This intermediate is reacted with an amine of the general formula R 4 R 5 NH to give a 6-halogeno substituted, substituted uronic acid amide of the formula wherein X is halogen. Reaction of the latter intermediate with an amine of the formula R 1 NH 2 , and removal of the isopropylidene (or other) blocking groups yields the compounds of the invention.

The present invention is also directed to a process for making said compounds. 3. Brief Description of the Prior Art Adenosine has been known for a long time to possess certain cardiovascular activity and particularly coronary dilatory activity. In an effort to obtain adenosine analogs of greater potency, or longer duration of activity, or both, many analogs of this naturally occurring nucleoside have been synthesized and tested. Moreover, numerous studies have been conducted in order to elucidate the biochemical mechanism of action of adenosine and its analogs, and several theories and hypotheses have been proposed regarding biochemical pathways and receptor sites. For discussion of current theories regarding the foregoing, reference is made to the following articles and publications: Adenosine Receptors: Targets for Future Drugs, by John W. Daly, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 25, 197 (1982); Cardiovascular Effects of Nucleoside Analogs, by Herman H.

In addition to the foregoing publications, German Offenlegungschrift Nos. 2133273, 2426682, 1795761, 1913818, 2007273, 2238923, 2060189, 2244328, 1814711, 2136624, South African Patent Application No. 677630 (filed on Dec. 20, 1967) and British Patent Specification No. 1,123,245 describe adenosine derivatives which have cardiovascular, coronary dilator or antilipolytic activities. Still more adenosine derivatives having beneficial cardiovascular activity are described in another application for U.S. Letters Patent of the present inventors, Ser. No. 601,435, filed on Apr. 18, 1984. Still further, Published Japanese Patent Application Nos. 58-167599 and 58-167600 disclose adenosine 5-carboxamide derivatives which have fibrinolysis accelerating activity. U.S. Pat. No. 4,029,334 discloses anti-hypertensive and anti-anginal adenosine 5-carboxamide derivatives where the N 6 amino group is unsubstituted. U.S. Pat. No. 4,167,565 discloses adenosine 5-carboxamide derivatives which have substituents both in the N 6 and 5-carboxamido position, and which are useful as poisons for certain noxious animals, such as rodents and coyotes. In the cardiovascular and anti-hypertensive field, however, the therapeutic utility of the natural nucleoside adenosine and many of its analogs is limited because the desired beneficial effect is often of relatively short duration. More particularly, the short duration of the beneficial cardiovascular effects of adenosine and those of its analogs which have an unsubstituted hydroxyl group at C-5 of the ribofuranose moiety is usually attributed to rapid penetration into cells followed by enzymatic conversion into less active or impermeant metabolites. For example, adenosine deaminase converts adenosine into inosine, which is a weak cardiovascular agonist. Alternatively, phosphorylation, catalyzed by adenosine kinase, forms adenylic acid (5-AMP). Ionization of the phosphate group under physiological conditions prevents the escape of 5-AMP from the cells in which it is formed. Thus trapped, 5-AMP cannot exert its cardiovascular actions, which are mediated by cell surface receptors, as is discussed below. Some known adenosine analogs, however, cannot be phosphorylated in the 5 position because the 5 position is effectively blocked. 5-N-Ethylcarboxamidoadenosine NECA (Compound 1 in General Formula 1) is an example of such an adenosine analog incapable of phosphorylation by adenosine kinase. Nevertheless, this compound binds potently to certain adenosine receptor sites and exhibits substantial cardiovascular activity. Other examples of known derivatives of adenosine-5-carboxamide, (Compound 2) and of adenosine-5-carboxylic acid (Compound 9) are shown below in General Formulae 1 and 2. Generally speaking, in these compounds, the 5-carboxylate or 5-carboxamide group of the uronic acid moiety is substituted with lower alkyl or lower acyl groups. Some of the adenosine-5-carboxamide derivatives shown in General Formula 1 are disclosed in Chemical Abstracts Volume 100, 68652c and 68653d (1984) and in the corresponding Published Japanese Patent Application Nos. 58-167599 and 58-167600. The biological activity of adenosine-5-carboxamide derivatives, such as NECA, is thought to be due to the activation of adenylate cyclase through cell surface R a or A 2 receptors. Structure-activity studies show that the R a receptor recognizes the alkyl uronamide moiety of NECA and its congeners. A second type of cell surface adenosine receptor designated R i or A 1 inhibits the catalytic activity of adenylate cyclase. Adenosine analogs possessing certain N-6 alkyl or aralkyl substituents such as cyclohexyl or R-1-phenyl-2-propyl are selective agonists at R i receptors. Many mammalian and human cells contain both R a and R i receptors; examples of exceptions are fat cells which contain R i receptors only, and blood platelets and human placenta, in which R a receptors predominate. Currently available agonists are only selective, not absolutely specific, for R a and R i receptors. Because the two types of receptors coexist in many organs, including brain and heart, even a selective agonist will activate both to a certain degree. A goal of pharmaceutical chemistry is the development of agonists which are as nearly specific as possible because unselectivity can be a source of side effects. The prior art makes no prediction about receptor selectivity of adenosine analogs which contain, in the same molecule, the recognition groups which confer specificity for R a and R i receptors. Many of the known adenosine derivatives, including the above-noted N-6 substituted and the 5-carboxamide derivatives are less than satisfactory as cardiovascular or antihypertensive drugs for animal and human use. This is either because of low activity, short duration of the desired activity, undue toxicity or undesirable side effects. Undesirable side effects of cardiovascularly active adenosine analogs often include cardiac depression. In light of the foregoing, the pharmaceutical industry is still striving to obtain adenosine analogs having high cardiovascular and hypotensive potency coupled with other optimal physiological characteristics, such as relatively long duration of the desired activity, low toxicity and minimal side effects. The compounds of the present invention constitute a step in this direction. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide adenosine analogs which have potent and prolonged cardiovascular activity in mammals and humans, coupled with relatively low toxicity and minimal side effects. It is another object of the present invention to provide adenosine analogs which have potent or prolonged anti-hypertensive activity in mammals and humans, coupled with relatively low toxicity and minimal side effects. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a relatively efficient synthetic process for the preparation of the adenosine derivatives which meet the above-noted objectives. The foregoing and other objects and advantages are attained by compounds of the General Formula 3, wherein R 1 represents secondary alkyl; hydroxy, lower alkoxy or halogen substituted secondary alkyl; aralkyl; aralkyl substituted in the aromatic nucleus with hydroxy, halogen, lower alkoxy or lower alkyl groups; cycloalkyl; hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkyl or halogen substituted cycloalkyl; para-substituted phenyl; heteroaryl substituted alkyl; heteroaryl substituted alkyl substituted in the heteroaryl nucleus with hydroxy, halogen, lower alkoxy or lower alkyl groups; norbornyl, and hydroxy, alkyl or halogen substituted norbornyl groups. The substituent R 2 and R 3 groups in the compounds of the present invention, as shown in General Formula 3, are hydrogen, or pharmacologically acceptable organic acyl groups, or inorganic acid radicals, such as NO 2 groups, which esterify the hydroxyl groups of the ribofuranose moiety. The R 2 and R 3 groups are preferably of the type which are relatively readily hydrolyzed under physiological conditions. The R 2 and R 3 substituents need not be identical with one another. Still further, in the compounds of General Formula 3, the substituent R 4 is straight chain lower alkyl having 1-4 carbon atoms; hydroxy, lower alkoxy or halogen substituted straight chain lower alkyl having 1-4 carbon atoms; cyclopropyl; secondary alkyl having 3-6 carbon atoms; hydroxy, lower alkoxy or halogen substituted secondary alkyl having 3-6 carbon atoms; alkenyl having 3 to 6 carbon atoms; aralkyl having 1 to 4 carbons in the alkyl chain; aralkyl having 1 to 4 carbons in the alkyl chain and substituted in the aryl nucleus with hydroxy, halogen, lower alkoxy or lower alkyl groups; heteroarylalkyl having 1 to 4 carbons in the alkyl chain; and heteroarylalkyl having 1 to 4 carbons in the alkyl chain and substituted in the heteroaryl nucleus with hydroxy, halogen, lower alkoxy or lower alkyl groups. R 5 is hydrogen, or straight chain lower alkyl having 1 to 4 carbons. The compounds of the present invention are resistant to enzymatic phosphorylation and to deamination by adenosine deaminase. The compounds exhibit significant cardiovascular activity. In accordance with a novel process of the invention, the compounds of General Formula 3 are obtained from 2,3-O-isopropylideneinosine-5-uronic acid by treatment with a suitable inorganic acid halide, such as thionyl chloride, to yield the intermediate, 6-chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene--D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid chloride-9H-purine. The intermediate, 6-chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene--D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid chloride-9H-purine, (or the corresponding bromide, if, for example thionyl bromide is used instead of thionyl chloride) is usually not isolated in a pure state. The acid chloride moiety of 6-chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene--D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid chloride-9H-purine (or the acid bromide of the corresponding bromo- analog) is significantly more readily displaced by nucleophilic reagents than the halide group in the 6 position of the purine moiety. Therefore, in accordance with the process of the present invention, 6-chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene--D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid chloride-9H purine is reacted with a first nucleophilic reagent having the formula R 4 ,R 5 -NH (General Formula 4) to yield an intermediate substituted carboxamide shown in General Formula 5, wherein the halide is retained in the 6position of the purine moiety. The intermediate of General Formula 5 is subsequently reacted with a nucleophile having the formula R 1 - NH 2 (General Formula 6) and the isopropylidene blocking group is removed with acid to yield the compounds of the invention (General Formula 3), having free hydroxyl groups in the 2 and 3 positions of the ribofuranose moiety. Instead of the isopropylidene blocking group, other acid stable blocking groups can also be used to protect the 2OH and 3OH groups of the ribofuranose moiety during the step of treatment with the inorganic acid halide. The groups R 1 , R 4 and R 5 in General Formulae 4-6 are defined the same as in General Formula 3. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Certain derivatives of 5-carboxamidoadenosine wherein both the amino nitrogen (N-6) of the purine moiety and the amino nitrogen of the 5-carboxamido moiety are substituted, have been found, in accordance with the present invention, to possess significant cardiovascular and/or anti-hypertensive activity. The compounds of the invention have the composition characterized by General Formula 3. The substituent R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 and R 5 groups are defined above in the summary description of the present invention.

The second substituent on the 5-carboxamido nitrogen, R 4 , is hydrogen, or straight chain lower alkyl having 1 to 4 carbons. The R 2 and R 3 substituents on the hydroxyl groups of the ribofuranose moiety are the same as described above in connection with the compounds of General Formulae 7, 8, and 9. Specific examples of compounds of the subclass of General Formula 10, where the R 2 and R 3 substituents are hydrogen, are: Compound 17: R 1 is ethyl, R 4 is H; Compound 28: R 1 is methyl, R 4 is H; Compound 29: R 1 is isopropy, R 4 is H; Compound 30: R 1 is 3-pentyl, R 4 is H; Compound 31: R 1 is allyl, R 4 is H; Compound 32: R 1 is (2-methyl)propyl, R 4 is H; Compound 33: R 1 is cyclopropyl, R 4 is H; Compound 35 R 1 is phenylmethyl, R 4 is H; Compound 36 R 1 is 2-methoxyphenylmethyl, R 4 is H; Compound 37 R 1 is 2-thienylmethyl, R 4 is H; Compound 38 R 1 is 2-phenylethyl, R 4 is H; Compound 39 R 1 is methyl, R 4 is methyl; Compound 40 R 1 is n-butyl, R 4 is methyl; Compound 41 R 1 is ethyl, R 4 is ethyl; The physical characteristics and biological activity of specific examples of the compounds of the present invention are noted below together with certain biological activity data.

PROCESS FOR MAKING THE COMPOUNDS OF THE INVENTION The compounds of the present invention are prepared in accordance with a novel process of the invention from a suitably blocked derivative of inosine-5-uronic acid, such as 2,3-O-isopropylideneinosine-5-uronic acid (Compound 43). 2,3-O-isopropylideneinosine-5-uronic acid (Compound 43) is readily obtained from inosine by treatment with acetone to block the 2- and 3- hydroxy groups of the ribofuranose moiety, followed by oxidation with chromic acid, in accordance with the published procedure of R. R. Schmidt and H. J. Fritz, Chemische Berichte., 103, 1867 (1970). 2,3-O-isopropylideneinosine-5-uronic acid (Compound 43) is treated in accordance with the process of the present invention, with a suitable inorganic acid halide, such as thionyl chloride, to convert, in the same reaction step, the uronic acid moiety into a uronic acid halide and to introduce a halogen substitutent into the 6 position of the purine moiety. In this regard it is noted that the blocking groups of the 2 and 3 hydroxyl groups must be capable of withstanding the conditions of this reaction, which is advantageously conducted in neutral solvents, such as chloroform, in the presence of dimethylformamide or other dialkylamides. The isopropylidene blocking group serves well for this purpose. Nevertheless, other ketal, acetal or even acyl blocking groups are also suitable. Instead of thionyl chloride other inorganic acid halides, such as thionyl bromide, may also be used. The product of the just described first step of the novel reaction sequence is 6-chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene--D-ribofuranosyl 5-uronic acid chloride-9H-purine (Compound 44). The reaction sequence leading to the compounds of the present invention, using the example of 6-chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene--D-ribofuranosyl 5-uronic acid chloride)-9H-purine (Compound 44) as the important intermediate, is shown in Reaction Scheme 1. 6-chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene--D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid chloride-9H-purine (Compound 44) is preferably not isolated in a pure state. Rather, it is reacted with an amine of the General Formula 4 to displace the halide of the uronic acid moiety and to provide compounds of the General Formula 5, wherein the halogen in the 6 position of the purine nucleus is retained. This selective displacement of the acid chloride group is readily conducted in neutral solvents, such as chloroform, preferably at low temperature. The intermediates of General Formula 5, may be isolated in a purified state. They are subsequently reacted with a nucleophilic amine of General Formula 6 in a suitable solvent such as ethyl alcohol, to displace the halogen substituent in the 6 position of the purine nucleus. The displacement reaction is preferably conducted in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as triethyl amine. The blocking groups of the 2 and 3 hydroxyls of the ribofuranose moiety are thereafter removed to provide the compounds of the invention (General Formula 3). Removal of the isopropylidene blocking groups is affected, for example, by heating with aqueous hydrochloric acid. These steps are illustrated in the continuation of Reaction Scheme 1. In the formulae shown in Reaction Scheme 1, the definition of the substituent R groups is the same as was given above in connection with the respective general formulae. Specific examples of the steps of the novel process of the present invention for the preparation of ethyl N 6 -(3-pentyl)adenosine-5-uronamide (Compound 17) and of N,N-dimethyl N 6 -(3-pentyl)adenosine-5-uronamide (Compound 39) are given below. Actually, the invention of the herein disclosed novel process is broader than the preparation of the herein disclosed compounds having beneficial cardiovascular or anti-hypertensive properties. In a broad sense, a multitude of N-6 and 5-N substituted adenosine 5-uronamides can be synthesized in accordance with the process of the present invention. The compounds which are obtainable by the process of the present invention include, in addition to the compounds described above, those compounds wherein the carboxamido nitrogen is mono or di substituted with alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, and heterocyclyl groups. The carboxamido nitrogen (5-N) can also be a member of a saturated heterocyclic ring such as a piperidine or morpholine ring. An alternative process for the preparation of at least some of the compounds of the present invention comprises the steps of oxidizing N-6 substituted adenosine derivatives which are suitably protected (for example by isopropylidene or benzyl groups) on the 2 and 3 hydroxyl groups. The step of oxidation is conducted in analogy to the procedure published by R. R. Schmidt and H. J. Fritz in Chemische Berichte, 103, 1867 (1970). The N-6 substituted adenosine derivatives can be obtained by reaction of 6-chloro--D-ribofuranosyl-9H-purine with the suitable amine. The resulting uronic acid is then converted to the corresponding acid halide by treatment, for example, with thionyl chloride, in analogy to the process which was described above. The resulting uronic acid halide is thereafter reacted with a primary amine bearing the desired R 4 and R 5 substituents. After removal of the protecting groups from the ribofuranosyl moiety, the compounds of the present invention are obtained. 6-Chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene-5-ethylcarboxamido--D-ribofuranosyl-9H-purine (Compound 45). A mixture of 2,3-O-isopropylideneinosine-5-uronic acid (6.5 g, 20 mmols), thionyl chloride (4 ml, 53.3 mmols), dry dimethylformamide (1.5 ml, 40 mmols) and dry chloroform (250 ml) was refluxed for 4 to 5 hours. The chloroform was removed in vacuo to give a syrup. The syrup was dissolved in dry chloroform (80 ml), and the resulting solution was added to a mixture of ethylamine (14 mi) and dry chloroform (150 ml) at 10 C. The mixture was stirred for one hour at 10 C., and then poured into cold water (300 ml). The resulting organic layer was separated and washed in succession with aqueous hydrochloric acid (10%, 2200 ml), aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (saturated, 1200 ml) and water (1100 ml), and dried over magnesium sulfate. The chloroform solvent was removed in vacuo to give 6.3 g (85% yield) of a slightly yellow solid. The product is usable in the subsequent reaction steps without further purification. Ethyl N 6 -(3-pentyl)adenosine-5-uronamide, (Compound 17) A mixture of 6-Chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene-5-ethylcarboxamido--D-ribofuranosyl-9H-purine (Compound 45) (6.3 g, 17.1 mmols), 3-pentylamine (1.6 g, 18.4 mmols), triethylamine (4.7 ml, 34 mmols) and absolute ethanol (200 ml) was refluxed for about 48 hours, or until thin layer chromatography indicated complete reaction. The ethanol was removed in vacuo and the product purified by chromatography on a silica gel column eluted with chloroform/acetone 16:1. Evaporation of fractions containing product yielded a syrup which was heated for 1.5 hours with aqueous hydrochloric acid (1.0 N, 100 ml) at 70 C. Upon cooling it yielded Compound 17 as white crystals. Recrystallization from ethanol yielded white needles, (4.5 g, 70% yield). The physical characteristics and analytical data of Compound 17 were described above. Dimethyl N 6 -(3-pentyl)adenosine-5-uronamide (Compound 39) from 2,3-O-isopropylideneinosine-5-uronic acid (Compound 43) A mixture of 2,3-O-isopropylideneinosine-5-uronic acid (5.0 g; 15.5 mmols) thionyl chloride (2.5 ml; 33.3 mmols) dry dimethylformamide (1.25 ml; 18.1 mmols) and dry chloroform (170 ml) was refluxed for 5 hours. The solvents were removed in vacuo to give a syrup. The syrup was dissolved in dry chloroform (50 ml) and the resulting solution was added to a mixture of dimethylamine (20 ml, 302 mmols) and dry chloroform (150 ml) at 10 C. The mixture was stirred for 15 minutes after the addition was complete, and thereafter poured into cold water (300 ml). The organic phase was separated and washed successively with water (1100 ml), 10% aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (2100 ml), saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, and was thereafter dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The chloroform solvent was removed in vacuo to give a syrup. The syrup was refluxed for 48 hours (or until thin layer chromatography indicated complete reaction) with 3-pentylamine (2.3 ml; 20 mmols), triethylamine (2.8 ml, 20 mmols) and anhydrous ethanol (100 ml). The solvent and volatile reagents were removed in vacuo to give a syrup (blocked nucleoside). The blocked (isopropylidine) nucleoside was purified by C-18 high performance low pressure liquid chromatography (HPLPLC), methanol-water (70%) being used as the eluent. The solvent was removed in vacuo from the appropriate fractions, to yield a light yellow solid which was thereafter heated at 70 C. for 1.5 hours in 2N aqueous hydrochloric acid (100 ml). Cooling and neutralization with solid sodium bicarbonate yielded Compound 39 as a white syrup, which was crystallized from methanol/water to give 4.0 g (68%) of colorless needles. The physical characteristics and analytical data of Compound 39 were described above. BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY AND PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES The cardiovascular and anti-hypertensive activities of the compounds of the present invention were determined in bioassays conducted on dogs and spontaneously hypertensive rats. More particularly, in one type of assay in which the activity of the compounds of the present invention was determined, the compounds to be tested are infused intracoronarily into either open-chest anesthetized or conscious dogs. Adenosine has a demonstrable coronary dilator effect under these conditions. The concentration of the test compound in coronary plasma which causes half-maximal vasodilation is designated ED-50. More specifically, ED-50 is determined in the following manner. Late diastolic coronary conductance (LDCC) of the experimental dog is monitored through suitable instrumentation. Late diastolic coronary conductance is measured at maximum coronary vasodilation (peak reactive hyperemid), and is designated LDCC max . Late diastolic coronary conductance is also measured at basal coronary vasodilation, and is designated LDCC 0 . The difference between instantaneously measured late diastolic coronary conductance (LDCC) and basal late diastolic coronary conductance (LDCC 0 ) is expressed as a fraction of the difference between maximum late diastolic coronary conductance (LDCC max ) and basal late diastolic coronary conductance (LDCC 0 ). Thus, LDCC is defined by Equation I. As the concentration of the test compound is varied, and the corresponding LDCC is obtained through measurements and the above-summarized calculations, data of an LDCC versus concentration function or plot are obtained. ED-50 is derived from these data by log-logit transformation of the LDCC versus concentration plot; namely by solving the linear regression of logit (LDCC) on log (concentration) for LDCC0.5. When ED-50 of a tested compound is compared to ED-50 of adenosine in the same dog, as is set forth in EQUATION II, then the resulting molar potency ratio (mpr) provides good comparison of the cardiovascular activity of the tested compound with cardivascular activity of other compounds in the same or other experimental dogs. Thus, molar potency ratio (mpr) is a useful measure of the cardiovascular vasodilatory effect, and hence of the utility of the tested compounds. The greater the vasodilatory effect of a tested compound, the larger the corresponding molar potency ratio (mpr). For a more detailed description of the bioassay used for determining molar potency ratios, reference is made to an article written by Olsson et al., and titled Coronary Vasoactivity of Adenosine in the Conscious Dog, Circulation Research, 45, 468 (1979). Molar potency ratios of the specific examples of the compounds of the present invention are listed above next to the detailed description of the specific compounds. These data demonstrate that the compounds are cardiovascularly active. In another assay for the anti-hypertensive activity of the compounds of the invention, blood pressure of unanesthetized, unheated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) is measured indirectly (through a tail cuff) usually at 2, 4, and 6 hours after oral administration of a single dose of the compounds of the invention. Reduction in mean blood pressure by more than ten per cent (10%) indicates anti-hypertensive activity. The test itself, is well established in the art and need not described here in further detail. The data obtained in the hypertensive rat (SHR) assay are indicated next to the description of the compounds. In the data, the percentage reduction of blood pressure in 2, 4 and 6 hours after the single oral dose is indicated in parentheses. A * sign after the data shows that the measured reduction of blood pressure occurred 1, 2, and 3 hours after the oral dose; a sign indicates that the measured reduction occurred in 1, 2 and 2.5 hours after the oral dose. The data demonstrate the anti-hypertensive activity of the compounds of the invention. An assay for the affinity of some of the compounds of the present invention for R a receptors employs a modification of the radioligand displacement method described by Fox and Kurpis in The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Volume 258 pages 6952-55 (1983). Briefly, this method comprises the steps of incubating 3 HNECA and the analogs to be tested, with human placenta membrane particles, a source of R a receptors. The particles are then filtered, washed with a buffer to remove unbound ligand and then the amount of bound radioligand is measured. By varying the concentration of the competing analog one may estimate an index of binding affinity, IC-50, the concentration of which causes half-maximum displacement of 3 HNECA. Using 3 HNECA in this assay instead of 3 H-2-chloroadenosine is a modification of the original method. The compounds of the present invention were found to compete weakly, or not at all, with 3 Hethyladenosine-5-uronamide at R a receptor sites of human placenta. The foregoing indicates that the compounds of the present invention are selective to R a receptors of the cardiovascular system. Such selectivity would not be expected on the basis of prevailing prior art theory. Further advantages of the compounds of the present invention include their inability to undergo phosphorylation in the 5-position, and their stability to acid. Therefore, the therapeutic effect of the compounds of the present invention is unlikely to be eliminated by the action of phosphorylating enzymes, and the compounds are unlikely to be incorporated into DNA or RNA. As is known, incorporation into RNA or DNA is likely to cause teratogenic, mutagenic or carcinogenic effects. Moreover, because the compounds of the present invention are stable to acid (they survive heating with 1N aqueous HCl for 1.5 hour at 70 C.) they are capable of surviving the acidic conditions prevailing in the stomach. Therefore, they are suitable as drugs for oral administration to humans and animals. Various modifications of the herein disclosed invention, in terms of structural modifications of the invented compounds and also in terms of making or using the same, may become readily apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the above disclosure. For example the compounds of the present invention may be administered as pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Inasmuch as the compounds of the present invention are useful as cardiac vasodilators, cardivascular, and particularly as anti-hypertensive agents in mammals, domestic animals and humans, various modes of administering the compounds will be apparent to a person having average skill in the art. Such modes of administering the compounds include oral and topical administration, and intravenous infusion. One having average skill in the art may readily prepare suitable formulations for the above-mentioned and other modes of administering the compounds of the invention.

The novel herbicidal compounds are 3-(pyrazolylphenyl)propanoic acids and derivatives having the formula: wherein X is H or halogen; Y is halogen, trihaloalkyl or cyano; Z and R are halogen; R 1 is carboxyl or agriculturally acceptable salt thereof, cyano, alkoxycarbonyl, alkylthiocarbonyl, alkoxyalkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, dialkylaminocarbonyl, or alkylsulfonylaminocarbonyl; and R 2 is hydrogen or lower alkyl. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to novel herbicidal compounds and methods for their use in controlling unwanted plant species in agriculture. In particular, the present invention relates to novel 3-(pyrazolylphenyl)propanoic acids and derivatives and their use as herbicides. There is a continuing demand for new herbicides. Herbicides are useful for controlling unwanted vegetation which may otherwise cause significant damage to crops such as wheat, corn, soybeans and cotton, to name a few. For crop protection, so-called selective herbicides are desired which can control the weeds without damaging the crop. Such crops are said to exhibit tolerance to the herbicide. In certain other situations, it is desirable to use herbicides that provide complete vegetation control such as in areas around railroad tracks and other structures. While many commercial products are available that provide selective or complete vegetation control, the demand exists for new, safe herbicides that are more effective and less costly. German Patent Application 4419517-A1 discloses, among others, the following compound having herbicidal activity: SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been discovered that certain 3-(pyrazolylphenyl)propanoic acids and derivatives of formula I below have good activity as pre- and post-emergence herbicides. In particular, certain compounds of the present invention exhibit varying levels of selectivity favorable to soybean, corn or wheat in pre- or post-emergence applications. Certain compounds of the present invention are especially useful as pre-emergence herbicides for soybean and corn and as postemergence herbicides for wheat. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The novel herbicidal 3-(pyrazolylphenyl)propanoic acids and derivatives of the present invention have the following formula: wherein X is H or halogen; Y is halogen, trihaloalkyl or cyano; Z and R are halogen; R 1 is carboxyl or agriculturally acceptable salt thereof, cyano, alkoxycarbonyl, alkylthiocarbonyl, alkoxyalkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, dialkylaminocarbonyl, or alkylsulfonylaminocarbonyl; and R 2 is hydrogen or lower alkyl. Examples of agriculturally acceptable salts include, among others, the sodium, ammonium and trialkylammonium salts of compounds of formula I where R 1 is carboxyl. The term alkyl alone or as part of a larger moiety, includes straight or branched chain alkyl groups of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, while the term alkoxy alone or as part of a larger moiety, includes straight or branched chain alkoxy groups of 1 to 6 carbon atoms Preferred compounds are those of formula I wherein X is Cl or F; Y is Cl or Br; Z and R are Cl; R 1 is carboxyl or sodium, ammonium or trialkylammonium salt thereof, cyano, alkoxycarbonyl, alkylthiocarbonyl, alkoxyalkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, alkylaminocarbonyl, dialkylaminocarbonyl, or alkylsulfonylaminocarbonyl; and R 2 is H or methyl. Particularly preferred compounds are those of formula I wherein X is Cl or F; Y is Cl; Z and R are Cl; R 1 is carboxyl or sodium, ammonium or trialkylammonium salt thereof, or alkoxycarbonyl; and R 2 is H. Scheme 1 below illustrates a general route for preparing compounds of the present invention. The known -ketoester II may be treated with methylhydrazine (step a) to form the hydroxypyrazole III. Alkylation of the OH group on the pyrazole ring of III with chlorodifluoromethane (step b) provides the corresponding difluoromethoxypyrazole IV. By treating IV with an N-halosuccinimide (step c), a halogen substituent may be introduced at the 4-position of the pyrazole ring (where the R group is attached) to give V. The aniline VII may be prepared in two steps (d and e) from V by nitration to give VI followed by reduction of the nitro group. Using Meerwein reaction conditions (Scheme 1, step f), compounds of the present invention may be obtained by treating VII with a mixture of an alkyl nitrite; a copper (II) halide selected from CuCl 2 and CuBr 2 ; and an activated olefin selected from the group consisting of CH 2 CHCO 2 -alkyl, CH 2 C(CH 3 )CO 2 -alkyl, CH 2 CHCN, and CH 2 C(CH 3 )CN in a suitable solvent. Examples of alkyl nitrites that may be used include isopentylnitrite and t-butylnitrite. Suitable solvents include polar, organic solvents such as acetonitrile and acetone. Thus, for example, when VII is treated with a mixture of copper(II) chloride, t-butylnitrite, and ethyl acrylate in acetonitrile, the target herbicidal compounds VIII are obtained. By replacing the ethyl acrylate used in step (f) of Scheme 1 with other activated olefins other compounds of the present invention may be obtained. For example, compounds of formula I where R 1 is CN may be obtained according to Scheme 1 above, except that in step (f) CH 2 CHCN is used in place of CH 2 CHCO 2 Et. When CH 2 C(CH 3 )CO 2 Et is used in place of CH 2 CHCO 2 Et in step (f), compounds of formula I where R 2 is CH 3 may be obtained. Also, compounds of formula I where Z is Br may be obtained when CuBr 2 is used in place of CuCl 2 in step (f). Further compounds of the present invention may be obtained from compounds of formula I where R 1 is an alkoxycarbonyl group (ester) by hydrolysis of the ester to give the corresponding carboxylic acid. Conversion of the resulting carboxylic acid to other esters and to salts and amides of the present invention may be carried out by methods that are well-known to one skilled in the art. Compounds of the present invention may also be prepared in accordance with the procedures shown in the Examples below, by procedures analogous to those described above or shown in the Examples, or by other methods that are generally known or available to one skilled in the art. SYNTHESIS EXAMPLES SYNTHESIS OF ETHYL 2-CHLORO-3-2-CHLORO-4-FLUORO-5-(4-CHLORO-5-DIFLUOROMETHOXY-1-METHYLPYRAZOL-3-YL)PHENYLPROPANOATE Step A Ethyl (2-fluoro-4-chlorophenyl)malonate A stirred mixture of 72.0 grams (0.42 mole) of potassium ethyl malonate (prepared in the manner disclosed in Organic Synthesis, Coll. Vol. IV, 417 1963) in 300 mL of acetonitrile was cooled to 10-15 C. and 58.4 mL (0.42 mole) of triethylamine, followed by 53.1 grams (0.55 mole) of magnesium chloride, were added. Upon completion of addition, the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to 25 C. where it stirred for about 2.5 hours. After this time the reaction mixture was cooled to 0 C. and 40.9 grams (0.21 mole) of 2-fluoro-4-chlorobenzoyl chloride was added slowly, followed by an additional 4.5 grams (0.045 mole) of triethylamine. The reaction mixture was then warmed to 20-25 C. where it stirred for about 18 hours. After this time the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residue which was dissolved in 100 mL toluene and again concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in a second 100 mL portion of toluene, and the solution was cooled to 10-15 C. To the cooled, stirred solution was slowly added 300 mL of aqueous 13% hydrochloric acid while maintaining the solution temperature at about 25 C. The organic layer was separated and washed with portions of aqueous 12% hydrochloric acid and water. The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residue. The residue was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel using methylene chloride as the eluant. The product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding about 44.0 grams of ethyl (2-fluoro-4-chlorophenyl)malonate. Step B 1-Methyl-5-hydroxy-3-(2-fluoro-4-chlorophenyl)pyrazole A stirred solution of 44.0 grams (0.18 mole) of ethyl (2-fluoro-4-chloro-phenyl)malonate and 9.6 grams (0.24 mole) of methylhydrazine in 150 mL of 2-propanol was heated at reflux for about 48 hours. After this time the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residue. The residue was slurred in 80 mL of methylene chloride and filtered to collect 27.0 grams of 1-methyl-2-hydroxy-3-(2-fluoro-4-chlorophenyl)pyrazole. Step C 1-Methyl-5-difluoromethoxy-3-(2-fluoro-4-chlorophenyl)pyrazole A stirred solution of 23.5 grams (0.104 mole) of 1-methyl-5-hydroxy-3-(2-fluoro-4-chlorophenyl)pyrazole and 43.0 grams (0.312 mole) of potassium carbonate in about 600 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide was warmed to 100 C., and an excess of chlorodifluoromethane was bubbled in during a 75 minute period. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature, then it was poured into about 1000 mL of water. The resultant mixture was neutralized with aqueous 2N hydrochloric acid and extracted with three portions of diethyl ether. The combined extracts were dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residual oil. The oil was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel using methylene chloride as the eluant. The product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 16.5 grams of 1-methyl-5-difluoromethoxy-3-(2-fluoro-4-chlorophenyl)pyrazole. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. Step D 1-Methyl-5-difluoromethoxy-4-chloro-3-(2-fluoro-4-chlorophenyl)pyrazole A solution of 16.2 grams (0.059 mole) of 1-methyl-5-difluoromethoxy-3-(2-fluoro-4-chlorophenyl)pyrazole and 8.5 grams (0.064 mole) of N-chlorosuc-cinimide in about 500 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide was stirred at ambient temperature for about 18 hours. After this time the reaction mixture was poured into about 1600 mL of water and then extracted with two portions of diethyl ether. The combined extracts were washed with one portion of aqueous 10% lithium chloride and two portions of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride. The organic layer was dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 18.0 grams of 1-methyl-5-difluoromethoxy-4-chloro-3-(2-fluoro-4-chlorophenyl)pyrazole. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. Step E 1-Methyl-5-difluoromethoxy-4-chloro-3-(2-fluoro-4-chloro-5-nitrophenyl)pyrazole A mixture of 18.0 grams (0.058 mole) of 1-methyl-5-difluoromethoxy-4-chloro-3-(2-fluoro-4-chlorophenyl)pyrazole and 120 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid was stirred, and when the pyrazole was dissolved, the solution was cooled to 0 C. To this was added dropwise 5.5 mL (0.074 mole) of 70% nitric acid at a rate to maintain the reaction mixture temperature below 3 C. Upon completion of addition the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to about 10 C. where it stirred for two hours. After this time the reaction mixture was poured into ice-water and then extracted with several portions of diethyl ether. The combined extracts were dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 20.1 grams of 1-methyl-5-difluoromethoxy-4-chloro-3-(2-fluoro-4-chloro-5-nitrophenyl)pyrazole. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. Step F 1-Methyl-5-difluoromethoxy-4-chloro-3-(2-fluoro-4-chloro-5-aminophenyl)pyrazole A stirred solution of 14.9 grams (0.042 mole) of 1-methyl-5-difluoromethoxy-4-chloro-3-(2-fluoro-4-chloro-5-nitrophenyl)pyrazole and 20 mL of water in 200 mL of acetic acid was warmed to 50 C., and 10.0 grams (0.179 mole) of iron powder was added portionwise. Upon completion of addition the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The reaction mixture was then poured into about 400 mL of a mixture of 1:1 ethyl acetate and water. The mixture was filtered through diatomaceous earth, and the organic layer in the filtrate was separated. The aqueous layer was washed with about 200 mL of ethyl acetate, and the wash was combined with the organic layer separated from the filtrate above. The combination was dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residue. The residue was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, using 5% methanol in methylene chloride as the eluant. The product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 12.2 grams of 1-methyl-5-difluoromethoxy-4-chloro-3-(2-fluoro-4-chloro-5-aminophenyl)pyrazole. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. Step G Ethyl 2-chloro-3-2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-(4-chloro-5-difluoromethoxy-1-methylpyrazol-3-yl)phenylpropanoate A mixture of 0.55 gram (0.004 mole) of copper(II) chloride and 0.6 mL (0.005 mole) of tert-butyl nitrite in 7.0 mL of ethyl acrylate and 10 mL of acetonitrile was stirred for five minutes, and cooled to 15 C. With continued stirring, a solution of 1.0 gram (0.003 mole) of 1-methyl-5-difluoromethoxy-4-chloro-3-(2-fluoro-4-chloro-5-aminophenyl)pyrazole in about five mL of acetonitrile was added dropwise while maintaining the reaction mixture temperature below 30 C. Upon completion of addition the reaction mixture was stirred with continued cooling for ten minutes, then it was allowed to warm to ambient temperature where it stirred for 1.5 hours. After this time the reaction mixture was poured into 75 mL of aqueous 20% hydrochloric acid. The resultant mixture was extracted with two 50 mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined extracts were washed with one portion of aqueous 20% hydrochloric acid, then dried with magnesium sulfate. The mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to an oil residue. The residue was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel using methylene chloride as the eluant. The product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 0.9 gram of ethyl 2-chloro-3-2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-(4-chloro-5-difluoromethoxy-1-methylpyrazol-3-yl)phenylpropanoate. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. TABLE 1 Derivatives of 2-Substituted-5-(5-difluoromethoxy-4-halo-1- methylpyrazol-3-yl)phenylpropanoic Acids Cmpd.

The test plants included soybean (Glycine max var. Winchester), field corn ( Zea mays var. Pioneer 3732), wheat ( Triticum aestivum var. Lew), morning glory ( Ipomea lacunosa or Ipomea hederacea ), velvetleaf ( Abutilon theophrasti ), green foxtail ( Setaria viridis ), Johnsongrass ( Sorghum halepense ), blackgrass ( Aloepecurus myosuroides ), common chickweed ( Stellaria media ), and common cocklebur ( Xanthium strumarium L.). For pre-emergence testing, two disposable fiber flats (8 cm15 cm25 cm) for each rate of application of each candidate herbicide were filled to an approximate depth of 6.5 cm with steam-sterilized sandy loam soil. The soil was leveled and impressed with a template to provide five evenly spaced furrows 13 cm long and 0.5 cm deep in each flat. Seeds of soybean, wheat, corn, green foxtail, and johnsongrass were planted in the furrows of the first flat, and seeds of velvetleaf, morningglory, common chickweed, cocklebur, and blackgrass were planted in the furrows of the second flat. The five-row template was employed to firmly press the seeds into place. A topping soil of equal portions of sand and sandy loam soil was placed uniformly on top of each flat to a depth of approximately 0.5 cm. Flats for post-emergence testing were prepared in the same manner except that they were planted 9-14 days prior to the pre-emergence flats and were placed in a greenhouse and watered, thus allowing the seeds to germinate and the foliage to develop. In both pre- and post-emergence tests, a stock solution of the candidate herbicide was prepared by dissolving 0.27 g of the compound in 20 mL of water/acetone (50/50) containing 0.5% v/v sorbitan monolaurate. For an application rate of 3000 g/ha of herbicide a 10 mL portion of the stock solution was diluted with water/acetone (50/50) to 45 mL. The volumes of stock solution and diluent used to prepare solutions for lower application rates are shown in the following table: Volume of Application Volume of Stock Acetone/Water Total Volume of Rate (g/ha) Solution (mL) (mL) Spray Solution (mL) 3000 10 35 45 1000 3 42 45 300 1 44 45 100 0.3 45 45.3 30 0.1 45 45.1 10 0.03 45 45.03 3 0.01 45 45.01 The pre-emergence flats were initially subjected to a light water spray. The four flats were placed two by two along a conveyor belt (i.e., the two pre-emergence flats, followed by the two post-emergence flats). The conveyor belt fed under a spray nozzle mounted about ten inches above the post-emergent foliage. The pre-emergent flats were elevated on the belt so that the soil surface was at the same level below the spray nozzle as the foliage canopy of the post-emergent plants. After the spray of herbicidal solution was commenced and stabilized, the flats were passed under the spray at a speed to receive a coverage equivalent to 1000 L/ha. At this coverage, the application rates are those shown in the above table for the individual herbicidal solutions. The pre-emergence flats were watered immediately thereafter, placed in the greenhouse, and watered regularly at the soil surface. The post-emergence flats were immediately placed in the green-house, but not watered until 24 hours after treatment with the test solution. Thereafter, they were regularly watered at ground level. After 12-17 days, the plants were examined, and the phytotoxicity data were recorded. Herbicidal activity data at selected application rates are given for various compounds of the present invention in Tables 2 and 3. The test compounds are identified by numbers which correspond to those in Table 1. Phytotoxicity data are taken as percent control. Percent control is determined by a method similar to the 0 to 100 rating system disclosed in Research Methods in Weed Science, 2 nd ed., B. Truelove, Ed. (Southern Weed Science Society; Auburn University, Auburn, Ala., 1977).

Thus, for agricultural use the present herbicidal compounds may be formulated as granules of relatively large particle size, as water-soluble or water-dispersible granules, as powdery dusts, as wettable powders, as emulsifiable concentrates, as solutions, or as any of several other known types of formulations, depending on the desired mode of application. It is to be understood that the amounts specified in this specification are intended to be approximate only, as if the word about were placed in front of the amounts specified. These herbicidal compositions may be applied either as water-diluted sprays, or dusts, or granules to the areas in which suppression of vegetation is desired. These formulations may contain as little as 0.1%, 0.2% or 0.5% to as much as 95% or more by weight of active ingredient. Dusts are free flowing admixtures of the active ingredient with finely divided solids such as talc, natural clays, kieselguhr, flours such as walnut shell and cottonseed flours, and other organic and inorganic solids which act as dispersants and carriers for the toxicant; these finely divided solids have an average particle size of less than about 50 microns. A typical dust formulation useful herein is one containing 1.0 part or less of the herbicidal compound and 99.0 parts of talc. Wettable powders, also useful formulations for both pre- and post-emergence herbicides, are in the form of finely divided particles which disperse readily in water or other dispersant. The wettable powder is ultimately applied to the soil either as a dry dust or as an emulsion in water or other liquid. Typical carriers for wettable powders include Fullers earth, kaolin clays, silicas, and other highly absorbent, readily wet inorganic diluents. Wettable powders normally are prepared to contain about 5-80% of active ingredient, depending on the absorbency of the carrier, and usually also contain a small amount of a wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent to facilitate dispersion. For example, a useful wettable powder formulation contains 80.0 parts of the herbicidal compound, 17.9 parts of Palmetto clay, and 1.0 part of sodium lignosulfonate and 0.3 part of sulfonated aliphatic polyester as wetting agents. Additional wetting agent and/or oil will frequently be added to the tank mix for post-emergence application to facilitate dispersion on the foliage and absorption by the plant. Other useful formulations for herbicidal applications are emulsifiable concentrates (ECs) which are homogeneous liquid compositions dispersible in water or other dispersant, and may consist entirely of the herbicidal compound and a liquid or solid emulsifying agent, or may also contain a liquid carrier, such as xylene, heavy aromatic naphthas, isphorone, or other non-volatile organic solvents. For herbicidal application these concentrates are dispersed in water or other liquid carrier and normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated. The percentage by weight of the essential active ingredient may vary according to the manner in which the composition is to be applied, but in general comprises 0.5 to 95% of active ingredient by weight of the herbicidal composition. Flowable formulations are similar to ECs except that the active ingredient is suspended in a liquid carrier, generally water. Flowables, like ECs, may include a small amount of a surfactant, and will typically contain active ingredients in the range of 0.5 to 95%, frequently from 10 to 50%, by weight of the composition. For application, flowables may be diluted in water or other liquid vehicle, and are normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated. Typical wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents used in agricultural formulations include, but are not limited to, the alkyl and alkylaryl sulfonates and sulfates and their sodium salts; alkylaryl polyether alcohols; sulfated higher alcohols; polyethylene oxides; sulfonated animal and vegetable oils; sulfonated petroleum oils; fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols and the ethylene oxide addition products of such esters; and the addition product of long-chain mercaptans and ethylene oxide. Many other types of useful surface-active agents are available in commerce. Surface-active agents, when used, normally comprise 1 to 15% by weight of the composition. Other useful formulations include suspensions of the active ingredient in a relatively non-volatile solvent such as water, corn oil, kerosene, propylene glycol, or other suitable solvents. Still other useful formulations for herbicidal applications include simple solutions of the active ingredient in a solvent in which it is completely soluble at the desired concentration, such as acetone, alkylated naphthalenes, xylene, or other organic solvents. Granular formulations, wherein the toxicant is carried on relative coarse particles, are of particular utility for aerial distribution or for penetration of cover crop canopy. Pressurized sprays, typically aerosols wherein the active ingredient is dispersed in finely divided form as a result of vaporization of a low boiling dispersant solvent carrier, such as the Freon fluorinated hydrocarbons, may also be used. Water-soluble or water-dispersible granules are free-flowing, non-dusty, and readily water-soluble or water-miscible. The soluble or dispersible granular formulations described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,920,442 are useful herein with the present herbicidal compounds. In use by the farmer on the field, the granular formulations, emulsifiable concentrates, flowable concentrates, solutions, etc., may be diluted with water to give a concentration of active ingredient in the range of say 0.1% or 0.2% to 1.5% or 2%. The active herbicidal compounds of this invention may be formulated and/or applied with insecticides, fungicides, nematicides, plant growth regulators, fertilizers, or other agricultural chemicals and may be used as effective soil sterilants as well as selective herbicides in agriculture. In applying an active compound of this invention, whether formulated alone or with other agricultural chemicals, an effective amount and concentration of the active compound is of course employed; the amount may be as low as, e.g. about 1 to 250 g/ha, preferably about 4 to 30 g/ha. For field use, where there are losses of herbicide, higher application rates (e.g., four times the rates mentioned above) may be employed. The active herbicidal compounds of the present invention may also be used in combination with other herbicides.

This invention relates to dyes, to inks, to compositions and to their use in ink jet printing (IJP). IJP is a non-impact printing technique in which droplets of ink are ejected through a fine nozzle onto a substrate without bringing the nozzle into contact with the substrate. There are many demanding performance requirements for dyes and inks used in IJP. For example they desirably provide sharp, non-feathered images having good water-fastness, light-fastness and optical density. The inks are often required to dry quickly when applied to a substrate to prevent smudging, but they should not form a crust over the tip of an ink jet nozzle because this will stop the printer from working. The inks should also be stable to storage over time without decomposing or forming a precipitate which could block the fine nozzle. According to the present invention there is provided a compound of Formula (1) and salts thereof: wherein: Ar 1 is substituted aryl carrying at least one COOH group; R 1 is H or optionally substituted alkyl; L is substituted phenyl carrying at least one substituent at the 2-position, or optionally substituted naphthyl.

The compounds of the invention exhibit a high solubility in aqueous media and provide prints which exhibit good light-fastness and chroma when incorporated into inks for ink jet printing. We have found that the presence of the substituent X in Formula (3) and X 1 in Formula (5) provides compounds with a particularly high light-fastness. The compounds of the invention may be in the free acid or salt form. Preferred salts are water-soluble, for example alkali metal salts, especially lithium, sodium and potassium salts, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts. Especially preferred salts are salts with sodium, lithium, ammonia and volatile amines. The compounds may be converted into a salt using known techniques. For example, an alkali metal salt may be converted into a salt with ammonia or an amine by dissolving an alkali metal salt in water, acidifying with a mineral acid, adjusting the pH of the solution to pH 9 to 9.5 with ammonia or the amine and removing the alkali metal cations by dialysis, reverse osmosis or ultrafiltration. The compounds of the invention may be prepared using conventional techniques for the preparation of azo dyes. For example a suitable method comprises coupling the diazonium salt of an amine of the formula Ar 1 NH 2 with a compound of the Formula (6), preferably under mildly alkaline reaction conditions: wherein, L, Ar 1 and R 1 are as hereinbefore defined. The coupling reaction is preferably performed in a liquid medium, more preferably an aqueous medium and especially water. A reaction temperature in the range of from 5 C. to 20 C. is preferred, more preferably from 0 to 10 C. Preferably a reaction time of 1 to 48, more preferably 3 to 24 hours is used.

The amount of base used may be varied between wide limits but it is preferred to use less than 40, more preferably less than 10 and especially from 3 to 5 moles for each mole of the compound of Formula (6). After the coupling reaction the product may be isolated by precipitating the product as a salt from the reaction mixture for example by the addition of a suitable alkali metal salt, especially sodium chloride. Alternatively, the product may be isolated in its free acid form by acidifying the reaction mixture, preferably using a mineral acid, especially hydrochloric acid. Where the product precipitates as a solid it may be separated from the mixture by filtration. If desired unwanted anions may be removed from the product of the above process by dialysis, osmosis, ultrafiltration or a combination thereof. The diazotisation of the amine of the formula Ar 1 NH 2 is preferably performed in an aqueous medium at a pH below 7 in the presence of a suitable diazotisation agent. Dilute mineral acid, e.g. HCl or H 2 SO 4 , is preferably used to achieve the desired acidic conditions.

Normally at least one mole of diazotisation agent per mole of the compound of formula Ar 1 NH 2 , preferably from 1 to 1.25 moles, will be used in the diazotisation. The temperature of the diazotisation is not critical and may conveniently be carried out at from 5 C. to 20 C., preferably from 0 to 10 C. and especially from 0 to 5 C. The compound of the Formula (6) may be prepared using conventional techniques, for example by condensing a compound of the Formula LC(O)Cl with a compound of the Formula (7): wherein L and R 1 are as hereinbefore defined.

No. 4,626,284, EP 425,150A and U.S. Pat. No. 5,207,824. When the liquid medium comprises an organic solvent free from water, (i.e. less than 1% water by weight) the solvent preferably has a boiling point of from 30 to 200 C., more preferably of from 40 to 150 C., especially from 50 to 125 C. The organic solvent may be water-immiscible, water-miscible or a mixture of such solvents. Preferred water-miscible organic solvents are any of the hereinbefore described water-miscible organic solvents and mixtures thereof. Preferred water-immiscible solvents include, for example, aliphatic hydrocarbons; esters, preferably ethyl acetate; chlorinated hydrocarbons, preferably CH 2 Cl 2 ; and ethers, preferably diethyl ether; and mixtures thereof. When the liquid medium comprises a water-immiscible organic solvent, preferably a polar solvent is included because this enhances solubility of the component (a) of the composition in the liquid medium. Examples of polar solvents include C 1-4 -alcohols. In view of the foregoing preferences it is especially preferred that where the liquid medium is an organic solvent free from water it comprises a ketone (especially methyl ethyl ketone) /or an alcohol (especially a C 1-4 -alkanol, such as ethanol or propanol). The organic solvent free from water may be a single organic solvent or a mixture of two or more organic solvents. It is preferred that when the medium is an organic solvent free from water it is a mixture of 2 to 5 different organic solvents. This allows a medium to be selected which gives good control over the drying characteristics and storage stability. This is particularly so when the liquid composition is used as an ink, especially an ink jet printing ink. Ink media comprising an organic solvent free from water are particularly useful where fast drying times are required and particularly when printing onto hydrophobic and non-absorbent substrates, for example plastics, metal and glass. Preferred low melting solid media have a melting point in the range from 60 C. to 125 C. Suitable low melting point solids include long chain fatty acids or alcohols, preferably those with C 18-24 chains, and sulphonamides. The compound of Formula (1) or Formula (3) may be dissolved in the low melting point solid or may be finely dispersed in it. The compounds according to the present invention exhibit a high solubility in aqueous media, accordingly it is preferred that the liquid medium is a mixture of water and one or more water miscible organic solvent(s). An especially preferred liquid composition which is suitable for use as an ink for an ink jet printer comprises: (a) from 1 to 10 parts in total of a compound or composition according to the first or second aspect of the invention; (b) from 2 to 60, more preferably 5 to 40 parts of water-soluble organic solvent; and (c) from 30 to 97, more preferably 40 to 85 parts water; wherein all parts are by weight and the sum of the parts (a)(b)(c)100.

The pH of the liquid composition is preferably from 4 to 10. The compounds, compositions and liquid compositions according to the first and second aspects of the present invention may be, and preferably are, purified to remove undesirable impurities before they are incorporated into inks for ink jet printing. Conventional purification techniques may be employed, for example ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, dialysis or a combination thereof. The liquid composition according to the third aspect of the invention preferably have a concentration of less than 100 parts per million, more preferably less than 50 parts per million, in total of undesirable ions, for example halide ions, silicon ions, peroxide radicals and divalent and trivalent metals, especially calcium ions. Such liquid compositions are particularly well suited to use as ink jet printing inks because higher levels of undesirable ions could lead to printing problems, especially in thermal ink jet printing heads. A fourth aspect of the present invention provides a process for printing an image on a substrate comprising applying thereto by means of an ink jet printer an ink containing a compound according to the first aspect of the invention or a composition according to the second aspect of the invention. The ink used in this process is preferably a liquid composition according to the third aspect of the present invention. The ink jet printer preferably applies the ink to the substrate in the form of droplets which are ejected through a small orifice onto the substrate. Preferred ink jet printers are piezoelectric ink jet printers and thermal ink jet printers. In thermal ink jet printers, programmed pulses of heat are applied to the ink in a reservoir by means of a resistor adjacent to the orifice, thereby causing the ink to be ejected in the form of small droplets directed towards the substrate during relative movement between the substrate and the orifice. In piezoelectric ink jet printers the oscillation of a small crystal causes ejection of the ink from the orifice. The substrate is preferably paper, plastic, a textile, metal or glass, more preferably paper, an overhead projector slide or a textile material, especially paper. Preferred papers are plain or treated papers which may have an acid, alkaline or neutral character. Examples of commercially available papers include, HP Premium Coated Paper, HP Photopaper (all available from Hewlett Packard Inc), Stylus Pro 720 dpi Coated Paper, Epson Photo Quality Glossy Film, Epson Photo Quality Glossy Paper (available from Seiko Epson Corp.), Canon HR 101 High Resolution Paper, Canon GP Glossy Paper, Canon HG 101 High Gloss Film (all available from Canon Inc.), Wiggins Conqueror paper (available from Wiggins Teape Ltd), Xerox Acid Paper and Xerox Alkaline paper, Xerox Acid Paper (available from Xerox). A fifth aspect of the present invention provides a substrate, preferably a paper, an overhead projector slide or a textile material, printed with a liquid composition according to the third aspect of the present invention or by means of the process according to the fourth aspect of the present invention. According to a sixth aspect of the present invention there is provided an ink jet printer cartridge comprising a chamber and ink, wherein the ink is present in the chamber and the ink contains a compound or a composition according to the first or second aspect of the invention. Preferably the ink is a liquid composition according to the third aspect of the invention.

The invention is further illustrated by the following Examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise stated. EXAMPLE 1 Dye (1) Dye 1 was prepared in accordance with following process: Stage (a): Diazotisation Anthranilic acid (7.0 g, 0.05 moles) was dissolved in water (100 mls) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (20 mls). The solution was cooled to 0-5 C. and sodium nitrite (4.0 g, 0.06 moles) was added in small portions. The solution was stirred a further 1.5 hours at 0-5 C., then the excess nitrous acid destroyed by the addition of saturated sulphamic acid solution. Stage (b): Coupling 2-chlorobenzoyl H acid (28.6 g at 76%, 0.05 moles) was suspended in water (200 mls) and dissolved by the addition of 2M sodium hydroxide to pH 7.5. The solution was screened and then added to the product of stage (a) over 10 minutes at 0-5 C. The mixture was stirred for 1 hour at 0-5 C. then allowed to rise to ambient and stirred a further 2 hours. The product was filtered off and washed with 10% brine (2100 mls), then saturated brine (500 mls). The title product was washed with acetone (300 mls) and then oven dried at 50 C. EXAMPLE 2 Dye 2 Dye (2) was prepared using the same method described above for the preparation of Dye (1), except the 2-chlorobenzoyl chloride used in Example 1 was replaced with 2-methylbenzoyl chloride. EXAMPLE 3 INKS AND INK JET PRINTING Ink An ink comprising 3 parts of Dye (1) from Example 1 and 97 parts of an ink medium comprising: 10 parts butyl Carbitol 2-(2-butyoxyethoxy)ethanol; 10 parts glycerol; 1 part Surfynol 465 (a non-ionic surfactant available from Air Products Inc.); 79 parts water was prepared by dissolving Dye (1) is the medium and filtering the resultant ink through a 0.45 m filter. Ink Jet Printing The ink was loaded into an Seiko Epson Stylus Colour Pro ink jet printer and was ink jet printed onto each of the substrates shown in column 1 of Table 1. The resulting prints were a bright magenta shade with a high water-fastness. The prints exhibited the reflected optical density shown under ROD in Table 1, as measured using an X-Rite 938 Spectrodensitometer. The light-fastness of each print was assessed by exposing a portion of each print to 50 hours fading in an Atlas Ci-35a Weatherometer and measuring the colour difference (E) between the faded and un-faded portions of the print using an X-Rite Spectrodensitometer. The measured E values are shown in column 3 of Table 1. A small E value corresponds to a small colour difference and hence a high light-fastness. TABLE 1 E Substrate ROD (after 50 hours) X.

This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/522,875, filed Sep. 1, 1995 now abandoned. The present invention relates to somatostatin peptides, a process for their production, pharmaceutical preparations containing them and their use as a radiopharmaceutical, e.g. for radiotherapy of somatostatin receptor positive tumors. Radiotherapy of tumors with radioactive compounds has the advantages of selectively targeting tumors and their metastases, thus limiting the radiation dose to normal tissue. A radiotherapeutic agent should have a fast accumulation and high retention at the target organs, e.g. tumor, and a fast clearance from the circulation to limit the whole body radiation dose. A radiotherapeutic agent based on a chelated radiometal should also be thermodynamically and/or kinetically stable against loss of the radiometal. A radiotherapeutic agent being administered repeatedly should not be immunogenic. GB-A-2,225,579 discloses somatostatin peptides bearing at least one chelating group which can be radiolabelled for in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic applications. These compounds are capable of binding to somatostatin receptors, e.g. expressed or overexpressed by tumors or metastases. EP-A2-607,103 describes somatostatin peptides comprising a bifunctional polyaminopoly-carboxylic acid chelating group attached to their terminal amino group by means of a spacer group. However, even though the presence of a bifunctional chelating group (octadentate) and of a spacer group lead to the improvement of certain properties of the resulting conjugate, there is still a compelling need for a radiopharmaceutical with further improved properties, particularly a high target/kidney ratio to minimize the radiation dose in the kidneys. It has now been found that somatostatin peptides as disclosed hereinafter comprising a monofunctional DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetra-azacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) conjugated directly, i.e. in the absence of a spacer group, to the terminal amino group of the somatostatin peptides have improved properties. Particularly they have an improved tumor/kidney ratio hence a lower radiation dose delivered to the kidneys. According to the invention there is provided a compound of formula I wherein M is H or a cation and A is Phe or Tyr, in free form, salt form or complexed with a radionuclide. As it will be appreciated, each bond connecting 2 nitrogen atoms in the DOTA formula above represents ethylene. When A is Phe, the peptide moiety of the compound of formula I corresponds to octreotide. When A is Tyr, the peptide moiety corresponds to Tyr 3 -octreotide. A is preferably Tyr. M may be H or any salt forming cation for a carboxy group, e.g. a monovalent or one equivalent of a polyvalent cation, for example an alkali metal ion such as sodium, potassium, or a substituted or unsubstituted ammonium ion. Compounds of formula I may also exist e.g. in the form of an internal salt when M is H or in the form of acid addition salts. Acid addition salts include e.g. salts obtained by addition of an organic, polymeric or inorganic acid, for example chlorhydrate, acetate, trifluoroacetate or lactate. By radionuclide is meant an - or -emitting nuclide or a nuclide with Auger-e -cascades. Suitable nuclides include e.g. 64 Cu, 67 Cu or a radiolanthanide, particularly 90 Y, 140 La, 161 Tb, 169 Er, 153 Sm, 177 Lu, 166 Dy, 166 Ho or 175 Yb, more preferably 161 Tb and 90 Y, most preferably 90 Y. The present invention also includes a process for the production of the compounds of formula I. They may be produced by analogy to known methods. The compounds of formula I may be produced for example as follows: a) removing at least one protecting group which is present in a compound of formula I in protected form, or b) linking together by an amide bond two peptide units, one of them containing at least one amino alcohol in protected or unprotected form and the other of them containing the DOTA group, wherein the amide bond is in such a way that the desired amino acid sequence of formula I is obtained, and stage a) of the process is then optionally effected, or c) linking together DOTA and the desired somatostatin peptide in protected or unprotected form in such a way that the group derived from DOTA is fixed on the terminal amino group of the peptide, and stage a) is then optionally effected or, d) oxidizing a DOTA-peptide having the amino acid sequence as stated in formula I wherein the mercapto groups of the Cys radicals exist in free form so as to produce a compound of formula I in which the 2 Cys radicals are joined by an S-S-bridge, and recovering the compounds of formula I thus obtained in free form, in salt form or in complexed form with a radionuclide. The above reactions may be effected in analogy with known methods, e.g. as described in the following examples. Where desired, in these reactions, protecting groups which are suitable for use in peptides or for the DOTA chelating group may be used for functional groups which do not participate in the reaction. The term protecting group may also include a polymer resin having functional groups. DOTA may be used in process step (c) in the free acid form, as an anhydride or as an activated ester, e.g. with N-hydroxysuccinimide. The complexation with the radionuclide may be performed at room temperature in accordance with methods known in the art, e.g. by reacting an uncomplexed compound of formula I with a salt yielding the desired radionuclide. Preferably the complexation of the uncompleted compound of formula I with the radionuclide-yielding salt is effected at a temperature of from 60 to 120 C., more preferably from 80 to 100 C. When the complexation is performed at a temperature 100 C., it may be effected in an autoclave. The complexation under heating may conveniently be carried out for a short time period, e.g. from 10 to 20 minutes. When the radionuclide is 90 Y, the preferred 90 Y-yielding salt is 90 YCl 3 . The above mentioned reactions may conveniently be effected under conditions avoiding trace metal contamination. Preferably distilled de-ionized water, ultrapure reagents, no carrier-added radioactivity etc. are used to reduce the effects of trace metal. The compounds of formula I, when complexed with a radionuclide, exhibit pharmaceutical activity and are therefore useful as a radiopharmaceutical for the in vivo treatment of somatostatin receptor positive tumors and metastases as indicated by standard tests. In particular, the compounds of formula I possess affinity for somatostatin receptors which can be assessed in vitro in binding assays performed as disclosed by J. C. Reubi, Life Sc. 36, 1829 (1985) and by C. Bruns et al. in Biochem. J., 265, 39 (1990). It is observed that the compounds of formula I, e.g. a compound of formula I complexed with 90 Y or 161 Tb, bind with a good affinity and specificity to somatostatin receptors with pK D values of from about 8.0 to 10.0. Compound of Example 1 binds with high affinity to somatostatin receptors expressed in rat cortex or AR42J pancreatic tumor cells: it has a pKi of 8.90.1 using 125 ITyr 3 -octreotide as specific ligand. Compound of Example 2 is a somatostatin receptor specific ligand that can be displaced from the somatostatin receptors by octreotide: pIC 50 9.00.3. The affinity of the complexed compounds of formula I for somatostatin receptors can also be shown by in vivo testing, according to standard test methods, e.g. as disclosed in GB-A-2, 225,579. For example, in one trial, the compound of Example 2 gives a significant tumor accumulation 2 hours following i.p. injection at a dose of 5 Ci into mice bearing an exocrine pancreatic tumor: 9.050.61% ID/g present in the somatostatin receptor positive tumor whereas significantly less radioactivity is accumulated in somatostatin receptor positive normal tissues, e.g. in the pancreas it amounts 1.520.08% ID/g. By % ID/g is meant the percentage of the injected radioactivity dose per g tissue. Not only does Compound of Example 2 provide 24 hours after injection a high tumor/kidney ratio but also a high tumor/liver and tumor/femur ratio. Bone marrow being regarded as the most radiosensitive organ, the low radioactivity accumulated in bones is particularly surprising. The compounds of formula I complexed with a radionuclide have an antiproliferative effect on tumor cells bearing somatostatin receptors, e.g. as indicated in nude mice tests. AR42J rat pancreatic tumor cells are trypsinized and 110 7 tumor cells (in 0.2 ml) are injected subcutaneously into both flanks of nude mice. When tumors have reached a significant volume of 0.1 to 2 ml, animals are randomized into control and treatment groups. Control animals, receive either an uncomplexed compound of formula I or the corresponding cold complexed compound of formula I by i.p. injections at doses corresponding to the highest dose of the treatment groups. Doses from 0.8 mCi up to 40 mCi/kg/100 l are given per mouse. The size of the tumors is determined with a caliper. To calculate the tumor volume in ml the equation volume (ellipsoid)lengthdepthheight0.52 is used. For statistical calculations Students t-test is applied. In this test, transient tumor shrinkage up to 70% is observed after one week and tumor growth is delayed for two weeks upon a single application of the compound of Example 2. In contrast, the control groups showed continuous tumor growth with a volume doubling time about seven days. The survival rate of the treated groups is significantly increased. Similar results are obtained when treating mice or rats bearing other tumor types, e.g. mammary carcinomas or small cell lung cancer, with Compound of Example 2. Accordingly, in a series of specific or alternative embodiments, the present invention also provides: 1. Use of a compound of formula I complexed with a radionuclide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as a radiopharmaceutical for in vivo treatment of somatostatin receptor positive tumors and metastases. 2. A method for in vivo treatment of somatostatin positive tumors and metastases, e.g. for treating invasiveness of such tumors or symptoms associated with such tumor growth, in a subject in need of such treatment which comprises administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I complexed with a radionuclide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. 3. Use of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form in the manufacture of a radiopharmaceutical composition. Dosages employed in practicing the radiotherapeutic use of the present invention will of course vary depending e.g. on the particular condition to be treated, for example the known radiosensitivity of the tumor type, the volume of the tumor and the therapy desired. In general, the dose is calculated on the basis of radioactivity distribution to each organ and on observed target uptake. A -emitting complex of formula I may be administered at several time points e.g. over a period of 1 to 3 weeks or longer. In animals, an indicated dosage range may be of from 0.1 to 1 g/kg compound of formula I complexed e.g. with 0.1 to 2 mCi 90 Y or 161 Tb. In larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated dosage range is of from 5 to 100 g compound of formula I complexed with e.g. 10 to 100 mCi 90 Y or 161 Tb, the higher radioactivity range being preferred for 161 Tb. The compounds of formula I complexed with a radionuclide may be administered by any conventional route, in particular intravenously, e.g. in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions. They may also be administered advantageously by infusion, e.g. an infusion of 30 to 60 min. Depending on the site of the tumor, they may be administered as close as possible to the tumor site, e.g. by means of a catheter. They may also be administered repeatedly in divided doses. Tumors which may be treated with compounds of formula I complexed with a radionuclide are e.g. pituitary, gastro-enteropancreatic, carcinoids, central nervous system, breast, prostatic, ovarian or colonic tumors, small cell lung cancer, paragangliomas, kidney cancer, skin cancer, neuroblastomas, pheochromocytomas, medullary thyroid carcinomas, myelomas, lymphomas, Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins disease, bone tumors and metastases thereof. Excretion of the radioactive compounds essentially takes place through the kidneys. Further protection of the kidneys from radioactivity accumulation may be achieved by administration of lysine or arginine or an amino acid solution having a high content of lysine and/or arginine, e.g. a commercially available amino acid solution such as Vamina 18EF or Synthamin-14 or -10, prior to the injection of or together with the complexed compound of formula I. Compounds of formula I complexed with a radionuclide may exist in free acid form or as pharmaceutically acceptable salts which exhibit the same order of activity as the complexes in free acid form. Compound of Example 1 complexed with 90 Y is preferred. According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I or a compound of formula I complexed with a radionuclide, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents therefor. Such compositions may be manufactured in conventional manner. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical compositions based on a compound of formula I complexed with a radionuclide further comprise a stabilizer, e.g. a free radical scavenger, which inhibits autoradiolysis of the peptide moiety. Suitable stabilizers include e.g. serum albumine, ascorbic acid, retinol, gentisic acid or a derivative thereof, or an amino acid infusion solution, e.g. as used for parenteral protein feeding, preferably free from electrolyte and glucose, for example a commercially available amino acid infusion such as Proteinsteril KE Nephro. Ascorbic acid is preferred. The stabilizer may conveniently be used in a weight ratio of 1,000-10,000:1, preferably 4000-7000:1 to the uncomplexed compound of formula I. The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise further additives, e.g. an agent to adjust the pH between 7.2 and 7.4, e.g. Na or ammonium acetate or Na 2 HPO 4 . Preferably the stabilizer is added to the uncomplexed compound of formula I and the complexation with the radionuclide is performed in the presence of the stabilizer, either at room temperature or, preferably, at a temperature of from 60 to 120 C. The complexation may conveniently be performed under air free conditions, e.g. under N 2 or Ar. Further stabilizer may be added to the composition after complexation. Compounds of formula I complexed with a radionuclide may also be used in the treatment of autoimmune or inflammatory disorders exhibiting somatostatin receptors, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis. According to a further embodiment of the invention, the compounds of formula I complexed with a radionuclide may be employed as adjunct or adjuvant to cytostatic therapy, e.g. in combination with a cytostatic agent, preferably a cytostatic agent which enhances the radiotherapy effects by acting as a radiosensitizer. Examples of suitable cytostatic or radiosensitizing agents include e.g. cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention provides in a yet further aspect: 4. A method for treating somatostatin receptor positive tumor invasiveness or symptoms associated with such tumor growth, in a subject in need of such treatment which method comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of a) a compound of formula I complexed with a radionuclide or a pharmaceutically acceptable thereof and b) a second drug substance, said second drug substance being a cytostatic agent. 5. A therapeutic combination, e.g. a kit, for use in treating tumor invasiveness or symptoms associated with tumor growth, said combination including a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I complexed with a radionuclide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and further including at least one pharmaceutical composition comprising a cytostatic agent. The cytostatic agent may be used in any amount known to be an effective cytostatic or radiosensitizing amount. The cytostatic agent may be added concomitantly or at a sequenced regimen with the radiopharmaceutical of formula I. Furthermore, the uncomplexed compounds of formula I show GH-release inhibiting activity as indicated by the inhibition of GH release in vitro from cultured pituitary cells. Anterior pituitary glands from adult male rats are cut into small pieces and dispersed using 0.1% trypsin in 20 mM HEPES buffer. The dispersed cells are cultured for four days in MEM (Gibco) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, 1 mM NaHCO 3 , 2.5 nM dexamethasone, 2.5 mg/ml insulin and 20 U/ml Pen/Strep. On the day of the experiment, the attached cells are washed two times with Krebs-Ringer medium buffered with 20 mM HEPES and supplemented with 5 mM glucose and 0.2% BSA. Subsequently the cells are incubated for two to four hours with the test compound in the presence of 310 10 M growth hormone releasing factor. The amount of growth hormone released into the medium is measured by RIA. Uncomplexed compounds of formula I inhibit the release of GH concentration-dependent from 10 10 to 10 6 M. Compound of Example 1 has an IC 50 of 1.60.9 nM. Uncomplexed compounds of formula I are accordingly indicated for use in the treatment of disorders with an aetiology comprising or associated with excess GH-secretion, e.g. in the treatment of acromegaly as well as in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. For the above uses, satisfactory results in animals are in general obtained at a daily dosage from about 0.03 to 300 g/kg animal body weight. In larger mammals, for example in humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range from about 2 g to about 20 mg, preferably about 0.01 to about 20 mg, e.g. about 10 to about 5000 g s.c. of the compound conveniently administered in divided doses up to 4 times a day in unit dosage form containing for example from about 0.5 g to about 10 mg, e.g. from about 2 g to 10 mg, of the compound or in sustained release form. The uncomplexed compounds of formula I may be administered by any conventional route, for example parenterally e.g. in form of injectable solutions or suspensions, or in a nasal or a suppository form. The following examples are illustrative of the invention. All temperatures are in C. Following abbreviations are employed: Fmoc9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl Boctert-butoxycarbonyl DOTA1,4,7,10-tetra-azacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid DMFdimethylformamide EXAMPLE 1 6 g of DOTAx2H 2 O (free acid) is dissolved in 50 ml of water (pH3.7). After diluting with 60 ml of DMF, 1 g of N-hydroxy-succinimide, 2.7 g of N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCI) and 3 g of Tyr 3 , -Boc-Lys 5 -octreotide is added immediately. The reaction is kept at room temperature for 72 hours under continuous stirring. The -Lys 5 protected compound is isolated by purification on a silica gel 60 column using methylene chloride/methanol/acetic acid 50% (9/1/0.125) as mobile phase. Subsequent cleavage of the Lys 5 protecting group with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 100%) over a period of 10 minutes at room temperature and purification on a silica gel 60 column (mobile phase: methylene chloride/methanol/acetic acid 50% (7/3/1 to 7/5/2)) and on a RP18-HPLC column, using water/acetonitrile/acetic acid 1% as buffer system, results in a pure and homogeneous title compound in its acetate salt form. FAB-MH : 1421 D 22 14.75 (95% AcOH; c0.52) EXAMPLE 2 90 Y Labelled Compound of Example 1 The 90 Y labelled CHELATE is prepared by adding 20 l of 90 Y (1.2 mCi, 0.04 M HCl) to 20 L of 50 M compound of Example 1 (0.15 M NH 4 OAc, 0.3% BSA, pH 4.5). This solution is incubated at 100 for 15 minutes. An aliquot is removed and diluted with 4 mM DTPA (pH 4.5) before being analyzed by C18 reverse phase HPLC to ascertain the amount of free unchelated 90 Y in the reaction mixture (as indicated by the presence of 90 YDTPA 2 ). The radiochemical purity is typically 99.5% and the produced chelate is kinetically stable in 4 mM DTPA (4 nM compound of Example 1, pH 4.5) over a seven day period. EXAMPLE 3 90 Y-labelled Compound of Example 1 120 l of 0.23 M ascorbic acid, 0.15 M ammonium acetate (pH 4.8), 6 l of 1 mM compound of Example 1 and 120 l of 90 Y (85 mCi/ml, 0.04 M HCl) are heated in a vial for 15 minutes in a boiling water bath. The resulting solution is diluted to 1 ml with either 0.23 M ascorbic acid and 0.15 M NH 4 OAc or Proteinsteril KE Nephro amino acid infusion solution and stored at ambient temperature for long term. The Proteinsteril KE Nephro amino acid solution comprises: 11.4 g/l Leu, 9.63 g/l Lys, 9.53 g/l Val, 7.76 g/l Phe, 7.52 g/l Ile, 6.78 g/l Thr, 6.59 g/l Met, 4.9 g/l His and 2.91 g/l Trp. EXAMPLE 4 The title compound is obtained by repeating the procedure of Example 1 but using -Boc-Lys 5 -octreotide. MS (Ion Spray): 1403 (M-H) EXAMPLE 5 90 Y Labelled Compound of Example 4 The labelling procedure of example 2 is repeated, thus yielding the 90 Y chelate. EXAMPLE 6 161 Tb Labelled Compound of Example 1 or 4 The labelling procedure of example 2 is repeated using a 161 Tb yielding salt instead of the 90 Y yielding salt, thus giving the 161 Tb chelate.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to polymerizable mesogenic fluorophenylenes of formula I wherein P, Sp, X, n, L, Z 1 , Z 2 , A, B, m and R are defined below. The invention also relates to a polymerizable liquid crystalline composition comprising at least one polymerizable mesogenic compound of formula I, and to the use of the inventive mesogenic compounds and compositions for the preparation of linear or crosslinked liquid crystalline polymers, in particular for the preparation of oriented linear or crosslinked liquid crystalline polymer films. The invention further relates to the use of inventive compounds, compositions and polymers in liquid crystal displays, such as STN, TN, AMD-TN, temperature compensation, guest-host, phase change, reflective or surface stabilized or polymer stabilized cholesteric texture (SSCT, PSCT) displays, in active and passive optical elements like polarizers, compensators, alignment layers, color filters or holographic elements, in adhesives, synthetic resins with anisotropic mechanical properties, cosmetics, diagnostics, liquid crystal pigments, for decorative and security applications, in nonlinear optics, optical information storage or as chiral dopants. Polymerizable mesogenic compounds, which are also known as reactive mesogenic compounds, have been described in prior art for various purposes. For example, they can be polymerized in situ whilst being macroscopically oriented in the liquid crystalline state to give anisotropic linear or crosslinked polymers or polymer films with uniform orientation of high quality. These films can be used for example as optical elements like broad band cholesteric polarizers (see EP 0 606 940) or polarization filters (EP 0 397 263). The WO 93/22397, DE 195 04 224 and WO 97/34862 for example disclose polymerizable mesogenic compounds with mesogenic cores of various structures. The polymerizable mesogenic compounds described in prior art, however, often exhibit liquid crystalline phases only in a small temperature range or do not show mesophase behavior at all. Another drawback for specific applications is that prior art compounds often exhibit high values of the birefringence. In particular where polymerizable mesogenic compounds are used in optical phase retardation, compensation or alignment layers or films for liquid crystal displays, it is desirable to have available materials of which the optical properties, such as the birefringence, phase retardation (i.e. the product of birefringence and layer thickness) and dispersion (i.e. the wavelength dependence of the birefringence) are adapted to those of the liquid crystal mixture in the display cell, so that optimum compensation can be achieved. Thus, there is still a demand for polymerizable mesogenic compounds with a broad liquid crystalline phase and a low value of birefringence. Furthermore, regarding the broad range of applications for polymerizable mesogenic compounds it is desirable for the expert to have available further compounds of this type which are easy to synthesize and fulfill the various requirements as described above. It was an aim of the invention to provide new polymerizable mesogenic compounds with advantageous properties, thus extending the pool of reactive liquid crystal compounds available to the expert. Other aims of the present invention are immediately evident to the person skilled in the art from the following detailed description. It was now found that these aims can be achieved by providing polymerizable mesogenic fluorophenylenes of formula I. The terms polymerizable mesogenic compound as used in the foregoing and the following comprise compounds with a rod-shaped, board-shaped or disk-shaped mesogenic group, i.e. a group with the ability to induce mesophase behavior in a compound comprising said group. These compounds do not necessarily have to exhibit mesophase behavior by themselves. It is also possible that these compounds show mesophase behavior only in mixtures with other compounds or when the polymerizable mesogenic compounds or the mixtures comprising them are polymerized. Thus, one object of the invention are polymerizable mesogenic fluorophenylenes of formula I wherein is CH 2 CWCOO, WCHCHO, or CH 2 CH-Phenyl-(O) k with W being H, CH 3 or Cl and k being 0 or 1, Sp is a spacer group having 1 to 25 C atoms, X is O, S, CO, COO, OCO, CONH, NHCO, CH 2 CH 2 , OCH 2 , CH 2 O, SCH 2 , CH 2 S, CHCH, CHCHCOO, OCOCHCH, CC, or a single bond, n is 0 or 1, L is H or F, Z 1 and Z 2 are in each case independently COO, OCO, CH 2 CH 2 , OCH 2 , CH 2 O, OCH 2 O or a single bond, A and B are each independently L 1 and L 2 are H or F, m is 0, 1 or 2, and R is H, CN, halogen or a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical with up to 25 C atoms which may be unsubstituted, mono- or polysubstituted by halogen or CN, it being also possible for one or more non-adjacent CH 2 groups to be replaced, in each case independently from one another, by O, S, NH, N(CH 3 ), CO, COO, OCO, OCOO, SCO, COS or CC in such a manner that oxygen atoms are not linked directly to one another, or alternatively R is P(SpX) n .

In another preferred embodiment the polymerizable liquid crystalline composition comprises at least one polymerizable chiral compound of formula I with one polymerizable group. In another preferred embodiment the polymerizable liquid crystalline composition comprises at least one polymerizable chiral compound of formula I with two polymerizable groups. It is also possible for the inventive composition to comprise one or more non-polymerizable chiral compounds, which may be mesogenic or non-mesogenic, in addition or alternatively to the chiral polymerizable compounds. For example, commercially available dopants, like e.g. R 811 or R 1011 (from Merck KGaA, Germany) can be used for this purpose. Polymerizable mesogenic compositions are preferred that comprise 1 to 6, preferably 1 to 3 compounds of formula I. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the polymerizable liquid crystalline composition comprises 1 to 80% by weight, preferably 2 to 60%, in particular 5 to 40% by weight of one or more compounds of formula I. In the polymerizable compositions comprising monofunctional compounds of formula I, the concentration of each of these compounds is preferably 1 to 60%, in particular 2 to 45%, very preferably 3 to 35% by weight of the total mixture. In the polymerizable compositions comprising bifunctional compounds of formula I, the concentration of each of these compounds is preferably 1 to 50%, in particular 2 to 35%, very preferably 3 to 25% by weight of the total mixture. The inventive polymerizable liquid crystalline compositions can additionally comprise one or more other suitable components, such as, for example, catalysts, sensitizers, stabilizers, co-reacting monomers or surface-active compounds. It is also possible, in order to increase crosslinking of the polymers, to add up to 20% of a non mesogenic compound with two or more polymerizable functional groups to the polymerizable composition alternatively or additionally to the multifunctional polymerizable mesogenic compounds. Typical examples for difunctional non mesogenic monomers are alkyldiacrylates or alkyldimethacrylates with alkyl groups of 1 to 20 C atoms. Typical examples for non mesogenic monomers with more than two polymerizable groups are trimethylpropanetrimethacrylate or pentaerythritoltetraacrylate. Liquid crystalline polymers can be obtained from the inventive polymerizable compounds and compositions e.g. by solution polymerization or by in-situ polymerization. For example, solution polymerization can be carried out in a solvent like dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran or toluene using AIBN as an initiator and heating for 24 hours at 30 to 60 C. The in-situ polymerization of polymerizable liquid crystalline compounds is described in detail by D. J.Broer et al., Makromol.Chem. 190, 2255ff. and 3202ff. (1989). The polymerizable liquid crystal compounds and compositions according to this invention are preferably polymerized in situ as described in the foregoing and the following. The inventive compounds and polymerizable liquid crystalline compositions are particularly useful for the preparation of anisotropic polymer films, such as nematic or cholesteric polymer films, with uniform molecular orientation. Thus, another object of the invention is an anisotropic polymer film with an oriented liquid crystalline phase that is obtainable by polymerizing a polymerizable liquid crystalline composition comprising at least one polymerizable mesogenic compound of formula I. To prepare an anisotropic polymer film with uniform orientation, an inventive polymerizable mesogenic composition is preferably coated onto a substrate, aligned and polymerized in situ by exposing them to heat or actinic radiation. Alignment and curing are preferably carried out in the liquid crystalline phase of the composition. Actinic radiation means irradiation with light, like UV light, IR light or visible light, irradiation with X-rays or gamma rays or irradiation with high energy particles, such as ions or electrons. As a source for actinic radiation for example a single UV lamp or a set of UV lamps can be used. Another possible source for actinic radiation is a laser, like e.g. a UV laser, an IR laser or a visible laser. When polymerizing by means of UV light, for example a photoinitiator can be used that decomposes under UV irradiation to produce free radicals or ions that start the polymerization reaction. It is also possible to use a cationic photoinitiator, when curing reactive mesogens with for example vinyl and epoxide reactive groups, that photocures with cations instead of free radicals. As a photoinitiator for radical polymerization for example the commercially available Irgacure 651, Irgacure 184, Darocure 1173 or Darocure 4205 (all from Ciba Geigy AG) can be used, whereas in case of cationic photopolymerization the commercially available UVI 6974 (Union Carbide) can be used. Preferably the polymerizable liquid crystalline composition comprises 0.01 to 10%, in particular 0.05 to 8%, very preferably 0.1 to 5% by weight of a photoinitiator, especially preferably a UV-photoinitiator. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the polymerization of the polymerizable mesogenic composition is carried out under an atmosphere of inert gas, preferably under a nitrogen atmosphere. As a substrate for example a glass or quarz sheet as well as a plastic film or sheet can be used. It is also possible to put a second substrate on top of the coated mixture prior to, during and/or after polymerization. The substrates can be removed after polymerization or not. When using two substrates in case of curing by actinic radiation, at least one substrate has to be transmissive for the actinic radiation used for the polymerization. Isotropic or birefringent substrates can be used. In case the substrate is not removed from the polymerized film after polymerization, preferably isotropic substrates are used. Preferably at least one substrate is a plastic substrate such as for example a film of polyester such as polyethyleneterephthalate (PET), of polyvinylalcohol (PVA), polycarbonate (PC) or triacetylcellulose (TAC), especially preferably a PET film or a TAC film. As a birefringent substrate for example an uniaxially stretched plastic film can be used. For example PET films are commercially available from ICI Corp. under the trade name Melinex. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the inventive polymerizable mesogenic composition is coated as a thin layer on a substrate or between substrates and is aligned in its liquid crystal phase to give a uniform orientation. A uniform orientation can be achieved for example by shearing the mixture, e.g. by means of a doctor blade. It is also possible to apply an alignment layer, for example a layer of rubbed polyimide or sputtered SiO x , on top of at least one of the substrates. In some cases, the mixtures orient themselves spontaneously on the substrate, or good alignment is achieved already by the act of coating the mixture. In another preferred embodiment, a second substrate is put on top of the coated material. In this case, the shearing caused by putting together the two substrates is sufficient to give good alignment. It is also possible to apply an electric or magnetic field to align the coated mixture. In some cases it is of advantage to apply a second substrate not only to aid alignment of the polymerizable mixture but also to exclude oxygen that may inhibit the polymerization. Alternatively the curing can be carried out under an atmosphere of inert gas. However, curing in air is also possible using suitable photoinitiators and high lamp power. When using a cationic photoinitiator oxygen exclusion most often is not needed, but water should be excluded. For the preparation of anisotropic polymer gels, the polymerizable mesogenic compound can be polymerized in situ as described above, however, in this case alignment of the polymerizable mixture is not necessarily required, although it may be desired for specific applications. The invention also relates to the use of inventive compounds, compositions and polymers in liquid crystal displays, such as STN, TN, AMD-TN, temperature compensation, guest-host, phase change or surface stabilized or polymer stabilized cholesteric texture (SSCT, PSCT) displays, in active and passive optical elements like polarizers, compensators, alignment layers, color filters or holographic elements, in adhesives, synthetic resins with anisotropic mechanical properties, cosmetics, diagnostics, liquid crystal pigments, for decorative and security applications, in nonlinear optics, optical information storage or as chiral dopants. The inventive compounds of formula I are particularly suitable, and preferably used, for the preparation of oriented birefringent polymer layers or films that are used as alignment or compensation layers in liquid crystal displays, in particular where these layers are applied to the surface of the electrodes of the liquid crystal cell facing the liquid crystal mixture, i.e. inside the cell. They are in particular suitable for the preparation of retardation or compensation layers in black and white or color reflective TN displays, especially single polarizer reflective displays (SPRD), as described e.g. by M. Tillin, SID 1998 Digest, 311-314 and the references cited therein. By using the inventive polymerizable compounds for birefringent optical polymer films in liquid crystal displays, it is possible to adapt the optical properties of the birefringent polymer, like e.g. the retardation or the dispersion, to those of the LC mixture, and thereby to optimize the electrooptical properties of the display.

nucleic acid sequences useful for detecting the presence of molecules of interest. The method is useful for detecting specific nucleic acids in a sample with high specificity and sensitivity. The method also has an inherently low level of background signal. A preferred form of the method consists of a DNA ligation operation, an amplification operation, and a detection operation. The DNA ligation operation circularizes a specially designed nucleic acid probe molecule. This operation is dependent on hybridization of the probe to a target sequence and forms circular probe molecules in proportion to the amount of target sequence present in a sample. The amplification operation is rolling circle replication of the circularized probe. A single round of amplification using rolling circle replication results in a large amplification of the circularized probe sequences. Following rolling circle replication, the amplified probe sequences are detected and quantified using any of the conventional detection systems for nucleic acids such as detection of fluorescent labels, enzyme-linked detection systems, antibody-mediated label detection, and detection of radioactive labels. Because, the amplified product is directly proportional to the amount of target sequence present in a sample, quantitative measurements reliably represent the amount of a target sequence in a sample. Major advantages of this method are that the ligation step can be manipulated to obtain allelic discrimination, the DNA replication step is isothermal, and signals are strictly quantitative because the amplification reaction is linear and is catalyzed by a highly processive enzyme. In multiplex assays, the primer oligonucleotide used for the DNA polymerase reaction can be the same for all probes.

In one embodiment, the process of the invention comprises mixing with a plant extract obtained from crushed daffodil bulbs or crushed snowdrop bulbs an oxidative cyclisation precursor of the compound. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for producing galanthamine and/or its derivatives from plant extracts. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Galanthamine (and its derivatives) are useful compounds for the treatment of Alzheimers disease and related illnesses. Currently galanthamine, nor-galanthamine and the oxidised precursors thereof, narwedine and nor-narwedine, are usually obtained by extraction from particular types of bulbs, such as daffodils or snowdrops. The yields of these extractive procedures are extremely low, resulting in product(s) which are expensive and in short supply. Studies have shown that the biosynthesis of such compounds probably proceeds by a pathway similar to that shown in Scheme 1 below, where the key step is an oxidative cyclisation. These studies have also indicated that when the cyclisation precursor lacks a methyl group on the amine nitrogen (i.e. RH) the biosynthesis to narwedine and galanthamine is disfavoured, and instead proceeds down other pathways, e.g. to pyrrolo(de)phenanthridine and ethanophenanthridine alkaloids (see Barton and Kirby, J. Chem. Soc. (1961) 806 and Fuganti et al, Tetrahedron Lett. (1974) 2261). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, a process for preparing a compound having a formula (4) or (5), in either optically-enriched or racemic form, wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl and acyl groups, comprises mixing with a plant extract an oxidative cyclisation precursor of the said compound. All formulae are depicted below. Surprisingly, the process of the present invention is capable of achieving higher yields of the desired compounds than simple extraction from bulbs, and has the further advantage of its own simplicity. The process is particularly useful for the preparation of such compounds in optically-enriched form, more particularly ()-galanthamine or ()-narwedine. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Whether the process of the invention results in an optically-enriched or racemic form of a desired compound may depend upon the choice of the precursor to be mixed with the plant extract. Typically, however, an optically-enriched form is achieved. This is particularly advantageous when the product is ()-galanthamine, or a derivative thereof, on account of its therapeutic activity. However, if the product is racemic or optically-enriched narwedine, or a derivative thereof, it can be readily converted to optically-enriched, eg. (), galanthamine by a process such as that described by Shieh et al, J. Org. Chem. (1994) 59: 5463. By optically-enriched typically we mean mixtures of enantiomers having an enantiomeric excess of at least 50%, and more typically at least 80%, or 90% or higher, thereby including single enantiomer form. The groups R 1 to R 4 have been defined above, and typically include up to 20 carbon atoms. The preferred precursor compound for the preparation of ()-galanthamine has surprisingly been found to be a secondary amine having the formula (3), below, in which the nitrogen atom is unsubstituted, ie. R 3 H, contrary to what is disclosed in the prior art discussed above. Particularly preferred precursor compounds are of formula (3) in which R 1 R 3 R 4 H and R 2 alkyl, preferably methyl. The plant extract is typically derived from daffodils or snowdrops, although other plants may give suitable extracts, and is preferably derived from the bulb of the plant. The extract is typically used in fragmented form, for instance by crushing with a pestle and mortar, and is then suspended in a liquid medium. Typically, the liquid medium comprises an aqueous buffer, optionally including an additive such as an organic solvent or a surfactant. The precursor compound is then added to the liquid mixture, and preferably stirred for a period. The mixture is then extracted in a conventional manner. The present invention is now further illustrated by the following Example. EXAMPLE Daffodil bulbs which had been stored in a refrigerator were allowed to warm to room temperature over night. The bulbs were crushed with a pestle and mortar and a 1 g sample of this material was stirred with 10 mg of a secondary amine of formula (3) below, in which R 1 R 3 R 4 H and R 2 Me, in aqueous phosphate buffer (20 ml) and ethanol (10 ml) for 18 hours. The mixture was then extracted with ethyl acetate and then concentrated in vacuo. Gas chromatographic analysis of the residue indicated that three times the amount of ()-galanthamine was produced in comparison with a control reaction, which was run under identical conditions but without the addition of the amine (3). What is claimed is: 1. A process for producing a compound having a formula (4) or (5) comprising: a) mixing an effective amount of a crude plant extract obtained from crushed daffodil bulbs or crushed snowdrop bulbs with an effective amount of an amine having a formula (3) in a suitable liquid medium for a sufficient time to produce said compound, and b) recovering said compound, wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, aralkyl, and acyl groups. 2. The process according to claim 1 , wherein the amine of formula (3) is prepared by mixing the compounds of formula (1) and formula (2) wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are as defined in claim 1 . 3.

TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel heterocyclyluracils, to a process for their preparation and to their use as herbicides. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Numerous heterocyclyluracils having herbicidal and/or insecticidal properties are already known (cf. JP-A 91-287 585, JP-A 93 202 031, Chem. Abstr. 116, 235 650 and Chem. Abstr. 120, 107 048). Thus, for example, 1-(3-chloro-5-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-yl)-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-4-trifluoromethyl-1(2H)-pyrimidine can be used for controlling weeds. However, at low application rates, the activity of this substance is not always satisfactory. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention, accordingly, provides novel heterocyclyluracils of the formula in which R 1 represents formyl, hydroximinomethyl, cyano, carboxyl, alkoxycarbonyl, carbamoyl, thiocarbamoyl or represents optionally halogen-substituted C 1 -C 4 -alkyl, R 2 represents hydrogen, cyano, halogen or represents opitionally halogen-substituted C 1 -C 4 -alkyl and Het represents pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, triazinyl, pyrazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl or thiazolyl, where these radicals are optionally mono- to trisubstituted by identical or different substituents selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, mercapto, amino, cyano, nitro, carboxyl, carbamoyl, thiocarbamoyl, halogen, alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, alkoxyalkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkoxy moiety and 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, alkoxy having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, halogenoalkoxy having 1 to 6 carbon atoms and 1 to 5 halogen atoms, alkoxyalkoxy having 1 to 6 carbon atoms in each alkoxy moiety, alkylthio having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, halogenoalkylthio having 1 to 6 carbon atoms and 1 to 5 halogen atoms, alkylsulphinyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, halogenoalkylsulphinyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms and 1 to 5 halogen atoms, alkylsulphonyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, halogenoalkylsulphonyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms and 1 to 5 halogen atoms, alkylcarbonyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, halogenoalkylcarbonyl having 1 to 5 halogen atoms and 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the halogenoalkyl moiety, alkoxycarbonyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkoxy moiety, halogenoalkoxycarbonyl having 1 to 5 halogen atoms and 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the halogenoalkoxy moiety, alkylamino having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, dialkylamino having 1 to 6 carbon atoms in each alkyl moiety, halogenoalkylamino having 1 to 5 halogen atoms and 1 to 6 carbon atoms, alkylaminocarbonyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, dialkylaminocarbonyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms in each alkyl moiety, alkylsulphonylamino having 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, halogenoalkylsulphonylamino having 1 to 5 halogen atoms and 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the halogenoalkyl moiety, N,N-bis-alkylsulphonylamino having 1 to 6 carbon atoms in each alkyl moiety, N,N-bis-halogenoalkylsulphonyl-amino having 1 to 5 halogen atoms and 1 to 6 carbon atoms in each halogenoalkyl moiety, N-alkyl-N-alkylsulphonyl-amino having 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety and 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkylsulphonyl moiety, N-halogenoalkyl-N-halogenoalkylsulphonyl-amino having 1 to 5 halogen atoms and 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the halogenoalkyl moiety and 1 to 5 halogen atoms and 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the halogenoalkylsulphonyl moiety, N-alkylcarbonyl-N-alkylsulphonyl-amino having 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety of the alkylcarbonyl group and 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkylsulphonyl moiety, N-halogenoalkylcarbonyl-N-halogenoalkylsulphonyl-amino having 1 to 5 halogen atoms and 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the halogenoalkyl moiety and 1 to 5 halogen atoms and 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the halogenoalkylsulphonyl moiety and N-alkylsulphonyl-N-phenylcarbonyl-amino having 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkylsulphonyl moiety and being optionally mono- to trisubstituted by identical or different substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms dialkylamino having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in each alkyl group and alkoxy having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Furthermore, it has been found that heterocyclyluracils of the formula (I) are obtained when a) in a first step aminoalkenoic esters of the formula in which R 1 and R 2 are each as defined above and R represents alkyl, aryl or arylalkyl are either reacted ) with heterocyclyl isocyanates of the formula OCNHet(III), in which Het is as defined above, or ) with heterocyclyl carbamates of the formula in which Het is as defined above and R 3 represents alkyl, aryl or arylalkyl, in each case if appropriate in the presence of an acid binder and if appropriate in the presence of a diluent, and b) in a second step the resulting heterocyclyluracils of the formula in which R 1 , R 2 and Het are each as defined above are reacted with 1-aminooxy-2,4-dinitrobenzene of the formula if appropriate in the presence of an acid binder and if appropriate in the presence of a diluent. Finally, it has been found that the novel heterocyclyluracils of the formula (I) have very good herbicidal properties. Surprisingly, the heterocyclyluracils of the formula (I) according to the invention have considerably better herbicidal activity than the constitutionally most similar active compounds of the prior art which have the same direction of action. In the present case, alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, alkylamino, dialkylamino, halogenoalkyl, halogenoalkoxy and halogenoalkylthio are in each case to be understood as straight-chain or branched radicals.

Using methyl 3-amino-crotonate and pyridin-3-yl isocyanate as starting materials and reacting the resulting 1-(pyridin)3-yl)-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-4-methyl-1(2H)-pyrimidine with 1-aminooxy-2,4-dinitro-benzene, the course of the process according to the invention can be illustrated by the following equation: Using ethyl 3-amino-4,4,4-trifluorocrotonate and N-(2-chloro-3-cyano-4-methyl-pyridin-6-yl)-carbamate as starting materials and reacting the resulting 1-(2-chloro-3-cyano-4-methyl-pyridin-6-yl)-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-4-trifluoromethyl-1(2H)-pyrimidine with 1-aminooxy-2,4-dinitro-benzene, the course of the process according to the invention can be illustrated by the following equation: The formula (II) provides a general definition of the aminoalkenoic esters required as starting materials for carrying out the first step of the process according to the invention. In the formula (II), R 1 and R 2 each preferably or in particular have those meanings which have already been mentioned above, in connection with the description of the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention, as being preferred or as being particularly preferred for R 1 and R 2 .

In general, the amounts used are between 1 g and 10 kg of active compound per hectare of soil surface, preferably between 5 g and 5 kg per ha. The preparation and use of the active compounds according to the invention can be seen from the examples below. PREPARATION EXAMPLES Example 1 a) First Step At 100 C. and under nitrogen, a mixture of 14.9 g (50 mmol) of ethyl 3-amino-4,4,4-trifluoro-crotonate, 13.8 g of potassium carbonate and 100 ml of N-methyl-pyrrolidone is stirred for one hour. 10.0 g (50 mmol) of O-ethyl N-(2-chloro-pyridin-5-yl)-carbamate are then added, and the reaction mixture is heated at approximately 130 C. on a water separator for four hours. Under nitrogen, the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and then poured into 1 litre of water and extracted three times with 100 ml of methylene chloride each time. The mixture is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid (to pH 3) and then left standing for one hour, and the crystalline product is isolated by filtration with suction. This gives 10.6 g (75% of theory) of 1-(2-chloro-pyridin-5-yl)-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-4-trifluoromethyl-1(2H)-pyrimidine of melting point 158 C. b) Second step At room temperature, 3 g (13 mmol) of 1-aminooxy-2,4-dinitro-benzene are added a little at a time, with stirring and over a period of 60 minutes, to a mixture of 2.9 g (10 mmol) of 1-(2-chloro-pyridin-5-yl)-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-4-trifluoromethyl-1(2H)-pyrimidine, 0.9 g of sodium bicarbonate and 50 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide, the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 48 hours. The mixture is then poured into a saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution and repeatedly extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases are washed with water, dried with sodium sulphate and filtered through silica gel. The filtrate is concentrated under water pump vacuum, the residue is digested with ethyl acetate and the crystalline product is isolated by filtration with suction. This gives 1.7 g (55% of theory) of 3-amino-1-(2-chloro-pyridin-5-yl)-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-4-trifluoromethyl-1-(2H)-pyrimidine of melting point 235 C. Preparation of the Starting Material of the Formula With stirring, 11 g (0.1 mol) of ethyl chloroformate are added dropwise to a mixture of 12.8 g (0.1 mol) of 2-chloro-5-amino-pyridine, 15.8 g of pyridine and 200 ml of methylene chloride, and the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for three hours. The mixture is then washed with 1N hydrochloric acid, dried with sodium sulphate and filtered through silica gel. The solvent is carefully distilled off from the filtrate under water pump vacuum. This gives 18.6 g (93% of theory) of O-ethyl N-(2-chloro-pyridin-5-yl)-carbamate as a crystalline product of melting point 110 C. The compounds of the formula (I) listed in the examples below are likewise prepared by the methods given above. Example 2 Example 3 Example 4 Example 5 Example 6 USE EXAMPLES Example A Pre-emergence test Solvent: 5 parts by weight of acetone Emulsifier: 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of emulsifier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration. Seeds of the test plants are sown in normal soil. After approximately 24 hours, the soil is sprayed with the preparation of active compound such that the particular amounts of active compound desired are applied per unit area. The concentration of the spray liquor is chosen so that the particular amounts of active compound desired are applied in 1000 l of water/ha. After three weeks, the degree of damage to the plants is scored visually in % damage in comparison to the untreated control. The figures denote: 0%no effect (like untreated control) 100%total destruction In this test, the compounds of Preparation Examples 1 and 2 exhibit strong activity against weeds, and they are in some instances tolerated well by crop plants, such as maize and soya bean.

The invention further concerns processes for the manufacture of the novel peptide derivatives and the use of the compounds, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them, in treating MHC class II dependent T-cell mediated autoimmllne or inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The present invention relates to certain novel peptides which possess pharmacologically useful properties for use in treating autoimmune diseases or medical conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and other MHC class II dependent T-cell mediated diseases. The invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions of the novel peptides, processes for their manufacture, and their use in treating one or more of the aforementioned diseases or medical conditions and in the production of novel pharmaceuticals for use in such medical treatments. Stimulation of the human immune response is dependent on the recognition of protein antigens by T cells. However T cells cannot respond to antigen alone and are only triggered by antigen when it is complexed with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of an antigen presenting cell, such as a B cell, macrophage or dendritic cell. MHC class I molecules elicit a T-killer cell response which results in the destruction of the cell bearing the antigen. MHC class II molecules elicit a T-helper cell response which controls the expansion and maturation of selected B cells (i.e. antigen-specific antibodies) and activation of macrophages. A critical requirement of the immune system is the ability to differentiate between self and non-self (i.e. foreign) antigens. This discrimination is required to enable the immune system to mount a response to invading foreign pathogens whilst maintaining tolerance to self-proteins and thereby preventing damage to normal tissues. An autoimmune disease results when self-tolerance breaks down allowing the immune system to react against self-tissues such as the joints in rheumatoid arthritis. It is thought that the maintenance of tolerance and thus avoidance of autoimmune disease is critically dependent on the function of MHC molecules. The observation that many autoimmune diseases are linked to the inheritance of particular MHC alleles suggests a key role for MHC molecules in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. For instance multiple sclerosis is linked to the inheritance of HLA-DR2, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus to HLA-DR3 and/or HLA-DR4 and Hashimotos thyroiditis to HLA-DR5. In particular, an especially strong association exists between predisposition to development of the chronic inflammatory joint disease rheumatoid arthritis and the inheritance of HLA-DR4Dw4 and/or HLA-DR4wl4 and/or HLA-DR1. It is thought that the autoimmune disease associated MHC molecules bind to certain self-antigens and present them to T cells thus stimulating an autoimmune response. Other peptides which can bind to the autoimmune associated MHC molecules and/or either prevent the binding or displace already bound self-antigens and/or which inhibit T cell activation (especially the activity of pathogenic T-cells (e.g. Th 1 cells)) and/or which increase the activity of protective T-cells (e.g. Th 2 cells) or peptides which interact with MHC molecules by an alternative mechanism of action so as to prevent or modify stimulation of an autoimmune response mediated via said MHC molecules, may specifically suppress an autoimmune response. An agent of this kind would offer therapy for the autoimmune disease whilst avoiding general suppression of the immune system, thus limiting deleterious side-effects. This kind of profile would have significant advantages over current therapy for diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is contemporary practice to treat rheumatoid arthritis initially with symptom relief agents such as NSAIDs, which do not have anv beneficial effect on disease progression and are often associated with unwanted side-effects. Treatment of more severe disease relies on the use of the so-called second-line agents. Often these are general cytotoxic compounds which are of limited efficacy and can cause severe toxicity problems. A rationally based, disease modifying agent, without associated non-specific cytotoxicity, would therefore offer significant benefits in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Peptides are disclosed in International Patent Application, Publication Nos WO 92/02543, WO 93/05011 and WO 95/07707 which bind to MHC molecules and inhibit T-cell activation. Although a number of peptides have been discovered which inhibit HLA-DR restricted T cell activation by binding to HLA-DR molecules, there is a continuing need for alternative compounds which bind to such molecules and/or either prevent the binding of self antigens or displace already bound self-antigens and/or inhibit T cell activation and/or increase the activity of protective T-cells, or which interact with MHC molecules by an alternative mechanism of action, so as to prevent or modify stimulation of an autoimmune response that cause a disease or condition referred to above. We have discovered that the peptides of the present invention (set out below) surprisingly possess such pharmacologically useful properties and this is a basis for the present invention. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a peptide of the formula I (set out hereinafter) wherein either AA 3 together with AA 4 , or AA 4 together with AA 5 , or AA 6 together with AA 7 form a group of the formula II (set out hereinafter) in which Ra is selected from hydrogen and (1-4C)alkyl, and the remainder of AA 1 , AA 2 , AA 3 , AA 4 , AA 5 , AA 6 , AA 7 and AA 8 are L-amino acid residues; P is a hydrophobic residue, and Q is OH, NH 2 or NRcRd wherein Re is selected from (1-4C)alkyl, 2-carbamoylcyclopentyl, 2-pyridylmethyl, 4-carbamoylcyclohexyl, 4-carbamoylcyclohexylmethyl 3-carbamoylphenyl, 4-carbamoylphenyl, 4-(carbamoylmcthyl)phenyl, 4-(carboxymethyl)phenyl, 2-morpholinoethyl and a group of the formula A 1 G 1 in which A 1 is (3-7C)alkylene or A 1 is selected from (1) a group of the formula -A 2 -B 2 - in which A 2 is p-phenylene or 1,4-cyclohexylene and B 2 is (1-4C)alkylcne or A 2 is methylene and B 2 is p-phenylene or 1,4-cyclohexylene; and (2) a group of the formula -A 3 -B 3 C 3 - in which A 3 is methylene, B 3 is p-phenylene or 1,4-cyclohexylene and C 3 is (1-3C)alkylene; and G 1 is a group of the formula NCN(Rp) 2 2 in which each Rp is independently selected from hydrogen, methyl, ethyl and propyl; and Rd is hydrogen or (1-4C)alkyl; or Q is 1-piperazinyl, 4-methyl-1-piperazinyl, 4-amidino-1-piperazinyl, 4-(2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl)-1-piperazinyl, 1-piperidyl or 4-substituted-1-piperidyl wherein the 4-substitutent is selected from carboxy, carbamoyl, N-(2-aminoethyl)carbamoyl and N-(4-aminobutyl)carbamoyl, or Q is a sequence of 1 to 6 amino acids or an amide thereof; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. It is to be understood that an amino acid of Q may independently have the D- or L-stereochemistry. Furthermore, when Q is defined as hydroxy (OH), this will be understood to be the hydroxy group of the C-terminal amino acid of AA 8 . Similarly where Q is defined as NH 2 , NRcRd, piperazinyl, piperidyl, etc., this means that the hydroxy group of the C-terminal amino acid AA 8 is replaced by such a group. It is also to be understood that where an amino acid is referred to this means an alpha-amino acid. It is also to be understood that when an L-amino acid is referred to this also includes amino acids such as Gly, 2,2-diethylGly. aza-alanine and aza-glycine which have no chiral carbon atom. It is further to be understood that generic terms such as alkyl include both straight and branched chain variants when the carbon numbers permit. The same convention applies to other radicals. It is well known in the art that compounds having a chiral centre may exist in the form of a racemate (or a mixture of diastereoisomers where there is more than one chiral centre) or as an optically active enantiomer or diastercoisomer. It is also well known in the art that a particular biological activity associated with a racemic or diastereomeric mixture may result largely or solely from a single optically active isomer. It will therefore be understood that the invention concerns any form of a peptide of formula I which possesses the aforementioned pharmaceutically useful properties. It is well known in the art how to obtain a single optically active isomer, for example by separation from a racemic or diastereomeric mixture containing the isomer using conventional techniques, such as chromatography, or by chiral synthesis using an appropriate optically active starting material or intermediate, as exemplified herein. It is also well known in the art how to determine the pharmacological properties of such racemic or diastereomeric mixtures, and the individual optically active isomers, for example by using the assays described herein. The person skilled in the art is therefore easily able to obtain the particular isomers of the peptides of formula I having the beneficial pharmacological properties referred to herein. It is also to be understood that the present invention also encompasses any polymorphic form, any tautomer or any solvate, or any mixture thereof, of a peptide of formula I which possesses the beneficial pharmaceutical properties referred to herein.

(Where Dic is referred to this means the forms in which the ring-junctions both have the R configuration or both have the S configuration.)

As stated above, the peptides of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, will have beneficial pharmacological effect in warm-blooded animals (including man) in a range of autoimmune diseases or medical conditions, to treat symptoms or as a disease modifying agent or as a prophylactic treatment. Such diseases may include, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, (Goodpastures syndrome, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, coeilac disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, Sjogren syndrome, myasthenia gravis, Type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetes, Hashimotos disease, Graves disease, Addisons disease, scieroderma, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, pernicious anaemia, glomerulonephritis, graft rejections and such like, especially rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.

Test A: Purified HLA-DR peptide in vitro binding assay. (This assay may be used to demonstrate the binding of the peptides of formula I to disease-associated MHC class II molecules.) 30 l of biotin-FHA 307-320 (FHA (307-320) peptide, derivatised with long-chain biotin at the N-terminus, Biotin-Ahx-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Val-Lys-Gln-Asn-Thr-Leu-Lys-Leu-Ala-Thr-Gly-OH) (SEQ ID NO: 8) at 800 nM in phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) is incubated with 30 L of purified HLA-DR4Dw4 at a concentration between 0.5 and 5 g/ml in V-welled micro-titre plates (Nunc) for 48 hours with or without inhibitor peptides. At the end of the incubation period 100 l of the incubate is transferred to Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbant Assay (ELISA) plates (Nunc) previously coated with an anti-MHC antibody (L243-American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) HB55 as described in Lampson and Levy (1980) J. Immunol. 125, 293-299) at a concentration of 10 g/ml for 1 hour at room temperature and blocked thereafter for 1 hour with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS and 0.05% Tween 20. After a further 1 hour period the unbound peptide is washed away and a 1/4,000 dilution of streptavidin peroxidase (Sigma) in PBS with 0.01% of a suitable detergent such as NP-40 (Sigma) added for 2 hours at room temperature. After further washing tetramethylbenzidene (TMB) substrate solution (1 TMB tablet (Sigma) in 10 mls of 0.1M citrate/acetate buffer, pH 6.0 with 36 l urea hydrogen peroxide (UHPO) (Fluka)) is added to each of the plates. The reaction is stopped by adding 2M sulphuric acid (10 l per well) and the absorbance read at 450 nm to quantify the amount of peptide bound. The inhibitory activity of peptides is obtained by plotting absorbance against concentration. The purified HLA-DR4Dw4 may be obtained as follows: (i) Expression of HLA-DR in the Baculovirus system The expression of recombinant proteins in insect cells from baculovirus vectors is an established procedure to obtain high yields of recombinant protein Luckow, VA Summers, MD (1988) Biotechnology 6 47-551. To enable the expression of the heterodimeric HLA-DR eg. HLA-DR4Dw4 from a single recombinant baculovirus vector (as opposed to having separate recombinant viruses for the a and b chains and then doing a co-infection), a double-recombinant baculovirus is constructed which carries both the and chains. A cDNA encoding the sequence of the polypeptide is cloned into the transfer vector pacYM1 Matsuura, Y; Possce, RD; Overton, HA Bishop, DHL (1987) J. Gen. Virol 68, 1233-1250 to place expression of the protein under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. The unit is inserted into the baculovirus genome by homologous recombination in Sf21 insect cells to create a single recombinant baculovirus for the chain. The techniques for the culture and infection of insect cells, for the homologous recombination and detection/isolation of recombinant viruses are all fully described by Summers, MDD Smith GE (1987) A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures; Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin No. 1555. The molecular genetic techniques used to construct the recombinant vectors are likewise readily available in the literature and are most fully described by Sambrook, J; Fritsch, EF Maniatis T, (1989) Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. To create the double-recombinant baculovirus, a cDNA encoding the chain is cloned into the transfer vector pAcUW1 Weyer, U; Knight, S Possee, RD (1990) J. Gen. Virol., 71, 1525-1534 to place expression of the protein under the control of the P10 promoter. The unit is then inserted into the genome of the single recombinant baculovirus carrying the chain. Double-recombinant viruses are detected by spotting insect cells, infected with randomly picked viruses from the transfection, onto membranes and reacting them with a monoclonal antibody e.g. L243 which specifically recognises the HLA-DR heterodimer. Binding of the antibody to Sf21 insect cells is detected using standard flow cytometry techniques, readily available in the literature. Stable, double-recombinant baculovirus expressing HLA-DR are plaque-purified. (ii) Purification of HLA-DR from insect cells The method used is a modification of that described by Gorga et al 1987. (Gorga et al 1987. J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16087-16094). HLA-DR expressing baculovirus/Sf21 cells (10 L which is approximately equal to 210 10 cells) are solubilised in 100 ml of 5 mM EDTA (sodium salt), 50 mM Tris-HCL pH 8.5, 2% NP40, 150 nM NaCl, 1 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM PMSF by homogenisation with 10 strokes of a teflon glass homogeniser. The homogenate is spun at 100,000 g for 1 hour and the supernatant collected. The anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody LB3.1 (Gorga et al 1986, Cell. Immunol. 103, 160-172) covalently coupled at a ratio of 50 mg of L243 to 10 ml of Protein A-Sepharose fast flow (Pharmacia) and pre-incubated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% NP-40 is incubated overnight with the supernatant. The resin is then put into a column and washed with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% NP-40 (20 column volumes) followed by 0.15 M NaCl, 50 nM Na 2 HPO 4 , pH 7.0 1% octylglucoside (20 column volumes). The HLA-DR is eluted with 50 mM diethylamine pH 11.0, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% octylglucoside. Column fractions are immediately neutralised with 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and concentrated by ultracentrifugation through a centricon-10 membrane. Protein content is determined by a BCA protein assay (Pierce) and purity by SDA-PAGE electrophoresis. In general, the peptides of formula I as defined above which were tested in test A showed significant inhibition at a concentration of about 10 M or much less. A further preferred aspect of the present invention comprises a peptide derivative of the formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which does not bind to HLA-DR3 but binds to HLA-DR1 and/or HLA-DR4Dw4 and/or HLA-DR4Dw14. HLA-DR3 is a common HLA-DR allele which is not associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Accordingly, in rheumatoid arthritis patients who carry HLA-DR3 as one of their alleles (which is approximately one third of the total rheumatoid arthritis patients), such a peptide derivative of the formula I will not interfere with the normal role of HLA-DR3 in the host-defense function. The use of such a peptide derivative is therefore particularly advantageous for treating rheumatoid arthritis patients as it will result in less immunosuppression than would occur with a non-selective DR binder. As a variant to test A, the ability of a peptide of the invention to bind to one or more HLA-DR molecules may be assessed as follows: (i) Purification of HLA-DR Types from Cell lines The method used is a modification of that described by Gorga et al, 1987, J.Biol.Chem. 262, 16087-16094. Human HLA-DR antigens is purified from various cell lines by immunoaffinity chromatography. Briefly, 110 9 -510 9 pelleted cells of the appropriate cell line selected from Hom 2 (source of DR1), BBF (source of DR2), AVL-B (source of DR3), JAH (source of DR4Dw4), JHAF (source of DR4Dwl3) or PE117 (source of DR4Dwl4) are solubilised at approximately 4 C. in 50 ml of 5 mM EDTA (sodium salt), 50 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.4, 2% NP40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM iodoacetamicle, 1 mM PMSF, by homogenisation with 10 strokes of a teflon glass homogeniser. The homogenate is spun at 100,000 g for 1 hour and the supernatant collected. The anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody LB3.1 (Gorga et al, 1986, Cell.Immunol., 103, 160-173) covalently coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) is pre-equilibrated with 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 0.1% NP-40 and incubated overnight with the supernatant. The resin is then packed in a column and washed with 0.15 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 1% octylglucoside (20 column volumes). The HLA-DR is eluted with 50 mM diethylaminc pH 11.0, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% octylglucoside. Column fractions are immediately neutralised with 0.5 M HEPES NaOH pH 7.4. Protein content is determined by a Biorad protein assay and purity by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. (ii) Peptide Selectivity Binding Assays 200 nM biotin-FHA 307-320 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) is incubated with either purified HLA-DR1, DR2, DR4Dw4, DR4Dwl3 or DR4Dwl4, (2-20 g/ml) in V-well microtitre plates (Nunc) with or without inhibitor peptides in assay buffer (PBS, 0.01% NP40 (Sigma.)) For DR3 inhibition, 400 nM Biotin-Ahx-(D)Ala-Ala-Ala-Che-Ile-Ala-Ala-Ala-Thr-Leu-Lys-Ala-Ala-(D)Ala-OH is incubated with purified DR3 (20 g/ml.), and incubated as above. After 48 hours, the incubates are treated, and absorbance readings taken as described in Test A. The inhibitory activity of peptides, expressed as IC 50 values, are calculated using Microcal Origin software on a PC. Test B: Inhibition of T cell activation in vitro. (This assay may be used to demonstrate the ability of the peptides of formula I to inhibit a T cell immune response mediated by or through an MHC class II molecule). Inhibitor peptides were tested for the ability to block stimulation of the B52.24 murine T cell hybridoma line which responds to the FHA 307-320 peptide (H-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Val-Lys-Gln-Asn-Thr-Leu-Lys-Leu-Ala-Thr-Gly-OH) (SEQ ID NO: 9) presented by HLA-DR4Dw4 molecules. B52.24 was produced by the fusion of lymph node T cells taken from FHA 307-320 immunised HLA-DR4Dw4 transgenic mice (International Patent Application, Publication No W095/03331) with the BW5147 murine T cell lymphoma line (White et al (1989) J. Immunol. 143, 1822) as outlined in Woods et al (1994) J. Exp. Med. 180, 173-181 and following the general methods for the generation of T cell hybridomas given in Current Protocols in Immunology, Volume 2, 7.21. Inhibitor peptides at concentrations between 100 and 0.1 M (or lower) were mixed with the antigenic peptide FHA 307-320 in-citlher varying concentrations between 100 and 0.1 M or at a fixed concentration of 10 M by dilution in RPMI-1640 culture media (Gibco) in a 96-well mictrotitre plate (Nunc) in a final volume of 100 l. HLA-DR4Dw4 expressing B cells such as the JAH EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (European Culture Collection ECACC 85102909) or B cells taken from an HLA-DR4Dw4 homozygous individual and transformed with Epsten Barr virus according to the method described in Current Protocols in Immunology 7.22.1 were fixed using gluteraldehyde by suspension in 1% gluteraldehyde (Sigma) at 410 6 cells/ml for 30 seconds, after which an equal volume of 200 mM lysine (Sigma) was added for 3 minutes. The cells were recovered by centrifugation at 300 g, washed in RPMI-1640 and added to the microtitre plates containing antigen and inhibitor compounds at a concentration of 210 5 cells per well. The microtitre plates were incubated for 2 hours at 37 C. and 5% CO 2 . The microtitre plates were then washed in RPMI-1640 by centrifugation at 300 g and aspiration twice before the addition of the B52.24 T cell hybridoma line at a concentration of 10 5 cells per well in culture medium (RPMI-1640, 10% foetal calf serum (Gibco) and 2 mM glutamine (Gibco)). The microtitre plates were then incubated for a further 2 days at 37 C. and 5% CO 2 . The plates were then centrifuged at 300 g for 10 minutes and 150 l of supernatant removed from all wells to be frozen at 20 C. prior to bioassay for IL-2 content. The culture plates containing supernatents to be assayed were left at room temperature to thaw and 100 ml of supernatent was transferred to fresh 96 round bottomed well plates. 1:1 serial dilutions of IL-2 were carried out using culture media (RPMI-1640 (Gibco), 10% foetal calf serum (Advanced Protein Products), 100 g/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco) and 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma)), to produce a standard curve of 250 units/ml to 0.04 units/ml IL-2 final. An IL-2 dependent cell line such as CTLL-2 cells (Nature (1977) 268 154-156) or HT-2 cells (J. Immunol. Methods (1987) 94-104) were harvested and washed twice using culture media prior to resuspension at 510 4 cells/ml. 100 l of IL-2 dependent cell suspension was added to each well of the standard curve and test samples. The culture plates were incubated for 72 hrs at 37 C. and 5% CO 2 . After which, 20 l (1 mCi) of 3H-Thymidine (Amersham International) was added to each well and the plates returned to the incubator for a further 16 hrs. The contents of each plate were harvested onto glass fibre filter mats and the radioactivity measured using a betaplate scintillation counter. In general, the peptides of formula I as defined above which were tested in test B showed significant inhibition at a concentration of about 10 M or much less. Test C: Peptide stimulated DTH (delayed type hypersensitivity) in BALB/C mice. (The assay may be used to demonstrate in vivo activity of peptides of formula I in an animal model). Balb/c female mice (18-20 g), 5 per group, were immunised sub-cutaneously on the flank with 0.1 ml of an emulsion of ovalbumin (Sigma) (2 mg/ml in saline) mixed 1:1 (v/v) with complete Freunds adjuvant (Sigma). Seven days later footpad thickness was detemined using a dual caliper micrometer followed by a challenge in one hind footpad with a 30 l sub-plantar injection of 1% heat-aggregated ovalbumin protein in saline. Twenty-four hours after antigen challenge, footpads were measured and the DTH response calculated as the percentage increase in footpad thickness in the injected footpad compared to contralateral control. Inhibitors were adminstered by 3-day osmotic mini-pumps (Alzet) implanted 24 hours prior to antigen challenge at doses ranging from 10 mg/kg/day to 0.1 g/kg/day. The degree of inhibition was calculated by substracting the value for swelling of inhibitor treated footpads from that of the vehicle dosed controls, dividing by the control value and multiplying by 100%. In general, the peptides of formula I as defined above which were tested in Test C showed significant inhibition at a dose of about 1 mg/kg/day or much less, without any overt toxicological or other untoward pharmacological effect. Test D: (This assay may be used to demonstrate in vivo activity of peptides of formula I in an animal model of arthritis). Balb/c female mice (19-21 g, 5-10/group) are immunised on day 0 and boosted on day 7 with a sub-cutaneous injection of 0.1 ml of an emulsion containing equal volumes of 2 mg/ml methylated bovine serum albumin (met-BSA, Sigma) in saline and complete Freunds adjuvant (Sigma) supplemented with 2.5 mg/ml Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB, strains C, DT and PN, MAFF, Weybridge, Surrey) thus giving a final MTB concentration of 3.5 mg/ml. An additional 0.1 ml i.p injection of 10 9 Bordetella nertussis organisms (Wellcome Pertussis vaccine) in saline is given at the same time. Fourteen days later, animals are challenged into one knee joint with a 10 l intra-articular injection containing 100 ug of met-BSA in saline using a 30 G needle and hamilton syringe. The contralateral knee is injected with a similar volume of saline and serves as a control. The degree of inflammation/swelling associated with both knees is determined 13 days later by measuring using a dual-caliper micrometer. This is achieved by making an incision with blunt-ended scissors and forceps into the skin approximately 5 mm above and below the knee and continuing along the side of the knee to form a flap which is then carefully cut away to expose the underlying joint. Measurements are made across the widest part of the knee, in the horizontal plane, on the flexed limb held in a fixed position. Percentage increase in inflammation in the antigen-injected knee compared to control is calculated according to the formula: antigen-injected knee thicknesssaline-injected knee thickness/saline-injected knee thickness100. Inhibitors are administered using 14 day osmotic mini-pumps (Alzet) implanted 24 hrs before antigen challenge at does ranging from 10 mg/kg/day to 0.1 ug/kg/day. The percentage inhibition of inflammation/swelling is calculated from the thickness measurements by subtracting the value for swelling in the inhibitor-treated group from that of the vehicle dosed controls, dividing by the control value and multiplying by 100. Additional assessments of disease involve 1) the histological evaluation of inflammation, synovitis and cartilage/bone erosions carried out on fixed knee sections stained with haemotoxylin and eosin and 2) the determination of levels of acute phase reactants in serum, serum amyloid P and/or haptoglobin. Peptides of formula I as defined above may show in Test D significant inhibition at a dose of about 10 mg/kg/day or much less. By way of illustration of the pharmacological activity of particular peptides of the formula I, the compound of Example 1 showed significant binding to HLA-DR4Dw4 in Test A at a concentration of 0.1 micromolar or much less, and was active at 0.1 mg/kg/day in Test C. A peptide of formula I may be prepared by any process well known in the art of peptide chemistry to be applicable to the synthesis of analogous peptides. A peptide of formula I may be obtained, for example, by procedures analogous to those disclosed in Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A practical approach by Atherton and Sheppard (published by IRL press at Oxford University Press, 1989). Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis by Stewart and Young (published by the Pierce Chemical Company, Illinois. 1984), Principles of Peptide Synthesis (published by Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1984), and a series of books Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins (volumes 1-25; volume 25 published in 1994) (published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK). Preferably, a peptide of formula I is prepared by solid phase sequential synthesis. Using this technique, the amino acid which is to become the C-terninus amino acid of the peptide is protected at the alpha-amino group, and, if necessary, in the side chain and coupled to a solid support, for example a resin, such as 2-chlorotritylchloride resin or Merrifield resin (chloromethylpolystyrenc-divinylbenzene) if a free carboxylic acid is required after cleavage, or Rink Amide resin (4-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)-phenoxy resin) or Rink Amide MBHA resin (N-(4-2,4-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)-phenoxyacetamido-norleucyl)-4-methyl benzhydrylamine resin (all available from Calbiochem-Novabiochem) if a carboxamide is required after cleavage, whereafter the protecting group on the alpha-amino group is removed. The amino acid which is to be attached to the C-terminus amino acid is protected at the alpha-amino group and, if necessary, in the side chain and coupled to the C-terminus amino acid which remains attached to the solid support. The stepwise process of deprotection of the alpha-amino group and coupling to the next amino acid is repeated to give a protected or unprotected polypeptide attached to the solid support. The group of formula II is incorporated into the sequence by using an appropriately protected (3-amino-2-oxopiperidin-1-yl)alkanoic acid, obtained, for example, as described in the Examples (or by analogy therewith), in place of a protected amino acid. The protected or unprotected polypeptide is released from the solid support by standard procedures, for example using a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid, tricthylsilane and water. It will be appreciated that a side-chain protecting group may be cleaved under the conditions used to release the peptide from the solid support, or may be cleaved as a separate step prior or subsequent to release of the peptide from the solid support. It will also be appreciated that the procedure to build up the polypeptide may be modified by using a sequence of two or more suitable protected amino acids in a particular coupling step. The synthesis may use manual techniques or be carried out automatically, employing for example, an Applied Biosystems 431A or 430A peptide synthesiser or Advanced Chemtech ACT357 peptide synthesiser or similar automatic peptide synthesiser, or a combination of both techniques can be used. During the assembly of the peptides, the amino acid functional groups not taking part in the reaction are protected by various functional groups. For example, the N-terminal and side chain amino groups may be protected by using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), biphenylisopropoxycarbonyl (Bpoc), 2-3.5-dimethoxyphenylpropyl-2-oxycarbonyl (Ddz), adamantyloxycarbonyl (Adoc), allyloxycarbonyl (Aloc), 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl (Troc), benzyloxycarbonyl and various substituted benzyloxycarbonyl groups. These protecting groups can be cleaved when required by the standard techniques (e.g. acid or base treatment, catalytic hydrogenolysis and Pd(0) treatment or zinc/acetic acid treatment). Suitable protecting groups used for the protection of the side chain guanidino group in the peptides containing an arginine residue include a nitro, adamantyloxycarbonyl, 4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylbenzenesulphonyl (Mtr), 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulphonyl (Pmc) and (especially) 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulphonyl (Pbf) group. Suitable protecting groups used for the protection of a side chain hydroxy group include t-butyl, benzyl and trityl (Trt). Suitable protecting groups used for the side chain imidazole group in the peptides containing a histidine residue, include a trityl, benzyl, tosyl, dinitrophenyl, Adoc, Boc or Fmoc group. Suitable protecting groups used for the protection of a side chain carboxyl group include various esters (e.g. methyl, ethyl, t-butyl, benzyl, nitrobenzyl, allyl and 9-fluorenylmethyl). The protecting group cleavage reactions can be performed at temperatures in the range of 4 C. to 40 C. (preferably at or about ambient temperature) and over a period of time in the range of 10 minutes to 24 hours. Suitable coupling methods used for the coupling of the individual amino acids include the commonly used azide, symmetrical anhydride, mixed anhydride and various active esters and carbodiimides. In the case of various carbodiimides (e.g. dicyclohexyl- or diisopropyl-carbodiimides), a number of additives (e.g. 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) and N-hydroxysuccinimde) may also be added. In addition, the amino acid couplings can also be achieved by using a number of other reagents, e.g. 1H-benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), (2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) and (2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (HBTU). The coupling reactions can be performed at temperatures in the range of 20 C. and 40 C. and over a period of time in the range of 10 minutes to 24 hours. A suitable medium for carrying out the coupling reactions includes, for example, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). A particularly suitable method includes the use of HBTU, HOBT and diisopropylethylamine in DMF. These and other methods of peptide synthesis are exemplified in the International Patent Applications referred to herein. A hydrophobic residue P which is a group of the formula R, R.CO, R.SO 2 , R.O.CO, R.NHCO, R.O.CS, R.S.CO, R.NHCS, R.S.CS and R.CS (or such a group present as a substituent on a terminal amino group of P where P is a hydrophobic amino acid or a hydrophobic amino acid bearing further amino acids) may be incorporated, for example, as a final step by alkylation, acylation or other standard functional group modification of a terminal amino group (for example prior to or subsequent to release of the peptide from the support). When C-terminus modifications are required (to obtain a particular value for Q), they may be performed after the peptide is synthesised, using conventional functional group modification. Alternatively a particular value for Q may be obtained by appropriate choice of the initial starting resin and/or the protected entity first coupled to the resin (for example by using a suitably protected group of the formula HQ). Typical examples of the preparation of peptides of formula I are provided in the examples hereinafter. A typical procedure for measuring the stability of a peptide of the present invention is as follows, in which, to minimize microbial contamination and degradation, all equipment that is used to prepare peptide solutions is sterilized in an autoclave and all material transfers carried out in a Class II laminar flow cabinet. Approximately 20 ml of McIlvaines citric acid-phosphate buffer solution at pH 3 or 7.6 containing 0.02% sodium azide is filtered into a 50 ml bottle using a sterile 0.22 m filter unit and a 20 ml syringe. Approximately 1.2 mg of peptide is accurately weighed in a capped vial. Using a sterile pipette tip, sufficient buffer solution is added to the peptide in the vial to give a peptide concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The vial is capped and shaken to dissolve the peptide. Using a sterile pipette tip, aliquots of approximately 1 ml of the peptide solution are transferred to 10 HPLC vials, which are then capped. 5 vials are stored at 18 and 37 C. The area of the peptide peak for the solution is determined by HPLC using appropriate standards initially and after storage at 18 and 37 C. for 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks. using a fresh vial at each time point with duplicate sample injections. The percentage of peptide remaining after storage at 37 C. at each time point is determined from the ratio of the area of the peptide peak at each time point to the initial area. Preferred peptides of the present invention have greater than 90%, and preferably greater than 95%, of peptide remaining after storage at 37 C. at both pH 3 and 7.6. The peptides of formula I will generally be administered for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes to warm-blooded animals (including man) requiring such treatment in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, as is well known in the pharmaceutical art. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a peptide of the formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. The composition may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example a tablet, capsule, aqueous or oily solution, suspension or emulsion; for nasal use, for example a snuff, nasal spray or nasal drops; for vaginal or rectal use, for example a suppository; for administration by inhalation, for example as a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol; for sub-lingual or buccal use, for example a tablet or capsule; or for parenteral use (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion), for example a sterile aqueous or oily solution or suspension. The composition may be in a form suitable for topical administration such as for example creams, ointments and gels. Skin patches are also contemplated. Formulation in general is described in Chapter 25.2 of Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry, Volume 5. Editor Hansch et al, Pergamon Press 1990. In general the above compositions may be prepared in a conventional manner using conventional excipients. However, in the case of a composition for oral administration, it may be convenient for the composition to include a coating to protect the polypeptide active ingredient from the actions of enzymes in the stomach. A preferred composition of the invention is one suitable for oral adminstration in unit dosage form for example a tablet or capsule which contains from 2.5 to 500 mg, and preferably 10 to 100 mg, of polypeptide in each unit dose, or one suitable for parenteral administration which contains from 0.5 to 100 mg of polypeptide per ml, and preferably 1 to 10 mg of polypeptide per ml of solution. A parenteral composition is preferably a solution in isotonic saline or isotonic dextrose buffered if necessary to a pH of 5 to 9. Alternatively, the parenteral composition may be one designed for slow release in which case the amount of polypeptide per unit dose is in general greater than that required when a conventional injectable formulation is used. A preferred slow release formulation is a continuous release formulation, for example a formulation of the type described in European Patent Specification No. 58481 or, for peptides of formula I containing at least one basic group, a formulation as described in International Patent Application, Publication No. WO93/24 150. Certain peptides of the present invention possess solubility characteristics which make them particularly suitable for the manufacture and processing of slow release parenteral formulations, particularly formulations containing biodegradeabie polyesters such as polylactides, and for providing slow release formulations with beneficial release profiles. Furthermore, peptides of the present invention containing one or more basic groups, particularly arginine, can also form peptide-polymer salts with acid-ended polyesters, such as polylactides, and such peptides and peptide-polymer salts constitute a further aspect of the present invention. Certain such salts possess solubility characteristics which make them particularly suitable for the manufacture and processing of slow release parenteral formulations, for example as described in WO93/24150, and for providing slow release formulations with beneficial release profiles and storage stability characteristics. A preferred slow release parenteral formulation contains from 1 to 100 mg (such as 5 to 50 mg) of polypeptide per unit dose. A preferred slow release parenteral formulation is also one designed for slow release over a period of at least 5 days. Preferred peptides of the present invention include those which, when in the form of an extruded polymer depot formulation, show minimal loss due to degradation on extrusion or which show minimal degradation on release from such a depot formulation. Typical procedures for measuring the level of degradation of a peptide of the present invention are as follows: Preparation of Extruded Polymer Depot Formulation of Peptide About 20 mg of peptide is accurately weighed and sufficient polymer (50/50% molar poly(D,L-lactic acid/glycolic acid) copolymer of approximate weight average molecular weight 20 kD and approximate polydispersity of 1.7 as determined by size exclusion chromatography relative to polystyrene standards) added to produce an approximate 20% w/w mixture. This is dissolved in anhydride-free glacial acetic acid to produce an approximate 10% w/v solution. The solution is freeze dried and the resulting freeze dried product is stored under vacuum prior to use. About 100 mg of freeze dried material is loaded into the barrel of a small laboratory extruder and the plunger pushed down to consolidate the sample. The extruder is heated to between 90 and 95 C. and held at this temperature for 10 minutes before the freeze dried material is extruded under pressure to give a cylindrical extrudate of approximately 1 mm in diameter. Analysis of Peptide Content of Extruded Polymer Depot Formulation of Peptide Two approximate 5 mm lengths of extruded polymer depot containing peptide are accurately weighed and each dissolved in 1 ml of anhydride-free glacial acetic acid in separate 25 ml volumetric flasks. After about 1.5 hours the volume of each is made up to 25 ml with distilled water, causing the polymer to precipitate. The solids are filtered off using a 0.5 m Millex PTFE filter and the solutions, A, collected. A series of standard solutions are prepared from a stock solution of peptide in distilled water at 0.5 mg/ml and a stock solution of polymer in anhydride-free glacial acetic acid at 2.5 mg/ml as follows with each solutions made up to 10 ml with distilled water: Concentration Volume of Volume of of stock polymer stock peptide peptide (g/ml) solution (l) solution (l) 50 1000 1000 40 1000 800 30 1000 600 20 1000 400 10 1000 200 5 1000 100 0 1000 0 Each standard is filtered through a 5 m Millex PTFE filter and an aliquot of filtrate, together with aliquots of the solutions A, analysed by HPLC using duplicate sample injections. The peptide content of the extruded polymer depot formulation of peptide is calculated from the concentration of peptide in solutions A, which is determined by comparing the area of the peptide peak in solutions A with the area of the peptide peak from the standard solutions. Preferred peptides of the present invention show minimal loss due to degradation on extrusion and thus the peptide content of the extruded polymer depot formulation is close to the approximate theoretical value of 20% w/w. Degradation of Peptide on in vitro Release from an Extruded Polymer Depot A solution of McIlvaines citric acid-phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.6 containing 0.02% sodium azide, is filtered through a 0.22 filter and stored at 4 C. Approximately 10 mg of extruded ploymer depot containing peptide is placed in two small vials and 2 ml of the buffer solution added. The vials are then capped and stored in a water bath at 37 C. for a month. At suitable time points over a month, three 0.6 ml aliquots of release medium are removed from each vial and either analysed by HPLC or stored frozen in an HPLC vial at 18 C. prior to analysis by HPLC. 1.8 ml of the buffer solution is added to each vial containing the depot to replace the release medium that has been removed at each time point. The average amount of intact peptide in the release medium at each time point is determined by HPLC using duplicate sample injections by comparing the area of the peptide peak in the release media with the area of the pcptide peak from standard buffer solutions of peptide at known concentrations. The approximate average amount of peptide degradation products in the release media at each time point is determined by HPLC by comparing the area of additional new peaks in the release media with the area of the peptide peak from standard buffer solutions of peptide at known concentrations and assuming the extinction coefficient has not changed. The average cumulative in vitro release profile of intact peptide and total peptide (intact peptide and peptide degradation products) is determined from the amounts of intact peptide and peptide degradation products in the release medium at each time point. Preferred peptides of the present invention show minimal degradation on in vitro release and thus show total peptide degradation products of less than 10% and preferably less than 5% of total peptide after a month of in vitro release into McIlvaines buffer solution at pH 7.6 at 37 C. The composition of the invention will generally be administered to man such that, for example, a daily dose will be from 10 micrograms to 5000 mg, preferably 0.1 to 100 mg, for a 70 kg patient, given in divided doses as necessary. The precise amount of composition administered and the route and form of administration may depend on the size, age and sex of the person being treated and on the particular disease or medical condition being treated and its severity, according to principles well know in the medical art. A peptide of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may also be advantageously administered for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes together with one or more other pharmacological agents known in the general art to be of value in treating or relieving the symptoms of (or to be a disease modifying agent of) one or more of the diseases or medical conditions referred to hereinabove, such as a NSAID (such as ibuprofen or piroxicam), an analgesic (such as paracetamol), a corticosteroid, a muscle relaxant, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, methotrexate, azathioprine, D-penicillamine, Cyclosporin A or a monoclonal antibody therapy (such as-anti-CD4 or anti-TNF). In diabetes the peptides may be co-administcred with insulin or other therapies for diabetes or diabetes complications, (such as an aldose reductasc inhibitor). It is to be understood that such combination therapy constitutes a further aspect of the invention. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for treating a MHC class II dependent T-cell mediated autoimmune or inflammatory disease, for example one or more of the diseases or medical conditions referred to herein, which comprises administering to a warm-blooded mammal (including man) in need of such treatment an effective amount of a peptide of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The invention also provides the use of a peptide of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the production of a novel medicament for use in the treatment of a MHC class II dependent T-cell mediated autoimmune or inflammatory disease. In addition to their aforesaid use in therapeutic medicine in humans, the peptides of formula I are also useful in the veterinary treatment of similar conditions affecting commercially valuable warm-blooded animals, such as dogs, cats, horses and cattle. In general for such treatment, the peptide of the formula I will be administered in an analogous amount and manner to those described above for administration to humans. The peptides of formula I are also of value as pharmacological tools in the development and standardisation of test systems for the evaluation of the effects of MHC class II molecules in laboratory animals such as cats, dotgs, rabbits, monkeys, rats and mice, as part of the continuing search for new and improved therapeutic agents, or as diagnostic reagents. The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples in which, unless otherwise stated: (i) concentrations and evaporations were carried out by rotary evaporation in vacuo; (ii) operations were carried out at room temperature, that is in the range 18-26 C.; (iii) yields, when given, are intended for the assistance of the reader only and are not necessarily the maximum attainable by diligent process development; (iv) the following abbreviations are used: Phv5-phenylvaleryl; Boctert-butoxycarbonyl; DMFN,N-dimethylformamide; HOBT1-hydroxy-benzotriazole; DIPCDIdiisopropylcarbodiimide; Metmethionine; Fmoc9-fluorenyimethyloxycarbonyl; Fmoc-Pip-OHN-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)piperidine-4-carboxylic acid; Fmoc-Papa-OH4-N-(9-fluorenylmcthoxycarbonyl)aminophenylacetic acid; CbZbenzyloxycarbonyl, THFtetrahydrofuran; DMSOdimethylsulfoxide: HBTU2-(1H-benzotriazol-1yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluroniumhexafluorophosphate; DIPEAdiisopropylethylamine; TFAtrifluoroacetic acid; Su is succinimide attached via the ring nitrogen atom; tButert-butyl; HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography; and RP-HPLCreverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography; (v) flash chromatography was performed on Merck Kieselgel 60 (Art No. 9385) obtained from E Merck, Darmstadt, Germany; (vi) 1 H NMR spectra were determined at 200 Mhz in CDCL 3 or d 6 -dimethylsulphoxide (d 6 -DMSO) using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard, and are expressed as chemical shift (delta) values in parts per million relative to TMS using conventional abbreviations for designation of major peaks: s, singlet; m, multiplet; t, triplet; br, broad, d, doublet; and (vii) where Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH was used, this was in a commercially available form of a solvate containing one molecule of isopropyl ether (per molecule of Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH). EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of Phv-Arg-Ala-Ala-Ala-Thr-II-Ala-Papa-NH 2 (SEQ ID NO: 1) 1.1 Preparation of 2-3-(9-fluorenyimethoxycarbonylamino)-2-oxopiperidin-1-ylacetic acid (Fmoc-II-OH) (a) (3RS)-3-aminopiperidin-2-one (1.5 g, obtained from DL-ornithine by the method described in Synthesis, 1978, 614-6) and triethylamine (1.4 ml) were dissolved in aqueous tert-butanol (50%, 30 ml) and heated to 40-50 C. Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (2.4 g) was added in 4 portions over 2 minutes and the resulting solution was stirred at 50 C. for 20 minutes. Solvent was removed by evaporation and the residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The aqueous phase was extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The organic phases were combined, washed with brine, dried over Na 2 SO 4 and solvent removed by evaporation. The resulting solid was recrystallised from cyclohexane to give (3RS)-3-tert-butoxycarbonylaminopiperidin-2-one as a white solid (1.6 g). (b) (3RS)-3-tert-butoxycarbonylaminopiperidin-2-one (16.07 g) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 350 ml) and the mixture was cooled to 0 C. Sodium hydride (3.6 g of a 50% dispersion in mineral oil) was added and then the mixture was stirred at 0 C. for one hour. A solution of ethyl bromoacetate (13.78 g) in DMF (20 ml) was then added. The mixture was stirred for 16 hours at ambient temperature, then cooled to 0 C. and ice added. Volatile material was removed by evaporation and the residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate and brine. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated by evaporation. The resulting oil was purified on silica eluting with 40% ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (60-80 C.) to give ethyl 2-(3RS)-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-2-oxopiperidin-1-ylacetate as a colourless oil (18.15 g). (c) Ethyl 2-(3RS)-3-tert-butoxycarbonylarnino-2-oxopiperidin-1-ylacetate (2.1 g) was refluxed in a mixture of acetone (30 ml), water (20 ml) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (12 ml) for 4 hours and the mixture was then evaporated to dryness. Water was added to the residue and the evaporation repeated. The residue was then dissolved in water (30 ml) and sodium bicarbonate (1.48 g) was added. 9-Fluorenyimethyl succinimidyl carbonate (2.48 g) was added in a mixture of acetonitrile (15 ml) and acetone (15 ml). Sodium carbonate (360 mg) was added to maintain the solution at approximately pH 8. The mixture was stirred for 16 hours and then volatile material was removed by evaporation. The residue was partitioned between water (10 ml) and ether (15 ml). The aqueous layer was separated and adjusted to about pH 2 with concentrated hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water (10 ml), brine (15 ml), dried over Na 2 SO 4 and evaporated to give 2-(3RS)-3-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonylamino)-2-oxopiperidin-1-ylacetic acid (Fmoc-II-OH) (1.01 g); NMR(CDCl 3 ): 1.65-2.05 (m, 4H), 3.25 (s, 2H), 3.9-4.1 (m, 3H), 4.14-4.35 (m, 3H), 7.25-7.45 (m, 4H), 7.5 (bd, 1H), 7.6 (d, 2H), 7.85 (d, 2H), 12.6 (bs, 1H); mass spectroscopy, m/e (positive fast atom bombardment (FAB)) 395.11 (MH) ; microanalysis, found: C, 66.8; H, 5.70; N, 6.8%; C 22 H 22 N 2 O 5 ; requires: C, 67.0; H, 5.62; N, 7.10%. 1.2 Synthesis of Phv-Arg-Ala-Ala-Ala-Thr-II-Ala-Papa-NH 2 (SEQ ID NO: 1) The peptide was prepared by Fmoc solid phase synthesis starting with Fmoc Rink Amide MBHA Resin (Novabiochem, 0.50 g, 0.25 mmoles) in a Bond Elut tube (Varian, 15 ml, fitted with a filter in the bottom). (a) The resin was deprotected using a 20% solution of piperidine in DMF (two treatments with 5 ml for 10 minutes each). After deprotection the resin was thoroughly washed with DMF (510 ml). (b) Acylation was carried out by addition of a solution of Fmoc-Papa-OH (373 mg, 1 mmol), DMF(1.5 ml), HOBT (165 mg, 1 mmol) and diisopropylcarbodiimide (155 microlitres. 1 mmol). The coupling was left for approximately 30 minutes, washed with DMF (510 ml) and a small portion of the resin checked for completion of acylation using the Kaiser test (E. Kaiser, et al, (1970), Anal. Biochem. 34, 595). The above deprotection (a) and coupling cycle (b) were repeated using, Fmoc-Ala-OH (311 mg, 1 mmol); Fmoc-II-OH (198 mg, 0.5 mmol); Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-OH (397 mg, 1 mmol); Fmoc-Ala-OH (311 mg, 1 mmol); Fmoc-Ala-OH (311 mg, 1 mmol); Fmoc-Ala-OH (311 mg, 1 mmol); Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH (752 mg, 1 mmol); 5-Phenylvaleric Acid (178 mg, 1 mmol); In each case the coupling time was around 30 minutes and a small portion of the resin was checked for completion of acylation by the Kaiser test. The phenylvaleric acid required a double couple to obtain a positive result by the Kaiser test. The peptide was cleaved from the resin using a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (7.9 ml) and triethylsilane (0.395 ml). After 2 hours the resin was washed with dichloromethane (approximately 150 ml) and the resulting solution evaporated to dryness. The resulting solid was partitioned between ether (25 ml) and water (25 ml) and then the ether was extracted with further portions of water (225 ml). The aqueous phases were combined and freeze dried. The crude product was purified using preparative RP-HPLC (Vydac 218TP1022 column, 250 mm22 mm), loading the crude material in 5 mls of 20% acetonitrile/water with 200 microiltres of DMF. Elution was with a gradient of acetonitrile-water containing 0.1%TFA (15-35% acetonitrile) over 80 minutes at a flow rate of 10 ml/minute. The fractions containing product were combined and freeze dried to give Phv-Arg-Ala-Ala-Ala-Thr-II-Ala-Papa-NH 2 (SEQ ID NO: 9) as a white solid (22 mg). The product was characterised by HPLC, mass spectroscopy and amino acid analysis. RP-HPLC (Vydac C18 column, 218TP54, 4.6250 mm, eluting with acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% TFA, using a 10-50% acetonitrile gradient over 30 minutes, flow rate 1.0 ml/minute), retention time 18.88 minutes and 19.10 minutes (for the two diastereoisomers). Mass spectrometry, m/e (positive electiospray (ES)) 1006.7 (MH ). Amino acid analysis (acid hydrolysis over 24 hours using a solution of 6N HCl containing 1% Phenol at 130 C.) gave Arg 1.04, Ala 4.12, Thr 0.85, II present. EXAMPLE 2 Preparation of Phv-Arg-Ala-Ala-II-Ala-Ala-Ala-Papa-NH 2 (SEQ ID NO: 2) The peptide was prepared by Fmoc solid phase synthesis starting from Fmoc Rink Amide MBHA Resin (Novabiochem, 0.50 g; 0.25 mmoles) by a mixture of automated synthesis and manual synthesis using a Bond Elut tube (Varian, 15 ml, fitted with a filter in the bottom). Fmoc-Ala-Ala-Ala-Papa-NH-Resin was first obtained using an ACT 357 automated peptide synthesiser in multiple parallel synthesis mode by deprotecting the resin and sequentially coupling and deprotecting with Fmoc-Papa-OH (373 mg, 1 mmol), followed by three times with Fmoc-Ala-OH (311 mg, 1 mmol), following the manufacturers recommended conditions for single acylations incorporating DIPCDI/HOBT chemistry. After deprotection, the resin was washed with DMF (1010-20 ml). The carboxylic acid (1 mmol) was activated with DIPCDI (1 equivalent), HOBT (1 equivalent) in DMF for approximately 11 minutes before transfer to the resin. The acylation was carried out for approximately 60 minutes and then the resin was washed with DMF (1010 ml). Fmoc deprotection at each stage was carried out using a 20% solution of piperidine in DMF (two treatments with 5 ml for 10 minutes each). After each deprotection, the resin was thoroughly washed with DMF (510 ml). Fmoc-Ala-Ala-Ala-Papa-NH 2 resin was deprotected as described above and put in a Bond Elut tube. A solution of Fmoc-II-OH (198 mg; 0.5 mmol), DMF (1.5 ml), HBTU (379 mg; 1 mmol), HOBT(165 mg; 1 mmol) and DIPEA (348 microlitres; 2 mmol) was added to the resin. The coupling was left for approximately 30 minutes, washed with DMF (510 ml) and a small portion of the resin checked for completion of the coupling using the Kaiser test (E.Kaiser et al (1970), Anal. Biochem. 34, 595). The peptide resin was returned to the automatic synthesiser, deprotected as described above and the synthesis completed by sequentially coupling and deprotecting twice with Fmoc-Ala-OH (311 mg; 1 mmol), followed by Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH (752 mg; 1 mmol) and 5-phenylvaleric acid (178 mg, 1 mmol) as previously described above for the automated couplings. The 5-phenylvaleric acid required a double couple to obtain a positive result by the Kaiser test. The peptidc was then cleaved from the resin and purified by preparation RP-HPLC using similar methodology to that described for Example 1.2. The product was characterised by HPLC, mass spectroscopy and amino acid analysis in a similar manner to that described for Example 1.2; RP-HPLC (eluting with acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% TFA, using a 20-35% acetonitrile gradient over 15 minutes, flow rate 1.0 ml/minute), retention time 10.62 minutes. Mass spectrometry, m/e (ES) 976.8 (MH) , 500.0 (MHNa) . Amino acid analysis (acid hydrolysis over 24 hours using a solution of 6N HCl containing 1% Phenol at 130 C.) gave Ala 5.30, Arg 1.00, II present. EXAMPLE 3 Preparation of Phv-Arg-Ala-II-Thr-Ala-Ala-Ala-Papa-NH 2 (SEQ ID NO: 3) The peptide was prepared using similar methodology to that described for Example 2. by automated deprotection and coupling (using Fmoc-Rink Amide MBHA resin) of Fmoc-Papa-OH, Fmoc-Ala-OH (three times) and Fmoc-Thr(tBu)-OH and manual coupling of Fmoc-II-OH, followed by automated deprotection and coupling of Fmoc-Ala-OH, Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH and 5-phenylvaleric acid. The peptide was cleaved from the resin, deprotected and purified by preparative RP-HPLC using a similar procedure to that described in Example 1.2. On this occasion the preparative RP-HPLC procedure separated the two diastereoisomers. The two diastercoisomers were characterised separately by HPLC, mass spectroscopy and amino acid analysis in a similar manner to that described for Example 1.2; RP-HPLC (eluting with acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% TFA, using a 20-35% acetonitrile gradient over 15 minutes, flow rate 1.0 ml/minute) retention time 11.34 minutes (Isomer A) and 11.62 minutes (Isomer B); mass spectroscopy (Isomer A), m/c (ES): 1006.7 (MH) , 514.8 (MHNa) ; amino acid analysis (Isomer A; acid hydolysis over 24 hours using a solution of 6N HCl containing 1% phenol at 130 C.) gave Ala 4.32, Arg 1.00, Thr 0.757, II present.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation-in-part of appl. Ser. No. 09/168,945, filed Oct. 9, 1998, now abandoned, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/061,676, filed Oct. 10, 1997, abandoned, the contents of each of which are entirely incorporated by reference herein. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention is in the field of medicinal chemistry. In particular, the invention relates to dipeptides which are potent inhibitors of apoptosis. The invention also relates to the use of these dipeptides for reducing or treating apoptotic cell death. 2. Description of Background Art Organisms eliminate unwanted cells by a process variously known as regulated cell death, programmed cell death or apoptosis. Such cell death occurs as a normal aspect of animal development as well as in tissue homeostasis and aging (Glucksmann, A., Biol. Rev. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 26:59-86 (1951); Glucksmann, A., Archives de Biologie 76:419-437 (1965); Ellis et al., Dev. 112:591-603 (1991); Vaux et al., Cell 76:777-779 (1994)). Apoptosis regulates cell number, facilitates morphogenesis, removes harmful or otherwise abnormal cells and eliminates cells that have already performed their function. Additionally, apoptosis occurs in response to various physiological stresses, such as hypoxia or ischemia (PCT published application WO96/20721). There are a number of morphological changes shared by cells experiencing regulated cell death, including plasma and nuclear membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage (condensation of nucleoplasm and cytoplasm), organelle relocalization and compaction, chromatin condensation and production of apoptotic bodies (membrane enclosed particles containing intracellular material) (Orrenius, S., J. Internal Medicine 237:529-536 (1995)). Apoptosis is achieved through an endogenous mechanism of cellular suicide (Wyllie, A. H., in Cell Death in Biology and Pathology, Bowen and Lockshin, eds., Chapman and Hall (1981), pp. 9-34). A cell activates its internally encoded suicide program as a result of either internal or external signals. The suicide program is executed through the activation of a carefully regulated genetic program (Wylie et al., Int. Rev. Cyt. 68: 251 (1980); Ellis et al., Ann. Rev. Cell Bio. 7: 663 (1991)). Apoptotic cells and bodies are usually recognized and cleared by neighboring cells or macrophages before lysis. Because of this clearance mechanism, inflammation is not induced despite the clearance of great numbers of cells (Orrenius, S., J. Internal Medicine 237:529-536 (1995)). Mammalian interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays an important role in various pathologic processes, including chronic and acute inflammation and autoimmune diseases (Oppenheim, J. H. et. al. Immunology Today, 7, 45-56 (1986)). IL-1 is synthesized as a cell associated precursor polypeptide (pro-IL-1) that is unable to bind IL-1 receptors and is biologically inactive (Mosley et al., J. Biol. Chem. 262:2941-2944 (1987)). By inhibiting conversion of precursor IL-1 to mature IL-1, the activity of interleukin-1 can be inhibited. Interleukin-1 converting enzyme (ICE) is a protease responsible for the activation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) (Thornberry, N. A., et al., Nature 356: 768 (1992); Yuan, J., et al., Cell 75: 641 (1993)). ICE is a substrate-specific cysteine protease that cleaves the inactive prointerleukin-1 to produce the mature IL-1. The genes that encode for ICE and CPP32 are members of the mammalian ICE/Ced-3 family of genes which presently includes at least twelve members: ICE, CPP32/Yama/Apopain, mICE2, ICE4, ICH1, TX/ICH-2, MCH2, MCH3, MCH4, FLICE/MACH/MCH5, ICE-LAP6 and ICE rel III. The proteolytic activity of this family of cysteine proteases, whose active site cysteine residue is essential for ICE-mediated apoptosis, appears critical in mediating cell death (Miura et al., Cell 75: 653-660 (1993)). This gene family has recently been named caspases (Alnernri, E. S. et al. Cell, 87:171 (1996)). IL-1 is also a cytokine involved in mediating a wide range of biological responses including inflammation, septic shock, wound healing, hematopoiesis and growth of certain leukemias (Dinarello, C. A., Blood 77:1627-1652 (1991); diGiovine et al., Immunology Today 11:13 (1990)). Many potent caspase inhibitors have been prepared based on the peptide substrate structures of caspases. However, in contrast to their potency in vitro, no inhibitors with good efficacy (IC 50 1 M) in whole-cell models of apoptosis have been reported (Thomberry, N. A. Chem. Biol. 5:R97-103 (1998)). Therefore the need exists for cell death inhibitors that show efficacy (IC 50 1 M) in whole-cell models of apoptosis and are active in animal models of apoptosis. These inhibitors thus can be employed as therapeutic agents to treat disease states in which regulated cell death and the cytokine activity of IL-1 play a role. WO 93/05071 disclosed peptide ICE inhibitors with the formula: ZQ 2 AspQ 1 wherein Z is an N-terminal protecting group; Q 2 is 0 to 4 amino acids such that the sequence Q 2 -Asp corresponds to at least a portion of the sequence Ala-Tyr-Val-His-Asp; Q 1 comprises an electronegative leaving group. Exemplary dipeptides are Boc-His-Asp-CH 2 F, Boc-Tyr-Asp-CH 2 F, Boc-Phe-Asp-CH 2 F, Ac-His-Asp-CH 2 F, Ac-Tyr-Asp-CH 2 F, Ac-Phe-Asp-CH 2 F, Cbz-His-Asp-CH 2 F, Cbz-Tyr-Asp-CH 2 F and Cbz-Phe-Asp-CH 2 F. WO 96/03982 disclosed aspartic acid analogs as ICE inhibitors with the formula: wherein R 2 is H or alkyl; R 3 is a leaving group such as halogen; R 1 is heteroaryl-CO or an amino acid residue. U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,357 disclosed peptidic ketones as ICE inhibitors with the formula: wherein n is 0-2; each AA is independently L-valine or L-alanine; R 1 is selected from the group consisting of N-benzyloxycarbonyl and other groups; R 8 , R 9 , R 10 are each independently hydrogen, low alkyl and other groups. Revesz et al. ( Tetrahedron Lett. 35, 9693-9696, 1994) reported the preparation of ethyl ester tripeptide: as a prodrug of the corresponding acid which is a potent ICE inhibitor. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to dipeptides of formula I: wherein R 1 is an N-terminal protecting group; AA is a residue of any natural or non-natural -amino acid, -amino acid, derivatives of an -amino acid or -amino acid; R 2 is H or CH 2 R 4 where R 4 is an electronegative leaving group, and R 3 is alkyl or H, provided that AA is not His, Tyr, Pro or Phe. The invention relates to the discovery that the dipeptide-based caspase inhibitors represented by Formula I, though less potent in enzyme assays than tri- and tetrapeptide inhibitors on the enzymes, are surprisingly potent inhibitors of apoptosis in cell based systems. These compounds are systemically active in vivo and are potent inhibitors of antiFas-induced lethality in a mouse liver apoptosis model and have robust neuroprotective effects in a rat model of ischemic stroke. The invention also relates to the use of the dipeptides of the invention for reducing, preventing or treating maladies in which apoptotic cell death is either a causative factor or a result. Examples of uses for the present invention include protecting the nervous system following focal ischemia and global ischemia; treating neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease, Huntingtons Disease, prion diseases, Parkinsons Disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ataxia, telangiectasia, and spinobulbar atrophy; treating heart disease including myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy; treating retinal disorders; treating autoimmune disorders including lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, type I diabetes, Sjgrens syndrome and glomerulonephritis; treating polycystic kidney disease and anemia/erythropoiesis; treating immune system disorders, including AIDS and SCIDS; reducing or preventing cell, tissue and organ damage during transplantation; reducing or preventing cell line death in industrial biotechnology; reducing or preventing alopecia (hair loss); and reducing the premature death of skin cells. The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of Formula I in an effective amount to reduce apoptotic cell death in an animal. The present invention also provides preservation or storage solutions for mammalian organs or tissue, or growth media for mammalian or yeast cells, wherein an effective amount of a compound of Formula I is included in said solutions or media in order to reduce apoptotic cell death in said organs, tissue or cells.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The inhibitors of apoptotic cell death of the present invention are compounds having the general Formula I: or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof, wherein: R 1 is an N-terminal protecting group including t-butyloxycarbonyl, acetyl, and benzyloxycarbonyl; AA is a residue of any natural or non-natural -amino acid, or -amino acid, or a derivative of an -amino acid or -amino acid, e.g. Gly, Thr, Glu, Lys, Arg, Ser, Asn, Gln, Val, Ala, Leu, Ile, Met, and -amino acids such as -Ala, and which is not His, Tyr, Pro or Phe; R 2 is H or CH 2 R 4 , R 4 is an electronegative leaving group such as F, Cl, TsO-, MeO-, ArO-, ArCOO, ArN-, and ArS-; and R 3 is alkyl or H. With respect to R 3 , preferred alkyl groups are C 1-6 alkyl groups, e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, pentyl and hexyl groups. The invention relates to the discovery that the dipeptide-based caspase inhibitors represented by Formula I, though less potent than tri- and tetrapeptide inhibitors on the enzymes, are surprisingly potent inhibitors of apoptosis in cell based systems. These compounds are systemically active in vivo and are potent inhibitors of antiFas-induced lethality in a mouse liver apoptosis model and have robust neuroprotective effects in a rat model of ischemic stroke. These inhibitors will slow or block cell death in a variety of clinical conditions and industrial applications in which the loss of cells, tissues or entire organs occurs. Therefore, the invention is also related to methods of treating, preventing or reducing conditions in which apoptosis plays a role. These conditions are more fully described below. The methods comprise administering to an animal in need of such treatment an inhibitor of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, in an amount effective to inhibit apoptotic cell death. Preferred embodiments of the compounds that may be employed as inhibitors of apoptosis are represented by Formula II: or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof wherein AA, R 1 and R 3 are as defined previously with respect to Formula I. Preferred R 1 is t-butyloxycarbonyl, acetyl and benzyloxycarbonyl. Preferred R 3 is H, Me, Et or t-Bu. Preferred AA is Val, Ala, Leu, Ile, Met, and -amino acids such as -Ala. Exemplary preferred inhibitors of apoptosis having Formula I include, without limitation: Boc-Ala-Asp-CH 2 F, Boc-Val-Asp-CH 2 F, Boc-Leu-Asp-CH 2 F, Ac-Val-Asp-CH 2 F, Ac-Ile-Asp-CH 2 F, Ac-Met-Asp-CH 2 F, Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F, Cbz--Ala-Asp-CH 2 F Cbz-Leu-Asp-CH 2 F, Cbz-Ile-Asp-CH 2 F, Boc-Ala-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F, Boc-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F, Boc-Leu-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F, Ac-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F, Ac-Ile-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F, Ac-Met-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F, Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F, Cbz--Ala-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F Cbz-Leu-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F, and Cbz-Ile-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F. Certain of the compounds of the present invention may exist as stereoisomers including optical isomers. The invention includes all stereoisomers and both the racemic mixtures of such stereoisomers as well as the individual enantiomers that may be separated according to methods that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts include inorganic and organic acid addition salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, sulphate, citrate, lactate, tartrate, maleate, fumarate, mandelate and oxalate. Examples of prodrugs include compounds of Formula I-II wherein R 3 is an alkyl group or substituted alkyl group such as CH 2 OCH 3 . Further, in the cases where AA contains a carboxylic acid group, examples of prodrugs of formula I-II wherein R 3 is H includes compounds in which either or both carboxyl groups are esterified (e.g. with a C 1-6 alcohol) or are in the form of the corresponding amides (e.g. with a C 1-6 amine). The invention is also directed to a method for treating disorders responsive to the inhibition of apoptosis in animals suffering thereof. Particular preferred embodiments of compounds for use in the method of this invention are represented by previously defined Formula II. The compounds of this invention may be prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. Specifically, compounds with Formulae I-II can be prepared as illustrated by exemplary reactions in Scheme 1. The intermediate 1 was prepared according to Revesz et al. ( Tetrahedron Lett. 35, 9693-9696, 1994). Coupling of 1 with a N-protected amino acid such as Z-Val-OH gave amide 2 which was oxidized by Dess-Martin reagent according to Revesz et al. ( Tetrahedron Lett. 35, 9693-9696, 1994) to give 3 as a mixture of diasteriomers. Acid catalyzed cleavage of the ester gave the free acid 4 which was converted to ester 5. An important aspect of the present invention is the discovery that compounds having Formulae I-II are potent inhibitors of apoptosis. Therefore, these inhibitors are expected to slow or block cell death in a variety of clinical conditions in which the loss of cells, tissues or entire organs occurs. The cell death inhibitors of the present invention can be used to reduce or prevent cell death in the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system) under various conditions of ischemia and excitotoxicity, including, but not limited to, focal ischemia due to stroke and global ischemia due to cardiac arrest, as well as spinal cord injury (Emery et al. J. Neurosurgery, 89: 911-920 (1998)). One particular usage is to treat the effects of oxygen deprivation which can occur during the birth of infants in high-risk labors. The cell death inhibitors can also be used to reduce or prevent cell death in the nervous system due to traumatic injury (such as head trauma), viral infection or radiation-induced nerve cell death (for example, as a side-effect of cancer radiotherapy). The cell death inhibitors can also be used to reduce or prevent cell death in a range of neurodegenerative disorders, including but not limited to Alzheimers disease (Mattson et al. Brain Res. 807: 167-176 (1998)), Huntingtons Disease, Parkinsons Disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinobulbar atrophy. The in vivo neuroprotective properties of cell death inhibitors of the invention can be tested in a rat transient focal brain ischemia model (Xue et al., Stroke 21: 166 (1990)). The cell death inhibitors of the invention can be used to reduce or prevent cell death in any condition which potentially results in the death of cardiac muscle (Black et al., J. Mol. Cel. Card. 30: 733-742 (1998) and Maulik et al. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 24: 869-875 (1998)). This includes myocardial infarction due to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy. One particular application is to reduce or prevent myocardial cell death as occurs in certain viral infections of the heart. The in vivo activity of the cell death inhibitors of the invention can be tested using the mouse liver apoptosis model described by Rodriguez et al. (Rodriguez et al., J. Exp. Med., 184:2067-2072 (1996)). In this model, mice are treated intravenously (IV) with an antiFas antibody which induces massive apoptosis in the liver and other organs, leading to generalized organ failure and death. This model is useful for indirectly testing the systemic bioavailability of the cell death inhibitors of the invention, as well as their in vivo anti-apoptotic properties. The cell death inhibitors of the invention therefore can be used to reduce or prevent apoptosis of liver cells (Jones et al. Hepatology 27: 1632-42 (1998)) such as in sepsis (Jaeschke et al. J. Immunol. 160: 3480-3486 (1998)) and hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) (Kubo et al. Prov. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 95: 9552-9557 (1998). The cell death inhibitors of the invention also can be used to treat hepatitis (Suzuki, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 217: 450-454 (1998)). The cell death inhibitors of the invention can be used to reduce or prevent cell death of retinal neurons (Kermer et al. J. Neurosci. 18: 4656-4662 (1998) and Miller et al. Am. J. Vet. Res. 59: 149-152 (1998)) as can occur in disorders which increase intraocular pressure (such as glaucoma) or retinal disorders associated with the aging process (such as age-related macular degeneration). The inhibitors can also be used to treat hereditary degenerative disorders of the retina, such as retinitis pigmentosa. The cell death inhibitors of the invention can also be used to reduce or prevent cell death in the kidney. This includes renal amyloidosis (Hiraoka et al. Nippon Jinzo Gakkai Shi, 40: 276-83 (1998)), acute renal failure (Lieberthal et al. Semin Nephrol. 18: 505-518 (1998)), murine tubular epithelial cell death induced by cyclosporine A (Ortiz et al. Kidney International Supp. 68: S25-S29 (1998)) and HIV-induced nephropathy (Conaldi et al. J. Clin. Invest. 102. 2041-2049 (1998)). The cell death inhibitors of the invention can also be used to reduce or prevent cell death of buccal mucosa due to chronic alcohol ingestion (Slomiany et al. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 45: 1199-1209 (1998)). The cell death inhibitors of the invention can also be used to reduce or prevent cell death in plants (Richberg et al. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1: 480-485 (1998)), such as plant cell death due to pathogens (Pozo et al. Curr. Biol. 8: 1129-1132 (1998) and Greenberg et al. Cell, 77: 551-563 (1994)). The cell death inhibitors of the invention can also be used to reduce or prevent cell death due to radiation and ultraviolet-irradiation (Sheikh et al. Oncogene, 17: 2555-2563 (1998)). The cell death inhibitors of the invention can also be used to reduce or prevent apoptotic death of bone marrow cells in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (Mundle et al., Am. J. Hematol. 60: 36-47 (1999)). The cell death inhibitors of the invention can also be used to reduce or prevent premature death of cells of the immune system, and are particularly useful in treating immune deficiency disorders, such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe combined immune deficiency syndrome (SCIDS) and related diseases. The cell death inhibitors can also be used to treat radiation-induced immune suppression. Transplantation of human organs and tissues is a common treatment for organ failure. However, during the transplantation process, the donor organ or tissue is at risk for cell death since it is deprived of its normal blood supply prior to being implanted in the host. This ischemic state can be treated with cell death inhibitors by infusion into the donor organ or tissue, or by direct addition of the cell death inhibitors to the organ/tissue storage medium. Cell death inhibitors may also be used to reduce or prevent cell death in the donor organ/tissue after it has been transplanted to protect it from the effects of host immune cells which kill their targets by triggering apoptosis. The cytoprotective effects of cell death inhibitors can also be used to prevent the death of human or animal sperm and eggs used in in vitro fertilization procedures. These inhibitors can be used during the harvesting process and can also be included in the storage medium. Mammalian cell lines and yeast cells are commonly used to produce large amounts of recombinant proteins (such as antibodies, enzymes or hormones) for industrial or medicinal use. The lifespan of some of these cell lines is limited due to growth conditions, the nature of the recombinant molecule being expressed (some are toxic) and other unknown factors. The lifespans of industrial cell lines can be extended by including these cell death inhibitors in the growth medium in a concentration range of 10-200 mM. The factors governing hair growth and loss are largely unknown. There is some evidence, however, that hair follicle regression (referred to as catagen) may be due at least partially to apoptosis. Therefore, it is contemplated that the cell death inhibitors of the present invention can be used to treat hair loss that occurs due to various conditions, including but not limited to male-pattern baldness, radiation-induced or chemotherapy-induced hair loss, and hair loss due to emotional stress. There is also evidence that apoptosis may play a role in the loss of hair color. Therefore, it is contemplated that the cell death inhibitors of the present invention can also be used in treating or preventing cases of premature graying of the hair. The death of skin epithelial cells can occur after exposure to high levels of radiation, heat or chemicals. It is contemplated that the cell death inhibitors of the present invention can be used to treat, reduce or prevent this type of skin damage. In one particular application, the cell death inhibitors can be applied in an ointment to treat acute over-exposure to the sun and to prevent blistering and peeling of the skin. Goldberg et al. ( Nature Genetics 13: 442-449 (1996)) reported recently that huntingtin, a protein product of Huntingtons disease (HD) gene, can be cleaved by CPP32 but not ICE. The mutation underlying HD is an expansion of a CAG trinucleotide at the 5 end of the HD gene. The trinucleotide expansion exceeding 36 repeats is associated with the clinical presentation of HD. The CAG expansion promotes cleavage of huntingtin by CPP32, thus links the role of CPP32 in the apoptotic cell death in HD. Compounds of the present invention with CPP32 inhibiting activity will be useful in blocking CPP32 induced apoptotic cell death, thus in preventing and treating HD and other disorders characterized by expansion of trinucleotide repeats such as myotonic dystrophy, fragile X mental retardation, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, spinocerebellar atoxia type I and Dentato-Rubro pallidoluysian atrophy. Compositions within the scope of this invention include all compositions wherein the compounds of the present invention are contained in an amount which is effective to achieve its intended purpose. While individual needs vary, determination of optimal ranges of effective amounts of each component is with the skill of the art. Typically, the compounds may be administered to mammals, e.g. humans, orally at a dose of 0.0025 to 50 mg/kg, or an equivalent amount of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, per day of the body weight of the mammal being treated for apoptosis-mediated disorders, e.g., neuronal cell death, heart disease, retinal disorders, polycystic kidney disease, and immune system disorders. Preferably, about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg is orally administered to treat or prevent such disorders. For intramuscular injection, the dose is generally about one-half of the oral dose. For example, for treatment or prevention of neuronal cell death, a suitable intramuscular dose would be about 0.0025 to about 15 mg/kg, and most preferably, from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg. The unit oral dose may comprise from about 0.01 to about 50 mg, preferably about 0.1 to about 10 mg of the compound. The unit dose may be administered one or more times daily as one or more tablets each containing from about 0.1 to about 10, conveniently about 0.25 to 50 mg of the compound or its solvates. In addition to administering the compound as a raw chemical, the compounds of the invention may be administered as part of a pharmaceutical preparation containing suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Preferably, the preparations, particularly those preparations which can be administered orally and which can be used for the preferred type of administration, such as tablets, dragees, and capsules, and also preparations which can be administered rectally, such as suppositories, as well as suitable solutions for administration by injection or orally, contain from about 0.01 to 99 percent, preferably from about 0.25 to 75 percent of active compound(s), together with the excipient. Also included within the scope of the present invention are the non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the present invention. Acid addition salts are formed by mixing a solution of the particular cell death inhibitors of the present invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acid such as hydrochloric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid, phosphoric acid, oxalic acid, and the like. Basic salts are formed by mixing a solution of the particular cell death inhibitors of the present invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, choline hydroxide, sodium carbonate and the like. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered to any animal which may experience the beneficial effects of the compounds of the invention. Foremost among such animals are mammals, e.g., humans, although the invention is not intended to be so limited. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered by any means that achieve their intended purpose. For example, administration may be by parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, transdermal, buccal, intrathecal or intracranial routes. Alternatively, or concurrently, administration may be by the oral route. The dosage administered will be dependent upon the age, health, and weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment, and the nature of the effect desired. The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention are manufactured in a manner which is itself known, for example, by means of conventional mixing, granulating, dragee-making, dissolving, or lyophilizing processes. Thus, pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compounds with solid excipients, optionally grinding the resulting mixture and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired or necessary, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as saccharides, for example lactose or sucrose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and/or calcium phosphates, for example tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, as well as binders such as starch paste, using, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinyl pyrrolidone. If desired, disintegrating agents may be added such as the above-mentioned starches and also carboxymethyl-starch, cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. Auxiliaries are, above all, flow-regulating agents and lubricants, for example, silica, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium stearate or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings which, if desired, are resistant to gastric juices. For this purpose, concentrated saccharide solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. In order to produce coatings resistant to gastric juices, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropymethyl-cellulose phthalate, are used. Dye stuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings, for example, for identification or in order to characterize combinations of active compound doses. Other pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active compounds in the form of granules which may be mixed with fillers such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds are preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, or liquid paraffin. In addition, stabilizers may be added. Possible pharmaceutical preparations which can be used rectally include, for example, suppositories, which consist of a combination of one or more of the active compounds with a suppository base. Suitable suppository bases are, for example, natural or synthetic triglycerides, or paraffin hydrocarbons. In addition, it is also possible to use gelatin rectal capsules which consist of a combination of the active compounds with a base. Possible base materials include, for example, liquid triglycerides, polyethylene glycols, or paraffin hydrocarbons. Suitable formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form, for example, water-soluble soluble salts and alkaline solutions. Buffers such as Tris may be present. In addition, suspensions of the active compounds as appropriate oily injection suspensions may be administered. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils, for example, sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for example, ethyl oleate or triglycerides or polyethylene glycol-400 (the compounds are soluble in PEG-400). Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension include, for example, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, and/or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain stabilizers. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, compounds of the invention are employed in topical and parenteral formulations and are used for the treatment of skin damage, such as that caused by exposure to high levels of radiation, including ultraviolet radiation, heat or chemicals. One or more additional substances which have therapeutic effects on the skin may also be incorporated in the compositions. Thus, the composition may also contain one or more compounds capable of increasing cyclic-AMP levels in the skin. Suitable compounds include adenosine or a nucleic acid hydrolysate in an amount of about 0.1-1% and papaverine, in an amount of about 0.5-5%, both by weight based on the weight of the composition. Also suitable are -adrenergic agonists such as isoproterenol, in an amount of about 0.1-2% or cyclic-AMP, in an amount of about 0.1-1%, again both by weight based on the weight of the composition. Other suitable types of additional active ingredients which may be incorporated in the compositions of this invention include any compounds known to have a beneficial effect on skin. Such compounds include retinoids such as Vitamin A, in an amount of about 0.003-0.3% by weight and chromanols such as Vitamin E or a derivative thereof in an amount of about 0.1-10% by weight, both based on the weight of the composition. Additionally, anti-inflammatory agents and keratoplastic agents may be incorporated in the cosmetic composition. A typical anti-inflammatory agent is a corticosteroid such as hydrocortisone or its acetate in an amount of about 0.25-5% by weight, or a corticosteroid such as dexamethasone in an amount of about 0.025-0.5% by weight, both based on the weight of the composition. A typical keratoplastic agent is coal tar in an amount of about 0.1-20% or anthralin in an amount of about 0.05-2% by weight, both based on the weight of the composition. The topical compositions of this invention are formulated preferably as oils, creams, lotions, ointments and the like by choice of appropriate carriers. Suitable carriers include vegetable or mineral oils, white petrolatum (white soft paraffin), branched chain fats or oils, animal fats and high molecular weight alcohol (greater than C 12 ). The preferred carriers are those in which the active ingredient is soluble. Emulsifiers, stabilizers, humectants and antioxidants may also be included as well as agents imparting color or fragrance, if desired. Additionally, transdermal penetration enhancers can be employed in these topical formulations. Examples of such enhancers can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,989,816 and 4,444,762. Creams are preferably formulated from a mixture of mineral oil, self-emulsifying beeswax and water in which mixture the active ingredient, dissolved in a small amount of an oil such as almond oil, is admixed. A typical example of such a cream is one which includes about 40 parts water, about 20 parts beeswax, about 40 parts mineral oil and about 1 part almond oil. Ointments may be formulated by mixing a solution of the active ingredient in a vegetable oil such as almond oil with warm soft paraffin and allowing the mixture to cool. A typical example of such an ointment is one which includes about 30% almond oil and about 70% white soft paraffin by weight. Lotions may be conveniently prepared by dissolving the active ingredient, in a suitable high molecular weight alcohol such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol. In addition, these compositions may include other medicinal agents, growth factors, wound sealants, carriers, etc., that are known or apparent to those skilled in the art. The compositions of the invention are administered to a warm-blooded animal, such as human, already suffering from a skin damage, such as a burn, in an amount sufficient to allow the healing process to proceed more quickly than if the host were not treated. Amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity of the skin damage and the general state of health of the patient being treated. Maintenance dosages over a prolonged period of time may be adjusted as necessary. For veterinary uses, higher levels may be administered as necessary. In the case of an animal suffering from decreased hair growth, the compositions of the invention are administered in an amount sufficient to increase the rate of hair growth. Amounts effective for this use will depend on the extent of decreased hair growth, and the general state of health of the patient being treated. Maintenance dosages over a prolonged period of time may be adjusted as necessary. For veterinary uses, higher levels may be administered as necessary. When the compounds are to be administered to plants, they may be applied to the leaves and/or stems and/or flowers of the plant, e.g. by spraying. The compounds may be spayed in particulate form or dissolved or suspended in an appropriate carrier, e.g. in water or an oil-water emulsion. The compounds may also be combined with the soil of the plant. In this embodiment, the compounds are taken up by the roots of the plant. The following examples are illustrative, but not limiting, of the method and compositions of the present invention. Other suitable modifications and adaptations of the variety of conditions and parameters normally encountered in clinical therapy and which are obvious to those skilled in the art are within the spirit and scope of the invention.

EXAMPLE 21 Cell Death Assays With HeLa Cells The cytoprotective properties of Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)CH 2 F were tested using HeLa cells challenged with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) and cycloheximide (CHX). This is a well-characterized cell culture model of apoptosis which is commonly used to analyze anti-apoptotic agents. Two types of experiments were performed: a qualitative assessment of cell death by visualization of the cells using phase contrast microscopy; and a quantitative assessment of cell death using the fluorescent dye calcein AM. For photomicroscopy, HeLa cells are seeded in 12-well multidishes at a density of 100,000 cells per well in Minimal Essential Medium containing 2 mM glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. 24 hours later the plating medium is removed and fresh medium is added containing the cytoprotective test compound at various concentrations. The cells are pre-incubated with test compound for 2 hours at 37 C. in a CO 2 incubator and then TNF- and CHX are added at final concentrations of 25 ng/mL and 30 g/mL, respectively. After a 24 hour incubation period, the cells are examined visually for evidence of cell death based on cell shape and degree of adherence. Cells are considered dead if they have become rounded up and phase bright and have detached from the substratum. Cells are considered alive if they have retained their normal morphology and remain attached to the substratum. For quantitative assays, the degree of cell survival in the presence of test compounds is analyzed quantitatively using the indicator dye calcein AM. This dye is taken up and converted to a fluorescent derivative by living cells; the amount of activated dye in each well can then be assayed in a fluorometric plate reader and the degree of fluorescence is used as a measure of the number of surviving cells. For these assays, HeLa cells are seeded in 48-well plates at a density of 25,000 cells per well in 0.4 mL of Minimal Essential Medium containing 2 mM glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. 24 hours later the plating medium is removed and 0.5 mL of fresh medium containing test compound at various concentrations is added. The cells are pre-incubated with test compound for 2 hours at 37 C. in a CO 2 incubator and then TNF- and CHX are added at final concentrations of 25 ng/mL and 30 g/mL, respectively. After a 24 hour incubation period, the cultures are washed twice with serum-free, phenol red-free Hams F12 to remove dead cells and 125 L of Hams F12 containing 8 M calcein AM is added. The cultures are incubated at room temperature for 1 hour and the fluorescent signal is determined with a BioTek plate reader using filter settings of 485 nm (excitation) and 530 nm (emission). The data are expressed as Percent Control, which is calculated by the following equation: Percent Control(Calcein AM Signal in the Presence of Test CompoundTNF- and CHX/(Calcein AM Signal in the Presence of CHX Only)100% The use of CHX-treated cultures as controls, rather than untreated cultures, allows one to correct for the cytostatic effects of CHX. However, because CHX by itself is also a mild inducer of apoptosis in HeLa cells, strong anti-apoptotic drugs will give a Percent Control value greater than 100%. Results from a typical qualitative assay are shown in FIGS. 1A-1G , 2 A- 2 G and 3 A- 3 G. In these experiments the cytoprotective potency of Cbz-Val -Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F is compared to the cytoprotective potency of BOC-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F, Cbz-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F, and Cbz-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (SEQ ID NO:1) at three different concentrations: 0.5, 5 and 50 M. All of these compounds are the methyl ester derivatives. FIGS. 1A-1G shows that, at a concentration of 50 M, Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F ( FIG. 1D ) completely protects HeLa cells from the apoptotic effects of TNF- and CHX. At 50 M, the related peptides BOC-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F ( FIG. 1C ) and Cbz-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F ( FIG. 1E ) are also protective. The CPP32 inhibitor, Cbz-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (SEQ ID NO:1) (FIG. 1 F), is only marginally effective as a cytoprotective agent at 50 M. FIGS. 2A-2G shows that, at a concentration of 5 M, Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F ( FIG. 2D ) still shows surprisingly strong cytoprotective action, while 5 M BOC-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F ( FIG. 2C ) and 5 M Cbz-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F ( FIG. 2E ) are less effective. The CPP32 inhibitor, Cbz-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (SEQ ID NO:1) (FIG. 2 F), has no cytoprotective properties at 5 M. FIGS. 3A-3G shows that, even at 0.5 M, Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F ( FIG. 3D ) is still an effective cytoprotectant, while the other compounds ( FIGS. 3C , 3 E and 3 F) give slight or no cytoprotection. These experiments demonstrate that Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F can protect HeLa cells from TNF-/CHX-induced apoptosis at concentrations 10 to 100 fold lower than other putative anti-apoptotic agents. Quantitative experiments using calcein AM, as described above, corroborate the results obtained by microscopic examination. FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate the results of two such experiments where the cytoprotective properties of Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (a) were compared to BOC-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (b) ( FIG. 5 ) and Cbz-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (SEQ ID NO:1) (c) ( FIG. 4 ) at three concentrations (0.5, 5 and 50 M). FIG. 4 shows that Cbz-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (SEQ ID NO:1) (b) is only minimally effective in protecting HeLa cells from TNF-/CHX, even at the highest concentration used (50 M). FIG. 5 shows that BOC-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (b) is an effective cytoprotectant at 50 and 5 M, but its activity decreases dramatically at 0.5 M. By contrast, Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (a) is as effective a cytoprotectant at 0.5 M as Cbz-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (SEQ ID NO:1) (b) is at 50 M (FIG. 4 ). Furthermore, 0.5 M Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (a) is highly active while 0.5 M BOC-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (b) is inactive (FIG. 5 ). In order to determine the effect of Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F at low doses, HeLa cells were treated with a range of concentrations from 0.05 M to 1 M. As shown in FIG. 6 , Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (a) gave significant protection at concentrations as low as 0.25 M. By contrast, Cbz-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (b), an anti-apoptotic agent widely used in cell death research, shows no cytoprotection in this concentration range. Taken together, the experiments illustrated by FIGS. 1A through 6 show that Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F is a surprisingly potent anti-apoptotic agent in intact cells and is more potent than any other known caspase inhibitor. EXAMPLE 22 Inhibition of PARP Cleavage in Jurkat Cells The cleavage of the enzyme poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP) appears to occur in all cells in which the caspase proteolytic cascade is activated. For this reason, PARP cleavage is widely used as a biochemical marker for caspase-mediated apoptosis. The ability of a cytoprotective drug to block PARP cleavage is considered to be an indication of the drugs ability to inhibit the caspase proteolytic cascade and, in particular, CPP32 (caspase-3), the main PARP protease. The ability of Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F to inhibit PARP cleavage was examined during Fas-mediated apoptosis of Jurkat cells, a human T-cell line. This cell culture model of apoptosis is well-characterized and is known to involve activation of at least two caspases, caspase-3 (CPP32) and caspase-8 (FLICE/MACH). For PARP cleavage assays, Jurkat cells were seeded at a density of 500,000 cells per well in six-well multidishes in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were pre-incubated with Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F or other test compounds for 2 hours at 37 C. in a CO 2 incubator and then a monoclonal antibody to Fas was added at a final concentration of 500 ng/mL. Incubation at 37 C. in a CO 2 incubator was continued for an additional 4 hours. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were harvested by centrifuigation and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA and a cocktail of protease inhibitors. An amount of lysate corresponding to 10 to 20 g of protein was loaded on a 7.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed for 2 to 2.5 hrs at 25 mA. The protein was then transferred to a PVDF membrane, probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to PARP, and visualized using chemiluminescence. FIGS. 7A-7E shows the result of three such experiments. Jurkat cells were pre-incubated with 0.5, 5, or 50 M of the following compounds: Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (compound 1); BOC-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (compound 5); Cbz-Asp--(2,6-dichlorobenzoyloxy-methyl ketone) (compound 6), Cbz-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (compound 3), Cbz-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (SEQ ID NO:1) (compound 2), Cbz-Ile-Glu(OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (SEQ ID NO:1) (compound 4), or Cbz-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (compound 7). The cells were then treated with antiFas and processed for Western Blotting. Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (compound 1) completely inhibited PARP cleavage at 50 and 5 M and afforded significant inhibition of cleavage even at 0.5 M (FIG. 7 A). By contrast, Cbz-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (SEQ ID NO:1) (compound 2) ( FIG. 7A ) and Cbz-Ile-Glu(OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (SEQ ID NO:1) (compound 4) ( FIG. 7C ) and Cbz-Asp-DCB (compound 6) ( FIG. 7D ) inhibited PARP cleavage completely at 50 M, but were only marginally effective inhibitors at 5 M and 0.5 M. BOC-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (compound 5) ( FIG. 7D ) and Cbz-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (compound 7) ( FIG. 7E ) and Cbz-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (compound 3) ( FIG. 7B ) were effective inhibitors of PARP cleavage at concentrations of 50 and 5 M, but were only marginally effective at 0.5 M, a concentration at which Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F (compound 1) still showed significant inhibition (FIG. 7 A). These experiments demonstrate that Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F can block the caspase proteolytic cascade in intact cells at a concentration at least 10-fold lower than other known caspase inhibitors. EXAMPLE 23 Enzyme Activity The activities of Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F and Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F (free acid) as inhibitors of CPP32, ICE and cathepsin B were measured in a fluorometric enzyme assay. Recombinant CPP32 protein and ICE protein were prepared by expressing DNA clones encoding these enzymes in an insect host cell (sf9 cells) using baculovirus as the vector. See, Webb, N. R. et al., Expression of proteins using recombinant Baculovirus, Techniques 2:173-188 (1990). Preparations of native cathepsin were acquired from a commercial source. Enzyme activity was measured using synthetic peptide substrates attached to a fluorogenic leaving group. Cleavage of the synthetic substrate by the enzyme results in a fluorescent signal which is read in a spectrofluorometer or in a fluorometric microtiter plate reader. CPP32 activity was measured using the following buffer conditions: 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, with 10% sucrose, 1% CHAPS, 5 mM glutathione, and 5 M peptide substrate. The peptide substrate consisted of an oligomer with the sequence Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (SEQ ID NO:1) with the fluorogenic compound aminomethylcoumarin conjugated to the C-terminus. The assay for enzyme activity was typically carried out at 37 C. for 30 minutes. Table I lists the IC 50 of Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)-CH 2 F and Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F (free acid) for CPP32 and other proteases. TABLE I Potency of Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)CH 2 F and Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F (free acid) as Inhibitors of CPP32 and Other Proteases Cbz-Val-AspCH 2 F (free Cbz-Val-Asp(OMe)CH 2 F acid) Enzyme IC 50 (M) IC 50 (M) CPP32 1.1 0.043 ICE 0.9 0.02 Cathepsin 0.3 10 B Factor Xa 100 100 Thrombin 100 100 The results shown in Table I show that compounds of the present invention are moderately potent inhibitors of CPP32 and ICE. It also shows that Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F is a potent and selective inhibitor for CPP32 and ICE. The inhibitory activity of Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F in recombinant caspase 3, 6, 7 and 8 obtained from PharMington (a Becton division company, San Diego, Calif.) were measured using Ac-DEVD-AMC (SEQ ID NO:1). The amount of each enzyme per assay was as following: 1 ng caspase3, 15 ng caspase6, 2 ng caspase7 and 60 ng caspase8. The enzyme reaction was conducted in 96-well plate using a caspase buffer (20 mM PIPES, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS and 10% sucrose, pH 7.2) and the reaction was initiated by adding 10 M Ac-DEVD-AMC (SEQ ID NO:1) (purchased from Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. Hopkinton, Mass.). Twelve concentrations of Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F ranged from 30 pM to 10 M were tested after incubation of the compound with recombinant caspases for 30 minutes at 37 C. The plate was read with a fluorescence plate reader (EGG WALLAG, model-1420-002) using excitation filter at 355 nm/emission filter at 460 nm. The data was analyzed using GraphPrism software. The data is summarized in Table II.

Table III shows the caspase-3 activity of various dipeptide inhibitors. The results show that Z-Val-Asp-CH 2 F is the most potent caspase-3 inhibitor among the compounds tested.

The ability of an anti-apoptotic compound to block PARP cleavage is therefore a useful indicator of its ability to inhibit apoptosis. The potency of Z-VD-fmk in a PARP cleavage assay was tested using antiFas-treated Jurkat cells. 210 6 Jurkat cells were seeded in each well of a 6-well dish and pre-incubated with test compounds for 30 minutes. The cells were then challenged with 500 ng/mL of an agonistic antiFas antibody or PBS for 4 hours. The cells were then harvested, pelleted gently, washed two times with PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer. Aliquots of the lysate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes for Western blotting. The primary antibody was a polyclonal antiPARP serum which cross-reacts with both full-length PARP and the caspase-3-generated cleavage product. FIG. 8A shows that Z-VD-fmk completely inhibits PARP cleavage at concentrations of 500 and 250 nM (note absence of the 85 kDa band). Z-VD-fmk still retains much of its inhibitory activity even at concentrations as low as 50 nM (FIG. 8 A). By contrast, Z-VAD-fmk, although an effective inhibitor of PARP cleavage at 5 M (data not shown), is much less effective at 500 nM (FIG. 8 B). These experiments show that Z-VD-fmk is at least 10-fold more potent as an inhibitor of PARP cleavage in intact cells than is Z-VAD-fmk and Z-VD-fmk has an IC 50 value of less than 50 nM in this model of whole-cell apoptosis. EXAMPLE 25 Effect of Z-VD-fmk on TNF--Induced Cell Death Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) can trigger apoptosis in a number of cell types by initiating the caspase cascade and its apoptosis inducing activity can be inhibited by peptide-based caspase inhibitors. However, high concentrations of the inhibitors (50 M or greater) is required to have good anti-apoptotic effect. HeLa cells, a cell line commonly employed in TNF-cell death studies, was used here to determine the anti-apoptotic potency of Z-VD-fmk. HeLa cells were seeded in 48-well multidishes at a density of 50,000 cells per well 24 hours before treatment. They were then pre-incubated with varying concentrations of Z-VD-fmk for 2 hours and challenged with TNF-(25 ng/mL) a nd cycloheximide (CHX; 30 g/mL). The cultures were incubated for an additional 24 hours and dead cells were removed by two washes with PBS. The density of surviving cells was then measured by incubating each culture for 45 minutes with calcein AM, a profluorescent dye which is taken up by living cells and converted to a fluorescent product. The resulting data were expressed as % control values (control values were cells incubated with cycloheximide but without TNF-). FIG. 9 shows the results of Z-VD-fmk with tested concentrations ranging from zero to 500 nM. Z-VD-fmk provided good cytoprotection at concentrations approaching 100 nM. By contrast, Z-VAD-fmk loses much of its cytoprotective properties below 1 M (data not shown). Tetrapeptide inhibitors, such as Z-DEVD-fmk (SEQ ID NO:1) and Ac-DEVD-CHO (SEQ ID NO:1), are very ineffective below 50 M (data not shown). Therefore Z-VD-fmk not only inhibits PARP cleavage at sub-micromolar concentrations (see Example 24), but also inhibits cell death at sub-micromolar concentrations, and is much more effective than known tripeptide and tetrapeptide inhibitors. EXAMPLE 26 Effect of Z-VD-fmk on DNA Laddering In the later stages of apoptosis, cells begin to literally fall apart as pieces of the cytoplasm are shed (through blebbing) and the nucleus is disassembled. One of the hallmarks of nuclear disassembly is the cleavage of genomic DNA into nucleosome-sized fragments (termed DNA laddering). DNA laddering, like other late stage apoptotic events, is considered to be irreversible, so it is important to determine whether an anti-apoptotic drug can prevent its occurrence. The ability of Z-VD-fmk to block DNA laddering was tested using antiFas-treated Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells were plated in 60 mm dishes at a density of 510 6 cells and pre-incubated with varying concentrations of Z-VD -fmk. They were then challenged with antiFas at 100 ng/mL for 4 hours, harvested, and pelleted and washed with PBS twice. Genomic DNA was isolated using the method of Eldadah et al. (1996). Briefly, the cells were lysed in 2 mL of 7M guanidine HCl and mixed with 1 mL of Wizard miniprep DNA purification resin (Promega). The resin/DNA complex was washed twice with buffer and the DNA was eluted in TE. 1 to 2 g of this DNA sample was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose/TBE gel and the gel was stained with ethidium bromide. FIG. 10 shows the results of a DNA laddering assay in which the cells were pre-incubated with Z-VD-fmk or drug vehicle (DMSO). Vehicle treated cells which were challenged with antiFas show a characteristic laddering pattern of DNA extending down to about 300 bp. By contrast, Z-VD-fmk inhibits ladder formation at a dose as low as that of 50 nM. This result shows that Z-VD-fmk can block a critical late-stage apoptotic event (DNA laddering) at sub-micromolar concentrations comparable to those concentrations which block cell death and PARP cleavage. Based on this experiment and the data described in Examples 24 and 25, it is concluded that Z-VAD-fmk is a highly effective, sub-micromolar apoptotic inhibitor in whole-cell model of apoptosis. EXAMPLE 27 Anti-Apoptotic Activity of Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F in the Mouse Liver Apoptosis Model Three to four week old female mice were used in the studies. Liver degeneration was induced by intravenous injection with 2-6 g of a purified hamster anti-mouse Fas monoclonal antibody (clone Jo2, Pharmingen) against mouse Fas antigen diluted in 80 l of phosphate buffered physiological saline (Rodriguez, et al., 1996). Mortality was used as the end point to assess liver degeneration. Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F was formulated in Tris buffer for intravenous infusion and tested at a dose of 1-10 mg/kg given IV via the tail vein. Ten minutes later, animals were injected with Fas antibody. Mortality was counted at 30 mins, 1, 3 and 24 h. For each compound there were groups of control animals that receive Fas antibody only. Those receiving the highest dose was observed for acute behavioral effects (e.g. sedation, locomoter activity, changes in gait, convulsions, straub tail, tremor etc.), and then housed overnight and checked the next day for toxicity/mortality. In these experiments, Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F was a surprisingly potent inhibitor of antiFas-induced lethality. A single 1 mg/kg IV dose completely protected mice from antiFas up to 1 h after antibody administration, and dose as low as 0.25 mg/kg was found to still give almost 100% protection. By contrast, in vehicle control groups all the mice were dead at this time-point. Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F also showed substantial protection up to 24 h (28% survival). Separate studies showed that the protection against lethality was associated with the predicted attenuation in the induction of the liver enzymes SPGT and SGOT. These data demonstrates that Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F is highly active in vivo following systemic administration in the mouse liver apoptosis model. EXAMPLE 28 Neuroprotection of Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F in Rat Model of Focal Ischemia (i) Preparative Surgery: Male Fischer-344 rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Calif.) weighing 200-240 g, were used. Animals were initially anesthetized with 3% halothane in a mixture of 30% oxygen and 70% air. Halothane level were reduced to 1.5% for maintenance of anesthesia throughout surgery. Preparative surgery includes: (a) Intravenous catheter implantation: the left femoral vein were exposed and a Teleflex catheter, filled with vehicle, were inserted up to the inferior vena cava, for subsequent drug administration. (b) Arterial catheter implantation: the femoral artery were cannulated to allow monitoring of the blood pressure, and other physiological conditions include PO 2 , pCO 2 , pH, glucose, hematocrite, during ischemia, initial drug administration, and the time of arterial reperfusion. Both arterial and venous catheters were exteriorized through the back of the animal, to allow free movement. (c) A PhysioTel Transmitter (Data Sciences International, Michigan) were implanted into the peritoneal cavity to remotely monitor the body temperature of the animals for 22 hours. (ii) Physiological parameters: Core body temperature was maintained at 37.5 C. during surgery, using a YSI Reusable Temperature Probe (YSI Co. Inc., Yellow Spring, Ohio) connected to a YSI Temperature Control Unit (Model 73A, YSI Co. Inc., Ohio) and a Electric Heating Pad (Model 756, Sunbean-Oster Co. Inc., Hattiesburg, Miss.). Following ischemia, the PhysioTel Transmitter was activated and core body temperature was recorded every 5 minutes. Systemic blood pressure was monitored throughout surgery, during intravenous drug infusion (bolus), and 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the onset of ischemia. Other physiological conditions, including PO 2 , pCO 2 , pH, glucose, and hematocrite were examined at the time of arterial occlusion and reperfusion. (iii) Transient focal ischemia model: Following preparative surgery, a ventral midline cervical incision was made to expose both CCAs. The right CCA was permanently ligated with 4-o silk ligature, while the left CCA was clamped with an atraumatic aneurysm clip. A 1-cm incision perpendicular to and bisecting a line between the lateral canthus of the right eye and the external auditory canal was made. The underlying temporalis muscle was excised and retracted and under direct visualization with the aid of a dissecting microscope (Model SZ-STB1, Olympus, Japan), the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was exposed through a 2 mm burr hole drilled 2-3 mm rostral to the fusion of the zygomatic arch and the squamosal bone. Drilling was done under a continuous irrigation of physiological saline. The dura was cut and retracted to expose the MCA in the rhinal fissure. A Codman micro-aneurysm clip (No.1) was used to temporarily occlude the MCA as it crosses the rhinal fissure. Flow interruption was verified with dissecting microscopic. Incisions were closed with surgical clips, anesthesia was discontinued, and the animals were returned to their cages after waking up (within minutes). Rats subject to transient ischemia weree reanesthetized after a 2.5 hours after MCA occlusion. After verification of MCA occlusion, the clips on the MCA and left CCA were removed and restoration of blood flow in the MCA confirmed visually. The incision was closed, and rats were returned to their cages. Animals requiring short term recovery were allowed to survive for 24 hours. All animals were deeply anesthetized prior to sacrifice. Brains was removed, and 2 mm coronal sections were sliced and placed in TTC. Infarcted tissue appeared pale, and distinguishable from adjacent viable tissue. The areas of cortical and subcortical infarction were measured blindly with imaging processing software, and the volume of infarction was calculated by adding up individual measures with known thickness. (iv) Statistical Analysis: All physiological parameters, temperature recordings, and the volumes of cortical infarction were compared statistically among experimental and control groups, for each sub-set of animals. Statistical analyses were conducted using Sigmastat software (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, Calif.). Students t tests were used for unpaired data and ANOVA for multiple comparisons. A p value of 0.05 was considered significant. Graphs were prepared on SigmaPlot 2.01 software (Jandel Scientific). The in vivo neuroprotective properties of Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F were tested in two stroke studies in the rat (Fischer-344) transient focal ischemia model. Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F was given as a 20 mg/kg IV bolus 10 minutes after the onset of ischemia, followed by a continuous IV infusion of 5 mg/kg/hr. In Experiment 1, the continuous infusion was given for 6 h. In Experiment 2, the infusion was extended to 12 h. Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F was found to significantly reduce cortical infarction in both studies: 46% (p0.05) in Experiment 1 and 57% (p0.05) in Experiment 2 (FIGS. 1 A and 1 B). There were no changes in blood pressure, blood gas, or temperature following drug administration. These results demonstrated that Cbz-Val-Asp-CH 2 F is well tolerated following acute IV dosing and is a potent neuroprotectant in a rat model of transient focal cerebral ischemia.

This application is a 371 of PCT/GB97/03203 filed Nov. 21, 1997 now WO 98/22479 May 28, 1998. This invention relates to certain amide derivatives of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), particularly amide derivatives their uses particularly in preventing ischemic damage to cells, and a method of synthesis for certain amide derivatives and for PEP. An ischaemic insult results when the blood flow to an organ of the body is insufficient relative to local needs, such that the resulting oxygen supply is greatly reduced. This can result in ischemic damage to the cells and, if the ischaemia is prolonged, to the eventual death of the organ. Ischemia is usually the result of a disease of the blood vessels, such as the arteries supplying the heart, but is also induced during cardiac surgery, involving coronary artery bypass grafting or valve replacements and also transplant operations, typically heart transplants. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is a glycolytic substrate which combines with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to form pyruvate and adenosine-5-triphosphate acid (ATP), catalysed by the enzyme pyruvate kinase. It is an exergonic reaction which is irreversible under intracellular conditions, requiring Mg as a cofactor and an alkali-metal cation (e.g. K) as a physiological activator. The enzyme is activated by increases in glycolytic intermediates such as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate or PEP, or by low ATP concentrations, and is inhibited by high ATP concentrations or when aerobic metabolites such as fatty acids or acetyl CoA are available. WO83/02391 relates to a pharmaceutical composition for parental administration for preventing and treating ischemic cell damage which comprises a water soluble salt of PEP and a water soluble salt of ATP. Areas of application for the PEP/ATP composition are given as a perfusion and preservation solution for use in open heart surgery and other organ transplants, and for treating ischemic brain and heart damage as a result of heart failure, drowning or drug overdose. Other scientific publications reporting on the PEP/ATP composition by the same inventors are: Eur. Surg. Res. 15: 200-207 (1983); Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surgeon 34: 104-109, (1986); and Scand. J. Thor. Cardiovasc. Surg. 21: 245-249, (1987). In these papers it is reported that the combination of PEP and ATP in a cardioplegic solution provides better post-ischemic recovery of function (in rat hearts) than PEP alone, but is no better than ATP alone. In J. Reconstructive Microsurgery Vol. 11, no. 6 (November 1995) a PEP/ATP infusion was found to reduce ischemiarepurfusion injury in rabbit skeletal muscle. In another investigation (British J. Plastic Surgery; 42; 675-681 (1989)) it was found that a composition of PEP and ATP or the free radical scavenger SOD, may be useful in the clinical treatment of failing ischemic skin flaps. PEP has also been suggested to have applications in other areas. Thus, it may be useful in the treatment of physical or mental fatigue (FR-A-3246) in circulatory insufficiencies, as an anticalculus agent (U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,675), as a cosmetic agent in skin preparations, as an anti-tumour agent, and as an agent to enhance the viability of stored blood (EP-A-275198). In Biochemistry, vol. 11, no. 3 (1972), p338-345, various derivatives of PEP were synthesised and tested as a potential substrate for pyruvate kinase and for enolase. Among the derivatives tested was the dicyclohexylammonium (CHA) salt of -(Dihydroxyphosphinyloxy)acrylamide, i.e. CH 2 CC(O)NH 2 OP(O)(OH) 2 :2CHA, but it was found that this salt was neither a pseudosubstrate for pyruvate kinase nor a very good competitive inhibitor with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate in the (tested) pyruvate kinase reaction. The synthesis for the dicyclohexylammonium salt as above was given on page 340. The synthetic method used was as follows: CH 2 CHCN---(H 2 O 2 /NaOH)--CH 2 -CHC(O)NH 2 --(HBr)--BrCH 2 CH(OH)C(O)NH 2 ---(CrO 3 )---BrCH 2 C(O)C(O)NH 2 --(P(OCH 2 Ph) 3 )--CH 2 CC(O)NH 2 OP (OCH 2 Ph) 2 ---(1.H 2 /Pd; 2.2CHA)---CH 2 CC(O)NH 2 OP(O)(OH) 2 *2CHA i.e. PEP-amide*2CHA (CHAcyclohexylamine: C 6 H 11 NH 2 ) the actual structure being a salt. The following other amide derivatives of PEP have been disclosed: CH 2 CC(O)OHNHP(O) (OH) 2 , Biorganic and Medical Chemistry Letters, no. 3, no. 8, p1615-1618 (1993) (Shani et al); CH 2 CC(O)OEtOP(O) (NMe 2 ) 2 , CH 2 CC(O)OEtOP(O)MeNMe 2 CH 2 CC(O)OEtOP(O)OMeNMe 2 ; Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 31, no. 8, p4471 (1990) (Despax et al); CH 2 COP(OH)(OEt)HC(O)NHR 1 where R 1 Pr or Ph, J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 106, p4017-4020 (1984) (Kluger et al). There are various syntheses of PEP given in the prior art, such as given in WO83/02391 (see above), and Russian patent no. 2043358 (application no. 92008062/04). In this latter synthesis PEP is formed by oxidative halophosphorylation of a derivative of propenoic acid with PCl 3 /O 2 , followed by dehalogenation of the product then hydrolysis to PEP. We have now found analogues of PEP as shown in Figure (1) below which have good pharmacological activity; particularly for the prophylaxis or treatment of conditions associated with ischemia: wherein Zrepresents O Yrepresents NR 1 R 2 wherein R 1 and R 2 are independently H, alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy (except where applied to OR 1 ) cycloalkyl, aryl, or aralkyl Z 1 and Z 2 are independently OR 1 and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of formula 1 and salts thereof are hereinafter compounds of the invention. A preferred group of compounds are those of formula (2) wherein R 1 and R 2 are as defined for formula (1). The more preferred group of compounds within formula (2) is where R 1 and R 2 are independently H or lower (i.e., C 1-5 ) alkyl, such as where R 1 is H and R 2 is methyl, R 1 is H and R 2 is ethyl, or where R 1 and R 2 are both methyl or ethyl. The most preferred compound is the primary amide of formula (2) (i.e. where R 1 and R 2 are both H) and salts thereof, particularly the potassium salt, such as the monopotassium salt. The IUPAC name compound is: 2-(dihydroxyphosphoryloxy)prop-2-enoic amide (otherwise known as pyruvic amide enol phosphate). The structure of this compound is shown in formula 3 and hereafter is referred to as the compound of formula 3 or compound 3. By alkyl we include straight and branched chain alkyl groups and the term lower alkyl covers straight and branched alkyl groups having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, and hexyl. Alkenyl refers to an unsaturated or partially saturated hydrocarbon group containing from 2 to 7 carbon atoms which may be straight or branched. By alkoxy we mean to include alkoxy groups having up to 6 carbon atoms. Cycloalkyl refers to a hydrocarbon ring having up to 7 carbon atoms. Aryl refers to any benzenoid aromatic group but preferably phenyl. Aralkyl refers to an aryl group substituted with one or more alkyl groups. Preferably the compounds of the invention are administered along with ATP, particularly in the treatment of conditions associated with ischemia. Examples of physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (1) and physiologically acceptable derivatives thereof include salts derived from an appropriate base, such as an alkali metal (for example, sodium and potassium), an alkaline earth (for example, magnesium), ammonium and NX 4 (wherein X is C 1-4 alkyl) Physiologically acceptable salts of an amino group include salts of organic carboxylic acids such as acetic, lactic, tartaric, malic, isethionic, lactobionic and succinic acids, organic sulphonic acids, such as methanesulphonic, ethanesulphonic, benzenesulphonic and p-toluenesulphonic acids and inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, sulphuric, phosphoric and sulphamic acids. Physiologically acceptable salts of a compound of a hydroxy group include the anion of said compound in combination with a suitable cation such as NH 4 and NX 4 (wherein X is a C 1-4 alkyl group). Alkali metal salts are particularly preferred salts of the compounds of formula 2, typically the potassium salt. The compounds of the invention act to protect and/or aid the recovery of functionally impaired cells such as cardiac tissue, neuronal tissue, organs for transplantation, skin (e.g. failing ischemic skin flaps) and muscle (e.g. skeletal) tissue whose-viability is threatened by hypoxia. The compounds find particular application in preventing, protecting or treating ischaemic cell damage, ischemia or repurfusion injury, such as by using the compound as cardiodrugs and in cardioplegic solutions for open heart surgery. Generally the compounds can be used to protect or preserve any transplant organ or bodily tissue which is under stress or trauma (such as postoperative stress), particularly for aiding myocardial recovery after ischemia. The compounds of the invention function as above even under hypothermic conditions. Clinical indications which may be treated by the compounds of the invention are myocardial infarction, septic shock, cardiogenic shock (and other manifestations where the heart muscle is depleted of ATP), excision of limbs, indications involving neuronal damage due to cerebral, ischemia and whose damage is due to peripheral vascular ischemia (e.g. as in vascular blockages). For example the compounds of the invention can be used for treating ischemic brain and heart damage as a result of heart failure, drowning or drug overdose. In such cases the invention could be used in the form of an infusion solution for direct infusion (e.g. via catheters) to treat the damaged organ. Another area of application for the compounds of the invention is their use in a perfusion and preservative solution for organs, such as in open heart surgery or organ transplantations. When used in a cardioplegic, perfusion or reperfusion solution for heart surgery, or for organ preservation preferably the concentration of the compounds of the invention (such as the compound of formula 3) is 10 mol/L to 50,000 mol/L, more preferably 50 mol/L to 1000 mol/L. For the compound of formula 3, a concentration of 100 mol/L has been found to be suitable. A further important area of application is for blood storage and regeneration, or for rejunenating red blood cells. Thus whereas blood banks can normally only store blood for about 5 weeks, the compounds of the invention, particularly compound 3, can extend the viable storage life of blood. The compounds would suitably be added to the blood (such as in SAG-M media) at a concentration of 10 to 100 mol/L preferably 15 to 60 mol/L, such as 40 to 60 mol/L. A suitable pH range for blood when including compounds of the invention is pH 5.5 to 6.8, such as 6.1 to 6.5. Early investigations also suggest that the compounds of the invention can be used for cosmetics; as a supplementary drug in tumour treatment; for the treatment of physical and mental fatigue; as an anticalculus or anticaries agent; for the treatment of ageing skin (such as by accelerating keratin turnover); for the treatment of circulatory insufficiencies; as a diagnostic agent for the determination of urea in blood or urine, and for determining cholesterol and triglyceride (U.S. Pat. No. 99,890 incorporated herein by reference); and for enzymatic phosphorylation of natural products such as carbohydrates, glycols, aldehydes, ADP and other nucleotides. In a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for preparing 2-(dihydroxyphosphoryloxy)prop- 2- enoic amide, (i.e. the compound of formula (3) which is a primary amide of PEP) and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof: which comprises hydrolysing a compound of formula (4) wherein Q is halogen to form said amide, of formula (3). Said amide can be converted into phosphoenolpyruvate enzymatically using a deaminase, or by mild hydrolysis such as by mild alkali (e.g. 0.1N sodium hydroxide). and Said amide or said phosphoenolpyruvate can be converted into a salt thereof. The nitrile of formula (4) is an important intermediate and may also be active. It is particularly surprising that the cyano group in formula 4 can be hydrolysed to the amide group. This may be attributed to the participation of the juxtaposed phosphoric acid group which is formed from the dihalide of formula 4 during the initial stages of the hydrolysis. The compounds of formula (4) are prepared by treating a compound of formula (5) with a base The compounds of formula (5) in turn are prepared by oxidative halophophorylation of acrylonitrile (CH 2 CHCN) Suitably the oxidative halophosphorylation is carried out using PCl 3 in the presence of oxygen (gas) or an oxygen donor compound. Thus Q in the above formulae 4 and 5 is preferably chlorine. The base is preferably a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine. In a preferred embodiment 2-(dihydroxyphosphoryloxy)prop-2-enoic amide is prepared by the reaction of phosphorus trichloride and oxygen with acrylonitrile followed by HCl elimination and hydrolysis of the formed compound. The reaction of PCl 3 and oxygen with acrylonitrile is preferably carried out in relative ratio PCl 3 :acrylonitrile1:530 and temperature range from 30 to 50 C. The dehydrohalogenation can be performed with various bases (such as triethylamine and pyridine) in an inert solvent (such as ether, benzene, and carbon tetrachloride). Hydrolysis is carried out by water with or without the presence of an inert solvent (such as ether, benzene, hexane, methylene chloride, or chloroform). When water alone is used, it is best to freeze dry to remove excess water and isolate the product. Secondary and tertiary amides of PEP, typically those of formula 2, can be prepared as follows. 1. Conversion of PEP amide of formula 3, such as by reaction with thionyl chloride to CH 2 COP(O)Cl 2 -C(O)Cl followed by reaction with a primary or secondary amine. 2. Oxidative phosphorylation of acryloylchloride, CH 2 CHC(O)Cl, followed by dehydrohalogenation with a tertiary amine to give the trichloride of (1) above, followed by reaction with a primary or secondary amine. The formulations of the compounds of the inventions include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous and intraarticular), rectal and topical (including dermal, buccal, sublingual and intraocular) administration although the most suitable route may depend upon for example the condition and disorder of the recipient. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association a compound of formula (1) and all salts, esters, amides and physiologically acceptable prodrugs thereof (active ingredient) with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. A typical formulation for the compounds of the invention is a cardioplegic or reperfusion solution, for use in cardiac surgery and transplant operations, and which in addition to a compound of the invention may comprise compounds of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and buffering agents. More specifically the cardioplegic or reperfusion solution may comprise (in addition to a compound of the invention), sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium biphosphate. A formulation used for rejuvenating red blood cells may, in addition to a compound of the invention, contain one or more of sodium or magnesium L-ascorbate phosphate, maltose, mannitol or sucrose, adenine, trisodium citrate, and sodium chloride (to adjust the osmolarity). Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, sachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and nonaqueous sterile suspension which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example saline or water-for-injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with the usual carriers such as cocoa butter or polyethylene glycol. Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccally or sublingually, include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in a base such as gelatine and glycerine or sucrose and acacia. The compounds of the invention may be administered orally or via injection at a dose range for adult humans of from 5 g to 25 g/day, such as about 15 g/day. Tablets or other forms of presentation provided in discrete units may conveniently contain an amount of compound of the invention which is effective at such dosage or as a multiple of the same, for instance, units containing 500 mg, 1 g or 2 g. Further aspects of the invention are as follows. A method for aiding myocardial recovery of a patient after or during an ischemic insult, comprising contacting the cells where ischemia has occurred or will occur by a compound of the invention, particularly a compound of formula 3 and salts thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the compound of the invention are contained in a cardioplegic solution which is used to arrest and support the heart of a patient undergoing heart surgery, such as coronary artery by-pass surgery or valve replacements or heart transplant surgery (or other organ transplant surgery). Thus in a preferred method, a cardioplegic solution of the invention is used to arrest and maintain the heart during surgery, and the heart is then reperfused with a reperfusion solution. Preferably the reperfusion solution also contains a compound of the invention. The invention will now be illustrated by way of the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 2-(dihydroxyphosphoryloxy)prop-2-enoic amide (enol pyruvic amide 2-O-phosphate)compound of Formula 3 Step 1: Synthesis of dichloride of 1-cyano-2chloroethylphosphoric acid through the oxidative halophosphorylation of acrylonitrile A reactor was charged with acrylonitrile (56 g) and phosphorus trichloride (1050 g), and oxygen was bubbled in, whilst stirring vigorously and with cooling to maintain the temperature at 20 C., at the volume rate of 0.01 m 3 /h, until the exothermic reaction was complete. Phosphorus trichloride was distilled off under a reduced pressure and the residue was vacuum distilled at ca 1 mm and the product collected as a colourless distillate in the fraction having a boiling point in the range 85-95 C. (139.3 g). Yield 71% NMR 1H: 3.89 (CH 2 Cl, JHH 5.0); 5.58 (CH, 3JHP 11.8); NMR 13C: 42.29 (CH 2 Cl, 3JPC 7.99); 66.42 (CH, 2JPC 7.19); 112.42 (CN, 3JPC 4.63); NMR 31P: 9.11. Step 2: Synthesis of dichloride of 1-cyanoethenyl phosphoric acid through dehydrohalogenation A solution of the distillate fraction collected from step 1 was added to absolute ether (500 ml), and then triethylamine (26.7 g) in absolute ether (100 ml) was added dropwise at 10 C. After the addition was complete the mixture was stirred for 20 min and the precipitate separated by filtration. The solvent was removed by distillation in vacuo using a water-jet aspirator, and the residue was distilled in vacuo (1 mm) to give the product as a colourless distillate (34.5 g, bp 40 C.). Yield 75% NMR 1H: 6.02 (HA, CHAHB, 4JAP 3.85, JAB 3.85); 5.94 (HB, CHAHB 4JBP 3.85); NMR 13C: 120.92 (CH 2 , 3JPC 7.34); 125.28 (C(OP), 2JPC 11.72); 111.23 (CN, 3JPC 5.58); NMR 31P 2.32. Step 3: Synthesis of enolpyruvic amide O-phosphate through hydrolysis To a stirred solution of dichloride of 1-cyanoethnylphosphoric acid (23.7 g) in 50 ml of chloroform, water (9.5 g) was added dropwise at 30-35 C. After complete addition the reaction mixture was warmed to 40 C. for 20 min to remove HCl. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and acetonitrile (400 ml) was added to the residue. The precipitate was separated and dried in a vacuum to give product as white crystals (12.8 g). Yield 59%. 1H NMR: 5.84 (HA, CHAHB, 4JAP 2.5, JAB 2.5); 5.43 (HB, CHAHB, 4JBP 2.5); 13C NMR (solvent CD30D): 105.7 (CH 2 ); 148.01 (C(OP), 2JPC 8.35); 166.27 (C(O)NH 2 , 3JPC 8.7); 31P NMR: 4.86. EXAMPLE 2 Example 1 was repeated, but the final product was obtained as the monopotassium salt of enolpyruvic amide 2-O-phosphate through step 4. Step 4: To stirred solution of enolpyruvic amide phosphate (4.4 g) in 50 ml of absolute ethanol, a solution of potassium hydroxide (1.48 g) in absolute ethanol (30 ml) was added dropwise at the temperature 15-20 C. The precipitate formed was separated and vacuum dried to give target compound as white crystals (3.45 g). Yield 75%. 1H NMR: 5.63 (HA, CHAHB, 4JAP 1.96, JAB 1.96); 5.29 (HB, CHAHB, 4JBP 1.96); 13C NMR (solvent D20): 104.97 (CH 2 , 3JPC 3.07); 147.02 (C(OP), 2JPC 7.89); 167.89 (C(O)NH 2 , 3JPC 7.24); 31P NMR: 4.58. EXAMPLE 3 Step 1 of Example 1 was repeated, but using a temperature of 40 C. The yield of dichloride of 1-cyano-2-chlorethylphosphoric was 65%. EXAMPLE 4 Step 1 of Example 1 was repeated, but using PCl 3 : acrylonitrile at a ratio 5:1. The yield of dichloride of 1-cyano-2-chlorethylphosphoric was 54%. EXAMPLE 5 Step 2 of Example 1 was repeated, but using benzene (50 ml) instead of ether. The yield was 60%. EXAMPLE 6 Step 2 of Example 1 was repeated, but using carbon tetrachloride (100 ml) instead of ether and pyridine instead of triethylamine. Yield 40%. The above synthesis provides a three step synthesis of 2-(dihydroxyphosphoryloxy)prop-2-enoic amide and some derivatives, in high yield (overall yield 31% in three steps) and high purity (96-99.9%). The above synthesis can also be used to generate PEP in a convenient way, by simply deaminating the aforementioned amide to PEP such as using a deaminase enzyme, or by mild hydrolysis. Furthermore secondary and tertiary amides can also be prepared via the above route by conversion of the above primary amide to CH 2 COP(O)Cl 2 C(O)Cl followed by reaction with a primary or secondary amine. This is illustrated in Examples 7 to 9. EXAMPLE 7 React acrylic acid chloride (CH 2 CHCOCl) with phosphorus trichloride and oxygen to give the intermediate (1) ClCH 2 CH(COCl)OP(O)Cl 2 and minor amounts of the phosphonate ClCH 2 CH(COCl)P(O)C 1 2 . Then treat with triethylamine to convert the phosphate (1) to the enolphosphate trichloride (2) CH 2 C(COCl)OP(O)Cl 2 , which can then be purified by fractional distillation. Now treat with one equivalent of various secondary and primary amines followed by two equivalent of water to make amides (3) CH 2 C(CONR 1 R 2 )OP(O)(OH) 2 , wherein R 1 R 2 Et, or Me, and wherein R 1 C 6 H 11 ,R 2 H. EXAMPLE 8 Treat the compound of formula 3 of Example 1 with three equivalents of t-potassium t-butoxide to form the tri potassium salt, then add one equivalent of methyl iodide to form the N-methyl analogue of the compound of formula 3i.e. CH 2 CH(CONHMe)OP(O)(OH) 2 . EXAMPLE 9 Condense pyruvic acid with diethylamine in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide to form CH 3 COCONEt 2 . Then convert to the diethylamide of PEP in accordance with the following synthetic route: CH 3 COCONEt 2 ----LiCH 2 COCONEt 2 ---ClP(O)(OEt) 2 --CH 2 CC(CONEt 2 )OP(O)(OEt) 2 ----ClSiMe 3 ----CH 2 CC(CONEt 2 )OP(O)(OSiMe 3 ) 2 ----H 2 O------CH 2 CC(CONEt 2 )OP(O)(OH) 2 . EXAMPLE 10 The phosphate trichloride (1) ClCH 2 C(COCl)OP(O)Cl 2 can be converted into the triester CH 2 C(COOMe)OP(O)(OMe) 2 by treating the trichloride (1) with excess dry methanol in an excess of triethylamine. The tri ester can then be converted into the mono carboxylic ester CH 2 C(CO 2 Me)OP(O)(OH) 2 via the silyl ester CH 2 C(CO 2 Me)OP(O)(OSiR 3 ) 2 . EXAMPLE 11 Blood Storage/Preservation Blood was successfully stored for an extended period using the compound of formula 3. The protocol was as follows. Three units of venous blood was taken from three donors and processed with (a) saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM)control (b) SAGM125 mol 1 compound of formula 3 (c) 125 mol 1 compound of formula 3. These were then stored at 4 C. Aseptic aliquots were abstracted on days 0, 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 49 and assayed for 2, 3 DPG electrolytes, FBC, lactate, methaemoglobin, oxygen dissociation, red blood cell (RBC) ATP assay, RBC morphology and blood culture. Haemoglobin variants were assayed on day 0 and blood cultures on days 7 and 49. EXAMPLE 12 A perfusion/reperfusion solution and a cardioplegic solution (according to the invention) for use in Example 8 were made up as follows.

This reduces the pH to 7.4 and prevents precipitation of calcium phosphate when the calcium is added. After bubbling through the gas CaCl 2 .2H 2 O is added then volume made up to 5 L and the solution filtered through a 5 m filter. Optionally a compound of the invention, preferably the compound of Example 1 (formula 3), is added to the reperfusion solution.

(by heating on hotplate stirrer) and then the solution filtered through 5 m filter. EXAMPLE 13 Recovery of Heart Function The cardioplegic solution of Example 12 was compared (as discussed below) against a cardioplegic solution of the monopotassium salt of PEP (PEP-K) in the post-ischemic recovery of rat heart function. An isolated working rat heart preparation was used. This is a left heart preparation which allows indices of cardiac function to be measured (aortic flow, coronary flow, heart rate, aortic systolic and diastolic pressure) and additional indices to be derived (cardiac output, stroke volume, stroke work). Using this preparation it is possible to simulate cardiopulmonary bypass, incorporating cardioplegic arrest and supportive bypass after ischaemia. The hearts were perfused with Krebs Henseleit buffer (KHB), as prepared in Example 12, containing 95% O 2 :5% CO 2 . The hearts were originally perfused in the Langendorff mode for 5 min equilibration and then converted to the working mode for 10 min when measurement of aerobic control function could be made. The hearts were then reconverted to the Langendorff mode for a further 5 min and perfused with either normal KHB or KHB to which the compound of formula 3 (example 1) had been added; they were then converted back to the working mode (again containing either control KHB or KHB plus PEP-amide) for measurement of a second period of control function. The hearts were then arrested with the cardioplegic solution as prepared in Example 12, and subjected to 30 min normotheric global ischaemia and then reperfused with either control KHB or KHB containing the compound of formula 3 in the Langendorff mode for 15 min (simulating supportive bypass). The hearts were then converted to the reperfusate working mode (with reperfusate of either KHB or KHB plus compound formula 3) and post-ischaemic function was measured and expressed as a percent of the pre-ischaemic control function. Finally, the hearts were again converted back to the Langendorff mode for 5 min and then back again to the working mode for a further 15 min when post-ischaemic function was again measured. In this final period hearts were only reperfused with KHB. Three groups were studied: 1. Hearts were perfused with KHB or normal cardioplegic solution. 2. 100 mol/L compound formula 3 added to KHB as pretreatment, and to the cardioplegic solution and during initial Langendorff and working mode reperfusion period. 3. 100 mol/L compound formula 3 added to KHB as pretreatment, and to the cardioplegic solution and during initial Langendorff and working mode reperfusion period. Recovery of Function In control hearts the recovery of aortic flow was 23.53.5% and compound formula 3 improved recovery to 69.34.3%. The heart properties measured for each of the three groups are shown in the accompanying Figures in which Figures 1 to 8 respectively show aortic flow, coronary flow, cardiac output, heart rate, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, stroke volume, and stroke work. Figures 9 and 10 shows the duration of reperfusion against the recovery of aortic flow at 10 minutes and 20 minutes respectively. Thus the compound of formula 3, when used as a pretreatment, and/or as an additive to cardioplegic solution and/or as an additive to the reperfusate, significantly enhanced post-ischemic recovery of function when used at a dose of 100 mol/L. In addition the compound of formula 3 also significantly increased (by approximately 25%) post-ischemic recovery of function over PEP-K. EXAMPLE 14 Recovery of Function The compound of formula 3 (compound 3 ) and its monopotassium salt (K-compound 3) were tested against the following cardioplegic solutions: Langendorff perfusion (control), phosphocreatine (PCr)the standard/commercially available treatment, and the monopotassium salt of PEP(PEP-k). The recovery profile during working reperfusion is shown in Figure 11. More particularly Figure 11 shows the recovery profile of aortic flow in control hearts, or hearts treated with 100 mol/L compound 3, PEP-K, K-compound 3 or 10 mol/L phosphocreatine (PCr). Langendorff (L) perfusion is shown by the light shaded bars. Results are expressed as a percentage of the mean of the second working period, normalised to 100%. Values are mean (SEM have been omitted for greater clarity). Figure 12 show the percent recovery, after 50 min reperfusion of control hearts and hearts treated with 100 mol/L compound 3, PEP-K, K-compound 3, 10 mol/L phosphocreatine (PCr). Values are meanSEM; *p0.05. It can be seen that control hearts, and hearts from compound 3, and K-compound 3 treated groups recover rapidly, reaching a plateau by 10 min of the initial reperfusion period (when, in any of the drug-treated groups, drug would still be present, implying that the drug was not interfering with the rate of recovery of the hearts). These groups of hearts did not improve or deteriorate when the reperfusate was replaced during the second working reperfusion period with KH buffer alone (suggesting that the drug was not interfering with the extent of recovery). This high speed or recovery could be very important in salvaging critical tissue such as of the heart or brain. In contrast, hearts treated with 10 mol/L PCr recovered slowly and continued to recover throughout the 15 min initial working reperfusion period. These hearts continued to recover when reperfused with KH alone and this recovery did not plateau until the final 10 min of reperfusion. In a clinical situation the optimal administration regime for compound 3 and K-compound 3 may require administration during reperfusion as well as during ischaemia. Figure 12 shows the final recovery (at the end of the 50 min total reperfusion period) for all groups. It is clear that the recovery of hearts treated with compound 3 was significantly (p0.05) greater than control hearts, and was also greater than the other drug treated groups. K-compound 3, although not as good as compound 3, nevertheless aided recovery to a higher level than the control group. This study confirms that compound 3 and K-compound 3 as an additive to the pre-ischemic perfusate, to the cardioplegic solution and to the initial reperfusate (also at a dose of 100 mol/L), significantly improved post-ischemic recovery of function in rate hearts subjected to normothermic global ischemia. In addition, it shows that there was a tendency for hearts treated with compound 3 to recover better than hearts treated with PEP or phosphocreatine. This is even so under hypothermic conditions. Both compound 3 and K-compound 3 also aided a much faster rate of recovery of the hear in the first 10 minutes after administration (Figure 1) than phosphocreatine which may be very important in aiding recovery of function of critical tissue, such as of the heart and brain.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This is a divisional of application Ser. No. 08/857,760 filed May 15, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,617. This application claims the benefit of provisional application Ser. No. 60/017,697, filed May 21, 1996, under 35 USC 119(e)(i). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides novel compounds and a novel method for treating: non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM); impaired glucose tolerance; and obesity. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, or NIDDM, and Type II diabetes are synonymous. NIDDM patients have an abnormally high blood glucose concentration when fasting and delayed cellular uptake of glucose following meals or after a diagnostic test known as the glucose tolerance test. NIDDM is diagnosed based on recognized criteria (American Diabetes Association, Physicians Guide to Insulin-Dependent (Type I) Diabetes, 1988; American Diabetes Association, Physicians Guide to Non-Insulin-Dependent (Type II) Diabetes, 1988). Impaired glucose tolerance occurs when the rate of metabolic clearance of glucose from the blood is less than that commonly occurring in the general population after a standard dose of glucose has been orally or parenterally administered (American Diabetes Association, Physicians Guide to Non-Insulin-Dependent (Type II) Diabetes, 1988). Impaired glucose tolerance can occur in NIDDM, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, middle age onset diabetes mellitus of the young, gestational diabetes and obesity. Impaired glucose tolerance can also occur in individuals not meeting the diagnostic criteria for these disease states. Impaired glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals is a predisposing factor for the development of NIDDM. Obesity is a condition in which there is an increase in body fat content resulting in excess body weight above the accepted norms for age, gender, height, and body build (Bray, Obesity, An Endocrine Perspective, p. 2303, Multihormonal Systems and Disorders (1989)). Accepted norms have been determined by life insurance mortality experience and by incidence of morbidity in relation to body composition. The excess mortality that occurs in obese individuals results from diseases that are predisposed by this condition. They include cancer, cardiovascular disease, digestive disease, respiratory disease and diabetes mellitus. In patients with chronic hyperglycemia such as occurs in non-insulin dependent diabetes, glucose-dependent protein crosslinking occurs at a rate in excess of the norm (Bunn, American Journal of Medicine, Vol. 70, p. 325, 1981) resulting in altered tertiary protein structure (Brownlee, Chapter 18, Diabetes Mellitus, p. 279, 1990). Excessive non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins contributes to diabetic complications and complications of aging in non-diabetic humans, such as neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, hypertension, and atherosclerosis (Brownlee, 1990, supra). Hyperglycemia is defined as blood glucose concentration in excess of the accepted norm for the general population (American Diabetes Association, Physicians Guide to Non-Insulin-Dependent (Type II) Diabetes, 1988). Reducing the abnormally high blood glucose level of diabetic subjects benefits the patient by reducing the discomfort of glycosuria and the excessively high mortality and morbidity associated with diabetes mellitus (Kahn, Diabetes Mellitus Theory and Practice, 4th ed., Chapter 26, p. 450, 1990). Weight loss by patients with diabetes mellitus who are obese results in a long-term reduction of the excessively high blood glucose level (Wing, Archives of Internal Medicine, Vol. 147, p. 1749, 1987; Kahn, Diabetes Mellitus Theory and Practice, 4th ed., Chapter 26, p. 450, 1990). As a result of this beneficial effect of weight loss on diabetes mellitus, weight reduction is the treatment of choice for obese patients with diabetes (Karam, Chapter 33, Diabetes Mellitus and Obesity, p. 298, 1982). While the relationship between diabetes mellitus and obesity is known, it would be an advantage to have a drug which can treat or prevent both of them.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention particularly provides: (1) A compound of the formulae I-VIII: or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, wherein G is (CH 2 ) n ; wherein G is (CH 2 ) m ; wherein G is (CH 2 ) p ; wherein R is H or NH 2 ; wherein n is an integer from 1-5; wherein m is an integer from 0-4; wherein p is an integer from 0-3; with the proviso that in formulae II, at least one R group must be NH 2 , and when G is (CH 2 ) 1 , formula II excludes the structure represented by formula XI with the proviso that in formula I, when G is (CH 2 ) 1 at least one R group must be NH 2 ; with the proviso that in formula VIII, when G is (CH 2 ) 2 at least one R group must be NH 2 . (2) a method for treating or preventing non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or obesity in a patient susceptible to or experiencing said NIDDM or obesity comprising the systemic administration of an amount effective to treat or prevent NIDDM or obesity of a compound of the formulae IX-XI. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include: acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, oxalate, palmoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate, and undecanoate. The dose of compounds of formula I-VIII to be used is between 0.1 and 100 mg/kg body weight daily. The preferred dose is 1-50 mg/kg/day. Administration may be by oral, parenteral, intranasal, buccal, sublingual, intrarectal, or transdermal routes. The oral route is preferred. Novel compounds of the invention are given by the generic formulae I-VIII. Known compounds claimed for use in the treatment of NIDDM are represented by formula IX-XI. Of the compounds of this invention, represented by generic formulae I-VIII, the compounds listed in Table 1 are especially preferred and their preferred utility is in the treatment of NIDDM and its complications. Procedures for their preparation are given in Section 4. Table 2 contains a list of compound specifically claimed by this invention. Thus, the present invention provides novel and known compounds having surprising and unexpected antidiabetic properties. Administration of the compounds of this invention to KKAy mice at a dose of approximately 100-500 mg/kg/day results in the partial or complete amelioration of hyperglycemia in this rodent model of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Specific compounds are listed in Tables 1 and 2; see Chang, Wyse, Copeland, Peterson, and Ledbetter, Diabetes 1985, p. 466, 1986). KKAy mice are insulin resistant (Chang, et al, supra) and the finding that the non-fasting blood glucose level is reduced in these animals indicates that insulin resistance is most probably less after treatment with the claimed compounds. KKAy mice are obese compared to normal, outbred mice (Chang, et al, supra) and administration of compounds of the invention results in weight loss. Administration of 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride, the most preferred compound in this series, to diabetic KKAy mice for 3 days decreased the non-fasting blood glucose level of the animals (see Table 3). A dose of 125 mg/kg/day produced a decrease in the blood glucose level that was approximately equal to the effect of 3-Guanidinopropionic acid at 700 mg/kg/day. A higher dose of 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride produced an even greater reduction in the blood glucose concentration. Administration of 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride to obese KKAy mice for 3 days decreased the body weight of the animals (see Table 3). A dose of 125 mg/kg/day produced a -1.90% decrease in the body weight compared to the control mice. A higher dose of 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride produced an even greater reduction in the body weight of obese mice. Administration of a variety of related structural analogs of 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride to diabetic, obese KKAy mice for 3 days resulted in a reduction in the abnormally elevated blood glucose of these mice or a decrease in the excessive body weight of the animals (Table 4). 4-Imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride and a mixture of 1,2,4-triazine-3,6-dione, tetrahydro-, 3-hydrazone, monohydrochloride and 2,4-imidazolidinedione, 3-amino-, 2-hydrazone, monohydrochloride caused both the blood glucose and body weight to decrease. 1,2,4-triazin-5(2H)-one, 3-amino-1,6-dihydro-, monohydrochloride and 1,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)-dione, dihydro-, 3-hydrazone, monohydrochloride caused a reduction in body weight. The blood glucose level did not decrease with these compounds during the 3 day experiment. Since the mean blood glucose level in obese diabetic humans decreases when body weight is reduced for 12, 36, or 64 weeks (Wing, Archives of Internal Medicine, Vol. 147, p. 1749, 1987), the weight reduction with 1,2,4-triazin-5(2H)-one, 3-amino-1,6-dihydro-, monohydrochloride and 1,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)-dione, dihydro-, 3-hydrazone, monohydrochloride should cause improvement in the hyperglycemic state with longer term administration. In patients with diabetes mellitus, there are several metabolic disorders that would be of therapeutic benefit to correct: the abnormally elevated blood level of glucose in the fed and fasted states, the delayed clearance of glucose from the blood stream (American Diabetes Association, Physicians Guide to Insulin-Dependent (Type I) Diabetes, 1988; American Diabetes Association, Physicians Guide to Non-Insulin-Dependent (Type II) Diabetes, 1988), and the excessive glycosylation of proteins which contributes to the development of diabetic complications (Brownlee, supra). Furthermore, obesity is frequently associated with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and aggravates the disordered glucose metabolism in these patients (Horton and Jeanrenaud, Chapter 27, Obesity and Diabetes Mellitus, 1990). The optimal treatment for non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus would correct all of these disorders, but in particular would correct obesity (Karam, Chapter 33, Diabetes Mellitus and Obesity, p. 298, 1982; Kahn, Diabetes Mellitus Theory and Practice, 4th ed., Chapter 26, p. 450, 1990). Excessive glycosylation of proteins, such as can occur in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, can be prevented by reducing the abnormal elevation of blood glucose concentration in the diabetic state (Holman and Turner, Diabetic Medicine, 5:582-588, 1988; Benjamin and Sacks, Clin Chem., 4015:683-687, 1994). It is the ability of the claimed compounds to positively affect multiple metabolic defects comprising diabetes mellitus and to prevent metabolic defects by more than one mechanism that clearly distinguishes their pharmacologic actions from other guanidine compounds that have previously been claimed as treatments for diabetes mellitus. The claimed compounds are unexpectedly superior to aminoguanidine, diaminoguanidine, 3-guanidinopropionic acid, and metformin in the treatment of NIDDM because they offer a more complete spectrum of desirable activities or are effective in lower doses. The claimed compounds offer unexpected advantages in the treatment of diabetes mellitus compared to diaminoguanidine and aminoguanidine since the claimed compounds act metabolically to reduce excessive blood glucose concentration. The claimed compounds are unexpectedly superior to aminoguanidine and diaminoguanidine in the treatment of impaired glucose tolerance or obesity since aminoguanidine and diaminoguanidine lack efficacy in this regard. Aminoguanidine and diaminoguanidine inhibit non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins in vitro and the formation of advanced glycosylation endproducts in vivo (Kumari, Umar, Bansal, and Sahib, Diabetes, 40:1079-1084, 1991). Based on its inhibition of nonenzymatic protein glycosylation, aminoguanidine has been suggested to have utility in the treatment of diabetes (Brownlee, supra). Aminoguanidine has no effect on the blood glucose level of normal rodents or rats made diabetic by injection of alloxan or streptozotocin (Kumari, Umar, Bansal, Sahib, supra; Yagihashi, Kamijo, Baba, Yagihashi, and Nagai, Diabetes, 41:47-52, 1992; Edelstein and Brownlee, Diabetologia, 35:96-97, 1992; Oxlund and Andreassen, Diabeterologia, 35:19-25, 1992). Diaminoguanidine has no effect on the blood glucose level of normal or alloxan-diabetic rats (Kumari, Umar, Bansal, Sahib, supra). Aminoguanidine has no effect on the body weight of normal or diabetic rats (Kumari, Umar, Bansal, Sahib, supra; Yagihashi, Kamijo, Baba, Yagihashi, and Nagai, supra: Oxlund and Andreassen, Diabetologia, 35:19-25, 1992) or results in an increase in body weight of human and rats (Baylin, Horakova, and Beaven, Experientia, 31:562, 1975). Diaminoguanidine does not affect the body weight of normal or alloxan-diabetic rats (Kumari, Umar, Bansal, Sahib, supra). An effect by aminoguanidine or diaminoguanidine on glucose tolerance has yet to be demonstrated. The claimed compounds are unexpectedly superior to 3-guanidinopropionic acid in the treatment of diabetes mellitus since the latter is less potent in the control of hyperglycemia. 3-Guanidinopropionic acid has previously been shown to reduce hyperglycemia and excess body weight and to improve glucose tolerance in diabetic rodents (Meglasson, Wilson, Yu, Robinson, Wyse, and de Souza, J. Pharm. and Exp. Therapeutics, 266:1454-1462, 1993). The most preferred compound in this claim, 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride, is more potent than 3-guanidinopropionic acid in reducing the abnormally elevated blood glucose level of KKAy mice. To reduced the blood glucose level of KKAy mice by 35% required 700 mg/kg/day of the latter compound. A similar reduction in the blood glucose level could be achieved with a dose of 125 mg/kg/day of 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride. The claimed compounds are unexpectedly superior to metformin in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, glucose intolerance, and obesity since the latter is less potent when tested in the same animal model as the claimed compounds. Also, with respect to its efficacy in reducing body weight, the disclosed data for metformin are contradictory and do not reveal a consistent result. Metformin has previously been shown to reduce hyperglycemia in non-insulin dependent diabetic patients when administered at 1000-3000 mg/day and to increase the rate of glucose clearance in such patients when administered at 1500-2500 mg/day (Bailey, Diabetes Care, 15:755-772, 1992). Rodents are less sensitive to metformin than humans and therefore higher doses (based on body weight) are required to demonstrate glycemic effects (Bailey, Flatt, Wilcock, and Day, Frontiers in Diabetes Research, pp. 277-282, 1990; Penicaud, Hitier, Ferre, and Girard, Biochem. J. 262:881-885, 1989). Chronic oral administration of metformin reduces hyperglycemia when administered to neonatal streptozotocin-diabetic rats at 100 mg/kg/day (Rossetti, DeFronzo, Gherzi, Stein, et al, Metabolism, 39:425-435, 1990), to DBM mice at 400 mg/kg/day (Bailey, Flatt, Wilcock, and Day, supra), to Zucker fa/fa rats at 350 mg/kg/day (Penicaud, Hitier, Ferre, and Girard, supra), and to KKAy mice at 300 mg/kg/day or more (Meglasson, Wilson, Yu, Robinson, de Souza, supra). Chronic oral administration of metformin did not affect the blood glucose concentration in normal mice receiving 250 mg/kg/day, in streptozotocin-diabetic mice receiving 250 mg/kg/day (Bailey, Flatt, Wilcock, and Day, supra), or diabetic ob/ob mice receiving 250 mg/kg/day (Bailey, Flatt, and Ewan, Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn., 282:233-239, 1986). Acute administration of 264 mg/kg metformin or its analog buformin at 132 mg/kg did not affect the blood glucose level of rats (Tutwiler and Bridi, Diabetes, 27:868-876, 1978). When the most preferred compound in this claim, 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride, was tested in KKAy mice it was more potent than metformin in reducing the abnormally elevated blood glucose level in this model. To reduce the blood glucose level of KKAy mice by 25% required 300 mg/kg/day of metformin (Meglasson, Wilson, Yu, Robinson, Wyse, and de Souza, supra). A similar reduction in the blood glucose level could be achieved with a dose of 70-125 mg/kg/day of 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride. With respect to increasing glucose tolerance metformin has been reported to not affect glucose tolerance in normal rats when given at a dose of 750 mg/kg (Tutwiler and Bridi, supra) or in normal mice when given at 50 mg/kg (Bailey, Flatt, Wilcock, and Day, supra). When given to normal mice or streptozotocin-diabetic rats at 250 mg/kg oral glucose tolerance was increased (Bailey, Flatt, Wilcock, and Day, supra). With respect to reducing body weight, metformin has been reported to cause weight loss in non-insulin dependent diabetic patients treated for one year (Bailey, supra) or to have no significant effect on the body weight of obese non-insulin dependent diabetic patients treated for a similar length of time (Multi-centre Study, Diabetologia, 24:404-411, 1983). Metformin did not cause weight loss in diabetic ob/ob mice when administered at 240 mg/kg/day or streptozotocin-diabetic mice when administered at 60 mg/kg/day (Lord, Atkins, and Bailey, Diabetologia 25:108-113, 1983). Metformin caused statistically significant weight loss in KKAy mice treated with 1700 mg/kg/day of the compound, but not when lower doses were given (Meglasson, Wilson, Yu, Robinson, Wyse, and de Souza, supra). By comparison, when N-(dihydrazinomethylene)glycine was administered to KKAy mice at 100 mg/kg/day it was approximately as effective as 1700 mg/kg/day of metformin in producing weight loss in this obese mouse strain (Meglasson, Wilson, Yu, Robinson, Wyse, and de Souza, supra).

EXAMPLE 3 1,2,4-Triazine-3,6-dione, tetrahydro-, 3-hydrazone, monohydrochloride (Compound 9) A soln of 8 (3.00 g, 20.4 mmol) in 1.0 M aq HCl (45 mL) was left standing at room temp for 24 h (NMR analysis of an aliquot indicated a 1:1 mixture of new products with no starting material remaining). The soln was then diluted to a total volume of 500 mL with THF. An oil separated. The mixture was chilled in an ice bucket for 1 h, whereupon some crystals appeared in the separated oil. Filtration of the mixture gave a white crystalline solid (0.86 g). NMR analysis indicated the solid was a 6:1 mixture of products 9:10 (major one having the upfield NMR signal). The oil in the filtrate continued to deposit crystals. After another hour, a second crop (0.55 g) was collected by filtration which was an 8:1 mixture of the same products. The second crop was dissolved in water (10 mL) and then diluted with THF (125 mL). The soln was left at 0 C. for 24 hrs, sonicated, and left at 0 C. for another 24 h.

After 3 days, NMR analysis of an aliquot indicated two peaks at 4.3 and 4.0 in a ratio of 2:1, respectively. After 5 days, the ratio was 3:1, and at ten days the ratio was 5:1. At that time, the soln was diluted with THF (400 mL), whereupon an oil separated. The mixture was left at 0 C. for two days, at which time some crystals had appeared in the separated oil. The crystals were isolated by suction filtration and washed with THF. Drying in vacuo left white crystals (approx 400 mg), which were a 10:1 mixture of 10:9. 1 H NMR (D 2 O) 4.29 (s, 2 H); Anal.

Biological Testing Compounds of the present invention were tested for their ability to reduce blood glucose and body weight as follows: KKAy mice are rodent models of NIDDM and obesity (Chang, Wyse, Copeland, Peterson, and Ledbetter, 1986). A pre-treatment blood sample was obtained from the retro-orbital sinus and the mice arranged in groups of 5-6 so that the mean pre-treatment blood glucose level was the same on average in all groups. Test compounds were admixed in the chow at a concentration of 0.05-0.5% and the mice were allowed to consume the diet ad libitum. Control mice received unsupplemented chow. On Day 0, the mice were weighed and provided control chow or chow supplemented with test compounds. After 3 days of consuming control chow or chow supplemented with test compounds, a blood sample was obtained for determination of the glucose concentration and the animals were weighed for determination of weight loss. Food consumption was measured by weighing the food provided at the beginning of the study and the food residue at the end of the study. Food consumption was calculated by subtracting the weight of the residue from the weight of the food provided. Drug intake was calculated by multiplying food consumption by the concentration of drug in the diet. Using this method drug intake was determined to be approximately 62-444 mg of the free base form per kg per day. Blood glucose data are expressed as the average blood glucose concentration in the test group divided by the average blood glucose level in the control group (treatment/control or T/C). Compounds resulting in TIC values equal to or less than 0.90 are considered to be active anti-hyperglycemic agents. Weight loss data are expressed as percent change in body weight. Compounds resulting in a decrease of 0.22% or more less than control in body weight over three days are considered to be active anti-obesity agents. In a typical obese human subject (for example, a male, 68 inches in height and body mass index of 30) the loss of 0.22%/3 days would be equivalent to 1 pound per week (Bray, Endocrinology, 3rd edition, Chap. 143, p. 2627, 1995). A widely used clinical standard for satisfactory weight loss by obese humans is 1-2 pounds per week (Horton, Diabetes Mellitus Theory and Practice, 4th edition, Chapter 27, p. 461, 1990). Hence a drug that causes weight to be lost at the rate of 0.22%/3 days would be of benefit.

No. 60/020,406, filed Jun. 25, 1996. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a ring-substituted derivative of K-252a for use in methods directed to ameliorating the deleterious effects of a variety of diseases, disorders and conditions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION I. The Indolocarbazole K-252a K-252a is a compound having an indolocarbazole skeleton Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 41489/85 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,555,402) with the stereochemistry shown in Formula I. It has been reported that K-252a strongly inhibits protein kinase C (PKC) which plays a central role in regulating cell functions, and has various activities such as the action of inhibiting smooth muscle contraction (Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 43 (suppl.): 284, 1987), the action of inhibiting elongation of neurazone (J. Neuroscience, 8: 715, 1988), the action of inhibiting histamine release (Allergy, 43: 100, 1988), the action of inhibiting smooth muscle MLCK ( J. Biol. Chem., 263: 6215, 1988), anti-inflammatory action (Acta Physiol. Hung., 80: 423, 1992), and the activity of cell survival (J. Neurochemistry, 64: 1502, 1995). It has also been disclosed in Experimental Cell Research, 193: 175-182, 1991, that K-252a has the activity of inhibiting IL-2 production. In addition, it has been reported that derivatives of K-252a have PCK inhibitory activity, the activity of inhibiting histamine release (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 295588/88), antitumor activity Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 168689/89 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,776), WO 88/07045 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,923,986), WO 94/04541, the action of increasing blood platelets WO 94/06799 (EP 630898A), vasodepressor activity (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 120388/87), the action of accelerating cholinergic neuron functions WO 94/02488 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,461,146 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,621,100) and, curative effect on prostate cancer WO 94/27982 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,516,771). Selected amino-containing trindene compounds have been prepared by Beckmann rearrangement of the corresponding staurosporine oximes (WO 97/05140). The indolocarbazoles are generally lypophilic. Because of this feature, the indolocarbazoles are able to cress biological membranes with relative ease, compared to proteins. Also indolocarbazoles generally have longer in vivo half lives than proteins. In addition to K-252a itself, various derivatives of K-252a have been synthesized and tested for biological activity. Among the K-252a derivatives shown to have biological activity is a compound disclosed in Lewis et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,461,146, and 5,621,100, and PCT Publication WO 94/02488, and designated therein as Compound II-51. Compound II-51 has been shown to enhance the function of cholinergic neurons, striatal neurons, and sensory neurons. II. Neurodegenerative Diseases and Disorders Parkinsons disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that involves progressive and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons of the nigro-striatal pathway (Agid, Lancet: 337:1991). Administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,4,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to mice leads to dopaminergic neuron degeneration and serves as an animal model for the dopaminergic neuronal loss and behavioral deficits observed in Parkinsons disease. Peripheral administration of MPTP leads to a highly selective degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal system in humans, monkeys and mice (Heikkila et al., Science 224; 1451-1453, 1984; Burns et al., Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:4546-4550, 1983). Neurodegeneration in the MPTP mouse model has been well-characterized. Systemic administration of MPTP produces selective loss of dopamine content (and metabolites), tyrosine hydroxylase activity, and dopamine uptake sites in dopaminergic neurons of the murine striatum (Heikkila et al., Nature 311:467-469, 1984a,b; Tipton et al., J. Neurochem. 61:1191-1206, 1993). This effect is dose-dependent. Maximal loss occurs between 3 and 7 days post-lesion (Jackson-Lewis et al., Neurodegeneration 4:257-269, 1995). The dopaminergic cell bodies in the nigra are less sensitive to MPTP toxicity than their corresponding nerve terminals. At high MPTP doses, or multiple MPTP injections, substantial loss of TH immunopositive cells in the substantia nigra occurs within a week (Heikkila et al., Science 224; 1451-1453, 1984; Jackson-Lewis et al., Neurodegeneration 4:257-269, 1995). At lower MPTP doses, or with a single injection, loss of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells occurs later (Tatton et al., J. Neuroscience. Res. 30:666-672, 1991). Thus, at lower doses of MPTP and a short-time period after lesion, striatal damage can be observed in the absence of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cell loss. This neurodegenerative sequence is similar to that observed in the disease. The MPTP mouse model is a recognized and widely used model for the study of Parkinsons disease. Non-cholinergic neurons that use -aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a neurotransmitter (i.e., GABA-ergic neurons) are widespread throughout the brain. For example, they are found in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis in the rodent (the equivalent region in the human brain is called nucleus basalis of Meynert), a region of the basal forebrain important in attention and memory functions. Damage to GABA-ergic neurons in the basal forebrain may also contribute to behavioral deficits in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease (Dekker et al., Neurosci. and Biobehav. Rev., 15:299-317, 1991; Gallagher et al., Seminars in Neuroscience, 6;351-358, 1994; Torres et al., Neuroscience, 63:95-122, 1994). Neurons in the basal forebrain die in several diseases of the central nervous system, notably Alzheimers disease (Arendt et al., Acta Neuropathol. ( Berl. ) 61:101-108, 1983; Iraizoz et al., Neuroscience, 41:33-40, 1991; Vogels et al., Neurobiol. Aging, 11:3-13, 1990). A contributing factor in such neuronal cell death is glutamate excitotoxity, i.e. over-stimulation of neurons by excess glutamate (Choi, Neuron, 1:623-634, 1988). Accordingly, several animal models of Alzheimers disease use glutamate or a glutamate analog to produce excitotoxic death in the region of the basal forebrain where neuron death occurs, i.e., the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (Wenk, Beh. Brain Res., 72:17-24, 1996). Neuronal pathology in Alzheimers disease is first seen in the entorhinal cortex, and loss of neurons in this region becomes severe as the disease progresses (Braak et al., Acta Neuropathol. 82:239-259, 1991; Hyman et al., Ann. Neurol. 20:472-481, 1986). Neurons in layer 2 of the entorhinal cortex project to the dentate syrus of the hippocampus, and this neuronal pathway plays an important role in memory formation (Levisohn et al., Brain Res. 564:230-244, 1991; Olton et al., Brain Res. 139:295-308, 1978; Steward et al., Brain Res. Bull. 2:41-48, 1977). Neurons in layer 2 of the entorhinal cortex, like many other neurons in the cerebral cortex, use glutamate as a neurotransmitter (Mattson et al., Neuron 1:865-876, 1988; White et al., Nature 270:356-357, 1977). Thus, loss of flutamatergic neurons in the entorhinal cortex contributes to the behavioural deficits seen in Alzheimers disease and other neurological disorders. III. Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy generally refers to a disorder that affects the peripheral nerves, most often manifested as one or a combination of motor, sensory, sensorimotor, or autonomic neural dysfunction. The wide variety of morphologies exhibited by peripheral neuropathies can each be uniquely attributed to an equally wide variety of causes. For instance, peripheral neuropathies can be genetically acquired, can result from a systemic disease, or can be induced by a toxic agent. Some toxic agents that cause neurotoxicities are therapeutic drugs, antineoplastic agents, contaminants in foods or medicinals, and environmental and industrial pollutants. In particular, chemotherapeutic agents known to cause sensory and/or motor neuropathies include vineristine, an antineoplastic drug used to treat haematological malignancies and sarcomas. The neurotoxicity is dose-related, and exhibits as reduced intestinal motility and peripheral neuropathy, expecially in the distal muscles of the hands and feet, postural hypotension, and atony of the urinary bladder. Similar problems have been documented with taxol and cisplatin (Mollman, 1990, New Eng. Jour. Med. 322:126-127), although cisplatin-related neurotoxicity can be alleviated with nerve growth factor (NGF) (Apfel, et al., 1992, Annals of Neurology 31:76-80). Although the neurotoxicity is sometimes reversible after removal of the neurotoxic agent, recovery can be a very slow process (Legha, 1986, Medical Toxicology 1:421-427; Olesen, et al., 1991, Drug Safety 6:302-314). There are a number of inherited peripheral neuropathies, including: Rofsums disease, A-betalipoproteinemia, Tangier disease, Krabbes disease, Metachromatic leukodystrophy, Fabrys disease, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome, and others. Of all the inherited neuropathies, the most common by far is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (see also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,420,112 for additional information on peripheral neuropathies). IV. Cytokines Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) are polypeptides known to be involved in a number of inflammatory and metabolic processes in vivo. For a review which relates the role of TNF- in inflammatory diseases, including septic shock, see Ann. Rev. Immunol. 7:625 (1980), and Clinical Trials for the Treatment of Sepsis, Sibbald, W. J. and Vincent, J.-L. (Eds.), Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1995. It is generally accepted that the overproduction or inappropriate production of TNF- is involved in several pathological conditions, including septic shock (Spooner et al., Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology, 62:p. S11 (1992)) and various other allergic and inflammatory conditions or diseases, including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive airway disease, psoriasis, allergic rhinitis, dermatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease, and other autoimmune diseases.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Generally, the invention features methodologies for ameliorating the deleterious effects of a variety of diseases, disorders and conditions by treating a subject in need thereof with a therapeutically effective amount of compound A. More specifically, the invention features a method for treating the deleterious effects of diseases, disorders and conditions which lead to or cause the death of, or lead to or cause inhibition of the function of, certain neurons by enhancing the function or survival of a dopaminergic, GABA-ergic, or glutamatergic neuron in a mammal, comprising the step of contacting the neuron with Compound A. Typically, the mammal in which the neuron is found in a human. Typically, the dopaminergic, GABA-ergic, or glutamatergic neuron contacted with Compound A has impaired function, or is at risk of dying, because of a neurodegenerative disease. Typically, the neurodegenerative disease is Parkinsons disease or Alzheimers disease. More specifically, the invention also features a method of reducing a peripheral neuropathy comprising administering to a mammal a neuropathy-reducing amount of Compound A. While it has been reported that the indolocarbazole compound K-252a reduces the lethality resulting from endotoxin administration, this ability has been ascribed to the ability of K-252a to inhibit protein kinases, especially protein kinase C (Inaba et al., Jpn. J. Surg 23:234 (1993). It has unexpectedly been found that Compound A, which has little or no inhibitory activity against PKC, provides surprisingly good activity as an inhibitor of TNF- production and production of the cytokine IL-1. Therefore, and with further specificity, the invention also features a method of inhibiting production of TNF- and IL-1 in a mammal and a method of treating or alleviating inflammatory conditions or diseases, including but not limited to septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive airway disease, psoriasis, allergic rhinitis, dermatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease and other autoimmune diseases, which method comprises administering to said mammal an effective amount of Compound A and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, Compound A means the compound whose chemical structure is shown below. Compound A is also referred to as Compound II-51 (Lewis et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,461,146 and 5,621,100; WO 94/02488). As used herein, ameliorate and ameliorating mean to therapeutically improve and/or therapeutically reduce and/or to make more therapeutically tolerable. As used herein, deleterious means damaging and/or harmful and/or negative. As used herein, the word overproduction when used to modify TNF- and IL-1 means production of TNF- and/or IL-1 leading to deleterious conditions such as, for example, septic shock, allergic conditions, inflammatory conditions, etc. As used herein, the terms inhibit or inhibiting means that the presence of Compound A has a comparatively greater effect on reducing and/or prohibiting and/or preventing the production of a material contacted with Compound A than a comparative material not contacted with Compound A. As used herein, the terms enhance or enhancing when used to modify the terms function or survival means that the presence of Compound A has a comparatively greater effect on the function and/or survival of the specified neuron that a comparative neuron not presented with Compound A. For example, and not by way of limitation, with respect to the survival of, e.g., a dopaminergic neuron, Compound A would evidence enhancement of the function of a dopaminergic neuronal population at risk of dying (due to, e.g., injury, a disease condition, a degenerative condition or natural progression) when compared to a dopaminergic neuronal population not presented with Compound A, if the treated population has a comparatively greater period of functionality than the non-treated population. As used herein, dopaminergic neuron means a neuron that uses dopamine as a neurotransmitter. As used herein, GABA-ergic neuron means a neuron that uses -aminobutyric acid as a neurotransmitter. As used herein, glutamatergic neuron means a neuron that uses glutamate as a neurotransmitter. As used herein, nbm means nucleus basalis magnocellularis. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present document, including definitions, will control. Unless otherwise indicated, materials, methods, and examples described herein are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting. Various features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description and from the claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Generally, the invention features methodologies for ameliorating the deleterious effects of a variety of diseases, disorders and conditions by treating a subject in need thereof with a therapeutically effective amount of Compound A. This invention provides a method for treating the deleterious effects of diseases, disorders and conditions which negatively affect the function and/or survival of neurons at risk of dying due to such diseases and disorders by enhancing the function or survival of specific types of neurons of the mammalian central nervous system. More particularly, the invention provides a method for enhancing the function or survival of dopaminergic neurons, GABA-ergic neurons, and glutamatergic neurons in a mammal by administering to the mammal Compound A, a ring-substituted K-252a derivative with the following chemical structure: Dopaminergic neurons, GABA-ergic neurons, and glutamatergic neurons are widespread in the mammalian central nervous system. Each of these three neuronal cell types suffers impaired function, or even death, in one or more neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. Parkinsons disease involves progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway. Alzheimers disease involves the death of various types of neurons, including GABA-ergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert of the basal forebrain. Alzheimers disease also involves death of glutamatergic neurons in the entorhinal cortex. One method of treating Parkinsons disease or Alzheimers disease is to administer a compound that enhances the function or survival of dopaminergic neurons, GABA-ergic neurons, or glutamatergic neurons. Compound A is pharmacologically active in biological assays and in vivo models for enhanced function or survival of dopaminergic neurons, GABA-ergic neurons, and glutamatergic neurons. Therefore, the present invention has utility for treating Parkinsons disease or Alzheimers disease. The invention, however, is not limited to the treatment of those diseases. The use of Compound A to enhance the function or survival of dopaminergic neurons, GABA-ergic neurons, or glutamatergic neurons whose impaired function or risk of dying results from causes other than Parkinsons disease or Alzheimers disease is also within the scope of the present invention. This invention also features a method of reducing a peripheral neuropath. The method involves administering a neuropathy-reducing amount of Compound A to a mammal. In various preferred embodiments, the mammal is a human, or an agricultureal or domestic mammal that develops a neuropathy, e.g., as a result of treatment of a neoplasm with a chemotherapeutic agent. Compound A can be administered in a manner deemed effective by one skilled in the art; a preferred mode of administration is subcutaneous injection. As used herein, peripheral neuropathy refers to a disorder affecting a segment of the peripheral nervous system. The invention involves using Compound A to reduce a neurotoxicity, including, but not limited to, distal sensorimotor neuropathy, or autonomic neuropathies such as reduced motility of the gastrointestinal tract or atony of the urinary bladder. Preferred neuropathies that can be effectively treated with Compound A include neuropathies associated with systemic disease, e.g., post-polio syndrome; genetically acquired neuropathies, e.g., Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; and neuropathies caused by a toxic agent, e.g., acrylamide, or a chemotherapeutic agent, e.g., vincristine. Where Compound A is used to treat a neuropathy induced by a toxic agent, it can be administered before, simultaneously with, or after exposure to the toxic agent, or before, during or after administration of a chemotherapeutic. Preferably, Compound A and the chemotherapeutic agent are each administered at effective time intervals, during an overlapping period of treatment. Compound A can be administered to the mammal following exposure to the neurotoxic agent, or following chemotherapy, to restore at least a portion of the neurofunction destroyed by the neurotoxic agent or chemotherapeutic. The chemotherapeutic can be any chemotherapeutic agent that causes neurotoxicity, such as vincristine, taxol, dideoxyinosine, or cisplatin. By toxic agent or neurotoxic agent, is meant a substance that through its chemical action injures, impairs, or inhibits the activity of a component of the nervous system. The list of neurotoxic agents that cause neuropathies is lengthy, and includes, but is not limited to, neoplastic agents such as vincristine, vinblastine, cisplatin, taxol, or dideoxy-compounds, e.g., dideoxyinosine; alcohol; metals; industrial toxins involved in occupational or environmental exposure; contaminants of food or medicinals; or over-doses of vitamins or therapeutic drugs, e.g., antibiotics such as penicillan or chloramphenicol, or megadoses of vitamins A, D, or B6. An extensive, although not complete, list of chemical compounds with neurotoxic side-effects is found in Table 1. Although this list provides examples of neurotoxic compounds, it is intended to exemplify, not limit, the scope of the invention. Other toxic agents can cause neuropathies, and can be characterized by methods known to one skilled in the art. By exposure to a toxic agent is meant that the toxic agent is made available to, or comes into contact with, a mammal of the invention. Exposure to a toxic agent can occur by direct administration, e.g., by ingestion or administration of a food, medicinal, or therapeutic agent, e.g., a chemotherapeutic agent, by accidental contamination, or by environmental exposure, e.g., aerial or aqueous exposure. Despite the widely disparate morphologies and causes attributed to peripheral neuropathies in vivo, applicants have hypothesized that Compound A can be an effective means of preventing or treating such neuropathies in a mammal.

Compound A also inhibits the production of the cytokine IL-1. The production of TNF- is associated with a variety of diseases and disorders such that the inhibition thereof via use of Compound A can beneficially provide value to a subject in need of such inhibition of TNF- production. Accordingly, Compound A can also be utilized to inhibit production of TNF- in a mammal and/or a method of treating or alleviating inflammatory conditions or disease, including but not limited to septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive airway disease, psoriasis, allergic rhinitis, dermatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease, and other autoimmune diseases which method comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of Compound A. For use in the present invention, Compound A can be formulated into a pharmaceutical composition by admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic excipients and carriers. Such a composition can be prepared for administration by any of various routes. Routes of administration and preferred dosage forms include the following: parenteral, preferably in the form of liquid solutions of suspensions; oral, preferably in the form of tablets of capsules; intranasal, preferably particularly in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols; and dermal, via, for example, trans-dermal patches. Composition A can be conveniently administered in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the pharmaceutical art, for example, as described in Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Pub. Co., Easton, Pa., 1980). Formulations for parenteral administration may contain as common excipients sterile water or saline, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils and vegetable origin, hydrogenated naphthalenes and the like. In particular, biocompatible, biodegradable lactide polymer, lactide/glycolide copolymer, or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers may be useful excipients to control the release of the active compounds. Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems for Compound A include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, and liposomes, Formulations for inhalation administration contain as excipients, for example, lactose, or may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, lactose, or may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycocholate and deoxycholate, or oily solutions for administration in the form of nasal drops, or as a gel to be applied intranasally. Formulations for parenteral administration may also include glycocholate for buccal administration, a salicylate for rectal administration, or citric acid for vaginal administration. Formulations for trans-dermal patches are preferably lipophilic emulsions. Compound A can be employed as the sole active ingredient in a pharmaceutical composition. Alternatively, it can be used in combination with other active ingredients, e.g., growth factors that facilitate neuronal survival or axonal regeneration in diseases or disorders. The concentration of Compound A used in the practice of this invention in a therapeutic composition can vary. The concentration will depend upon factors such as the total dosage of the drug to be administered and the route of administration. Compound A typically would be provided in an aqueots physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to 10% w/v for parenteral administration. Typical dose ranges are from about 1 g/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day; a preferred dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. A preferred dosage of Compound A to be administered is likely to depend on variables such as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative efficacy of Compound A for the particular disease or disorder treated, the particular formulation used, and its route of administration. Compound A for use in the present invention is preferably obtained according to the methods described in Lewis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,461,146. The present invention will be further illustrated by the following examples. These examples are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention, nor the scope of the claims appended hereto. EXAMPLES Example 1 Pharmacological Activity on Dopaminergic Neurons Experiments were conducted using Compound A in MPTP-lesioned dopaminergic neurons in mice (MPTP mouse model). A single s.c. dose of MPTP (20 mg/kg) provided to C57 black mice produced approximately 60% loss of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Administration of Compound A, at daily doses ranging from 0.01 to 10 mg/kg (s.c.), to such MPTP-treated mice reduced the loss of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase activity. These data are shown in Table 2.

Mice were treated with MPTP (20 mg/kg; s.c.) 4-6 hours after the first Compound A injection. Compound A was then injected every day until the end of the experiment, which was 7 days in duration. Striata were assessed for tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme activity. Asterisk indicates statistically significant difference (p0.05) from MPTP-Vehicle treated animals. In a separate experiment, the activities of Compound A were assessed in a high dose MPTP-mouse model. A single 40 mg/kg injection of MPTP produced a 95% depletion in striatal tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme activity 7 days post-injection. Administration of Compound A at daily doses of between 0.03 and 3.0 mg/kg reduced the magnitude of the lesion, in a dose dependent manner. These data are shown in Table 3. TABLE 3 Striatal Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) Activity in High-Dose MPTP-Treated Mice a Striatal TH % Activity Unlesioned Treatment ( SEM) Control Unlesioned 23.1 1.6 100 7.0 MPTP-Lesioned (Vehicle) 1.6 0.6 7 3.0 MPTP-Lesioned Cmpd A (0.03 mg/kg) 1.8 0.6 8 2.5 (0.3 mg/kg) 2.7 0.6 12 2.5 (3.0 mg/kg) 5.3 1.8* 23 8.0* a Data are from a single experiment. Mice were treated with MPTP (40 mg/kg; s.c.) 4-6 hrs after the first Compound A injection. Compound A was then injected every day until the end of the experiment which was 7 days in duration. Striata were assessed for tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme activity. Asterisk indicates statistically significant difference (p0.05) from MPTP-Vehicle treated animals. MPTP-mediated dopaminergic toxicity is dependent on MAO mediated conversion of MPTP to MPP (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion) and uptake of MPP into dopaminergic neurons. Compounds found to be active in the MPTP-mouse model should be determined not to be inhibitors of MAO or dopamine uptake. Compound A has been found not to inhibit monoamine oxidase A or B in vitro ( FIGS. 1 and 2 ) or block uptake of catecholamines into nerve endings, indicating that this compound does not prevent the metabolic conversion of MPTP to MPP or inhibit the active uptake of MPP into dopaminergic neurons. These data demonstrating efficacy of Compound A in the MPTP-mouse dopaminergic lesion model indicate utility of Compound A in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinsons disease. Example 2 Pharmacological Activity on GABA-ergic Neurons Compound A was tested for its ability to prevent depletion (e.g., enhance the survival) of GABA-ergic neurons in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis, using the well-established ibotenic acid lesion mode. Ibotenic acid, an excitotoxin, is known to reduce numbers of GABA-expressing neurons in the nbm region (Lindefors et al., Neurosci. Lett., 135:262-264, 1992; Shaugnessy et al., Brain Res., 637:15-26, 1994). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received injections of ibotenic acid (5.0 g) into the nbm unilaterally. The rats were then dosed with Compound A (0.03 mg/kg) via subcutaneous injection beginning 18 hours after the lesion, and continuing q.o.d. until 18 days post-lesion. Tissue sections were then collected throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the nbm, and processed to detect glutamic acid decarboxylase, an enzyme required for biosynthesis of GABA. The numbers of neurons expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase were then counted throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis, in a region where glutamic acid decarboxylase-expressing neurons of the nbm are easily distinguished from glutamic acid decarboxylase-expressing neurons in adjacent structures (white matter medial and ventral to the globus pallidus). The results were expressed as percent glutamic acid decarboxylase-expressing neurons on the lesioned side relative to the number on the opposite, unlesioned side. The results were also calculated separately for the rostral nbm, mid-nmb, and caudal nbm. A mean of 78 (16 s.c.m.) percent glutamic acid decarboxylase neurons were counted in the rostral nbm of animals receiving Compound A, compared to 34 (19 s.e.m.) percent in animals receiving vehicle only, a statistically significant difference by t test (p0.05). No statistically significant differences between Compound A-treated animals and vehicle-only (control) animals were seen in mid-nbm or caudal nbm. These results demonstrate that Compound A can protect against a GABA-ergic neuron loss that results from an excitotoxic lesion, and thus has a neurotrophic effect on that neuronal population. Example 3 Pharmacological Activity on nbm Neurons To test directly the ability of Compound A to prevent excitotoxic neuron death, nbm neurons in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were first labeled with a long-lasting marker. This was done by injecting Fluoro-Gold (FG), a neuronal tracer that is taken up by nerve terminals and transported back to the cell body (Book et al., J. Neuropath. Exp. Neurology, 53:95-102, 1994), into target regions of nbm neurons in the frontal and parietal cortex. 7-10 days later the animals received lesion of the nbm unilaterally, using 5 g of ibotenic acid. Beginning 18 hours after this lesion, the animals received Compound A (0.03 mg/kg) via subcutaneous injection, every other day until 18 days post-lesion. Tissue sections were collected throughout the entire rostral-caudal extent of the nbm on both sides of the brain, and numbers of nbm neurons with the FG label were counted. The counts were corrected for size differences using standard procedures, and the results expressed as the percent of labeled neurons in the nbm on the lesioned side of each animal relative to the number of labeled neurons in the nbm on the opposite unlesioned side of the brain. Animals receiving compound A had significantly more FG-labeled neurons in the rostral portion of the lesioned nbm (over 400 m from the mid-point of the lesion), compared to lesioned animals receiving vehicle only (FIG. 3 ). At mid-lesion and caudal to the lesion Compound A had a declining effect. These results demonstrate directly that Compound A can prevent the loss of pre-labeled neurons in the nbm that results from excitotoxic damage. Example 4 Long-Lasting Functional Improvement Upon Short Term Dosing with Compound A Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were first trained to alternate responses in a standard rewarded-alternation T-maze task (Hepler et al., J. Neurosci., 5:866-873, 1985). The animals then received bilateral lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis, to impair performance in T-maze tasks (e.g., Salamone et al., Behav. Brain Res., 13:63-70, 1984). Beginning 18 hours after the lesion, the animals received Compound A via subcutaneous injection (0.1 mg/kg) every other day until 12 days post-lesion. Twenty-four hours following the last injection all animals were placed in the T-maze once a day, until their alternation performance reached pre-operative levels, which took anywhere from 3 to 10 days. After reaching criterion, the animals were not further tested for 8-10 weeks. At that point the animals were again placed in the T-maze, once a day until they reached pre-operative performance. The total number of errors the animals committed during this test is shown in FIG. 4 . The lesioned animals receiving vehicle only committed significantly more errors than either unoperated normals or sham-operates, while lesioned animals that received Compound A 10-12 weeks previously were not different from normals. These results demonstrate that Compound A produces a chronic improvement in a behavior reflective of an improvement in attention or memory several months after dosing has ceased. Example 5 Efficiency of Compound A in Entorhinal Cortex Lesion Model Glutamate-containing neurons in layer 2 of the entorhinal cortex project to the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, where they form synapses on the dendrites of the dentate gyrus granule cells. A lesion can be created in layer 2 of entorhinal cortex by stereotaxic injection of the excitotoxin N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA). Under sodium pentobarbitol anesthesia, rats received an injection of NMDA (15 nmols/site) at each of 2 sites in the entorhinal cortex. Two weeks later, the rats were sacrificed and perfused with a 50 mM sodium sulfide solution. The brains were removed, sectioned in the horizontal plane at a thickness of 40 m, and stained with either Cresyl violet or Timmstain. The survival of neurons in layer 2 of entorhinal cortex was assessed in Cresyl violet stained sections, while the integrity of their axon terminals in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus was measured in alternate sections stained with Timms stain. Injection of NMDA destroyed 6211% (s.e.m.) of entorhinal layer 2 and decreased the area of the dentate gyrus middle molecular layer by 196% (s.e.m.). Daily treatment with Compound A (1 mg/kg, s.c.), with the first injection given immediately after injection of NMDA, reduced the loss of entorhinal layer 2 neurons to 2210% (s.e.m.)(p0.05, t test) and prevented the decrease in area of the middle molecular layer (p0.05, t test). Thus, Compound A protected neurons in the entorhinal cortex from an excitotoxic lesion and maintained the integrity of their axon terminals in the dentate gyrus. These data demonstrate the efficacy of Compound A in protecting glutamatergic neurons of the entorhinal cortex. Lesions of entorhinal cortex in animal models have been shown to produce memory deficits, and severe degeneration of these neurons occurs in Alzheimers disease. This supports the position that Compound A is useful in treating neurological disorders that involve loss of or damage to glutamatergic neurons and neurons of the cerebral cortex, including but not limited to Alzheimers disease, stroke and head trauma. Example 6 Effect of Compound A on Acrylamide-Induced peripheral Neuropathy Acrylamide produces a dying back central-peripheral distal neuropathy in humans and animals. The lesion is a mixed sensory/motor neuropathy characterized by weakness, tremor and ataxia in humans. In animals, acrylamide produces changes in behavior (sensory, motor and proprioceptive), histopathology, electrophysiology and weight loss. In the periphery, large diameter, long axon, Ab fibers are preferentially affected by acrylamide. In rats, acrylamide administration produces an axonopathy as measured by increased landing foot spread (LFS), a measure of proprioception. Acrylamide-induced neuropathy is a model of chemically induced toxicity. It differs from other chemically-induced models (such as chemotherapeutic models) in that the duration is relatively short (3 weeks) and the animals are in relatively good health. Acrylamide does not produce gross systemic toxicity. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250 grams at the start of the experiment were used. Acrylamide (50 mg/kg, IP) was administered three times/week for three weeks. The animals were dropped from a height of 30 cm and the distance between the hindfeet was recorded (Edwards, P. M. and Parker, V. H. (1977) A simple, sensitive, and objective method for early assessment of acrylamide neuropathy in rats. Toxicol. Appl Pharmacol, 40:589-591). Compound A (0.1, 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg, s.c. in 5% solutol) was administered once daily for the duration of the experiment. Acrylamide-treated animals had larger distances in the LFS than the vehicle treated animals. Compound A (0.3 mg/kg/day) reduced the magnitude of the increase in LFS produced by acrylamide (FIG. 5 ). These data indicate that Compound A is useful for the treatment of peripheral neuropathies. Example 7 Failure of Compound A to Inhibit Protein Kinase C, In Vitro The protein kinase C assay and the inhibition of protein kinase C by K-252a is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,923,986 and Kase, H. et.al., (eds.) Japan Scientific Societies Press, Tokyo, pp 293-296, (1988). By means of an essentially similar assay, it was found that K-252a inhibits protein kinase C with an IC 50 of 0.028 M while the IC 50 of Compound A is 16.0 M, i.e., 570 fold less active. Compound A has an IC 50 of 139 nM, as an inhibitor of the production of TNF-, and an IC 50 value of 261 nM as an inhibitor of the production of IL-1, concentrations at which Compound A is inactive as an inhibitor of protein kinase C. Example 8 In Vitro Inhibition of TNF- and IL-1 Production by Compound A The ability of Compound A to inhibit the induction of TNF- was demonstrated by use of a standard in vitro pharmacological testing procedure as described below. Stock solutions consisting of 4 mM Compound A, in 100% DMSO, were stored at 4 C. Cell culture medium RPMI 1640 (Media Tech, Herndon, Va.) and fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, Utah) comprised the test medium. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) from E. coli serotype 0.111:B4, extracted with trichloroacetic acid, was used. Stock solutions of LPS were prepared and stored at 4 C. in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). ELISA kits for assaying tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and IL-1 were purchased from Boehringer-Mannheim, (Indianapolis, Ind.) and were used according to the manufacturers instructions. THP-1 cells, a human monocyte-derived cell line, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC TIB 202). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (medium) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 :95% air at 37 C. Experiments were performed in 24 well culture plates (Nunc) with 510 5 THP-1 cells in 1 ml of medium. Cells were incubated with LPS at 2 ug/ml to induce TNF-. After a 3-hr incubation period, the cells and medium were centrifuged at 1,000g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant fluid was either assayed immediately for TNF- or stored at 70 C. and assayed later. Media samples were measured for content of TNF- and IL-1 by Elisa assays. To test Compound A for the ability to inhibit the induction of TNF-, cells were incubated with varying concentrations of Compound A for 1 hr prior to the addition of LPS. Compounds were diluted so that DMSO was never present in the cell culture medium at a concentration higher than 0.1%. Compound A was tested and assayed as described above for its ability to inhibit TNF- and IL-1 production. Example 9 Inhibition of LPS-Induced TNF- and IL-1 in the Serum of Mice. Sixty female C57BL mice (4-6 weeks old) were divided into six groups, each with 10 animals. Three groups (1,3,5) received vehicle only (PBS containing 0.1% TEA (tetraethyl ammonium hydrochloride)), 200 l/mouse via intraperitoneal (ip) administration. The other three groups (2,4,6) received Compound A (30 mg/kg in 200 l, ip) of vehicle (PBS containing 10% of the ethyl ester of 12-hydroxystearic acid; solutol). Two hours later, the animals received by ip administration, 0.1 mg/kg of LPS (groups 1 2), 0.5 mg/kg of LPS (groups 3 4), and 1.0 mg/kg of LPS (groups 5 % 6). Two hours after LPS administration, all of the animals were sacrificed, and plasma samples were obtained and assayed for their TNF-60 and IL-1 content. Assays were carried out as described in Example 8. Data are summarized in Table 4. The numbers in () are the group numbers as described above. N indicates the number of animals from which plasma measurements where made. NDnot done.

As shown in Table 4, LPS administration to the mice caused the production by those mice of TNF-, and the amount of TNF- produced was markedly inhibited by a two hour pretreatment with Compound A. Pretreatment with Compound A also markedly inhibited the production of IL-1, produced in response to the administration of 1.0 mg/kg of LPS. Example 10 Prevention of LPS-Induced Death in Mice Forty mice were divided into three groups, two groups consisting of ten mice and one group of twenty mice. Administrations of vehicles, LPS, and Compound A were intraperitoneal. Group 1 (n10) mice received vehicle (phosphate buffered saline for LPS, 200 l/mouse) at time zero and vehicle for Compound A (200 l/mouse) 2 hours later. Group 2 (n10) mice received the vehicle for Compound A at zero time (200 l/mouse) and LPS (2 mg in 200 l/mouse) for two hours later. Group 3 (n20) received Compound A (30 mg/kg in 200 l of vehicle) at time zero and LPS (2 mg in 200 l/mouse) two hours later. The administration of LPS caused 90% mortality within 20 hours and 100% mortality by 42 hours after administration. In the group of animals which received Compound A two hours prior to receiving LPS, there was 25% mortality at 20 hours after LPS administration, 75% mortality at 42 hours after LPS, and 80% mortality one week after LPS administration. Vehicle treatments were well tolerated and caused no deaths.

The present case claims priority of German Patent Application 19733779.1, filed Aug. 5, 1997, and German Patent Application 19747889.1, filed Oct. 30, 1997, both of which are incorporated by reference. DESCRIPTION The invention relates to compounds of the formula I in which R(1), R(2), R(3), R(4), R(5), R(6), R(7) and R(8) have the meanings indicated in the following, their preparation and their use, in particular in pharmaceuticals. The compounds affect the potassium channel opened by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or the I Ks channel and are outstandingly suitable as pharmaceutical active compounds, for example for the prophylaxis and therapy of cardiovascular disorders, in particular arrhythmias, for the treatment of ulcers of the gastrointestinal region or for the treatment of diarrheal illnesses. In pharmaceutical chemistry, the 4-acylaminochroman derivatives class has been worked on intensively in recent years. The most prominent representative of this class is cromakalim of the formula A (J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1, 1991, 63-70). Cromakalim and other related 4-acylaminochroman derivatives are compounds having a relaxant action on smooth muscular organs, so that they are used for lowering raised blood pressure as a result of vascular muscle relaxation and in the treatment of asthma as a result of the relaxation of the smooth musculature of the airways. It is common to all these preparations that they act at the cellular level, for example, of smooth muscle cells and lead there to an opening of specific ATP-sensitive K channels. The increase in negative charge in the cell (hyperpolarization) induced by the efflux of K ions counteracts via secondary mechanisms the increase in the intracellular Ca 2 concentration and thus cell activation which leads, for example, to muscle contraction. Similar structures to those of the formula I, the so-called pyranopyridines (formula B), are described in the literature. However, we are also dealing here exclusively with 4-acylamino derivatives, which likewise have K-ATP channel-blocking properties. The compounds of the formula I according to the invention differ structurally from these acylamino derivatives, inter alia by the replacement of the acylamino group by a sulfonylamino function. While cromakalim (formula A) and analogous acylamino compounds act as openers of ATP-sensitive K channels, the compounds of the formula I according to the invention having the sulfonylamino structure, however, do not show any opening action on this K (ATP) channel, but surprisingly show a strong and specific blocking (closing) action on a K channel which is opened by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (CAMP) and differs fundamentally from the K (ATP) channel mentioned. More recent investigations show that this K (cAMP) channel identified in colonic tissue is very similar, perhaps even identical, to the I Ks channel identified in the cardiac muscle. In fact, it was possible, for the compounds of the formula I according to the invention, to show a strong blocking action on the I Ks channel in guinea-pig cardio-myocytes and on the I sK channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes. As a result of this blocking of the K (cAMP) channel or of the I Ks channel, the compounds according to the invention display pharmacological actions of high therapeutic utility in the living body.

The invention includes all possible stereoisomers, e.g. enantiomers or diastereomers, and mixtures of two or more stereoisomeric forms, e.g. enantiomers and/or diastereomers, in any desired ratios. The invention thus relates to enantiomers, for example, in enantiomerically pure form, both as levo- and dextrorotatory antipodes, and also in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in different ratios or in the form of racemates. If cis/trans isomerism is present, the invention relates both to the cis form and to the trans form and mixtures of these forms. The preparation of individual stereoisomers can be carried out, if desired, by resolution of a mixture according to customary methods or, for example, by stereoselective synthesis. If mobile hydrogen atoms are present, the present invention also comprises all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the formula I. Alkyl and alkylene chain radicals can be unbranched or branched. The compounds of the formula I can be prepared by different chemical processes to which the invention likewise relates. Thus a compound of the formula I is obtained by a) reacting a compound of the formula II in which R(1), R(2), R(5), R(6), R(7) and R(8) have the meaning indicated in formula I and L is a customary nucleofugic leaving group, in particular F, Cl, Br, I, MeSO 2 O, a p-toluenesulfonyloxy radical, or R(7) and L together are an epoxide ring, in a manner known per se with a sulfonamide or its salt of the formula III in which R(3) and R(4) have the meaning indicated in formula I and M is hydrogen or preferably a metal equivalent, particularly preferably lithium, sodium, or potassium; or by b) reacting a compound of the formula IV in which R(1), R(2), R(4), R(5), R(6), R(7) and R(8) have the meaning indicated in formula I, with a sulfonic acid derivative of the formula V in which R(3) has the meaning indicated in formula I and W is a nucleofugic leaving group, such as fluorine, bromine, 1-imidazolyl, but in particular chlorine; or by c) reacting a compound of the formula VI in which R(1), R(2), R(3), R(5), R(6), R(7), R(8) and M have the meaning indicated, in a manner known per se in the sense of an alkylation reaction with an alkylating agent of the formula VII R(4)LVII in which R(4), with the exception of hydrogen, and L have the meaning indicated above; or by d) carrying out, in a compound of the formula I in which R(1) to R(4), R(7) and R(8) have the meaning indicated, an electrophilic substitution reaction in at least one of the positions R(15), R(16), R(17) of the ring system R(5)-R(6) if this position is hydrogen and the remaining substituents R(1) to R(8) have the meaning indicated in formula I. Procedure a) describes the reaction of a sulfonamide or of one of its salts of the formula III with a reactive heterocycle of the formula II. As the reaction of a sulfonamide III is carried out from the salt form, when using a free sulfonamide (formula III, MH) a sulfonamide salt which is distinguished by higher nucleophilicity and thus by higher reactivity must be generated (formula III, Mcation) by the action of a base. If free sulfonamide (MH) is employed, the deprotonation of the sulfonamide to the salt is carried out in situ, preferably using those bases which are not alkylated or only slightly alkylated themselves, such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, a sterically strongly hindered amine, e.g. dicyclohexylamine, N,N,N-dicyclohexylethylamine or other strong nitrogen bases with low nucleophilicity, for example DBU, N,N,N-triisopropylguanidine, etc. However, it is also possible to employ other customarily used bases for the reaction, such as potassium tert-butoxide, sodium methoxide, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates, alkali metal hydroxides, such as, for example, LiOH, NaOH or KOH, or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, for example Ca(OH) 2 . The reaction is preferably carried out in polar organic solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, tetramethylurea, hexamethylphosphoramide, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, toluene, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as chloroform or methylene chloride, etc. However, the reaction can also be carried out in polar protic solvents, such as water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol or its oligomers and their corresponding hemiethers and ethers. The reaction is carried out in a preferred temperature range from 10 to 140 C., particularly preferably from 20 to 100 C. Favorably, procedure a) can also be carried out under the conditions of a two-phase catalysis. The compounds of the formula II are obtained by methods known from the literature, for example from the corresponding unsaturated compound of formula X by the action of an inorganic or organic peroxide, such as, for example, H 2 O 2 , MCPBA, peracetic acid. The addition of halogen/OH is also possible by the reaction of X with NCS, NBS, chlorine or bromine in aqueous solvents. In the case of the epoxide (R(7) and L form an epoxide ring), this can be prepared from the hydrohalide by elimination of H-halogen using various bases. Advantageously, the reaction is carried out in a solvent which is sufficiently inert to these halogenating or oxidizing reagents, such as, for example, in DMSO or halogenated hydrocarbons, such as, for example, chloroform, methylene chloride. Procedure b) describes the reaction, which is known per se and frequently used, of a reactive sulfonyl compound of the formula V, in particular of a chlorosulfonyl compound (WCl), with an amino derivative of the formula IV to give the corresponding sulfonamide derivative of the formula I. In principle, the reaction can be carried out without solvent, but reactions of this type are in most cases carried out using a solvent. The reaction is preferably carried out using a polar solvent, preferably in the presence of a base which can advantageously be used as a solvent itself, e.g. when using triethylamine, in particular pyridine and its homologs. Solvents likewise used are, for example, water, aliphatic alcohols, e.g. methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, sec-butanol, ethylene glycol and its monomeric and oligomeric monoalkyl and dialkyl ethers, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dialkylated amides such as DMF, DMA, and also TMU and HMPT. The reaction is in this case carried out at a temperature from 0 to 160 C., preferably from 20 to 100 C. The amino derivatives of the formula IV are obtained in a manner known per se from the literature, preferably by reaction of the reactive compounds of the formula 11 where R(1), R(2), R(5), R(6) and L have the meaning indicated in formula I, either with ammonia or an amine of the formula Xl R(4)NH 2 Xl where R(4) has the meaning indicated in formula I. Procedure c) represents the alkylation reaction known per se of a sulfonamide or of one of its salts VI with an alkylating agent of the formula VlI. In accordance with the analogy of the reaction to procedure a), the reaction conditions already described in detail under procedure a) apply to procedure c). The preparation of the sulfonamide derivatives VI and their precursors has already been described in procedure b). The preparation of the alkylating agents VII is carried out according to analogous procedures in the literature or as described under procedure a), preferably from the corresponding hydroxyl compounds (formula VII where L is OH). Procedure d) describes the further chemical conversion of compounds of the formula I according to the invention into other compounds of the formula I by electrophilic substitution reactions in one or more of the positions designated by R(5) to R(8), which in each case are hydrogen. Preferred substitution reactions are 1. aromatic nitration to introduce one or more nitro groups, and their subsequent reduction to NH 2 , 2. aromatic halogenation, in particular for the introduction of chlorine, bromine or iodine, 3. chlorosulfonation by the action of chlorosulfonic acid, for the introduction of a chlorosulfonyl group, 4. the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction to introduce an acyl radical according to methods known from the literature. In all procedures, it may be appropriate to protect functional groups in the molecule temporarily in certain reaction steps. Such protective group techniques are familiar to the person skilled in the art. The choice of a protective group for groups in question and the methods for their introduction and removal are described in the literature and can be adapted to the individual case, where appropriate, without difficulties. It has already been said that the compounds of the formula I surprisingly have a strong and specific blocking (closing) action on a K channel which is opened by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and fundamentally differs from the well-known K (ATP) channel, and that this K (cAMP) channel identified in colonic tissue is very similar, perhaps even identical, to the I Ks channel identified in the cardiac muscle. For the compounds according to the invention, it was possible to show a strong blocking action on the I Ks channel in guinea-pig cardiomyocytes and on the I sK channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes. As a result of this blocking of the K (cAMP) channel or of the I Ks channel, the compounds according to the invention display pharmacological actions of high therapeutic utility in the living body and are outstandingly suitable as pharmaceutical active compounds for the therapy and prophylaxis of various syndromes. The compounds of the formula I according to the invention are thus distinguished as a novel active compound class of potent inhibitors of stimulated gastric acid secretion. The compounds of the formula I are thus useful pharmaceutical active compounds for the therapy and prophylaxis of ulcers of the stomach and of the intestinal region, for example of the duodenum. They are likewise suitable, on account of their strong gastric secretion-inhibiting action, as excellent therapeutics for the therapy and prophylaxis of reflux esophagitis. The compounds of the formula I according to the invention are furthermore distinguished by an antidiarrheal action and are therefore suitable as pharmaceutical active compounds for the therapy and prophylaxis of diarrheal illnesses. The compounds of the formula I according to the invention are furthermore suitable as pharmaceutical active compounds for the therapy and prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders. In particular, they can be used for the therapy and prophylaxis of all types of arrhythmias, including atrial, ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, especially cardiac arrhythmias which can be eliminated by action potential prolongation. They can be specifically used for the therapy and prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutters, and for the therapy and prophylaxis of reentry arrhythmias and for the prevention of sudden heart death as a result of ventricular fibrillation. Although numerous substances having antiarrhythmic activity are already on the market, there is nevertheless no compound which is really satisfactory with respect to activity, range of application and side-effect profile, so that there is furthermore a need for the development of improved antiarrhythmics. The action of numerous known antiarrhythmics of the so-called class IlIl is based on an increase in the myocardial refractory time by prolongation of the action potential duration. This is essentially determined by the extent of repolarizing K streams which flow out of the cell via various K channels. Particularly great importance is ascribed in this context to the so-called delayed rectifier I K , of which two subtypes exist, a rapidly activated I Kr and a slowly activated I Ks . Most known class III antiarrhythmics block I Kr predominantly or exclusively (e.g. dofetilide, d-sotalol). It has been shown, however, that these compounds have an increased proarrhythmic risk at low or normal heart rates, arrhythmias which are designated as Torsades de pointes in particular being observed (D. M. Roden; Current Status of Class III Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy; Am. J. Cardiol. 72 (1993), 44B-49B). In the case of higher heart rates or stimulation of the -receptors, however, the action potential-prolonging action of the I Kr blockers is markedly reduced, which is attributed to the fact that under these conditions the I Ks contributes more strongly to the repolarization. For these reasons, the substances according to the invention, which act as I Ks blockers, have significant advantages compared with the known I Kr blockers. In the meantime, it has also been described that a correlation exists between I Ks channel-inhibitory action and the suppression of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, such as are elicited, for example, by -adrenergic hyperstimulation (e.g. T. J. Colatsky, C. H. Follmer and C. F. Starmer; Channel Specificity in Antiarrhythmic Drug Action; Mechanism of potassium channel block and its role in suppressing and aggravating cardiac arrhythmias; Circulation 82 (1990), 2235-2242; A. E. Busch, K. Malloy, W. J. Groh, M. D. Varnum, J. P. Adelman and J. Maylie; The novel class III antiarrhythmics NE-10064 and NE-10133 inhibit I sK channels in Xenopus oocytes and I Ks in guinea pig cardiac myocytes; Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 202 (1994), 265-270). Moreover, the compounds contribute to a marked improvement of cardiac insufficiency, in particular of congestive heart failure, advantageously in combination with contraction-promoting (positively inotropic) active compounds, e.g. phosphodiesterase inhibitors. In spite of the therapeutically utilizable advantages which can be achieved by a blockade of the I Ks , hitherto only very few compounds have been described which inhibit this subtype of the delayed rectifier. The substance azimilide which is in development admittedly also has a blocking action on the I KS , but mainly blocks the I Kr (selectivity 1:10). WO-A-95/14470 claims the use of benzodiazepines as selective blockers of the I Ks . Further I Ks blockers are described in FEBS Letters 396 (1996), 271-275: Specific blockade of slowly activating I sK channels by chromanols . . . and Pflgers, Arch.Eur. J. Physiol. 429 (1995), 517-530: A new class of inhibitors of cAMP-mediated Cl secretion in rabbit colon, acting by the reduction of cAMP-activated K conductance. The water solubility of the compounds described there, however, is less than that of the compounds of the present invention. The compounds of the formula I according to the invention and their physiologically tolerable salts can thus be used in animals, preferably in mammals, and in particular in humans, as pharmaceuticals per se, in mixtures with one another, or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The present invention also relates to the compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts for use as pharmaceuticals, their use in the therapy and prophylaxis of the syndromes mentioned and their use for the production of medicaments therefor and of medicaments with K channel-blocking action. Furthermore, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions which as active constituent contain an effective dose of at least one compound of the formula I and/or of a physiologically tolerable salt thereof in addition to customary, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, innocuous excipients and auxiliaries. The pharmaceutical preparations normally contain 0.1 to 90 percent by weight of the compounds of the formula I and/or of their physiologically tolerable salts. The pharmaceutical preparations can be prepared in a manner known per se. For this purpose, the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts, together with one or more solid or liquid pharmaceutical excipients and/or auxiliaries and, if desired, in combination with other pharmaceutical active compounds, are brought into a suitable administration form or dosage form which can then be used as a pharmaceutical in human medicine or veterinary medicine. Pharmaceuticals which contain compounds of the formula I according to the invention and/or their physiologically tolerable salts can be administered orally, parenterally, e.g. intravenously, rectally, by inhalation or topically, the preferred administration being dependent on the individual case, e.g. the particular course of the illness to be treated. The person skilled in the art is familiar on the basis of his expert knowledge with the auxiliaries which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulation. Beside solvents, gel-forming agents, suppository bases, tablet auxiliaries and other active compound carriers, it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, flavor corrigents, preservatives, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, buffer substances or colorants. The compounds of the formula I can also be combined with other pharmaceutical active compounds to achieve an advantageous therapeutic effect. Thus in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders advantageous combinations with substances having cardiovascular activity are possible. Possible combination components of this type which are advantageous for cardiovascular disorders are, for example, other antiarrhythmics, i.e. class I, class II or class III antiarrhythmics, such as, for example I Kr channel blockers, e.g. dofetilide, or furthermore hypotensive substances such as ACE inhibitors (for example enalapril, captopril, ramipril), angiotensin antagonists, K channel activators and also alpha- and beta-receptor blockers, but also sympathomimetic compounds and compounds having adrenergic activity, and also Na /H exchange inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and other substances having positively inotropic activity, such as, for example, digitalis glycosides, or diuretics. Combinations with substances having antibiotic activity and with antiulcer agents are furthermore advantageous, for example with H 2 antagonists (e.g. ranitidine, cimetidine, famotidine, etc.), in particular when used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. For an oral administration form, the active compounds are mixed with the additives suitable for this purpose, such as excipients, stabilizers or inert diluents, and brought by the customary methods into the suitable administration forms, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions. Inert excipients which can be used are, for example, gum arabic, magnesia, magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate, lactose, glucose or starch, in particular corn starch. In this case the preparation can be carried out either as dry or as moist granules. Suitable oily excipients or solvents are, for example, vegetable or animal oils, such as sunflower oil or cod-liver oil. Suitable solvents for aqueous or alcoholic solutions are, for example, water, ethanol or sugar solutions or mixtures thereof. Further auxiliaries, also for other administration forms, are, for example, polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols. For subcutaneous or intravenous administration, the active compounds, if desired with the substances customary for this such as solubilizers, emulsifiers or further auxiliaries, are brought into solution, suspension or emulsion. The compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts can also be lyophilized and the lyophilizates obtained can be used, for example, for the production of injection or infusion preparations. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, physiological saline solution or alcohols, e.g. ethanol, propanol, glycerol, in addition also sugar solutions such as glucose or mannitol solutions, or alternatively mixtures of the various solvents mentioned. Suitable pharmaceutical formulations for administration in the form of aerosols or sprays are, for example, solutions, suspensions or emulsions of the active compounds of the formula I or their physiologically tolerable salts in a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as, in particular, ethanol or water, or a mixture of such solvents. If required, the formulation can also additionally contain other pharmaceutical auxiliaries such as surfactants, emulsifiers and stabilizers as well as a propellant. Such a preparation contains the active compound customarily in a concentration from approximately 0.1 to 10, in particular from approximately 0.3 to 3 percent by weight. The dose of the active compound of the formula I or of the physiologically tolerable salts thereof to be administered depends on the individual case and, as customary, is to be adapted for an optimum effect to the conditions of the individual case. Thus it depends, of course, on the frequency of administration and on the potency and duration of action of the compounds employed in each case for therapy or prophylaxis, but also on the nature and severity of the disease to be treated and on the sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated and on whether the therapy is acute or prophylactic. Customarily, the daily dose of a compound of the formula I in the case of administration to a patient approximately 75 kg in weight is at least 0.001 mg/kg of body weight, preferably at least 0.01 mg/kg of body weight, in particular at least 0.1 mg/kg of body weight, up to at most 100 mg/kg of body weight, preferably up to at most 20 mg/kg of body weight, in particular up to at most 1 mg/kg of body weight. In other words, the preferred dose range is from about 0.001 to about 100 mg/kg, more preferrably from about 0.01 to about 20 mg/kg, most preferrably from about 0.1 to about 1 mg/kg. The dose can be administered in the form of an individual dose or divided into several, e.g. two, three or four, individual doses. In particular in the treatment of acute cases of cardiac arrhythmias, for example in an intensive care unit, parenteral administration by injection or infusion, e.g. by an intravenous continuous infusion, can also be advantageous. The compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts selectively inhibit K (cAMP) channels and I Ks channels. On account of this property, apart from use as pharmaceutical active compounds in human medicine and veterinary medicine, they can also be employed as a scientific tool or as aids for biochemical investigations in which an effect on potassium channels is intended, and also for diagnostic purposes, e.g. in the in vitro diagnosis of cell or tissue samples. They can further be employed, as already mentioned above, as intermediates for the preparation of other pharmaceutical active compounds.

Chem. 33 (1990) 3023-3027) in 6 ml of DMSO is added dropwise. The mixture is heated at 60 C. for 4 h and then stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture is added to ice water and extracted with ethyl acetate. After removing the solvent in vacuo, the solid obtained is stirred with a mixture of heptane and ethyl acetate and filtered off with suction. 400 mg (67%) of ethanesulfonic acid (3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrano3,2-cpyridin-4-yl)methylamide are obtained as a solid (m.p. 163 C.).

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compounds having antitumor activity. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions that contain one or more of those compounds, methods of using the compounds to inhibit tumor growth in mammals, and methods of preparing the compounds. Many thousands of people are diagnosed with cancer each year, and although great advances have been made in cancer therapy, the existing treatments are not successful in many cases. Among the problems with existing therapies are (1) anticancer drugs administered to patients often have toxic effects on non-cancerous cells in the patients body, (2) cancerous cells whose growth can be inhibited by certain drugs sometimes become resistant to those drugs, and (3) some cancers cannot be effectively treated with a single drug, and sometimes not even with a combination of different anticancer drugs. A long-standing need exists for new anticancer drugs that have one or more of the following characteristics: (1) ability to inhibit the growth of cancerous cells, (2) acceptable levels of toxicity to non-cancerous cells, (3) effectiveness against cancerous cells that are resistant to other drugs, and (4) a different mechanism of action than existing drugs, so that when the new drug is used in combination with an existing drug, the likelihood of the cancer cells developing cross-resistance is reduced. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention concerns compounds having a formula selected from the group consisting of or salts thereof. In the above formulas, at least one of R 1 -R 13 in formula (I) or at least one of R 1 -R 12 in formula (II) is R 14 Z. R 14 is a substituted or unsubstituted amino or amido group preferably having from 1-12 carbon atoms. Z is a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic group preferably having from 1-12 carbon atoms. The remainder of R 1 -R 13 in formula (I) or R 1 -R 12 in formula (II) are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydroxyl, halogen, nitro, substituted or unsubstituted amino or amido groups preferably having from 1-12 carbon atoms, and alkyl groups preferably having from 1-12 carbon atoms. As mentioned above, salts of the compounds (I) and (II) are part of the present invention. Examples of suitable salts include but are not limited to the hydrochloride, iodide, and methane sulfonate salts. In one embodiment of the invention where the compound has formula I, R 11 is R 14 Z, and R 1 -R 10 and R 12 -R 13 are independently hydrogen, hydroxyl, halogen, nitro, substituted or unsubstituted amino or amido having from 1-12 carbon atoms, or alkyl having 1-12 carbon atoms In another embodiment of the invention where the compound has formula II, R 11 is R 14 Z, and R 1 -R 10 and R 12 are independently hydrogen, hydroxyl, halogen, nitro, substituted or unsubstituted amino or amido having from 1-12 carbon atoms, or alkyl having 1-12 carbon atoms. R 14 preferably has the formula NNHR 15 , where R 15 is a substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic group having from 2-6 carbon atoms. R 15 preferably is selected from the group consisting of NCO(CH 2 ) n CO, N(CH 2 ) m , and CO(CH 2 ) q CHCH(CH 2 ) r CO, where n, m, q, and r are independently a number from 0-6. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, n is from 1-4, m is from 2-6, q is from 0-2, and r is from 0-2. Z preferably is selected from the group consisting of piperidinyl, piperazinyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, pyrrolidinyl, hydroxyetyl piperazinyl, aminoethyl piperazinyl, and aminomethyldihydroxy piperidinyl. Another aspect of the present invention is pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a compound as described above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Yet another aspect of the present invention is a method of inhibiting the growth of tumor cells, in which a tumor-inhibitory amount of a compound as described above is administered to a mammal. Another aspect of the present invention is a method of synthesizing a cyclic hydrocarbon and keto compound. The method comprises the step of reacting a cyclic hydrocarbon compound that comprises at least two rings with a metal bismuthate in the presence of an acid. The metal bismuthate can be for example an alkali metal bismuthate such as sodium bismuthate. As another example, it can be zinc bismuthate. In certain embodiments of this method, the acid can be an organic acid such as acetic acid or a mineral acid such as sulfuric acid. Optionally the reaction can take place in the presence of an organic solvent, such as acetone. The cyclic hydrocarbon reactant preferably comprises from 10-50 carbon atoms. The compounds and compositions of the present invention are useful in cancer therapy, either by themselves or in combination with other antitumor chemotherapy or radiation therapy. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 depicts a synthesis scheme that is described in Example 1. FIGS. 2-4 depict synthesis schemes that are described in Example 2. DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS Polycyclic aromatic compounds are widely distributed in nature and are considered to be among the significant environmental carcinogens 1. Previously, considerable research has been directed towards the synthesis of the polycyclic ring systems 2 and examination of their metabolic activation within target cells. Several hypotheses 3 have been proposed to establish the correlations between the structure of these metabolites, their cellular interactions and carcinogenicity. Eventually, most of the polycyclic metabolic products which act as carcinogens, intercalate with or bind covalently to DNA. Examination of several frequently used antitumor agents revealed two common structural features 4: they have a planar ring system and a, basic side chain. It could be predicted, therefore, that in addition to other cellular interactions these compounds would first demonstrate a strong interaction with the lipid domains of the plasma membranes and other membranes within the cell 5. In some instances, antitumoral, DNA-intercalating drugs have been shown to interact with cell membranes and in some cases have demonstrated antitumor activities without further penetrating the cell structure. This then would put them in a class of drugs that have been called generically membrane stabilizing agents (MSA) 6. These are agents which increase membrane stability against various stressors and often at higher concentration induce membrane destabilization. For example, they may act as anti-hemolytic agents at lower concentrations and cause hemolysis at higher concentrations. In order to determine the importance of these primary interactions with the plasma membrane of tumor cells in antitumor effects, we undertook an exploratory, synthetic and biological evaluation of unique polycyclic aromatic compounds. This was based on our belief that the potential use of such compounds as antitumor agents has not been systematically explored 7, especially when specific modification is applied to enhance the membrane interaction as the primary effector of antitumor activity. On this basis, we began this systematic analysis by synthesizing a number of dibenzofluorpne derivatives and studied their biological effects in vitro on a panel of human tumor cell lines. A number of compounds of the present invention have been prepared, and are listed in Table 1.

Therapeutic compositions containing these compounds will preferably also include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as saline solution, and may also include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and/or additional biologically active substances. The compounds of the present invention can be used in methods of inhibiting the growth of tumor cells in mammals, particularly in humans. Specific human malignancies for which these compounds should be useful include breast, colon, ovarian, and prostate cancers, melanoma, leukemia/lymphomas, and possibly others as well. The compounds are administered to a mammal in an amount effective to inhibit the growth of tumor cells in the mammal. The administration can suitably be parenteral and by intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intralymphatic, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intrapleural, or intrathecal injection. Such administration is preferably repeated on a timed schedule until tumor regression or disappearance has been achieved, and may be used in conjunction with other forms of tumor therapy such as surgery or chemotherapy with different agents. A compound of the present invention is preferably administered in a dose that is between approximately 0.01 and 100 mg/kg of body weight of the mammalian subject. The present invention can be further understood from the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 This example relates to synthesis of polycyclic aromatic ketones. The oxidizing power of sodium bismuthate in acid media is proved by the facile conversion of bivalent manganese salts to heptavalent manganese. 8 In comparison to other, common oxidizing agents, the use of this reagent in synthetic organic chemistry has not been extensively explored. Rigby 9 demonstrated the cleavage of vicinal diols and the conversion of acyloins to -diketones by sodium bismuthate. This reagent was also used for the oxidation of phenols 10, olefins 11 and -ketols. 12 Recently, a few other bismuth derivatives were developed for the oxidation of various functional groups. 13 Oxidation of benzylic methylenes to the ketones by DDQ 14, PCC 15, CrO 3 16, tBuOOH 17, tetrapyridinesilver peroxydisulfate 18 is known in the literature. Recently, Harvey et al 19 reported a new oxidation method with n-Buli in the presence of molecular oxygen. Although this method is attractive, it has several limitations. For example, oxidation of some structurally similar benzylic compounds could not be achieved by this method. Dimer formation in strong basic media was observed and mixtures of products were formed in some cases. Most importantly, extreme precaution has to be taken to get successful results as the method requires absolutely dry and inert media. We have now oxidized benzylic methylenes to ketones under reflux condition, using sodium bismuthate in acetic acid. As shown in FIG. 1 , commercially available tetralin ( 1 ), diphenylmethane ( 5 ), 9-10 dihydroanthracene ( 3 ), dibenzosubcrane ( 9 ) flourene ( 7 a ) and 2-nitroflourene ( 7 b ) were readily converted to the respective ketones 2 , 6 , 4 , 8 a , 8 b and 10 by sodium bismuthate in acetic acid. We selected two synthetic compounds, 2,3-benzo fluorene ( 11 ) and 13H-dibenzoa,gfluorene ( 13 ) reported by Harvey et al 14 for the oxidation study and produced the ketones 12 and 14 in good yield. The presence of acetic acid is required for the completion of the reaction. We found that the progress of the reaction became very slow when carried out without acetic acid. However, use of 10% sulfuric acid did not change the reaction time that was observed with acetic acid. In order to keep the reactants in contact with the oxidizing agent, acetone was added as a co-solvent. Oxidation of 1 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 and 13 produced monoketones 2 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , and 14 in 50-90% yield. The presence of the diketone was not observed in the crude product while compound 3 produced a diketone 4 in 72% yield. No side products such as hydroxy, acetates, quinones or dicarboxylic acid were observed during this oxidaticon. The mechanism of the sodium bismuthate induced oxidation is not firmly established. Oxidation of phenols by sodium bismuthate in neutral aromatic solvent has been shown to proceed by one-electron 10(e) (through a radical intermediate) oxidation. Similar reaction in the presence of acetic acid as the solvent is believed to occur through a two-electron 10(f) (carbonium ion) oxidation process. The suggested mechanism has a close similarity to the chromic acid 20 mediated benzylic oxidation. Thus, we hypothesize that our acid-catalyzed sodium bismuthate induced oxidation of benzylic methylenes may follow one of the processes mentioned above. A representative procedure is as follows: To the starting methylene compound (20 mmol) in acetic acid (4 mL, 50%) and acetone (2 mL), was added sodium bismuthate (80 mmol) and the mixture was heated to reflux under an argon atmosphere. At the end of reaction as indicated by TLC the mixture was filtered through a pad of celite and diluted with water (10 ml). The mixture was extracted with methylene chloride (320 mL). The combined organic layer was washed with sodium bicarbonate solution (310 mL, 10%), brine (10 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resultant crude product was purified by column chromatography. All products have been characterized through a comparison of mp, TLC and NMR with authentic compounds. EXAMPLE 2 This example concerns synthesis of dibenzofluorene derivatives. We have developed a novel oxidation method for the conversion of benzylic methylenes to benzylic ketones in polycyclic systems by sodium bismuthate. Thus, as shown in FIG. 2 , pentacyclic dibenzofluorene 101 was oxidized to the dibenzofluorenone 102 in good yield. We have also shown a facile reduction of the polycyclic aromatic nitro compounds to polycyclic aromatic amines (for example, 3 to 4) by samarium metal in the presence of catalytic amounts of iodine (see FIG. 3 ). Using these two methods, we became interested in examining the anti-tumor effects of structurally complex, angular dibenzofluorene a,g polycyclic systems with a very reactive bridged methylene group. We believe that a bridged unit in the polycyclic aromatic system could play an important role as this can form cation, anion and radical intermediates. This example describes the nitration study of the 13-H dibenzofluorene ( 101 ) and structure-activity relationship studies of several 13-unsubstituted and 13-substituted diarnides ( 110 , 111 and 112 ). We prepared pentacyclic dibenzoa,gfluorene ( 110 ) in 20% yield by following the method reported by Harvey 21. Functionalization of benzene and naphthalene derivatives by electrophilic reaction 22 is routine organic chemistry. The orientation of the electrophile in such monocyclic or bicyclic derivatives is predictable. Similar substitution reaction in polycyclic aromatic system is extremely difficult and the site of attack does not follow any known orientation rule. In fact, very little is known about the electrophilic substitution reaction in polycyclic aromatic system 23. We planned to link a 4-carbon chain side chain with a heterocyclic base at the end to the aromatic ring through nitrogen 24. Therefore, our task was to prepare amino dibenzofluorene 106 for the subsequent derivatization. Towards this goal, we reacted the ketone 102 with nitric acid in acetic acid under different conditions and failed to get any desired nitro derivative. However, the hydrocarbon 101 produced a single, nitro compound 105 with nitric acid-acetic acid at 0-5 C. in 80% yield. (See FIG. 2. ) The location of the nitro group in the aromatic system was determined by nmr spectra. The nmr spectrum (400 MHz) of the known hydrocarbon 101 was taken. Based on the homonuclear decoupling and COSY nmr studies, all the protons in 101 were assigned as follows: (400 MHz, CDCl 3 ): 8.81 (d, 1H, J8.46 Hz, H 7 ), 8.50 (d, 1H, J8.68 Hz, H 6 ), 8.02 (d, J8.22 Hz, H 1 ), 7.89-7.96 (m, 3H, H 4 , H 5 , H 10 ), 7.70 and 7.79 (2H, ABq, J8.23 Hz, H 11 , H 12 ), 7.60-7.65 (m, 1H, H 8 ), 7.45-7.54 (m, 3H, H 2 , H 3 , H 9 ). These assignments were supported by the data reported by Jones et al 25. The nmr spectrum of the nitro compound 105 revealed the absence of the AB quartet which was present in 101 . The spectrum of 105 showed a new singlet at 8.39 and a new doublet at 8.44 (J8.75 Hz). We eliminated positions C 1 , C 4 , C 7 and C 10 for the nitro group because of the singlet at 8.44. The positions C 5 , C 6 , C 8 and C 9 were eliminated based on the homonuclear decoupling and COSY experiment. The region ( 7.5-7.6) of the hydrocarbon 101 remained unaffected in 105 clearly ruled out positions C 2 and C 3 for the nitro group in 105 . We eliminated position C 12 because of the downfield doublet at 8.44. The 13 C nmr spectrum of 105 showed the presence of nine quaternary carbons. The signal at 123.58 due to the C 11 carbon (verified by HETCOR study) was not present in the spectrum of 105 . A new peak at 145.24 appeared because of the nitro group. Thus, we assigned C 11 as the site of the nitro group in 105 based on extensive nmr study. Reduction of the nitro compound 105 to the amino compound 106 was carried out by Pd-C (10%)-ammonium formnate 26, samarium-iodine and Pd-C (10%)-hydrazine hydrate 27. We found hydrazine hydrate and Pd/C (10%) gave the best results. Our next task was to prepare the side chains 109 and to couple them to the amine 106 . (See FIG. 4. ) The acid 108 was prepared by refluxing succinic anhydride ( 107 ) with piperidine ( 108 a ) and N-methylpiperazine ( 108 b ). The amine 106 was then condensed with the side chains 109 by mixed anhydride method. 28 The desired diamides 110 were isolated by column chromatography. The benzylic methylene group in 110 was oxidized by molecular oxygen 29 to get the ketone 111 which was subsequently reduced to the alcohol 112 . All new compounds gave satisfactory spectral data. The compounds of this example (see FIGS. 2 , 3 , and 4 ) correlate to the listing of compounds by Tx number in Table 1 as follows: Compound Compound Tx No. 110a Tx-38 110b Tx-37 111a Tx-51 111b Tx-50 112a Tx-67 112b Tx-66 EXAMPLE 3 Dibenzofluorene In Vitro Cytotoxicity Testing Every dibenzofluorene derivative was tested, as will be described below, against six to eight cultured, tumor cell lines of human and/or animal origin, at least half of which were selected from the NCI panel of test tumors. In each experiment, Adriamycin (ADR) was used as a maximally positive control. Subsequent to our determination that the dibenzofluorene derivative Tx-37 demonstrated consistent, highly positive effects, it was also included in the panel of test agents in every experiment where dibenzofluorene derivatives were tested. In Vitro Cytotoxicity Determinations Data are IC 50 values (MTT assay) reported as g/ml for 72 hours continuous exposure to the drug. Drugs were prepared in DMSO:PEG300 (1:1). Further, dilutions were made in a cell culture medium with fetal bovine serum. Test Tumor Lines BRO human melanoma HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma P388/0 murine lymphatic leukemia MCF-7 human breast carcinoma HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia OVCAR 3 human ovarian carcinoma Additional tumor lines against which the drugs were tested in certain series included L1210 (leukemia), PC3 (prostate) and several others. Compounds were evaluated for solubility characteristics in vehicles which would be appropriate for use in cell culture. The compounds were added to the cell lines under continuous culture for 72 hours. Inhibition of growth relative to control cell culture was determined by the MTT method at the end of 72 hours. This is a test of the relative ability of a compound to inhibit cell growth not survival. However, inhibition of growth may reflect cell death and/or cytostasis. Summarized results of the in vitro cytotoxicity testing, specifically average IC 50 values for the various tumor lines, are given in Table 2. TABLE 2 Agent Runs P388/0 BRO HT-29 MCF-7 OVCAR-3 HL-60 Tx-37 5 2.0 1.8 1.9 3.0 1.9 1.6 Tx-38 3 42.9 46.4 34.4 22.8 39.5 14.9 Tx-47 1 15.4 1.2 16.7 20.2 1.1 1.2 Tx-48 1 71.5 22.6 52.2 18.3 23.4 30.1 Tx-49 1 3.1 2.5 2.5 5.7 2.8 2.5 Tx-50 2 3.7 11.2 10.0 18.1 6.6 4.0 Tx-51 1 55.4 47.2 65.1 27.0 16.2 32.0 Tx-66 1 2.1 6.0 5.9 4.2 2.0 Tx-67 1 9.2 14.7 8.9 8.8 5.6 Tx-68 1 41.7 18.2 31.7 Tx-69 1 41.5 28.9 52.6 An IC 50 value above 50 g/ml indicates that there was insufficient cytotoxicity of the compound to achieve a 50% inhibition of cell growth at 50 g/ml. In some cases, we observed cytotoxicity at 100 g/ml but few of the drugs are readily soluble at this concentration and the data are not reliable. ADR invariably produced the described anti-tumor effect against all tumor lines at concentrations lower than 1 g/ml of culture media. The effect of the Tx-compounds was divided into five activity groups as described below. In all cases, if activity against a single tumor line differed radically from that against all others, notation was made of this specificity but the agent was grouped as determined by the majority of the results. Group A. These agents were effective against all tumor lines at concentrations under 5 g/ml. Some of these compounds were effective at less than 1 log difference from the activity of ADR. Group B. These agents were effective against all tumor lines at less than 10 g/ml. Group C. These agents were effective against one-third to one-half of all tumor lines tested at levels less than 10 g/ml. Group D. These agents were effective against one or two of the six to eight tumor lines tested at concentrations of less than 10 g/ml. Group E. These agents produced some anti-tumor effect at doses above 10 g/ml but less than 20 g/ml. Group F. These agents were effective against some tumor line, above 20 g/ml but often demonstrated no anti-tumor effect. TABLE 3 GROUP A Tx-37 Tx-49 Tx-66 GROUP B Tx-50 Tx-67 GROUP C Tx-47 GROUP E Tx-68 GROUP F Tx-38 Tx-51 Tx-48 Tx-69 In summary of these findings, the most active compound produced in this series was Tx-37, the dibenzofluorene molecule with a terminal N-methyl piperazine heterocyclic ring. While the hydrochloride salt (Tx-49) or the addition of a hydroxyl moiety at position 13 (Tx-66), produced minor change in the activity, the substitution of a ketone moiety at position 13 (Tx-50) produced a slight diminution in activity. The insertion of an unsaturated bond in the alkyl chain at Tx-37 (Tx-47) reduced its activity significantly. Tx-38 with a terminal piperidine heterocyclic ring demonstrated no significant anti-tumor activity and the insertion of an unsaturated bond in this molecule produced little or no change (Tx-48). However, the addition of the hydroxyl moiety at position 13, which caused minor change in Tx-37, greatly increased the activity of Tx-38 (Tx-67). As we have reported in other compounds based on other polycyclic ring structures, those that terminate in a N-methyl piperazine ring again demonstrated far greater activity than those that terminated in a piperidine ring. Thus, Tx-38 and Tx-51 possess little or no activity when compared with the significant activities of Tx-37 and Tx-50 against all tumor lines. Modification of other components of the molecule, however, such as insertion of the hydroxyl moiety at position 13 of Tx-38 (Tx-67) often reduced or eliminated these differences; in this case by greatly enhancing its activity.

and salts thereof, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as active ingredient the compounds of formula (I) and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof inhibit the effects of VEGF, a property of value in the treatment of a number of disease states including cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. This application is the national phase of international application PCT/GB97/00365 filed Feb. 10,1997 which designated the U.S. The present invention relates to quinazoline derivatives, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredient, methods for the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability, to their use as medicaments and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the production of antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effects in warm-blooded animals such as humans. Normal angiogenesis plays an important role in a variety of processes including embryonic development, wound healing and several components of female reproductive function. Undesirable or pathological angiogenesis has been associated with disease states including diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, atheroma, Kaposis sarcoma and haemangioma (Fan et al, 1995, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 16: 57-66; Folkman, 1995, Nature Medicine 1: 27-31). Alteration of vascular permeability is thought to play a role in both normal and pathological physiological processes (Cullinan-Bove et al, 1993) Endocrinology 133: 829-837; Senger et al, 1993, Cancer and Metastasis Reviews. 12: 303-324). Several polypeptides with in vitro endothelial cell growth promoting activity have been identified including, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). By virtue of the restricted expression of its receptors, the growth factor activity of VEGF, in contrast to that of the FGFs, is relatively specific towards endothelial cells. Recent evidence indicates that VEGF is an important stimulator of both normal and pathological angiogenesis (Jakeman et al, 1993, Endocrinology, 133: 848-859; Kolch et al, 1995, Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, 36:139-155) and vascular permeability (Connolly et al, 1989, J. Biol. Chem. 264: 20017-20024). Antagonism of VEGF action by sequestration of VEGF with antibody can result in inhibition of tumour growth (Kim et al, 1993, Nature 362: 841-844). Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are important in the transmission of biochemical signals across the plasma membrane of cells. These transmembrane molecules characteristically consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain connected through a segment in the plasma membrane to an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Binding of ligand to the receptor results in stimulation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity which leads to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on both the receptor and other intracellular molecules. These changes in tyrosine phosphorylation initiate a signalling cascade leading to a variety of cellular responses. To date, at least nineteen distinct RTK subfamilies, defined by amino acid sequence homology, have been identified. One of these subfamilies is presently comprised by the fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Flt or Flt1, the kinase insert domain-containing receptor, KDR (also referred to as Flk-1), and another fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Flt4. Two of these related RTKs, Flt and KDR, have been shown to bind VEGF with high affinity (De Vries et al, 1992, Science 255: 989-991; Terman et al, 1992, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992, 187: 1579-1586). Binding of VEGF to these receptors expressed in heterologous cells has been associated with changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of cellular proteins and calcium fluxes. Compounds which have good activity against epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase are disclosed in the European Patent Publication No 0566226, but there is no disclosure or suggestion that the compounds inhibit the effects of VEGF. European Patent Publication No. 0326330 discloses certain quinoline, quinazoline and cinnoline plant fungicides. Certain of these plant fungicides are also stated to possess insecticidal and miticidal activity. There is however no disclosure or any suggestion that any of the compounds disclosed may be used for any purpose in animals such as humans. In particular, the European Patent Publication contains no teaching whatsoever concerning angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability mediated by growth factors such as VEGF. The present invention is based on the discovery of compounds that surprisingly inhibit the effects of VEGF, a property of value in the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability such as cancer, diabetes, psoriasis. rheumatoid arthritis, Kaposis sarcoma, haemangioma, acute and chronic nephropathies, atheroma, arterial restenosis, autoimmune diseases, acute inflammation and ocular diseases with retinal vessel proliferation. Compounds of the present invention possess higher potency against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase whilst possessing some activity against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, compounds of the present invention, possess substantially higher potency against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase than against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase or FGF R1 receptor tyrosine kinase. Thus compounds of the invention which have been tested possess activity against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase such that they may be used in an amount sufficient to inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase whilst demonstrating no significant activity against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase or FGF R1 receptor tyrosine kinase.

For the avoidance of doubt it is to be understood that where in this specification a group is qualified by hereinbefore defined or defined hereinbefore the said group encompasses the first occurring and broadest definition as well as each and all of the preferred definitions for that group. In this specification the term alkyl includes both straight and branched chain alkyl groups but references to individual alkyl groups such as propyl are specific for the straight chain version only. An analogous convention applies to other generic terms. Unless otherwise stated the term alkyl advantageously refers to chains with 1-6 carbon atoms, preferably 1-4 carbon atoms. In this specification the term alkoxy means an alkyl group as defined hereinbefore linked to an oxygen atom. In this specification the term aryl includes C 6-10 aromatic groups which may, if desired, carry one or more substituents selected from halogeno, alkyl, alkoxy, cyano, nitro or trifluoromethyl (wherein alkyl and alkoxy are as hereinbefore defined). The term aryloxy means an aryl group as defined hereinbefore linked to an oxygen atom. In this specification the term sulphonyloxy includes alkylsulphonyloxy and arylsulphonyloxy wherein alkyl and aryl are as defined hereinbefore. The term alkanoyl as used herein unless otherwise stated includes alkylCO groups in which alkyl is as defined hereinbefore, for example ethanoyl refers to CH 3 CO. In this specification unless stated otherwise the term alkenyl includes both straight and branched chain alkenyl groups but references to individual alkenyl groups such as 2-butenyl are specific for the straight chain version only. Unless otherwise stated the term alkenyl advantageously refers to chains with 2-5 carbon atoms, preferably 3-4 carbon atoms. In this specification unless stated otherwise the term alkynyl includes both straight and branched chain alkynyl groups but references to individual alkynyl groups such as 2-butynyl are specific for the straight chain version only. Unless otherwise stated the term alkynyl advantageously refers to chains with 2-5 carbon atoms, preferably 3-4 carbon atoms. In formula I, as hereinbefore defined, hydrogen will be present at positions 2 and 8 of the quinazoline group. Within the present invention it is to be understood that a quinazoline of the formula I or a salt thereof may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism and that the formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses any tautomeric form which inhibits VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric form utilised within the formulae drawings. It is also to be understood that certain quinazolines of the formula I and salts thereof can exist in solvated as well as unsolvated forms such as, for example, hydrated forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses all such solvated forms which inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity. For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that when X 1 is, for example, a group of formula NR 8 CO, it is the nitrogen atom bearing the R 8 group which is attached to the quinazoline ring and the carbonyl (CO) group is attached to R 4 , whereas when X 1 is, for example, a group of formula CONR 9 , it is the carbonyl group which is attached to the quinazoline ring and the nitrogen atom bearing the R 9 group is attached to R 4 . A similar convention applies to the other two atom X 1 linking groups, such as NR 11 SO 2 and SO 2 NR 10 . When X 1 is NR 7 it is the nitrogen atom bearing the R 7 group which is linked to the quinazoline ring and to R 4 . An analogous convention applies to other groups. It is further to be understood that when X 1 represents NR 7 and R 7 is C 1-3 alkoxyC 2-3 alkyl it is the C 2-3 alkyl moiety which is linked to the nitrogen atom of X 1 and an analogous convention applies to other groups. For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that in a compound of the formula I when R 4 is, for example, a group of formula C 1-5 alkylR 23 , it is the terminal C 1-5 alkyl moiety which is bound to X 1 , similarly when R 4 is, for example, a group of formula C 2-5 alkenylR 23 it is the C 2-5 alkenyl moiety which is bound to X 1 and an analogous convention applies to other groups. When R 4 is a group 1-R 23 prop-1-en-3-yl it is the first carbon to which the group R 23 is attached and it is the third carbon which is linked to X 1 and an analogous convention applies to other groups. The present invention relates to the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined as well as to the salts thereof. Salts for use in pharmaceutical compositions will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, but other salts may be useful in the production of the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the invention may, for example, include acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined which are sufficiently basic to form such salts. Such acid addition salts include for example salts with inorganic or organic acids affording pharmaceutically acceptable anions such as with hydrogen halides (especially hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid of which hydrochloric acid is particularly preferred) or with sulphuric or phosphoric acid, or with trifluoroacetic, citric or maleic acid. In addition where the compounds of formula I are sufficiently acidic, pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be formed with an inorganic or organic base which affords a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. Such salts with inorganic or organic bases include for example an alkali metal salt, such as a sodium or potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt such as a calcium or magnesium salt, an ammonium salt or for example a salt with methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, piperidine, morpholine or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine. A compound of the formula I, or salt thereof, and other compounds of the invention (as hereinafter defined) may be prepared by any process known to be applicable to the preparation of chemically-related compounds. Such processes include, for example, those illustrated in European Patent Applications, Publication Nos. 0520722, 0566226, 0602851 and 0635498. Such processes, are provided as a further feature of the invention and are as described hereinafter. Necessary starting materials may be obtained by standard procedures of organic chemistry. The preparation of such starting materials is described within the accompanying non-limiting Examples. Alternatively necessary starting materials are obtainable by analogous procedures to those illustrated which are within the ordinary skill of an organic chemist. Thus the following processes (a) to (g) and (i) to (v) constitute further features of the present invention. Synthesis of Compounds of Formula I (a) Compounds of the formula I and salts thereof may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formula III: (wherein R 1 , R 2 , X 1 and R 4 are as defined hereinbefore and L 1 is a displaceable moiety), with a compound of the formula IV: (wherein Z, R 3 and m are as defined hereinbefore) whereby to obtain compounds of the formula I and salts thereof. A convenient displaceable moiety L 1 is, for example, a halogeno, alkoxy (preferably C 1-4 alkoxy), aryloxy or sulphonyloxy group, for example a chloro, bromo, methoxy, phenoxy, methanesulphonyloxy or toluene-4-sulphonyloxy group. The reaction is advantageously effected in the presence of either an acid or a base. Such an acid is, for example, an anhydrous inorganic acid such as hydrogen chloride. Such a base is, for example, an organic amine base such as, for example, pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, collidine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine, morpholine, N-methylmorpholine or diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene, or for example, an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carbonate or hydroxide, for example sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. Alternatively such a base, is, for example, an alkali metal hydride, for example sodium hydride, or an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal amide, for example sodium amide or sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide. The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of an inert solvent or diluent, for example an alkanol or ester such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or ethyl acetate, a halogenated solvent such as methylene chloride, trichloromethane or carbon tetrachloride, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxan, an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene, or a dipolar aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one or dimethylsulphoxide. The reaction is conveniently effected at a temperature in the range, for example, 10 to l 50 C., preferably in the range 20 to 80 C. The compound of the invention may be obtained from this process in the form of the free base or alternatively it may be obtained in the form of a salt with the acid of the formula HL 1 wherein L 1 has the meaning defined hereinbefore. When it is desired to obtain the free base from the salt, the salt may be treated with a base as defined hereinbefore using a conventional procedure. (b) Where the group of formula IIa: (wherein R 3 and m are as hereinbefore defined) represents a phenyl group carrying one or more hydroxy groups, a compound of the formula I and salts thereof can be prepared by the deprotection of a compound of formula V: (wherein X 1 , m, R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 and Z are as hereinbefore defined, P represents a phenolic hydroxy protecting group and p 1 is an integer from 1 to 5 equal to the number of protected hydroxy groups and such that mp 1 is equal to the number of R 3 substituents which are not protected hydroxy). The choice of phenolic hydroxy protecting group P is within the standard knowledge of an organic chemist, for example those included in standard texts such as Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis T. W. Greene and R. G. M. Wuts, 2nd Ed. Wiley 1991, including ethers (for example, methyl, methoxymethyl, allyl and benzyl), silyl ethers (for example, t-butyldiphenylsilyl and t-butyldimethylsilyl), esters (for example, acetate and benzoate) and carbonates (for example, methyl and benzyl). The removal of such a phenolic hydroxy protecting group may be effected by any of the procedures known for such a transformation, including those reaction conditions indicated in standard texts such as that indicated hereinbefore, or by a related procedure. The reaction conditions preferably being such that the hydroxy derivative is produced without unwanted reactions at other sites within the starting or product compounds. For example, where the protecting group P is acetate, the transformation may conveniently be effected by treatment of the quinazoline derivative with a base as defined hereinbefore and including ammonia, and its mono and di-alkylated derivatives, preferably in the presence of a protic solvent or co-solvent such as water or an alcohol for example methanol or ethanol. Such a reaction can be effected in the presence of an additional inert solvent or diluent as defined hereinbefore and at a temperature in the range 0 to 50 C. conveniently at about 20 C.

The cyclisation is conveniently effected in the presence of formamide as solvent or in the presence of an inert solvent or diluent such as an ether for example 1,4-dioxan. The cyclisation is conveniently effected at an elevated temperature, preferably in the range 80 to 200 C. The compounds of formula XII may also be prepared by cyclising a compound of the formula XIV, where A 1 is an amino group, with formic acid or an equivalent thereof effective to cause cyclisation whereby a compound of formula XII or salt thereof is obtained. Equivalents of formic acid effective to cause cyclisation include for example a tri-C 1-4 alkoxymethane, for example triethoxymethane and trimethoxymethane. The cyclisation is conveniently effected in the presence of a catalytic amount of an anhydrous acid, such as a sulphonic acid for example p-toluenesulphonic acid, and in the presence of an inert solvent or diluent such as for example a halogenated solvent such as methylene chloride, trichloromethane or carbon tetrachloride, an ether such as diethylether or tetrahydrofuran, or an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene. The cyclisation is conveniently effected at a temperature in the range, for example 10 to 100 C., preferably in the range 20 to 50 C. Compounds of formula XIV and salts thereof, which constitute a further feature of the present invention, may for example be prepared by the reduction of the nitro group in a compound of the formula XV: (wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 4 , X 1 and A 1 are as hereinbefore defined) to yield a compound of formula XIV as hereinbefore defined. The reduction of the nitro group may conveniently be effected by any of the procedures known for such a transformation. The reduction may be carried out, for example, by the hydrogenation of a solution of the nitro compound in the presence of an inert solvent or diluent as defined hereinbefore in the presence of a metal effective to catalyse hydrogenation reactions such as palladium or platinum. A further reducing agent is, for example, an activated metal such as activated iron (produced for example by washing iron powder with a dilute solution of an acid such as hydrochloric acid). Thus, for example, the reduction may be effected by heating the nitro compound and the activated metal in the presence of a solvent or diluent such as a mixture of water and alcohol, for example methanol or ethanol, to a temperature in the range, for example 50 to 150 C., conveniently at about 70 C. Compounds of the formula XV and salts thereof which constitute a further feature of the present invention, may for example be prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formula XVI: (wherein R 1 , R 2 , L 1 and A 1 are as hereinbefore defined) with a compound of the formula IX as hereinbefore defined to give a compound of the formula XV. The reaction of the compounds of formulae XVI and IX is conveniently effected under conditions as described for process (d) hereinbefore. Compounds of formula XV and salts thereof, may for example also be prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formula XVII: (wherein R 1 , R 2 , X 1 and A 1 are as hereinbefore defined with the proviso that X 1 is not CH 2 ) with a compound of the formula VII as hereinbefore defined to yield a compound of formula XV as hereinbefore defined.

A compound of formula XVIII is conveniently used in which L 2 represents a phenoxy group which may if desired carry up to 5 substituents, preferably up to 2 substituents, selected from halogeno, nitro and cyano. The reaction may be conveniently effected under conditions as described for process (c) hereinbefore. The compounds of formula XVIII and salts thereof as hereinbefore defined may for example be prepared by deprotecting a compound of the formula XIX: (wherein R 1 , R 2 , P, X 1 and L 2 are as hereinbefore defined with the proviso that X 1 is not CH 2 ). Deprotection may be effected by techniques well known in the literature, for example where P represents a benzyl group deprotection may be effected by hydrogenolysis or by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid. One compound of formula III may if desired be converted into another compound of formula III in which the moiety L 1 is different. Thus for example a compound of formula III in which L 1 is other than halogeno, for example optionally substituted phenoxy, may be converted to a compound of formula III in which L 1 is halogeno by hydrolysis of a compound of formula III (in which L 1 is other than halogeno) to yield a compound of formula XII as hereinbefore defined, followed by introduction of halide to the compound of formula XII, thus obtained as hereinbefore defined, to yield a compound of formula III in which L 1 represents halogen. (ii) The compounds of formula V and salts thereof, constitute a further feature of the present invention, and may for example be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula III as hereinbefore defined with a compound of the formula XX: (wherein R 3 , m, p 1 , P and Z are as hereinbefore defined).

Compounds of the formula XXVII and salts thereof may be made for example by reacting compounds of the formulae XXII and XXVI as defined hereinbefore, under the conditions described in (c) above. When a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of the formula I is required, it may be obtained, for example, by reaction of said compound with, for example, an acid using a conventional procedure, the acid having a pharmaceutically acceptable anion. Many of the intermediates defined herein are novel, for example, those of the formulae III, V, XII, XIV and XV, and these are provided as a further feature of the invention. Intermediates of the formulae VIII, X, XXI, XXII, XXIV, XXV and XXVII are also provided as a further feature of the invention. The identification of compounds which potently inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity associated with the VEGF receptors such as Fit and/or KDR and which inhibit angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability is desirable and is the subject of the present invention. These properties may be assessed, for example, using one or more of the procedures set out below: (a) In Vitro Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Test This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity. DNA encoding VEGF or epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor cytoplasmic domains may be obtained by total gene synthesis (Edwards M, International Biotechnology Lab 5(3), 19-25, 1987) or by cloning. These may then be expressed in a suitable expression system to obtain polypeptide with tyrosine kinase activity. For example VEGF and EGF receptor cytoplasmic domains, which were obtained by expression of recombinant protein in insect cells, were found to display intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. In the case of the VEGF receptor Flt (Genbank accession number X51602), a 1.7 kb DNA fragment encoding most of the cytoplasmic domain, commencing with methionine 783 and including the termination codon, described by Shibuya et al (Oncogene, 1990, 5: 519-524), was isolated from cDNA and cloned into a baculovirus transplacement vector (for example pAcYM1 (see The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide, L. A. King and R. D. Possee, Chapman and Hall, 1992) or pAc360 or pBlueBacHis (available from Invitrogen Corporation)). This recombinant construct was co-transfected into insect cells (for example Spodoptera frugiperda 21(Sf21)) with viral DNA (eg Pharmingen BaculoGold) to prepare recombinant baculovirus. (Details of the methods for the assembly of recombinant DNA molecules and the preparation and use of recombinant baculovirus can be found in standard texts for example Sambrook et al, 1989, Molecular cloningA Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press and OReilly et al, 1992, Baculovirus Expression VectorsA Laboratory Manual, W.H. Freeman and Co, New York). For other tyrosine kinases for use in assays, cytoplasmic fragments starting from methionine 806 (KDR, Genbank accession number L04947) and methionine 668 (EGF receptor, Genbank accession number X00588) may be cloned and expressed in a similar manner. For expression of cFlt tyrosine kinase activity, Sf21 cells were infected with plaque-pure cFlt recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 3 and harvested 48 hours later. Harvested cells were washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) (10 mM sodium phosphate pH7.4, 138 mM sodium chloride, 2.7 mM potassium chloride) then resuspended in ice cold HNTG/PMSF (20 mM Hepes pH7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 10% v/v glycerol, 1% v/v Triton X100, 1.5 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(aminoethyl ether) N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride); the PMSF is added just before use from a freshly-prepared 100 mM solution in methanol) using 1 ml HNTG/PMSF per 10 million cells. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13,000 rpm at 4 C., the supernatant (enzyme stock) was removed and stored in aliquots at 70 C. Each new batch of stock enzyme was titrated in the assay by dilution with enzyme diluent (100 mM Hepes pH 7.4. 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% v/v Triton X100, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol). For a typical batch, stock enzyme is diluted 1 in 2000 with enzyme diluent and 50 l of dilute enzyme is used for each assay well. A stock of substrate solution was prepared from a random copolymer containing tyrosine, for example Poly (Glu, Ala, Tyr) 6:3:1 (Sigma P3899), stored as 1 mg/ml stock in PBS at 20 C. and diluted 1 in 500 with PBS for plate coating. On the day before the assay 100 l of diluted substrate solution was dispensed into all wells of assay plates (Nunc maxisorp 96-well immunoplates) which were sealed and left overnight at 4 C. On the day of the assay the substrate solution was discarded and the assay plate wells were washed once with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% v/v Tween 20) and once with 50 mM Hepes pH7.4. Test compounds were diluted with 10% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and 25 l of diluted compound was transferred to wells in the washed assay plates. Total control wells contained 10% DMSO instead of compound. Twenty five microliters of 40 mM manganese(II)chloride containing 8 M adenosine-5-triphosphate (ATP) was added to all test wells except blank control wells which contained manganese(II)chloride without ATP. To start the reactions 50 l of freshly diluted enzyme was added to each well and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The liquid was then discarded and the wells were washed twice with PBST. One hundred microliters of mouse IgG anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc. product 05-321), diluted 1 in 6000 with PBST containing 0.5% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA), was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature before discarding the liquid and washing the wells twice with PBST. One hundred microliters of horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-linked sheep anti-mouse Ig antibody (Amersham product NXA 931), diluted 1 in 500 with PBST containing 0.5% w/v BSA, was added and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature before discarding the liquid and washing the wells twice with PBST. One hundred microliters of 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) solution, freshly prepared using one 50 mg ABTS tablet (Boehringer 1204 521) in 50 ml freshly prepared 50 mM phosphate-citrate buffer pH5.00.03% sodium perborate (made with 1 phosphate citrate buffer with sodium perborate (PCSB) capsule (Sigma P4922) per 100 ml distilled water), was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 20-60 minutes at room temperature until the optical density value of the total control wells, measured at 405 nm using a plate reading spectrophotometer, was approximately 10. Blank (no ATP) and total (no compound) control values were used to determine the dilution range of test compound which gave 50% inhibition of enzyme activity. (b) In Vitro HUVEC Proliferation Assay This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the growth factor-stimulated proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). HUVEC cells were isolated in MCDB 131 (Gibco BRL)7.5% v/v foetal calf serum (FCS) and were plated out (at passage 2 to 8), in MCDB 1312% v/v FCS3 g/ml heparin1 g/ml hydrocortisone, at a concentration of 1000 cells/well in 96 well plates. After a minimum of 4 hours they were dosed with the appropriate growth factor (i.e. VEGF 3 ng/ml, EGF 3 ng/ml or b-FGF 0.3 ng/ml) and compound. The cultures were then incubated for 4 days at 37 C. with 7.5% carbon dioxide. On day 4 the cultures were pulsed with 1 Ci/well of tritiated-thymidine (Amersham product TRA 61) and incubated for 4 hours. The cells were harvested using a 96-well plate harvester (Tomtek) and then assayed for incorporation of tritium with a Beta plate counter. Incorporation of radioactivity into cells, expressed as cpm, was used to measure inhibition of growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation by compounds. (c) In Vivo Rat Uterine Oedema Assay This test measures the capacity of compounds to reduce the acute increase in uterine weight in rats which occurs in the first 4-6 hours following oestrogen stimulation. This early increase in uterine weight has long been known to be due to oedema caused by increased permeability of the uterine vasculature and recently Cullinan-Bove and Koos (Endocrinology, 1993,133:829-837) demonstrated a close temporal relationship with increased expression of VEGF mRNA in the uterus. We have found that prior treatment of the rats with a neutralising monoclonal antibody to VEGF significantly reduces the acute increase in uterine weight, confirming that the increase in weight is substantially mediated by VEGF. Groups of 20 to 22-day old rats were treated with a single subcutaneous dose of oestradiol benzoate (2.5 g/rat) in a solvent, or solvent only. The latter served as unstimulated controls. Test compounds were orally administered at various times prior to the administration of oestradiol benzoate. Five hours after the administration of oestradiol benzoate the rats were humanely sacrificed and their uteri were dissected, blotted and weighed. The increase in uterine weight in groups treated with test compound and oestradiol benzoate and with oestradiol benzoate alone was compared using a Student T test. Inhibition of the effect of oestradiol benzoate was considered significant when p0.05. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the formula I as defined hereinbefore or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier. The composition may be in a form suitable for oral administration, for example as a tablet or capsule, for parenteral injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion) for example as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration for example as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration for example as a suppository. In general the above compositions may be prepared in a conventional manner using conventional excipients. The compositions of the present invention are advantageously presented in unit dosage form. The compound will normally be administered to a warm-blooded animal at a unit dose within the range 5-5000 mg per square meter body area of the animal, i.e. approximately 0.1-100 mg/kg. A unit dose in the range, for example, 1-100 mg/kg, preferably 1-50 mg/kg is envisaged and this normally provides a therapeutically-effective dose. A unit dose form such as a tablet or capsule will usually contain, for example 1-250 mg of active ingredient. According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as defined hereinbefore for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy. We have found that compounds of the present invention inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity and are therefore of interest for their antiangiogenic effects and/or their ability to cause a reduction in vascular permeability. A further feature of the present invention is a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use as a medicament, conveniently a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use as a medicament for producing an antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effect in a warm-blooded animal such as a human being. Thus according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided the use of a compound of the formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the production of an antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effect in a warm-blooded animal such as a human being. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a method for producing an antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effect in a warm-blooded animal, such as a human being, in need of such treatment which comprises administering to said animal an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as defined hereinbefore. As stated above the size of the dose required for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of a particular disease state will necessarily be varied depending on the host treated, the route of administration and the severity of the illness being treated. Preferably a daily dose in the range of 1-50 mg/kg is employed. However the daily dose will necessarily be varied depending upon the host treated, the particular route of administration, and the severity of the illness being treated. Accordingly the optimum dosage may be determined by the practitioner who is treating any particular patient. The antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing treatment defined hereinbefore may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve, in addition to a compound of the invention, one or more other substances and/or treatments. Such conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate administration of the individual components of the treatment. In the field of medical oncology it is normal practice to use a combination of different forms of treatment to treat each patient with cancer. In medical oncology the other component(s) of such conjoint treatment in addition to the antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing treatment defined hereinbefore may be: surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Such chemotherapy may cover three main categories of therapeutic agent: (i) other antiangiogenic agents that work by different mechanisms from those defined hereinbefore (for example linomide, inhibitors of integrin v3 function, angiostatin, razoxin. thalidomide); (ii) cytostatic agents such as antioestrogens (for example tamoxifen, toremifene, raloxifene, droloxifene, iodoxyfene), progestogens (for example megestrol acetate), aromatase inhibitors (for example anastrozole, letrazole, vorazole, exemestane), antiprogestogens, antiandrogens (for example flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide, cyproterone acetate), LHRH agonists and antagonists (for example goserelin acetate, luprolide), inhibitors of testosterone 5-dihydroreductase (for example finasteride), anti-invasion agents (for example metalloproteinase inhibitors like marimastat and inhibitors of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor fluction) and inhibitors of growth factor function, (such growth factors include for example EGF, FGFs, platelet derived growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor such inhibitors include growth factor antibodies, growth factor receptor antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and serine/threonine kinase inhibitors); and (iii) antiproliferative/antineoplastic drugs and combinations thereof, as used in medical oncology, such as antimetabolites (for example antifolates like methotrexate, fluoropyrimidines like 5-fluorouracil, purine and adenosine analogues, cytosine arabinoside); antitumour antibiotics (for example anthracyclines like doxorubicin, daunomycin, epirubicin and idarubicin, mitomycin-C, dactinomycin, mithramycin); platinum derivatives (for example cisplatin, carboplatin); alkylating agents (for example nitrogen mustard, melphalan, chlorambucil, busulphan, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, nitrosoureas, thiotepa); antimitotic agents (for example vinca alkaloids like vincrisitine and taxoids like taxol, taxotere); topoisomerase inhibitors (for example epipodophyllotoxins like etoposide and teniposide, amsacrine, topotecan). As stated above the compounds defined in the present invention are of interest for their antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effects. Such compounds of the invention are expected to be useful in a wide range of disease states including cancer, diabetes, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Kaposis sarcoma, haemangioma, acute and chronic nephropathies, atheroma, arterial restenosis, autoimmune diseases, acute inflammation and ocular diseases with retinal vessel proliferation. In particular such compounds of the invention are expected to slow advantageously the growth of primary and recurrent solid tumours of, for example, the colon, breast, prostate, lungs and skin. More particularly such compounds of the invention are expected to inhibit the growth of those primary and recurrent solid tumours which are associated with VEGF, especially those tumours which are significantly dependent on VEGF for their growth and spread, including for example, certain tumours of the colon, breast, prostate, lung, vulva and skin. In addition to their use in therapeutic medicine, the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are also useful as pharmacological tools in the development and standardisation of in vitro and in vivo test systems for the evaluation of the effects of inhibitors of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity in laboratory animals such as cats, dogs, rabbits, monkeys, rats and mice, as part of the search for new therapeutic agents. It is to be understood that where the term ether is used anywhere in this specification it refers to diethyl ether. The invention will now be illustrated in the following non-limiting Examples in which, unless otherwise stated: (i) evaporations were carried out by rotary evaporation in vacuo and work-up procedures were carried out after removal of residual solids such as drying agents by filtration; (ii) operations were carried out at ambient temperature, that is in the range 18-25 C. and under an atmosphere of an inert gas such as argon; (iii) column chromatography (by the flash procedure) and medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) were performed on Merck Kieselgel silica (Art. 9385) or Merck Lichroprep RP-18 (Art. 9303) reversed-phase silica obtained from E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany; (iv) yields are given for illustration only and are not necessarily the maximum attainable; (v) melting points are uncorrected and were determined using a Mettler SP62 automatic melting point apparatus, an oil-bath apparatus or a Koffler hot plate apparatus.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to treating various disorders associated with the activity of the kinase p38-. More specifically, it concerns compounds that are derivatives of quinazoline as useful in these methods. BACKGROUND ART A large number of chronic and acute conditions have been recognized to be associated with perturbation of the inflamniatory response. A large number of cytokines participate in this response, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF. It appears that the activity of these cytokines in the regulation of inflammation rely at least in part on the activation of an enzyme on the cell signaling pathway, a member of the MAP kinase family generally known as p38 and alternatively known as CSBP and RK. This kinase is activated by dual phosphorylation after stimulation by physiochemical stress, treatment with lipopolysaccharides or with proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF. Therefore, inhibitors of the kinase activity of p38 are useful antiinflammatory agents. PCT applications WO98/06715, WO98/07425, and WO 96/40143, all of which are incorporated herein by reference, describe the relationship of p38 kinase inhibitors with various disease states. As mentioned in these applications, inhibitors of p38 kinase are useful in treating a variety of diseases associated with chronic inflammation. These applications list rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions, sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, Gramnegative sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, asthma, adult respiratory distress syndrome, stroke, reperfusion injury, CNS injuries such as neural trauma and ischemia, psoriasis, restenosis, cerebral malaria, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcosis, bone resorption diseases such as osteoporosis, graft-versus-host reaction, Crohns Disease, ulcerative colitis including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and pyresis. The above-referenced PCT applications disclose compounds which are p38 kinase inhibitors said to be useful in treating these disease states. These compounds are either imidazoles or are indoles substituted at the 3- or 4-position with a piperazine ring linked through a carboxamide linkage. Additional compounds which are conjugates of piperazines with indoles are described as insecticides in WO97/26252, also incorporated herein by reference. The compounds of the invention are quinazoline derivatives. Other quinazoline compounds for other uses have been described. U.S. Pat.

Thus, in one aspect, the invention is directed to compounds of the formula set forth above. In other aspects, the invention is directed to methods to produce these compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to methods of treating inflammation using these compounds. The invention is also directed to treating conditions associated with cardiac failure using the invention compounds. MODES OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The compounds of formula (1) are useful in treating conditions which are characterized by overactivity of p38 kinase, and in particular the -isoform. The compounds are derivatives of quinazoline containing mandatory substituents at the 2- and 4-positions. With respect to the substituted amino substituent at the 4-position of the quinazoline, the preferred embodiment of R 1 is H, but R 1 may also be alkyl (1-6C) or arylalkyl where the aryl moiety may be substituted by 1-2 groups, preferably alkyl (1-6C), OR, SR or NR 2 wherein R is H or lower alkyl (1-4C). Preferably, R 1 is H or alkyl (1-6C). n may be 0-2, and is preferably 0 or 1 and most preferably 0. Ar is preferably indolyl, 6-pyrimidyl, or 3- or 4-pyridyl, or is optionally substituted phenyl. For embodiments wherein Ar is optionally substituted phenyl, preferred substituents include halo, OR, SR, and NR 2 wherein R is H or methyl or ethyl. Particularly preferred is 3- or 4-pyridyl, especially 4-pyridyl in unsubstituted form. These substituents may occupy all five positions of the phenyl ring, preferably 1-2 positions, preferably one position. Any of the aryl moieties, especially the phenyl moieties may also comprise two substituents which, when taken together, form a 5-7 membered carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring. Thus, preferred embodiments of the substituents at the 4-position of the quinazoline include 2-(4-pyridyl)ethylamino; 4-pyridylamino; 3-pyridylamino; 2-pyridylamino; 4-indolylamino; 5-indolylamino; 3-methoxyanilinyl; 2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)ethylamino-, and the like. Preferred embodiments of R 3 , the substituent at the 2-position of the quinazoline comprise a phenyl moiety optionally substituted with 1-2 substituents preferably halo, alkyl (1-6C), OR, NR 2 , and SR wherein R is as defined above. Preferred substituents at the 2-position of the quinazoline include phenyl, 2-bromophenyl, 2-chlorophenyl, 2-fluorophenyl, 2-methylphenyl, 4-fluorophenyl and the like. Other preferred embodiments of R 3 comprise a cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl moiety. As noted above, R 2 is a noninterfering substituent. A noninterfering substituent is one whose presence does not substantially destroy the p38- kinase inhibiting ability of the compound of formula (1) as compared to the case wherein m is 0. With respect to the nature of the noninterfering substituents, preferably they are selected from R 4 , halo, OR 4 , NR 4 2 , SR 4 , OOCR 4 , NR 4 OCR 4 , COOR 4 , R 4 CO, CONR 4 2 , SO 2 NR 4 2 , CN, CF 3 , and NO 2 , wherein each R 4 is independently H, or optionally substituted alkyl (1-6C), or optionally substituted arylalkyl (7-12C) and wherein two R 2 taken together may form a fused ring of 5-7 members. More preferred substituents represented by R 2 are those as set forth with regard to the phenyl moieties contained in Ar or R 3 as set forth above. m may be 0-4 and is preferably 0-2, and most preferably 1 or 0. When m is 2, two substituents taken together may form a carbocyclic or heterocyclic fused ring of 5-7 atoms. When m is 1, however, preferred substituents are of the formula R 4 , OR 4 , SR 4 or R 4 NH, especially R 4 NH, wherein R 4 is defined as above. Particularly preferred are instances wherein R 4 is substituted arylalkyl. The compounds of formula (1) may be supplied in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition salts including salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, or phosphoric acid or salts of organic acids such as acetic, tartaric, succinic, benzoic, salicylic, and the like. If a carboxyl moiety is present on the compound of formula (1), the compound may also be supplied as a salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. SYNTHESIS OF THE INVENTION COMPOUNDS The compounds of the invention may be synthesized from the corresponding 4-halo-2-phenyl quinazoline as described in Reaction Scheme 1; which may be obtained from the corresponding 4-hydroxyquinazoline as shown in Reaction Scheme 2. Alternatively, the compounds can be prepared using anthranylamide as a starting material and benzoylating the amino group followed by cyclization to obtain the intermediate 2-phenyl-4-hydroxy quinazoline as shown in Reaction Scheme 3. The compounds of the invention wherein R 1 is H can be further derivatized to comprise other embodiments of R 1 as shown in Reaction Scheme 4. It is seen that Reaction Scheme 1 represents the last step of both Reaction Schemes 2 and 3 and that Reaction Scheme 2 represents the last two steps of Reaction Scheme 3. Reaction Scheme 4 provides conditions wherein compounds of formula (1) are obtained wherein R 1 is other than H. Reaction Scheme 5 shows a modified form of Reaction Scheme 3 which includes substituents R 2 in the quinazoline ring of formula (1). The substituents are carried throughout the reaction scheme. In step a, the starting material is treated with thionyl chloride in the presence of methanol and refluxed for 12 hours. In step b, the appropriate substituted benzoyl chloride is reacted with the product of step a by treating with the appropriately substituted benzoyl chloride in pyridine for 24 hours. In embodiments wherein X (shown illustratively in the ortho-position) is fluoro, 2-fluorobenzoyl chloride is used as a reagent; where X is (for illustration ortho-chloro), 2-chlorobenzoyl chloride is used. In step c, the ester is converted to the amide by treating in ammonium hydroxide in an aprotic solvent such as dimethyl formamide (DMF) for 24 hours. The product is then cyclized in step d by treatment with 10 N NaOH in ethanol and refluxed for 3 hours. The resulting cyclized form is then converted to the chloride in step e by treating with thionyl chloride in chloroform in the presence of a catalytic amount of DMF under reflux for 4 hours. Finally, the illustrated 4-pyridylamino compound is obtained in step f by treating with 4-amino pyridine in the presence of potassium carbonate and DMF and refluxed for 2 hours. In illustrative embodiments of Reaction Scheme 5, R 2 m may be, for example, dimethoxy so that the starting material is 2-amino-4,5-dimethoxy benzoic acid and the product is, for example, 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-4-(4-pyridylamino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline. In another illustrative embodiment, R 2 is nitro and m is 1; the starting material is thus, for example, 2-amino-5-nitrobenzoic acid and the resulting compound is, for example, 2(2-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-pyridylamino)-5-nitroquinazoline. In compounds of the invention wherein R 2 is nitro, the nitro group may, of course, be reduced to amino and further derivatized as indicated in Reaction Scheme 6. In Reaction Scheme 6, the illustrative product of Reaction Scheme 5 is first reduced in step g by treating with hydrogen and palladium on carbon (10%) in the presence of acetic acid and methanol at atmospheric pressure for 12 hours to obtain the amino compound. The resulting amino compound is either converted to the acyl form (Racyl) using the appropriate acid chloride in the presence of chloroform and pyridine for four hours, or is converted to the corresponding alkylated amine (Ralkyl) by treating the amine intermediate with the appropriate aldehyde in the presence of ethanol, acetic acid, and sodium triacetoxyborohydride for 4 hours. While the foregoing exemplary Reaction Schemes are set forth to illustrate the synthetic methods of the invention, it is understood that the substituents shown on the quinazoline ring of the products are generically of the formula (1) as described herein and that the reactants may be substituted accordingly. Variations to accommodate various substituents which represent embodiments of R 3 other than the moieties shown in these illustrative examples or as Ar in these illustrative examples may also be used. Similarly, embodiments wherein the substituent at position 4 contains an arylalkyl (i.e., wherein n is 1 or 2) can be used in these schemes. Methods to synthesize the compounds of the invention are, in general, known in the art. Administration and Use The compounds of the invention are useful in treating conditions associated with inflammation. Thus, the compounds of formula (1) or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are used in the manufacture of a medicament for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of mammals, including humans, in respect of conditions characterized by excessive production of cytokines and/or inappropriate or unregulated cytokine activity on such cells as cardiomyocytes, cardiofibroblasts and macrophages. The compounds of the invention inhibit the production of cytokines such as TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8, cytokines that are important proinflammatory constituents in many different disease states and syndromes. Thus, inhibition of these cytokines has benefit in controlling and mitigating many diseases. The compounds of the invention are shown herein to inhibit a member of the MAP kinase family variously called p38 MAPK (or p38), CSBP, or SAPK-2. The activation of this protein has been shown to accompany exacerbation of the diseases in response to stress caused, for example, by treatment with lipopolysaccharides or cytokines such as TNF and IL-1. Inhibition of p38 activity, therefore, is predictive of the ability of a medicament to provide a beneficial effect in treating diseases such as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, vasculitis, restenosis, such as occurs following coronary angioplasty, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions, multiple sclerosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), silicosis, pulmonary sarcosis, sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, toxic shock syndrome, heart and brain failure (stroke) that are characterized by ischemia and reperfusion injury, surgical procedures, such as transplantation procedures and graft rejections, cardiopulmonary bypass, coronary artery bypass graft, CNS injuries, including open and closed head trauma, inflammatory eye conditions such as conjunctivitis and uveitis, acute renal failure, glomerulonephritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis, graft vs. host disease, bone resorption diseases like osteoporosis, type II diabetes, pyresis, psoriasis, cachexia, viral diseases such as those caused by HIV, CMV, and Herpes, and cerebral malaria. Within the last several years, p38 has been shown to comprise a group of MAP kinases designated p38-, p38-, p38- and p38-. Jiang, Y. et al. J Biol Chem (1996) 271:17920-17926 reported characterization of p38- as a 372-amino acid protein closely related to p38-. In comparing the activity of p38- with that of p38-, the authors state that while both are activated by proinflammatory cytokines and environmental stress, p38- was preferentially activated by MAP kinase kinase-6 (MKK6) and preferentially activated transcription factor 2, thus suggesting that separate mechanisms for action may be associated with these forms. Kumar, S. et al. Biochem Biophys Res Comm (1997) 235:533-538 and Stein, B. et al. J Biol Chem (1997) 272:19509-19517 reported a second isoform of p38-, p38-2, containing 364 amino acids with 73% identity to p38-. All of these reports show evidence that p38- is activated by proinflammatory cytokines and environmental stress, although the second reported p38- isoform, p38-2, appears to be preferentially expressed in the CNS, heart and skeletal muscle compared to the more ubiquitous tissue expression of p38-. Furthermore, activated transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) was observed to be a better substrate for p38-2 than for p38-, thus suggesting that separate mechanisms of action may be associated with these forms. The physiological role of p38-1 has been called into question by the latter two reports since it cannot be found in human tissue and does not exhibit appreciable kinase activity with the substrates of p38-. The identification of p38- was reported by Li, Z. et al. Biochem Biophys Res Comm (1996) 228:334-340 and of p38- by Wang, X., et al., J Biol Chem (1997) 272:23668-23674 and by Kumar, S., et al., Biochem Biophys Res Comm (1997) 235:533-538. The data suggest that these two p38 isoforms ( and ) represent a unique subset of the MAPK family based on their tissue expression patterns, substrate utilization, response to direct and indirect stimuli, and susceptibility to kinase inhibitors. Various results with regard to response to drugs targeting the p38 family as between p38- and either the putative p38-1 or p38-2 or both were reported by Jiang, Kumar, and Stein cited above as well as by Eyers, P. A. et al. Chem and Biol (1995) 5:321-328. An additional paper by Wang, Y. et al. J Biol Chem (1998) 273:2161-2168 suggests the significance of such differential effects. As pointed out by Wang, a number of stimuli, such as myocardial infarction, hypertension, valvular diseases, viral myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy lead to an increase in cardiac workload and elevated mechanical stress on cardiomyocytes. These are said to lead to an adaptive hypertrophic response which, if not controlled, has decidedly negative consequences. Wang cites previous studies which have shown that in ischemia reperfusion treated hearts, p38 MAPK activities are elevated in association with hypertrophy and programmed cell death. Wang shows in the cited paper that activation of p38- activity results in hypertrophy, whereas activation of p38- activity leads to myocyte apoptosis. Thus, selective inhibition of p38- activity as compared to p38- activity will be of benefit in treating conditions associated with cardiac failure. These conditions include congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, vasculitis, vascular restenosis, valvular disease, conditions associated with cardiopulmonary bypass, coronary artery bypass, grafts and vascular grafts. Further, to the extent that the -isoform is toxic in other muscle cell types, -selective inhibitors would be useful for conditions associated with cachexia attributed to TNF or other conditions such as cancer, infection, or autoimmune disease. Thus, the invention encompasses the use of compounds which selectively inhibit the activity of the p38- isoform for treating conditions associated with activation of p38-, in particular those associated with cardiac hypertrophy, ischemia or other environmental stress such as oxidation injury, hyperosmolarity or other agents or factors that activate p38- kinase, or cardiac failure, for example, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy and myocarditis. The manner of administration and formulation of the compounds useful in the invention and their related compounds will depend on the nature of the condition, the severity of the condition, the particular subject to be treated, and the judgement of the practitioner; formulation will depend on mode of administration. As the compounds of the invention are small molecules, they are conveniently administered by oral administration by compounding them with suitable pharmaceutical excipients so as to provide tablets, capsules, syrups, and the like. Suitable formulations for oral administration may also include minor components such as buffers, flavoring agents and the like. Typically, the amount of active ingredient in the formulations will be in the range of 5%-95% of the total formulation, but wide variation is permitted depending on the carrier. Suitable carriers include sucrose, pectin, magnesium stearate, lactose, peanut oil, olive oil, water, and the like. The compounds useful in the invention may also be administered through suppositories or other transmucosal vehicles. Typically, such formulations will include excipients that facilitate the passage of the compound through the mucosa such as pharmaceutically acceptable detergents. The compounds may also be administered topically, for topical conditions such as psoriasis, or in formulation intended to penetrate the skin. These include lotions, creams, ointments and the like which can be formulated by known methods. The compounds may also be administered by injection, including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection. Typical formulations for such use are liquid formulations in isotonic vehicles such as Hanks solution or Ringers solution. Alternative formulations include nasal sprays, liposomal formulations, slow-release formulations, and the like, as are known in the art. Any suitable formulation may be used. A compendium of art-known formulations is found in Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences , latest edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. Reference to this manual is routine in the art. The dosages of the compounds of the invention will depend on a number of factors which will vary from patient to patient. However, it is believed that generally, the daily oral dosage will utilize 0.001-100 mg/kg total body weight, preferably from 0.01-50 mg/kg and more preferably about 0.01 mg/kg-10 mg/kg. The dose regimen will vary, however, depending on the conditions being treated and the judgment of the practitioner. As implicated above, although the compounds of the invention may be used in humans, they are also available for veterinary use in treating animal subjects. The following examples are intended to illustrate but not to limit the invention. EXAMPLE 1 Synthesis of 4-(4-pyridylamino)-2-phenyl quinazoline This example illustrates Reaction Scheme 1.

Recrystallization from methanol provided the product as a white solid that was found to be homogenous by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and confirmed by EIMS. EXAMPLE 5 Synthesis of 4-(4-Methoxybenzyl-4-pyridylamino)-2-phenyl quinazoline 4-(4-pyridylamino)-2-phenyl quinazoline, 1 equivalent, was dissolved in reagent grade acetone, to this was added 5 equivalents of potassium hydroxide and 1.5 equivalents of 4-methoxybenzyl chloride. The mixture was refluxed under nitrogen for 4 hours. After cooling to room temperature the reaction mixture was concentrated and the residue taken up in ethyl acetate and washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated to give an oil. This crude material was dissolved in ethyl acetate and chromatographed as in Example 1. EIMS confirmed the product. EXAMPLE 6 Assay for p38 Kinase Inhibition The compounds to be tested were solubilized in DMSO and diluted into water to the desired concentrations. The p38 kinase was diluted to 10 g/ml into a buffer containing 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 25 mM beta-glycerol phosphate, 2 mg/ml gelatin, 0.5 mM EGTA, and 4 mM DTT. The reaction was carried out by mixing 20 l test compound with 10 l of a substrate cocktail containing 500 g/ml peptide substrate and 0.2 mM ATP (200 Ci/ml gamma-32P-ATP) in a 4 assay buffer. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 l of p38 kinase. Final assay conditions were 25 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 26.25 mM beta-glycerol phosphate, 80 mM KCI, 22 mM MgCl 2 , 3 mM MgSO 4 , 1 mg/ml gelatin, 0.625 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 125 g/ml peptide substrate, 50 M ATP, and 2.5 g/ml enzyme. After a 40 minute incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 l per reaction of 0.25 M phosphoric acid. A portion of the reaction was spotted onto a disk of P81 phosphocellulose paper, the filters were dried for 2 minutes and then washed 4 in 75 mM H 3 PO 4 . The filters were rinsed briefly in 95% ethanol, dried, then placed in scintillation vials with liquid scintillation cocktail. Alternatively, the substrate is previously biotinylated and the resulting reactions are spotted on SAM 2 streptavidin filter squares (Promega). The filters are washed 4 in 2M NaCl, 4 in 2M NaCl with 1% phosphoric acid, 2 in water, and briefly in 95% ethanol. The filter squares are dried and placed in scintillation vials with liquid scintillation cocktail. Counts incorporated are determined on a scintillation counter. Relative enzyme activity is calculated by subtracting background counts (counts measured in the absence of enzyme) from each result, and comparing the resulting counts to those obtained in the absence of inhibitor. IC 50 values were determined with curve-fitting plots available with common software packages. Approximate IC 50 values were calculated using formula IC 50 (app)A i /(1A) where Afractional activity and itotal inhibitor concentration. The results, where lC 50 has been calculated, are as follows: TABLE 2 Com- pound M IC 50 No. Compound Name vs p38- 16 2-phenyl-4-(4-pyridylmethylamino)-quinazoline 1.2 7 2-phenyl-4-(4-pyridylamino)-quinazoline 0.457 8 2-(4-fluorophenyl)-(4-pyridylamino)-quinazoline 0.439 1 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-(4-pyridylamino)-quinazoline 0.137- (.202) 30 2-phenyl-4-(3-methoxyanilinyl)-quinazoline 0.578 5 2-(2-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-pyridylamino)-quinazoline 0.114 4 2-(2-bromophenyl)-4-(4-pyridylamino)-quinazoline 0.285 3 2-(2-methylphenyl)-4-(4-pyridylamino)-quinazoline 0.345 40 2-(2-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-pyridylamino)-6-amino 0.168 quinazoline The compounds in Table 3 have been assessed in terms of percent inhibition of p38- activity in the presence of 15 M concentration.

"Compound corresponding to the general formula (I) in which R 1 represents a hydrogen atom, a (C 1 -C 4 )alkyl group or a phenyl(C 1 -C 4 )alkyl group, R 2 represents a hydrogen atom or a (C 1 -C 4 ) alkyl group, and R 3 , R 4 and R 5 each represent a hydrogen or halogen atom or a trifluoromethyl, cyano, hydroxyl, (C 1 -C 6 )alkyl or (C 1 -C 6 ) alkoxy group. This application is a 371 of PCT/FR98/01446 filed Jul. 07, 1998, now WO 99/02517 published Jan. 21, 1999. The present invention relates to the compounds of general formula (I) in which R 1 represents a hydrogen atom, a (C 1 -C 4 )alkyl group or a phenyl(C 1 -C 4 )alkyl group, R 2 represents a hydrogen atom or a (C 1 -C 4 ) alkyl group, and R 3 , R 4 and R 5 each represent, independently of each other, a hydrogen or halogen atom or a trifluoromethyl, cyano, hydroxyl, (C 1 -C 6 )alkyl or (C 1 -C 6 )alkoxy group. When R 2 represents a hydrogen atom, the molecules of general formula (I) contain two asymmetric carbon atoms, i.e. the carbon atom in position 6 and the carbon atom of the pyrrolidine ring to which it is attached; for the same combination of substituents R 1 , R 3 , R 4 and R 5 , the compounds of the invention can thus exist in the form of 4 different isomers. When R 2 is other than a hydrogen atom, the carbon atom in position 7 is also asymmetric; for the same combination of substituents R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 and R 5 , the compounds of the invention can thus exist in the form of 8 different optical isomers. The compounds of the invention can also exist in the form of bases or addition salts with acids. In accordance with the invention, the compounds of general formula (I) can be prepared according to a process illustrated by the scheme which follows. A derivative of general formula (II), in which X represents a halogen atom and R 2 , R 3 , R 4 and R 5 are as defined above, is reacted with diethyl propanedioate in basic medium in order to obtain, via a bis-alkylation, a cyclized diester of general formula (III), which is saponified under acidic conditions, or optionally under basic conditions, into an acid of general formula (IV) in which Y represents a hydroxyl group; this acid can be converted into an ester of general formula (IV) in which Y represents an alkoxy group, or alternatively into a Weinreb amide of general formula (IV) in which Y represents an (N-alkoxy)alkylamino group. The derivative of general formula (IV) is then treated either according to the method described in Tetrahedron Lett., (1984) 25(46) 5271, or according to the method described in J. Med. Chem. (1997) 39 3235. According to the first method, the derivative of general formula (IV) is reacted with the organomagnesium reagent derived from 3-bromopropanamine, in which the amine function is protected with a silyl function, after which this function is hydrolysed in acidic medium; according to the second method, the derivative of general formula (IV) is reacted with N-vinylpyrrolid-2-one under basic conditions in order to form an intermediate which is hydrolysed in acidic medium. An imine of general formula (V) is obtained, which is reduced to a derivative of general formula (VI) by an agent such as sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride in a suitable solvent. The cis and trans stereoisomers formed during this step can be separated by chromatography into more polar isomers and less polar isomers. If so desired, it is also possible at this stage to separate the enantiomers, for example by treating a cis or trans stereoisomer of general formula (VI) with a chiral substrate, for example an S-proline derivative, under peptide coupling conditions, for example in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, in order to obtain a derivative of general formula (I) in which R 1 represents a prolinyl group, in the form of a mixture of diastereoisomers which can be separated by chromatography. The enantiomers are then obtained by treating each of the diastereoisomers in acidic medium. Finally, and if it is desired to introduce a group R 1 other than a hydrogen atom, an alkylation of the nitrogen in the pyrrolidine ring is carried out by any known method, for example a reductive methylation according to the Eschweiler-Clarck method (formaldehyde and formic acid), or by reductive amination in the presence of an aldehyde and sodium cyanoborohydride, or alternatively by acylation, in order to form an amide, which is reduced to an amine, using an agent such as lithium aluminium hydride. For certain compounds, all the substituents R 2 , R 3 , R 4 and R 5 cannot be present in the starting compound of general formula (II); depending on their nature, these substituents can be introduced onto one and/or the other of the compounds of general formulae (III), (IV), (V), (VI) and (I), in which R 2 , R 3 , R 4 and/or R 5 represent hydrogen atoms, according to any known methods, for example the method described in J. Het. Chem. (1996) 33 1051-1056, optionally after activation of the nitrogen in the pyridine ring by formation of the corresponding N-oxide. The examples which follow illustrate the preparation of a number of compounds of the invention. The elemental microanalyses and the IR and NMR spectra confirm the structures of the compounds obtained. The numbers indicated in parentheses in the example titles correspond to those in the 1st column of Table 1 given later. In the compound names, the hyphen - forms part of the name, and the underscore mark _ serves merely to indicate the line break; it should be removed if a line break does not occur at that point, and should not be replaced either with a normal hyphen or with a space.

The compounds of the invention underwent tests which revealed their therapeutic properties. Thus, they were studied as regards their affinity towards nicotinic receptors, according to the methods described by Anderson and Arneric, Eur. J. Pharmacol (1994) 253 261, and by Hall et al., Brain Res. (1993) 600 127. Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 150 to 200 g are decapitated and the entire brain is removed rapidly, it is homogenized in 15 volumes of 0.32M sucrose solution at 4 C. and is then centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min. The pellet is discarded and the supernatant is centrifuged at 20,000g for 20 min at 4 C. The pellet is collected and homogenized using a Polytron mill in 15 volumes of double-distilled water at 4 C., after which it is centrifuged at 8000g for 20 min. The pellet is discarded and the supernatant and the layer of skin (buffy coat) are centrifuged at 4000g for 20 min, the pellet is recovered, washed with double-distilled water at 4 C. and centrifuged once again before being stored at 80 C. On the day of the experiment, the tissue is thawed slowly and is suspended in 3 volumes of buffer. 150 l of this membrane suspension are incubated at 4 C. for 120 min in the presence of 100 l of 1 nM 3 Hcytisine in a final volume of 500 l of buffer, in the presence or absence of test compound. The reaction is quenched by filtration through Whatman GF/B filters pretreated with polyethyleneimine, the filters are rinsed with twice 5 ml of buffer at 4 C. and the radioactivity retained on the filter is measured by liquid scintigraphy. The non-specific binding is determined in the presence of 10 m ()-nicotine; the non-specific binding represents 75 to 85% of the total binding recovered on the filter. For each concentration of test compound, the percentage of inhibition of the specific binding of 3 Hcytisine is determined, then the IC 50 , the concentration of compound which inhibits 50% of the specific binding, is calculated. The IC 50 values for the compounds of the invention are between 0.001 and 1 M.

Since it shows antibacterial action upon Helicobacter pylori , this invention is effective for the treatment or prevention of infection with Helicobacter pylori in human and infection with related bacteria belonging to the genus Helicobacter in animals. Also, the anti- Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is useful for the prevention (including prevention of relapse) or treatment of diseases of the upper digestive organs, such as peptic ulcers (e.g., gastric and duodenal ulcers), inflammations (e.g., acute or chronic gastritis or duodenitis) and gastric cancer, as well as MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma or chronic heart diseases. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a medicament, particularly an anti- Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition. In particular, it relates to an anti- Helicobacter pylori agent which is useful for the treatment and prevention of various diseases caused by the infection with Helicobacter pylori. BACKGROUND ART Helicobacter pylori is a pathogenic bacterium discovered in 1983, which is regarded as the cause of diseases at the upper digestive organs, such as peptic ulcers (e.g., gastric and duodenal ulcers), inflammations (e.g., gastritis) and gastric cancer, and of MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma or as a background pathogenic factor of chronic heart diseases. Studies on the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection are active now, and a large number of therapeutic methods have been reported, including those for removing the bacterium or those for preventing relapse, as described below. The examples include a single agent administration method using bismuth, an antibiotic, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), an antitumor agent, or the like and a multiple agent combination method (two agent combination or three agent combination) which uses a combination of these agents, etc. (Internal Medicine, Special Edition, vol. 78, no. 1 (1996), published by Nankodo). However, these therapeutic methods have many problems to be solved, such as high frequency of administration times, requirement of administration in a dose larger than the usual dose in some cases, onset of diarrhea or constipation caused by the drug administration and generation of resistant strains. The compound related to the present invention as a substance useful as an anti- Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition, is disclosed in JP-A-7-189 (the term JP-A as used herein means an unexamined published Japanese patent application) as a substance YL-02729S, and its use is particularly antibacterial activity upon methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus . Said patent application does not suggest or report about antibacterial activity of the substance YL-02729S upon Helicobacter pylori. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The inventors of the present invention have carried out extensive studies on the aforementioned substance YL-02729S and, as a result, found that it has an excellent anti- Helicobacter pylori activity and also that said substance has high selectivity and does not exert influences upon other bacteria. The following describes the present invention in detail. The present invention relates to an anti- Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition containing a 1-hydroxy-3-methyl-quinolone derivative represented by the following formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient, preferably an anti- Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition containing 1-hydroxy-2-(2-trans-nonenyl)-3-methyl-4(1H)-quinolone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient, and to the use of a 1-hydroxy-3-methyl-quinolone derivative represented by the following formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the production of an anti- Helicobacter pylori agent. The present invention also relates to the use of an anti- Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition containing a 1-hydroxy-3-methyl-quinolone derivative represented by the formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient for the prevention or treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, to a method for the administration of the substance of formula (I) and other agent, preferably an antibiotic, an acid-related agent or an H2 blocker, simultaneously or at an interval and to the use thereof for the prevention of relapse of diseases caused by Helicobacter pylori infection. Also included in the present invention is a prodrug of the substance of formula (I) obtained by a usual means. Since the active ingredient (I) of the anti- Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition of the present invention has double bonds, cis isomer and trans isomer, as well as tautomers exist therein. Existence of the tautomers is disclosed in JP-A-7-189 as follows. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt include acid addition salts with inorganic acids or organic acids, of which pharmaceutically acceptable salts are desirable. Illustrative examples of such salts include acid addition salts with mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid, with organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, methanesulfonic acid and ethanesulfonic acid or with acidic amino acids such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Hydrates and various solvates of the active ingredient are also included in the present invention. Also, said active ingredient exists in polymorphic forms in some cases, and all of such crystal forms are included in the present invention. The production method disclosed in JP-A-7-189 can be cited as a typical method for the production of the active ingredient of the anti- Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Regarding a fermentation method for the production of said active ingredient, it is desirable to employ a method in which a bacterium belonging to the genus Arthrobacter, such as Arthrobacter sp. YL-02729S which has been deposited in National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology under an international deposition No. FERM BP-6326, is cultured, and the compound of interest is isolated and purified from said culture in the usual way.

The dose is generally from 0.1 to 500 mg in the case of oral administration, or from 0.01 to 100 mg in the case of parenteral administration, per day per adult, and the daily dose is divided into 1 to several doses per day. Since the dose varies depending on various conditions, a smaller amount than the above range may be sufficient in some cases. In this connection, the anti- Helicobacter pylori pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be used in combination with other drugs such as antibacterial agents which will be described later, simultaneously or at an interval. The solid composition of the present invention for use in oral administration is used in the form, for example, of tablets, powders or granules. In such a solid composition, one or more of the active substances are mixed with at least one inert diluent such as lactose, mannitol, glucose, hydroxypropylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, metasilicate or magnesium aluminate. In addition to the inert diluent, the composition may contain other additives in the usual way, which include a lubricant such as magnesium stearate, a disintegrating agent such as calcium cellulose glycolate, a stabilizer such as lactose and a solubilizing or solubilization assisting agent such as glutamic acid or aspartic acid. As occasion demands, tablets or pills may be coated with a film of a gastric or enteric substance such as sucrose, gelatin, hydroxypropylcellulose or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate. The liquid composition for oral administration use includes pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, elixirs and the like preparations and contains a generally used inert diluent such as purified water or ethyl alcohol. In addition to the inert diluent, this composition may also contain a solubilizing or solubilization assisting agent, a moistening agent, a suspending agent and the like auxiliary agents, as well as sweeteners, flavors, aromatics and antiseptics. The injections for parenteral administration use include aseptic aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions and emulsions. Examples of the diluent for use in the aqueous solutions and suspensions include distilled water for injection use and physiological saline. Examples of the diluent for use in the non-aqueous solutions and suspensions include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, plant oil (e.g., olive oil), alcohol (e.g., ethyl alcohol), polysorbate 80 (trade name, polyoxyethylene sorbitan higher fatty acid ester). Such a composition may further contain additive agents such as a tonicity agent, an antiseptic, a moistening agent, an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent, a stabilizing agent (e.g., lactose) and a solubilizing or solubilization assisting agent. These preparations are sterilized for example by filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, blending of a germicide or irradiation. Alternatively, they may be used by firstly making into sterile solid compositions and dissolving them in sterile water or a sterile solvent for injection use prior to their use. When the compound of the present invention has low solubility, it may be subjected to a solubilization treatment. The solubilization treatment may be effected by known methods which can be applied to pharmaceutical preparations, such as a method in which surface active agents (e.g., polyoxyethylene hardened castor oils, polyoxyethylene sorbitan higher fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene glycols or sucrose fatty acid esters) are added, and a method in which a drug is formed into solid dispersion together with a solubilizing agent such as a high polymer (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), polyethylene glycol (PEG) or the like water-soluble high polymer or carboxymethylethylcellulose (CMEC), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP), methyl methacrylate-methacrylic acid copolymer (Eudragit L, S, trade name, manufactured by Rohm Haas) or the like enteric high polymer). In addition, as occasion demands, a method in which the drug is made into a soluble salt or a method in which an inclusion compound is formed using cyclodextrins such as (-cyclodextrin, -cyclodextrin, -cyclodextrin, hydroxypropyl -cyclodextrin or the like hydroxyalkylated cyclodextrin, methylated cyclodextrin or dimethyl -cyclodextrin or dextrins may also be employed. The solubilization means can be optionally changed depending on each drug of interest Recent Preparation Techniques and Their Application , I.

EXAMPLE 5 Measurement of in vivo antibacterial activity upon Helicobacter pylori was carried out in the following manner. In vivo Antibacterial Activity Infection experiment was carried out using Mongolian gerbils on which stable infection has been reported ( J. Gastroenterology, 31: supple IX, 24-28, 1996). Helicobacter pylori ATCC 43504 was cultured overnight in Brucella broth containing 5% calf serum, and the cell suspension was inoculated using a sound into the stomach of each Mongolian gerbil (MGS/Sea, male, 4-week-old) which had been subjected to overnight fasting. Treatment was started about 1 week after the infection, by dissolving the drug to be evaluated in a solvent in the usual way and orally administering it twice a day for 3 days in a dose of 10 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg or 0.1 mg/kg. The stomach was excised and homogenized on the next day after completion of the administration. The stomach homogenate was diluted by 10-fold serial dilution, inoculated onto modified Skirrows medium and cultured at 37 C. for 6 to 7 days under microaerophilic or 10% CO 2 condition. The number of cells in the stomach was calculated from the number of grown colonies.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This is a nonprovisional application which claims the benefit of provisional applications U.S. Ser. No. 60/111,079, filed Dec. 4, 1998. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to novel 3-substituted-4-arylquinolin-2-one derivatives which are modulators of the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels and, therefore, useful in the protection of neuronal cells and diseases arising from dysfunction of cellular membrane polarization and conductance. The present invention also provides a method of treatment with the novel substituted quinolin-2-one derivatives and to pharmaceutical compositions thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Potassium channels play a key role in regulation of cell membrane potential and modulation of cell excitability. Potassium channels are largely regulated by voltage, cell metabolism, calcium and receptor mediated processes. Cook, N. S., Trends in Pharmacol. Sciences (1988), 9, 21; and Quast, U., et al., Trends in Pharmacol. Sciences (1989), 10, 431. Calcium-activated potassium (K ca ) channels are a diverse group of ion channels that share a dependence on intracellular calcium ions for activity. The activity of K Ca channels is regulated by intracellular Ca 2 , membrane potential and phosphorylation. On the basis of their single-channel conductances in symmetrical K solutions, K Ca channels are divided into three subclasses: large conductance (BK)150 pS; intermediate conductance 50-150 pS; small conductance50 pS. Large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (Maxi-K or BK) channels are present in many excitable cells including neurons, cardiac cells and various types of smooth muscle cells. Singer, J. et al., Pflugers Archiv . (1987) 408,98; Baro, I., et al., Pflugers Archiv . (1989) 414 (Suppl. 1), S168; and Ahmed, F. et al., Br. J. Pharmacol . (1984) 83, 227. Potassium ions play a dominant role in controlling the resting membrane potential in most excitable cells and maintain the transmembrane voltage near the K equilibrium potential (E k ) of about 90 mV. It has been shown that opening of potassium channels shift the cell membrane potential towards the equilibrium potassium membrane potential (E k ), resulting in hyperpolarization of the cell. Cook, N. S., Trends in Pharmacol. Sciences (1988), 9, 21. Hyperpolarized cells show a reduced response to potentially damaging depolarizing stimuli. BK channels which are regulated by both voltage and intracellular Ca 2 act to limit depolarization and calcium entry and may be particularly effective in blocking damaging stimuli. Therefore cell hyperpolarization via opening of BK channels may result in protection of neuronal cells. A range of synthetic and naturally occurring compounds with BK opening activity have been reported. The avena pyrone extracted from avena sativa-common oats has been identified as a BK channel opener using lipid bi-layer technique International Patent application WO 93/08800, published May 13, 1993. 6-Bromo-8-(methylamino) imidazo1,2-apyrazine-2-carbonitrile (SCA-40) has been described as a BK channel opener with very limited electrophysiological experiments Laurent, F. et al., Br. J. Pharmacol . (1993) 108, 622-626. The flavanoid, Phloretin has been found to increase the open probability of Ca 2 -activated potassium channels in myelinated nerve fibers of Xenopus laevis using outside-out patches Koh, D-S., et al., Neuroscience Lett . (1994) 165, 167-170. In European patent application EP-477,819 published Jan. 4, 1992 and corresponding U.S. Pat.

E. S. Hamanaka in U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,472, issued Oct. 15, 1996, discloses a number of 4-aryl-3-(heteroarylureido)-1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-quinoline derivatives which are inhibitors of acyl coenzyme A; cholesterol acyltransferase and are useful as hypolipidemic and antiatherosclerosis agents.

The compounds of Formula I may be prepared by various procedures such as those illustrated herein in the examples and in the Reaction Schemes described in the specific embodiments and variations thereof which would be evident to those skilled in the art. The following Reaction Schemes 1-11 illustrate representative general procedures for the preparation of intermediates and methods for the preparation of products according to this invention. It should also be evident to those skilled in the art that appropriate substitution of both the materials and methods disclosed herein will produce the examples illustrated below and those encompassed by the scope of this invention. The preparation of 2(1H)-quinolinones of Formulae 4 and 5 is illustrated in Reaction Scheme 1. Acylation of the compound of Formula 1 with an acid chloride as shown in the Reaction Scheme provided the amide of Formula 2 wherein R a is hydrogen or C 1-4 alkyl which may be cyclized and dehydrated to the quinolinone of Formula 3 by treatment with a base such as potassium tert-butoxide in an inert organic solvent. Exposure of the ester of Formula 3 to a reducing agent such as diisobutyl aluminum hydride affords the primary alcohol of Formula 4 which can then be advantageously oxidized with an oxidant such as manganese dioxide to yield the desired aldehyde of Formula 5. As illustrated in Reaction Scheme 2, the homologation of the aldehyde of Formula 5 can readily be accomplished with a phosphonate reagent to produce the unsaturated ester of Formula 6 as a mixture of (E)- and (Z)-isomers which then be separated using column chromatography. Reduction of the ester of Formula 6 may be carried out with a reducing agent such as diisobutyl aluminum hydride to afford the corresponding allylic alcohol of Formula 7. Alternatively, when it is desired to prepare the compound of Formula 9, the ester of Formula 6 is selectively reduced under hydrogenation conditions to reduce the double bond and provide the saturated ester of Formula 8. Treatment of the ester of Formula 8, under conditions similar to the reduction of the ester of Formula 6 will afford the corresponding alcohol of Formula 9. In Reaction Scheme 3, the butyloxycarbonyl (BOC) and methyl groups can be removed simultaneously by treatment of the compound of Formula 1a with boron tribromide (BBr 3 ) to give the aniline of Formula 10. Acylation of the aniline of Formula 10 afforded the corresponding amide of Formula 11, which is readily cyclized and dehydrated under basic conditions with potassium tert-butoxide to provide the lactone of Formula 12. Partial reduction of the lactone with diisobutyl aluminum hydride in THF produced the intermediate lactol of Formula 13. Alternatively, it has been found that by changing solvents from THF to methylene chloride, the lactone of Formula 12 can be reduced with diisobutyl aluminum hydride to provide the desired alcohol of Formula 14. When it is desired to prepare the compound of Formulae 17 and 20, the intermediate lactol of Formula 13 may be treated as shown in Reaction Scheme 4 with a phosphonate reagent to afford the unsaturated ester of Formula 15 and then, if desired, be saponified to produce the unsaturated acid of Formula 16. Reduction of the ester of Formula 15 with aluminum hydride affords the corresponding unsaturated alcohol of Formula 17. Alternatively, the hydrogenation of the double bond of the compound of Formula 15 yields the ester of Formula 18, which may be either saponified to produce the acid of Formula 19, or reduced with aluminum hydride to yield the desired alcohol of Formula 20. Reaction Scheme 5 illustrates the homologation of the intermediate lactol of Formula 13 with a fluorophosphonate, as described in step (a) in the Reaction Scheme, to afford the unsaturated -fluoroester ester of Formula 21 as a mixture of (E)- and (Z)-isomers. The crude mixture of esters of Formula 21 may be reduced with aluminum hydride, and the resulting mixture of alcohols are advantageously separated by column chromatography to afford the (E)-olefin of Formula 23 and the (Z)-olefin of Formula 25. In a similar manner, the aldehyde of Formula 5 which contains a methyl ether can be converted to the corresponding desired olefins of Formulae 24 and 26. The preparation of compounds of Formulae 31a and 31b is illustrated in Reaction Scheme 6. Acylation of the aniline of Formula 1 with an acid chloride provides the corresponding amide. The amide of Formula 27 may be cyclized under basic conditions to give the dehydrohydroxyquinolinone of Formula 28, which may then be dehydrated and deesterified under acidic conditions such as HBr/AcOH or pTsOH, to afford the quinolinone of Formula 29. If desired, removal of the methyl ether can be accomplished with pyridine hydrochloride at elevated temperatures to give the corresponding phenol of Formula 30. Reduction of the acid of Formula 30 then provides the alcohol of Formula 31a as the phenol. Alternatively, if the methyl ether of the phenol is desired, direct reduction of the carboxylic acid of Formula 29 with borane provides the corresponding alcohol of Formula 31b. The compound of Formulae 34 and 35 wherein n is 0 to 6 and R 8 is C 1-4 alkyl or aryl optionally substituted by one or two substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, hydroxy, methoxy, amino, acetylamino and trifluoromethyl, may be prepared by a similar approach to that outlined in Reaction Scheme 6. Thus, Reaction Scheme 7 illustrates the acylation of the compound of Formula 1, followed by cyclization and dehydration to give the 3-substituted quinoline of Formula 34 as the methyl ether. Demethylation of the compound of Formula 34 with pyridine hydrochloride at elevated temperatures provides the corresponding phenol compound of Formula 35. As shown in Reaction Scheme 8, homologation of the intermediate lactol of Formula 13 with a cyano phosphonate or phosphonoacetate reagent provides the corresponding unsaturated nitrile of Formula 36a or acetate of Formula 37a, respectively. Similarly, the methyl ether analogs of Formulae 36b and 37b can be synthesized starting with the aldehyde of Formula 5 and treatment with either a cyano phosophonate or phosphonoacetate reagent, respectively. The oxime of Formula 38a can be prepared from the intermediate lactol of Formula 13 by treating the lactol with hydroxyl amine. Similarly, the methyl ether of Formula 38b, can be prepared from the aldehyde of Formula 5. Reaction Scheme 9 illustrates the formation of the lactone of Formula 39 when the hydroxy acid of Formula 30a is treated with a catalytic amount of acid in refluxing toluene. Upon attempted purification of lactone of Formula 39 on silica gel and employing methanol as one of the eluting solvents, the lactone may be converted to the ester of Formula 30b. When it is desired to prepare the substituted alcohol of Formula 40, the lactone of Formula 39 is treated with an excess of a lithium reagent such as methyl lithium to produce the disubstituted alcohol of Formula 40 or alternately, with an equivalent amount to produce a monosubstituted alcohol. The preparation of the N-methyl compounds of Formulae 43 and 44 are depicted in Reaction Scheme 10. Silylation of the alcohol of Formula 31a with triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) chloride provided the silyl protected ether of Formula 41. N-alkylation with an alkyl halide such as methyl iodide afforded the compound of Formula 42, which may be desilylated with a fluoride reagent, step (c), to give the alcohol of Formula 43. When it is desired to prepare the methylated phenol, the compound of Formula 41 is treated with dimethylsulfate followed by desilylation to afford the dimethyl analog of Formula 44. The preparation of the compound of Formula 31a is advantageously prepared by the reactions illustrated in Reaction Scheme 11. The coumarin compound of Formula 45 is advantageously prepared by condensing -butyrolactone with the methyl ester of chlorosalicylic acid which is then readily cyclized with acid to produce the benzopyran-4-one of Formula 46. Treatment of compound 46 with p-trifluoromethylaniline as illustrated in step (d) produced the dihydrofuran of Formula 47 which is then subjected to photocyclization in an inert organic solvent to afford the compound of Formula 31a. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the compounds of Formula I have the formula wherein R and R 1 each are independently hydrogen or methyl; R 2 , R 3 and R 4 each are independently hydrogen, halogen, nitro or trifluoromethyl, provided R 2 , R 3 , and R 4 are not all hydrogen; R 5 is bromo, chloro or nitro; R 6 is hydrogen or fluoro; n is an integer from 0 to 6; m is an integer of 0 or 1; and R 7 is CH 3 , CRR 1 OH, CHO, CNOH, COCH 3 or aryl optionally substituted by one or two substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, hydroxy, methoxy, amino, acetylamino and trifluoromethyl; or a nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the compounds of the invention include those wherein R and R 1 each are independently hydrogen or methyl; R 2 , R 3 and R 4 each are independently hydrogen, chloro, nitro or trifluoromethyl, provided R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are not all hydrogen; R 5 is chloro; R 6 is hydrogen or fluoro; n is 0, 1, or 2; m is 0 or 1; and R 7 is CH 3 , CH 2 OH, CHO, CNOH, COCH 3 or aryl optionally substituted by halogen, hydroxy, methoxy, amino, acetylamino or trifluoromethyl; or a nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

In another aspect, this invention provides a method for the treatment of or protection from disorders which are mediated by opening of the large conductance calcium-activated K channels (BK channels) in a mammal in need thereof, which comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or a nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Preferably, the compounds of Formula I are useful in the treatment of ischemia, stroke, convulsions, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, migraine, traumatic brain injury, urinary incontinence, and sexual dysfunction in both men (erectile dysfunction, for example, due to diabetes mellitus, spinal cord injury, radical prostatectomy, psychogenic etiology or any other cause) and women by improving blood flow to the genitalia, especially the corpus cavernosum, and other disorders sensitive to BK channel activating activity. In still another aspect, this invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of Formula I in combination with a pharmaceutical adjuvant, carrier or diluent. BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY Potassium (K ) channels are structurally and functionally diverse families of K -selective channel proteins which are ubiquitous in cells, indicating their central importance in regulating a number of key cell functions Rudy, B., Neuroscience , 25: 729-749 (1988). While widely distributed as a class, K channels are differentially distributed as individual members of this class or as families. Gehlert, D. R., et al., Neuroscience , 52: 191-205 (1993). In general, activation of K channels in cells, and particularly in excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells, leads to hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, or in the case of depolarized cells, to repolarization. In addition to acting as an endogenous membrane voltage clamp, K channels can respond to important cellular events such as changes in the intracellular concentration of ATP or the intracellular concentration of calcium (Ca 2 ). The central role of K channels in regulating numerous cell functions makes them particularly important targets for therapeutic development. Cook, N. S., Potassium channels: Structure, classification, function and therapeutic potential. Ellis Horwood, Chinchester (1990). One class of K channels, the large-conductance Ca 2 -activated K channels (Maxi-K or BK channels), is regulated by transmembrane voltage, intracellular Ca 2 , and a variety of other factors such as the phosphorylation state of the channel protein. Latorre, R., et al., Ann. Rev. Pysiol ., 51: 385-399 (1989). The large, single channel-conductance (generally150 pS) and high degree of specificity for K of BK channels indicates that small numbers of channels could profoundly affect membrane conductance and cell excitability. Additionally, the increase in open probability with increasing intracellular Ca 2 indicates involvement of BK channels in the modulation of Ca 2 -dependent phenomena such as secretion and muscular contraction. Asano, M., et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther ., 267: 1277-1285 (1993). Openers of BK channels exert their cellular effects by increasing the open probability of these channels McKay, M. C., et al., J. Neurophysiol ., 71: 1873-1882 (1994); and Olesen, S.-P., Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs , 3: 1181-1188 (1994). This increase in the opening of individual BK channels collectively results in the hyperpolarization of cell membranes, particularly in depolarized cells, produced by significant increases in whole-cell BK-mediated conductance. The ability of compounds described in the present invention to open BK channels and increase whole-cell outward (K ) BK-mediated currents was assessed under voltage-clamp conditions by determining their ability to increase cloned mammalian (mSlo or hSlo) BK mediated outward current heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes Butler, A., et al., Science , 261: 221-224 (1993); and Dworetzky, S. I., et al., Mol. Brain Res ., 27: 189-193 (1994). The two BK constructs employed represent nearly structurally identical homologous proteins, and have proven to be pharmacologically identical in our tests. To isolate BK current from native (background, non-BK) current, the specific and potent BK channel-blocking toxin iberiotoxin (IBTX) Galvez, A., et al., J. Biol. Chem ., 265: 11083-11090 (1990) was employed at a supramaximal concentration (50 nM). The relative contribution of BK channels current to total outward current was determined by subtraction of the current remaining in the presence of IBTX (non-BK current) from the current profiles obtained in all other experimental conditions (control, drug, and wash). It was determined that at the tested concentration the compounds profiled did not effect non-BK native currents in the oocytes. All compounds were tested in at least 5 oocytes and are reported at the single concentration of 20 M; the effect of the selected compounds of Formula I on BK current was expressed as the percent of control IBTX-sensitive current and is listed in Table I. Recordings were accomplished using standard two-electrode voltage clamp techniques Stuhmer, W., et al., Methods in Enzymology , Vol. 207: 319-339 (1992); voltage-clamp protocols consisted of 500-750 ms duration step depolarizations from a holding potential of 60 mV to 140 mV in 20 mV steps. The experimental media (modified Barths solution) consisted of (in mM): NaCl (88), NaHCO 3 (2.4), KCl (1.0), HEPES (10), MgSO 4 (0.82), Ca(NO 3 ) 2 (0.33), CaCl 2 (0.41); pH 7.5. TABLE 1 Ex.

Selected compounds have been evaluated in the focal stroke model involving permanent MCAO in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. This procedure results in a reliably large neocortical infarct volume that is measured by means of vital dye exclusion in serial slices through the brain 24 hours after MCAO. In the present test, compounds were administered using an intravenous route of administration at 2 hours after occlusion. For example, in this model, the compound of Example 21 reduced the cortical infarct volume by about 25% when administered (0.003 mg/kg) as a single bolus 2 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion as compared to vehicle-treated (2% DMSO, 98% propylene glycol) control. The in vivo model on erectile function is described fully in the scientific literature Rehman, J., Chenven, E., Brink, P. Peterson, B., Wolcott, B., Wen, Y. P., Melman, A., Christ, G.: Diminished neurogenic but not pharmacological erections in the 2- to 3-month experimentally diabetic F-344 rat. Am. J. Physiol . 272: H1960-H1971, (1997). Briefly, rats (250-600 g) were anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital, the abdomen opened and the cavernous nerve identified. A pressure catheter was placed in the right corpus cavernosum (crus) to measure intracavernous pressure (ICP). A second catheter was introduced into the carotid artery to measure blood pressure. Test compound (0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg iV.) or vehicle (PEG 400) was given via a catheter placed into the jugular vein. Control intracavernous pressure responses were elicited by electrically stimulating the cavernous nerve via bipolar stimulating electrodes (20 Hz, 0.22 ms pulse width). Stimulus amplitude (0.2-20 mA) was adjusted to produce a submaximal intracavernous pressure response (typically 0.2 or 0.5 mA). A series of control intracavernous pressure responses were then obtained using a constant stimulus amplitude. Test compound or vehicle was then administered (200 l i.v bolus) and the cavernous nerve was restimulated to evoke a cavernous pressure response at various times post-drug administration. Animals were excluded from the study if the initial ICP responses to nerve stimulation were unstable (spiky responses) or if there were time-dependent variations in the magnitude of the control responses. Animals were also excluded if the control ICP/BP response fell outside the 0.3-0.6 range. A repeated measures ANOVA was used for the evaluation of statistical significance. The compound of Example 20 (0.1-1 mg/kg) produced an augmentation of the ICP/BP responses elicited by sub-maximal stimulation of the cavernous nerve. A significant increase in the ICP/BP ratio was observed at doses from 0.1-1.0 mg/kg of compound tested. The results of the above biological tests demonstrates that the compounds of the instant invention are potent openers of the large-conductance calcium-activated K channels (Maxi-K or BK channels). Thus, the compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment of human disorders arising from dysfunction of cellular membrane polarization and conductance and, preferably, are indicated for the treatment of ischemia, stroke, convulsions, epilepsy, asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, migraine, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, sexual dysfunction, urinary incontinence and especially male erectile dysfunction, other disorders sensitive to BK channel activating activity. In another embodiment, this invention includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of Formula I in combination with a pharmaceutical adjuvant, carrier or diluent. In still another embodiment, this invention relates to a method of treatment or prevention of disorders responsive to opening of potassium channels in a mammal in need thereof, which comprises administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or a nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. For therapeutic use, the pharmacologically active compounds of Formula I will normally be administered as a pharmaceutical composition comprising as the (or an) essential active ingredient at least one such compound in association with a solid or liquid pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, optionally, with pharmaceutically acceptable adjutants and excipients employing standard and conventional techniques. The pharmaceutical compositions include suitable dosage forms for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal and intravenous) bronchial or nasal administration. Thus, if a solid carrier is used, the preparation may be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form, or in the form of a troche or lozenge. The solid carrier may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, tableting lubricants, disintegrants, wetting agents and the like. The tablet may, if desired, be film coated by conventional techniques. If a liquid carrier is employed, the preparation may be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile vehicle for injection, an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspension, or may be a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, wetting agents, non-aqueous vehicle (including edible oils), preservatives, as well as flavoring and/or coloring agents. For parenteral administration, a vehicle normally will comprise sterile water, at least in large part, although saline solutions, glucose solutions and like may be utilized. Injectable suspensions also may be used, in which case conventional suspending agents may be employed. Conventional preservatives, buffering agents and the like also may be added to the parenteral dosage forms. Particularly useful is the administration of a compound of Formula I directly in parenteral formulations. The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by conventional techniques appropriate to the desired preparation containing appropriate amounts of the active ingredient, that is, the compound of Formula I according to the invention. See, for example, Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences , Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 17th edition, 1985. The dosage of the compounds of Formula I to achieve a therapeutic effect will depend not only on such factors as the age, weight and sex of the patient and mode of administration, but also on the degree of potassium channel activating activity desired and the potency of the particular compound being utilized for the particular disorder of disease concerned. It is also contemplated that the treatment and dosage of the particular compound may be administered in unit dosage form and that the unit dosage form would be adjusted accordingly by one skilled in the art to reflect the relative level of activity. The decision as to the particular dosage to be employed (and the number of times to be administered per day) is within the discretion of the physician, and may be varied by titration of the dosage to the particular circumstances of this invention to produce the desired therapeutic effect. A suitable dose of a compound of Formula I or pharmaceutical composition thereof for a mammal, including man, suffering from, or likely to suffer from any condition as described herein is an amount of active ingredient from about 0.01 g/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight and preferrably, from about 0.1 g/kg to 5 mg/kg body weight for oral administration. For parenteral administration, the dose may be in the range of 0.1 g/kg to 1 mg/kg body weight for intravenous administration The active ingredient will preferably be administered in equal doses from one to four times a day. However, usually a small dosage is administered, and the dosage is gradually increased until the optimal dosage for the host under treatment is determined. The compounds of the present invention may be employed alone or in combination with other suitable therapeutic agents useful in the treatment of sexual dysfunction such as cGMP PDE inhibitors and particularly cGMP PDE V inhibitors such as sildenafil. Exemplary of the therapeutic agents are PDE V inhibitors selected from imidazo-quinazolines (see WO 98/08848), carbazoles (see WO 97/03675, WO 97/03985 and WO 95/19978), imidazopurinones (see WO 97/19947), benzimidazoles (see WO 97/24334), pyrazoloquinolines (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,488,055), anthranilic acid derivatives (see WO 95/18097), fused heterocycles (see WO 98/07430) and thienopyrimidines (see DE 19632423). The above therapeutic agents, when employed in combination with the compounds of the present invention, may be used, for example, in those amounts indicated in the Physicians Desk Reference (PDR) or as otherwise determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. However, it will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances including the condition to be treated, the choice of compound of be administered, the chosen route of administration, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patients symptoms. The following examples are given by way of illustration and are not to be construed as limiting the invention in any way inasmuch as many variations of the invention are possible within the scope of the invention.

EXAMPLE 1 4-(5-Chloro-2-methoxyphenyl)-1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-6-(trifluoromethyl)-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid, methyl ester (3, R 3 CF 3 , R a CH 3 ) Step A: N-2-(5-Chloro-2-methoxyphenyl) carbonyl-4-(trifluoromethyl) phenylaminocarboxylic acid, 1,1-dimethylethyl ester A stirred neat mixture of 4-aminobenzotrifluoride (35 g, 0.218 mol) and (Boc) 2 O (52.4 g, 0.24 mol) was heated at 80 C. for 2 to 3 hours until CO 2 evolution ceased. The mixture was allowed to cool and the t BuOH was rotary evaporated. The resultant white solid was recrystallized from hexanes/ether to provide white needles (50.6 g, 89%) of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-aminobenzotrifluoride. Tert-BuLi (130 mL, 0.22 mol, 1.7M in cyclohexane) was added over 20 minutes to a cold (78 C.) stirred solution of N-Boc-4-aminobenzotrifluoride (26.2 g, 0.1 mol) in dry THF (130 mL) under argon. The resultant yellow partial solution was warmed to 45 to 40 C. and maintained for 2 hours. The resultant thick yellow slurry of the dianion was cooled to 78 C. and neat dry methyl 5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoate (22.1 g, 0.11 mol) was added rapidly. The resultant yellow-brown solution was warmed to 40 C. and maintained for 1 hour.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Research leading to the completion of the invention was supported, in part, by Grant No. 2-U01-CA37606 awarded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The United States Government has certain rights in and to the invention claimed herein. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to analogs of biologically active, naturally occurring polyamines having a wide variety of therapeutic properties, as well as pharmaceutical compositions containing the analogs and their use in methods of therapeutic treatment. DISCUSSION OF THE PRIOR ART In recent years, a great deal of attention has been focussed on the polyamines, e.g., spermidine, norspermidine, homospermidine, 1,4-diaminobutane (putrescine) and spermine. These studies have been largely directed at the biological properties of the polyamines probably because of the role they play in proliferative processes. It was shown early on that the polyamine levels in dividing cells, e.g., cancer cells, are much higher than in resting cells. See Janne et al, A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta., Vol. 473, page 241 (1978); Fillingame et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., Vol. 72, page 4042 (1975); Metcalf et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 100, page 2551 (1978); Flink et al, Nature (London), Vol. 253, page 62 (1975); and Pegg et al, Polyamine Metabolism and Function, Am. J. Cell. Physiol ., Vol. 243, pages 212-221 (1982). Several lines of evidence indicate that polyamines, particularly spermidine, are required for cell proliferation: (i) they are found in greater amounts in growing than in non-growing tissues; (ii) prokaryotic and eukaryotic mutants deficient in polyamine biosynthesis are auxotrophic for polyamines; and (iii) inhibitors specific for polyamine biosynthesis also inhibit cell growth. Despite this evidence, the precise biological role of polyamines in cell proliferation is uncertain. It has been suggested that polyamines, by virtue of their charged nature under physiological conditions and their conformational flexibility, might serve to stabilize macromolecules such as nucleic acids by anion neutralization.

Biol ., Vol. 42, page 363 (1969); and Liquori et al, J. Mol. Biol ., Vol. 24, page 113 (1968). However, regardless of the reason for increased polyamine levels, the phenomenon can be and has been exploited in chemotherapy. See Sjoerdsma et al, Butterworths Int. Med. Rev.: Clin. Pharmacol.

The disclosures of each of the foregoing applications and patents are incorporated herein by reference. It is an object of the present invention to provide novel analogs of naturally occurring, biologically active polyamines which possess anti-neoplastic properties and to define the structural parameters which define compounds having such activities. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION These and other objects are realized by the present invention, one embodiment of which relates to a polyamine having the formula: or a salt thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid wherein: R 1 -R 6 may be the same or different and are alkyl, aryl, aryl alkyl, cycloalkyl, any of the foregoing wherein the alkyl chain is interrupted by at least one etheric oxygen atom, or hydrogen; N 1 , N 2 , N 3 and N 4 are nitrogen atoms capable of protonation at physiological pHs; a and b may be the same or different and are integers from 1 to 4; A, B and C may be the same or different and are bridging groups which effectively maintain the distance between the nitrogen atoms such that the polyamine: (i) is capable of uptake by a target cell upon administration of the polyamine to a human or non-human animal; and (ii) upon uptake by the target cell, competitively binds via an electrostatic inter-action between the positively charged nitrogen atoms to substantially the same biological counter-anions as the intracellular natural polyamines in the target cell; the polyamine, upon binding to the biological counter-anion in the cell, functions in a manner biologically different than the intracellular polyamines, the polyamine not occurring in nature. Another embodiment of the invention comprises a pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti-neoplastic effective amount of the polyamine described above or a salt thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor. An additional embodiment of the invention relates to a method of treating a human or non-human animal in need thereof comprising administering thereto an anti-neoplastic effective amount of the polyamine described above or a salt thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGS. 1-8 depict reaction schemes for preparing various of the polyamines of the invention and intermediates therefor. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the polyamines of the invention, as described in the above structural formula, R 1 -R 6 may be alkyl, e.g., methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl; aryl, e.g., phenyl, p-tolyl, 2,4,6-trimethyl-phenyl; aryl alkyl, e.g., benzyl, -phenethyl, -phenethyl; cycloalkyl, e.g., cyclohexyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cycloheptyl; any of the foregoing wherein the alkyl chain is interrupted by etheric oxygen, e.g., CH 3 O(CH 2 ) 2 , CH 3 O(CH 2 ) 2 O(CH 2 ) 2 , CH 3 O(CH 2 ) 2 O(CH 2 ) 2 O(CH 2 ) 2 ; or hydrogen. Except where R 1 -R 6 are hydrogen or etheric substituents, each are hydrocarbyl and may have from about 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, it being understood that the size of the substituents will be tailored in each case to ensure that the polyamine is capable of uptake by the target cell and, upon uptake, will competitively bind with the intracellular counter-anions as described above. The bridging groups A, B and C may be the same or different and may be alkylene having 1-8 carbon atoms, e.g., methylene, trimethylene, tetramethylene, pentamethylene; branched alkylene, e.g., CH(CH 3 )CH 2 CH 2 , CH 2 CH(CH 3 )CH 2 , CH(CH 3 )CH 2 CH 2 , CH 2 CH(CH 3 )CH 2 CH 2 ; arylalkylene, e.g., CH(Ph) CH 2 CH 2 , CH 2 CH(Ph) CH 2 , CH(Ph)CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 , CH 2 CH(Ph)CH 2 CH 2 ; cycloalkylene, e.g., cyclohexylene, cis- and trans-1,3-cyclohexylene, 1,4-cyclohexylene, 1,3-cyclopentylene; heterocyclic groups which incorporate within the ring one of the nitrogen atoms of the polyamine e.g., it being understood that the heterocyclic nitrogen group may be located at the terminal end(s) or within the interior of the polyamine. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that it is only necessary that the bridging groups be selected so as to ensure uptake by the cell and competitive binding to the intracellular counter-anion as described above. Particularly preferred polyamines are those set forth in Tables 1 and 2 and in the examples, as well as those having the formula: wherein R 1 -R 6 have the meanings ascribed above and a and b may be the same or different and are integers from 2 to 8. At physiological pHs, the naturally occurring polyamines and the analogs of the present invention are largely in a protonated state Bioorg. Chem ., supra. At a cellular level, these polycations can bind to a collection of single unconnected anions or to anions tethered to a single biomolecule, e.g., the phosphates on a nucleic acid. If there is any significance to the role of charge interaction in the biological properties of the polyamine analogs, alterations in the polyamine methylene backbone should have significant impact on the compounds biological properties. In fact, the significance of charge and the length of the methylene bridges separating the cations in the biological properties of the polyamine analogs has been demonstrated. For example, although N 1 ,N 12 -diethylspermine (DESPM) is quite active against a variety of tumors in cell culture, when the terminal ethyl groups are replaced by ,,,-tri-fluoroethyl groups, the anti-neoplastic activity essentially disappears. The trifluoroethyl group substantially reduces the pK 8 of the terminal nitrogens and they are no longer protonated J. Org. Chem ., Vol. 24, Fluorine containing nitrogen compoundsI Trifluoroethylamines, Bissel et al, pages 1256-1259 (1959). Even though the dimensions of bis-,,-trifluoroethylspermine and diethylspermine are essentially the same, what was once a tetracationic spermine analog is now only a dication. On comparing the abilities of several polyamines and polyamine analogs to displace ethidium iodide from calf thymus DNA, bis-,,-trifluoroethylspermine (BTFESPM) was found to behave more like putrescine than spermine. The same phenomenon is observed when one acetylates a terminal nitrogen of spermine. The amide nitrogen is not protonated at physiological pH, and the compound has no anti-neoplastic properties and behaves very much like spermidine in displacing ethidium iodide from DNA. Perhaps the most impressive finding regarding the separation of charge is associated with S-acetyltransferase (SAT), an enzyme responsible for the N-terminal acetylation of spermine and spermidine. It has been determined that very slight changes in the methylene backbone of the polyamine analogs have pronounced effects on up-regulating the production of this protein, diethylnorspermine (DENSPM)diethylspermine (DESPM)diethyl-homospermine (DEHSPM) Proc.

Extracting a single methylene from each of the three methylene bridges of DEHSPM substantially increases the ability of the analog to stimulate SAT up-regulation, DEHSPM has little impact on SAT levels, while DESPM up-regulates the enzyme by a factor of 200 and DENSPM by 1,200 fold. Although each of the tetraamines is a closely related linear tetracation at physiological pH, each provides a different signal to the cell. While DEHSPM has three 4-methylene bridges and little SAT-stimulating activity, DESPM which has a single central 4-methylene bridge and two terminal 3-methylene bridges is a more active SAT-stimulating factor. DENSPM has three 3-methylene bridges and is the most active SAT stimulator. Presumably, the cell then reads the charge distribution on the polyamines. This suggests that the key issue in the polyamine analogues activity is the distance between the charged centers and not the nature of the groups separating these centers, the insulators. However, that this was indeed the case required proof. The total concentration of polyamines in cation equivalents, as well as the ratios of the various polyamines, is very tightly regulated and, when this equilibrium is disturbed, the cell acts quickly to re-adjust. For example, when polyamine analogs are incorporated, these dynamics are disrupted and the cell responds by either excreting polyamines in the free state or by first acetylating them, followed by excretion of the N 1 -acetyl compounds J. Biol. Chem ., Vol. 264, No. 20, Effect of N 1 ,N 12 -bis(ethyl)spermine and related compounds on growth and polyamine acetylation, content and excretion in human colon tumor cell, Pegg et al, pages 11744-11749 (1989); and Cancer Res ., Vol. 51, Porter et al, supra. On analog incorporation, the cell disposes of the appropriate number of polyamine cation equivalents in order to maintain the total polyamine charge balance. The analogs appear to the cell as normal polyamines and provide many of the same regulatory messages that the natural polyamines do. As analog concentration increases in the cell, the following events ensue. Polyamine biosynthesis is down-regulated, just as when cells are grown in exogenous polyamines. The levels of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMETDC) are drastically reduced just as with the normal negative polyamine feedback control. Analogs with aminopropyl groups cause a marked increase in S-acetyl transferase (SAT). Once again, the issues are how the cell reads the charge distribution on the polyamines and how does it translate this information into regulatory events. The answers to both of these questions will allow one to define the structural boundary conditions for the general design of polyamine anti-neoplastics. Two fundamental issues needed to be addressed regarding the general structural requirements for anti-neoplastic polyamines: (1) Are the cationic centers really key to the compounds anti-neoplastic activity or are the nitrogen centers simply enough, and (2) what are the boundary conditions on the insulators, e.g., bridging groups separating the nitrogen or cationic centers The first question can be answered by comparing two polyamines with essentially the same distance between the nitrogens, but with different pKa values on spatially equivalent nitrogens. While the bis-,,-trifluoroethyl analogue of N 1 , N 12 -diethylspermine strongly suggested that charge was significant in polyamine analogue activity, additional examples had to be developed. In particular, examples were utilized in which other than simple methylene insulators were employed. This experiment is typified by the compounds and their activities as set forth in Table 1. TABLE 1 Piperidine and Pyridine Bicyclic Tetraamines IC 50 (M) of L1210 cells at 48/96 h 2/0.2 100/90 100/0.25 100/100 The results of Table 1 clearly indicate that the nitrogen cationic centers are required for anti-neoplastic activity and not simply a nitrogen center. The pyridine compounds have their nitrogen separated by distances very similar to those in the corresponding piperidine systems. The major difference is, at physiological pH, the pyridine compounds are not substantially protonated at the pyridine nitrogens. This means that the piperidine compounds are tetracations at physiological pH, while the pyridines are dications. The dications, unlike the corresponding reduced and acyclic linear molecules, are not active against L1210 cells. Whether the cations can be insulated from each other by other than a methylene bridge, e.g., a more rigid cyclic backbone, while still maintaining the activity of the compound is a question important not only to an understanding of how cells process information on the polycations, but also to the design of improved therapeutics. If a variety of other aliphatic systems can be substituted for the methylene bridges in the polyamines, it is possible to alter not only the metabolic properties of the polyamine anti-neoplastics, but also their organ distribution and clearance properties. The data set forth in Table 2 further indicates that simple linear insulators are not a strict requirement for polyamine analogue anti-neoplastic activity. The results suggest that the polyamine nitrogens can be incorporated into a cyclic backbone. This observation was further investigated to verify that nitrogen insulators could also be cyclic alkyl groups. Table 2 clearly indicates that this is true. The cyclohexyl fragment works well in a variety of different arrangements as an insulator.

The intention is that the cell should incorporate these compounds via the polyamines transport apparatus and that these analogues should find their way to the same sub-cellular distribution sites that the naturally occurring polyamines do, but once there, because of subtle alterations in the molecules, they should be unable to be further processed. The inability of the polyamines to be further processed is largely related to the fact that the terminal nitrogens in the active compounds are alkylated and unable to be acetylated by SAT.

Org. Chem ., Vol. 52, Bergeron et al, supra; J. Org. Chem ., Vol. 56, Bergeron et al, supra; and CRC Handbook on Microbial Iron Chelates , Bergeron et al, supra were not designed for polyamine bridge expansions, but for the introduction of different alkyl groups at different nitrogens in the triamines or tetraamines. However, it has been recently shown that many of the simple terminally dialkylated polyamine analogs of interest can be accessed via the appropriate tosylamide. For example, to synthesize DESPM, spermine is first tosylated and then monoalkylated at each terminal tosylamide by treatment with sodium hydride and ethyl iodide. The tosyl groups are then removed under conditions of dissolving metal reduction. The shortcomings of the procedure are three-fold: (1) the alkylation must be symmetrical, i.e., the same alkyl group must be fixed to both terminal nitrogens, (2) the methylene insulators between the nitrogens are regulated by the availability of the starting polyamine, and (3) removal of the tosyl protecting group proceeds in low yield. A more satisfactory alternative involves formation of the appropriate tetramesitylenesulfonamides, which can be alkylated in high yields and the tetramesitylenesulfonyl (MES) protecting groups quantitatively removed by treatment with 30% HBr in acetic acid and phenol (FIG. 1 ). This approach eliminates the low yield problem associated with removal of the tosyl protecting group under dissolving metal reduction conditions. The MES methodology has been extended to a symmetrical segmented synthesis which allows for the facile alteration of the methylene backbone (FIG. 2 ). The segmented approach to constructing polyamine analogs offers numerous advantages in terms of flexibility and high yields. The procedure begins with mesitylenesulfonation of a primary amine providing (1), followed by alkylation of (1) with an excess of the appropriate dihalide (FIG. 2 ). The resulting halosulfonamide (2) can then be utilized to alkylate the disulfonamides, e.g., (3). The tetrasulfonamide (4) is treated with HBr/HOAc/PhOH to remove the mesitylenesulfonamide protecting groups. The resulting bromide is converted to the corresponding HCl salts. Thus, the limitations associated with the availability of the starting tetraamine have been eliminated, as well as removal of the tosyl protecting group. In addition, the earlier method was limited to terminal primary alkyl groups because of poor yields when alkylating with secondary and tertiary halides. Linear Polyamine, Non-Methylene Insulators The above methodology has been successfully applied to the synthesis of, e.g., trans-1,4-diaminocyclohexane DESPM analog (FIG. 3 ). The cyclic disulfonamide (2) which is obtained by sulfonation of trans-1,4-cyclohexanediamine (1) is alkylated with two equivalents of halosulfonamide (3, n3). Finally, the amine protecting groups of tetrasulfonamide (4) are easily removed by treatment with phenol and HBr as above to provide cyclic spermine analog (5). Piperidine Polyamine Anti-Neoplastic Synthesis Tetraamines in which the terminal nitrogens are incorporated into piperidine rings can also be prepared using mesitylenesulfonyl-protected segments, as shown in FIGS. 4 and 5 . 4-(Aminomethyl)piperidine (1) was converted into bis-sulfonamide (2) which was alkylated with 1,4-dibromobutane (0.5 equivalent)/NaH/DMF to complete the polyamine framework (3). Reductive removal of the sulfonamide protecting groups in (3) was accomplished with 30% HBr in HOAc/PhOH, generating bicyclic DEHSPM analog (4) (FIG. 4 ). The corresponding 5-4-5 bicyclic polyamine was synthesized from the inside out (FIG. 5 ). Crystalline N,N-bis-(mesitylenesulfonyl)putrescine (1) was alkylated at both ends with mesitylenesulfonate (2), a solid derived from 4-piperidineethanol and mesitylenesulfonyl chloride (MesSO 2 Cl) in pyridine. Deprotection of sulfonamide (3) with HBr as usual gave the larger bicyclic spermine homolog (4). Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Polyamine Anti-Neoplastics The development of a tri-protected diamine reagent ( FIG. 6 ) permits the efficient synthesis of tetraamines which are unsymmetrical with respect to both their outer methylene chains and terminal alkyl substituents. This methodology eliminates the limitation in earlier routes that the terminal alkyl substituents must be identical. Furthermore, terminal monoethyl polyamines (FIG. 8 ), which are useful as standards in studies of diethyl analog metabolism, can also be generated in a systematic way. N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)-N-mesitylenesulfonylamide (BOCNHSO 2 Mes) (1), a di-protected ammonia, was alkylated with 4-chlorobutyronitrile (NaH/DMF) to give (2). The cyano group of (2) was hydrogenated with Raney nickel in methanolic ammonia, resulting in primary amine (3). Both the tert-butoxycarbonyl and mesitylenesulfonyl amine protecting groups were stable to these reduction conditions. Attachment of a second mesitylenesulfonyl functionality to amine (3) under bi-phasic conditions generated the reagent, N-(tert-butoxy-carbonyl)-N,N-bis(mesitylenesulfonyl)putrescine (4). It is noteworthy that this route is flexible, as well, in that an -chloroalkanenitrile of any length can be employed in the alkylation of BOCNHSO 2 Mes (1). Applications of the tri-protected diamine reagent to unsymmetrical polyamine preparation are shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 . Reagent (1) was deprotonated and alkylated with N-(ethyl-amino)tetramethylene unit (2), providing (3) (FIG. 7 ). After removal of the tert-butoxycarbonyl group under mild acidic conditions (TFA, CH 2 Cl 2 ) to produce (4), the other nitrogen of the putrescine reagent was elaborated with N-(ethylamino)-trimethylene segment (5). Unmasking of the amino groups of (6) generated tetraamine (7), in which the outer chains are unequal. N-Ethyl trisulfonamide (3) ( FIG. 8 ) was alkylated with N-(4-bromobutyl)-N-(tert-butyl) mesitylenesulfonamide (2) to afford masked polyamine (4). Treatment of (4) with HBr/HOAc/PhOH cleanly removed the tert-butyl group, as well as the sulfonamides, giving N 1 -ethylhomospermine (5), a polyamine analog metabolite. Only the sulfonamides were cleaved using sodium and liquid ammonia to provide the unsymmetrically dialkylated homospermine derivative (6). The invention is illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.

The compounds of the present invention were prepared by methods generally known to those skilled in the art. In the method shown in Schema 1, where R 1 and R 2 are the same, ethyl piperidin4-ylcarboxylate was reacted with either an appropriately substituted alkyl halide, for example, 4-methoxyphenylmethyl bromide, or with an appropriately substituted aldehyde under reductive conditions, for example, 4-phenoxybenzaldehyde, affording the corresponding ethyl N-substituted alkylpiperidin-4-ylcarboxylate (A). Intermediate (A) was then treated with more than two molar equivalents of the Grignard reagent of an appropriately substituted halide, for example, 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl magnesium bromide, yielding the desired N-(substituted alkyl)4-bis(substituted)hydroxymethypiperidine (I), for example, N-(4-methoxyphenylmethyl)-4bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 1). Example 1 provides a detailed description of how these reactions are conducted. Compound (I) of the present invention, as depicted in Schema 1, can be further reacted to obtain additional compounds within the scope of Compound (I). For example, compounds where R 1 and R 2 are phenyl substituted with haloalkylthio can be converted to the corresponding compounds where R 1 and R 2 are phenyl substituted with haloalkylsulfinyl or haloalkylsulfonyl by the mild oxidation of the haloalkylthio moiety with sodium perborate Synth. Commun.; 1993, 23 (6), 765-769. Another method, again for cases where R 1 and R 2 are the same, is shown in Schema 2. In this method ethyl piperidin-4-ylcarboxylate is reacted with diethyl carbamoyl chloride, under basic conditions, affording the corresponding intermediate, ethyl N-diethylaminocarbonylpiperidin-4-yl-carboxylate (B). Intermediate (B) is treated with more than two molar equivalents of the Grignard reagent of an appropriately substituted halide, yielding the corresponding N-diethylaminocarbonyl-4-bis(substituted phenyl or pyridyl)hydroxymethylpiperdine (C). Intermediate (C) is then treated with lithium aluminum hydride, affording the 4-bis(substituted phenyl or pyridyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (II), for example, 4-bis(4trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine. As depicted in Schema 2a, intermediate (II) may be reacted with either an appropriately substituted alkyl halide or with an appropriately substituted aldehyde, as previously described, affording the desired N-(substituted alkyl)-4-bis(substituted phenyl or pyridyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (I), for example, N-4-(2-methyltetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 9). For the preparation of those compounds in which R 1 and R 2 may be pyridyl, the appropriate pyridyl bromide is lithiated at 78 C. with tert-butyllithium, and the resulting product is used as described for the magnesium Grignard reagents. The preparation of intermediate (II) using the method described above provided relatively low yields of (II). In a preferred method to prepare the intermediate 4-bis(substituted phenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (II), ethyl piperidin-4-ylcarboxylate was reacted with chlorotrimethylsilane under basic conditions in diethyl ether, affording ethyl N-(trimethylsilyl)piperidin-4-yl-carboxylate. The so-prepared ethyl carboxylate was then reacted with more than two molar equivalents of the Grignard reagent of an appropriately substituted halide, a method previously described, affording intermediate (II) Both steps of this method provided product in good yield. Example 3 provides a detailed description of how this reaction is conducted. Schema 3 shows this method. The intermediate 4-bis(substituted phenyl or pyridyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (II) described above, can also be reacted, as shown in Schema 2a, with an appropriately substituted acid chloride, for example, 4-(1-methyltetrazol-5-yl)benzoyl chloride, under basic conditions, yielding the corresponding N-(substituted carbonyl)-4-bis-(substituted phenyl or pyridyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (G). Intermediate (G) is reduced with borane-methyl sulfide complex, affording the desired N-(substituted alkyl)-4-bis(substituted)hydroxymethylpiperidine (I), for example, N-4-(1-methyltetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 8). Schema 4 shows the method used when R 1 and R 2 are not the same. Here 4-aminocarbonylpiperidine is reacted with an appropriately substituted alkyl halide, for example, 4-(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)phenylmethyl chloride, under basic conditions, affording the corresponding N-(substituted alkyl)-4-aminocarbonylpiperidine (H). Treatment of intermediate (H) with phosphorous oxychloride yields the corresponding N-(substituted alkyl)-4-cyanopiperidine (J), which is in turn reacted with the Grignard reagent of an appropriately substituted halide, for example, 2-trifluoromethoxyphenylmagnesium bromide, yielding the corresponding N-(substituted alkyl)-4-(substituted carbonyl)piperidine (K). Intermediate (K) is reacted with a different Grignard reagent of an appropriately substituted halide, for example, 4-trifluoromethoxyphenylmagnesium bromide, yielding the desired N-(substituted alkyl)-4-di(substituted phenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (I), for example, N-4-(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)phenylmethyl-4-(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)( 2-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 103). In an alternate one-step route, the dehydroxylated compounds (IB) are also prepared by the reduction of N-(substituted alkyl))-4-bis(substituted phenyl or pyridyl)hydroxymethylpiperidines (I) with trifluoroacetic acid and triethylsilane in methylene chloride. Included within the scope of the present invention are the N-oxides (IA) of the compounds prepared by methods discussed above. The N-oxides (IA) were prepared by treating the parent compounds, for example, N-4-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethyl-4bis(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 31) with an oxidizing agent, such as 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, yielding the corresponding N-oxide, for example, N-4-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine N-oxide (Compound 32). Example 10 provides a detailed description of how this reaction is conducted. The following examples illustrate general methods by which the compounds of the present invention were prepared. EXAMPLE 1 Synthesis of N-(4-Methoxyphenylmethyl)-4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 1) To a stirred mixture of 1.1 grams (0.045 gram-atom) of magnesium turnings in 30 mL of diethyl ether was added dropwise 15 mL of a solution of 11.0 grams (0.045 mole) of 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl bromide in 30 mL of diethyl ether. Once the reaction had started, the remaining 15 mL of the bromide solution was added portionwise during a 45 minute period. When the reaction subsided, a solution of 5.0 grams (0.018 mole) of ethyl N-(4-methoxyphenylmethyl)piperidin-4-ylcarboxylate in 20 mL of diethyl ether was added dropwise during a five minute period. Upon completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was heated to reflux, where it stirred for about 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was then allowed to cool to ambient temperature, where it stirred for about 18 hours. After this time an aqueous solution saturated with ammonium chloride was added dropwise to quench the reaction. The mixture was then partitioned between water and diethyl ether. The diethyl ether layer was separated and washed first with a solution saturated with sodium chloride and then with water. The organic layer was dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residual oil. The oil was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, with 10% diethyl ether in hexane, 100% diethyl ether, and 10% methanol in diethyl ether as eluants. The product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 6.7 grams of N-(4-methoxyphenylmethyl)-4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine, mp 86-96 C. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. EXAMPLE 2 Synthesis of N-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethyl)piperidine (Compound 2) Step A Synthesis of ethyl N-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethylpiperidin-4-ylcarboxylate as an intermediate A stirred mixture of 5.0 grams (0.032 mole) of ethyl piperidin-4-ylcarboxylate, 5.4 grams (0.032 mole) of 1-(2-chloroethyl)-4-methoxybenzene and 4.4 grams (0.032 mole) of potassium carbonate in 50 mL of dried N,N-dimethylformamide was heated at 70 C. for about 16 hours. After this time the reaction mixture was cooled and partitioned between diethyl ether and water. The organic layer was separated and washed with water and then with an aqueous solution saturated with sodium chloride. The organic layer was dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residue, which was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, with diethyl ether/hexane mixtures as eluants.

This reaction differed from Example 1 in that once the Grignard reaction commenced, the ethyl N-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethylpiperidin-4-ylcarboxylate was added to the diethyl ether solution of 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl bromide. The combination was then added dropwise to the reaction mixture, thereby introducing the piperidin-4-ylcarboxylate to the reaction mixture as the Grignard reagent was forming. Upon completion of addition, the reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for about 18 hours. After this time an aqueous solution saturated with ammonium chloride was added dropwise to quench the reaction. The reaction mixture was then extracted with methylene chloride. The combined extracts were washed with a dilute aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid and then with an aqueous solution saturated with sodium chloride. The organic layer was dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residue, which was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, with hexane/diethyl ether and ethyl acetate/methanol combinations as eluants. A second column chromatography on silica gel was required, with diethyl ether as the eluant, to afford pure product. The product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 0.3 gram of N-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure.

An oily solid precipitate formed. Upon completion of precipitation, the reaction mixture was taken up in 25 mL of hexane and stored in a refrigerator for about 18 hours. After this time the supernatant liquid was decanted from the precipitate. The precipitate was then stirred with about 20 mL of diethyl ether, and the mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residue.

The solid was dissolved in 30 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide and, with stirring, 3.7 grams (0.029 mole) of N,N-diisopropylethylamine and 3.1 grams (0.019 mole) of ethyl piperdin-4-ylcarboxylate were added simultaneously from syringes. The resultant reaction caused the reaction mixture temperature to rise to about 40 C. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature as it stirred for about 18 hours. The reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted with ethyl acetate and then with diethyl ether. The combined extracts were washed with an aqueous solution saturated with sodium bicarbonate, and then with an aqueous solution saturated with sodium chloride. The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residual oil, which was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, with ethyl acetate as the eluant. The product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 2.1 grams of ethyl N-(2-ethylbenzoxazol-5-ylmethyl)piperidin-4-ylcarboxylate. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure.

The crude reaction product was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, with methylene chloride and then ethyl acetate as eluants. The product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 2.1 grams of N-4-(2-ethylbenzoxazol-5-yl)methyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. EXAMPLE 7 Synthesis of N-4-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)-hydroxymethyl-piperidine (Compound 9) Step A Synthesis of 4-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)benzaldehyde as an intermediate A stirred solution of 2.2 grams (0.009 mole) 4-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl bromide in 70 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran was cooled to 70 C., and 7.4 mL (0.018 mole) of n-butyllithium (2.5M in hexanes) was added dropwise from a syringe. The resulting reaction caused the reaction mixture temperature to rise to about 50 C. The reaction mixture was again cooled to 70 C., and stirring was continued for about 30 minutes. After this time 0.8 mL (0.010 mole) of N,N-dimethylformamide was added during a 90 second period. The reaction mixture was then stirred for 30 minutes at ice-water bath temperature, after which time it was allowed to warm to ambient temperature. The reaction mixture was poured into 200 mL of an aqueous solution saturated with ammonium chloride. The mixture was stirred for about 90 minutes and then extracted with three 150 mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined extracts were washed with one 400 mL portion of an aqueous solution saturated with sodium chloride. The organic layer was dried with sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residual oil, which was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, with 3:7 ethyl acetate:heptane as the eluant. The product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 0.5 gram of 4(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)benzaldehyde. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. Step B Synthesis of 4-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethanol as an intermediate This compound was prepared in a manner analogous to that of Step A of Example 5, with 0.5 gram (0.003 mole) of 4-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)benzaldehyde and 0.1 gram (0.003 mole) of sodium borohydride in 17 mL of ethanol.

The crude reaction product was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, with 3:7 acetone:methylene chloride as the eluant. The product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding about 0.2 gram of N-4-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. EXAMPLE 8 Synthesis of N-4(4,5-dihydro-1-methyl-5-oxo-1H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)phenylmethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 12) Step A Synthesis of 4,5-dihydro-1-methyl-5-oxo4-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole as an intermediate To a stirred solution of 3.5 grams (0.08 mole) of methylhydrazine in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran, cooled to 0 C., was added dropwise 10.0 grams (0.08 mole) of 4-methylphenyl isocyanate. Upon completion of the addition the reaction mixture was stirred at 0 C. for 30 minutes, then allowed to warm to ambient temperature, where it stirred for one hour. After this time the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residual solid. The solid was dissolved in 100 mL of dioxane and 11.1 grams (0.08 mole) of triethyl orthoformate and three drops of concentrated sulfuric acid were added. The reaction mixture was heated at reflux for about three hours, during which time about 75 mL of a water-dioxane azeotrope was collected by distillation, after which the reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for about 60 hours. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure to a residual solid. The solid was dissolved in about 150 mL of ethyl acetate, and washed with one 50 mL portion of an aqueous solution saturated with sodium bicarbonate and one 50 mL portion of an aqueous solution saturated with sodium chloride. The organic layer was dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residual solid, which was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, with 3:7 ethyl acetate:heptane as the eluant. The product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 5.6 grams of an uncyclized intermediate of the intended product. This intermediate was then stirred with 10 mL of Eatons Reagent (a 7.5% wt/wt solution of phosphorous pentoxide in methanesulfonic acid) for about 18 hours. The mixture was then poured into ice-water and the resultant precipitate collected by filtration, yielding 3.3 grams of 4,5-dihydro-1-methyl-5-oxo-4-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. Step B Synthesis of 4,5-dihydro-1-methyl-5-oxo-4-(4-bromomethylphenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole as an intermediate To a stirred solution of 2.6 grams (0.013 mole) of 4,5-dihydro-1-methyl-5-oxo-4-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole in 150 mL of carbon tetrachloride were added 0.3 gram (catalyst) of benzoyl peroxide and 2.5 grams (0.014 mole) of N-bromosuccinimide. The reaction mixture was heated at reflux for three hours, after which it was cooled and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 2.6 grams of 4,5-dihydro-1-methyl-5-oxo-4-(4-bromomethylphenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole, which was used in the next reaction without further characterization. Step C Synthesis of N-4-(4,5dihydro-1-methyl-5-oxo-1H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)phenylmethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 12) This compound was prepared in a manner analogous to that of Step D of Example 4, with 2.0 grams (0.007 mole) of 4,5-dihydro-1-methyl-5-oxo4-(4-bromomethylphenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole, 2.0 grams (0.005 mole) of 4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (prepared as in Step C of Example 4), and 3.2 grams (0.025 mole) of N,N-diisopropylethylamine in about 15 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide as reagents. The crude reaction product was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, with 2:8 heptane:ethyl acetate, and then pure ethyl acetate as eluants. The product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 1.6 grams of N-4-(4,5-dihydro-1-methyl-5-oxo-1H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)phenylmethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. EXAMPLE 9 Synthesis of N-4-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 31) This compound was prepared in the manner of Step E of Example 6, with 2.4 grams (0.007 mole) of ethyl N-4-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethylpiperidin-4-ylcarboxylate, 2.8 mL (0.019 mole) of 4-trifluoromethylphenyl bromide, and 0.4 gram (0.018 gram-atom) of magnesium turnings in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran. The yield of N-4-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine was 2.0 grams. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. EXAMPLE 10 Synthesis of N-4-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-hydroxymethylpiperidine N-oxide (Compound 32) A solution of 1.1 grams (0.002 mole) of N-4-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 31-prepared in Example 9) in 100 mL of methylene chloride was stirred, and 0.6 gram (excess) of 50-85% 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid was added. Upon completion of addition, the reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for about one hour. After this time the reaction mixture was washed with an aqueous 10% solution of sodium hydroxide. The organic layer was dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 1.0 gram of N-4-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl-methyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine N-oxide. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. EXAMPLE 11 Synthesis of N-4-(2-ethyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl-methyl-4-bis(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)hydroxymethyl-piperidine (Compound 118) This compound was prepared in the manner of Step E of Example 6, with 3.4 grams (0.010 mole) of ethyl N-4-(2-ethyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethylpiperidin-4-ylcarboxylate, 7.1 grams (0.030 mole) of 5-bromo-2,2-diffuoro-1,3-benzodioxole, and 0.97 gram (0.040 gram-atom) of magnesium turnings in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran. The yield of N-4-(2-ethyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethyl-4-bis(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)hydroxymethylpiperidine was about 2.0 grams, mp 79-81 C. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. Representative compounds prepared by the methods exemplified above are listed in Table 1. Characterizing properties are given in Table 2. Biological Data Candidate insecticides were incorporated into an artificial diet for evaluation of insecticidal activity against the tobacco budworm ( Heliothis virescens Fabricius) in the following manner. Stock solutions of test chemical in dimethyl sulfoxide, ranging from 50 micromolar to 0.005 micromolar, were prepared for each rate of application. One hundred microliters of each of the stock solutions was manually stirred into 50 mL of a molten (65-70 C.) wheat germ-based artificial diet. The 50 mL of molten diet containing the test chemical was poured evenly into twenty wells in the outer two rows on each side of a twenty-five well, five row plastic tray. (Each well in the tray was about 1 cm in depth, with an opening of 3 cm by 4 cm at the lip.) Molten diet containing only dimethyl sulfoxide at the levels used in the test chemical-treated diet was poured into the five wells in the third (center) row of the tray. Each tray therefore contained one test chemical at a single rate of application, together with an untreated control. The rates of application, expressed as the negative log of the molar concentration, and the corresponding concentrations of the stock solution prepared for each rate are shown below: Stock Solution Rate of Application 50 micromolar 4 5 5 0.5 6 0.05 7 0.005 8 Single second instar tobacco budworm larvae, selected at a stage of growth at which they uniformly weigh about 5 mg each, were placed in each well. Upon completion of infestation, a sheet of clear plastic was heat-sealed over the top of the tray by use of a common household flat iron. The trays were held at 25 C. at 60% relative humidity for five days in a growth chamber. Lighting was set at 14 hours of light and 10 hours of darkness. After the 5-day exposure period, mortality counts were taken, and the surviving insects were weighed. From the weights of the surviving insects that fed on the treated diet as compared to those insects that fed on the untreated diet, the percent growth inhibition caused by each test chemical was determined. From these data, the negative log of the concentration of the test chemical that provided 50% growth inhibition (pI 50 ) was determined by linear regression, when possible, for each test chemical. Also, where possible, the negative log of the concentration of the test chemical that provided 50% mortality (pLC 50 ) was determined. Compounds 118 and 119 were tested in a similar manner in which the artificial diet was surface-treated with candidate insecticide rather than having the candidate insecticide incorporated into the diet. Candidate insecticides with high p150 values from the diet test were tested for insecticidal activity in foliar evaluations against tobacco budworm, beet armyworm ( Spodoptera exigua Hubner), and cabbage looper ( Trichoplusia ni Hubner). In these tests against tobacco budworm and beet armyworm, nine-day-old chick pea plants ( Cicer arietinum ) were sprayed at 20 psi to runoff on both upper and lower leaf surfaces with solutions of test chemical to provide application rates as high as 1000 ppm of test chemical. The solvent used to prepare the solutions of test chemical was 10% acetone or methanol (v/v) and 0.1% of the surfactant octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol in distilled water. Four replicates, each containing one chick pea plant, for each rate of application of test chemical were sprayed. The treated plants were transferred to a hood, where they were kept until the spray had dried. The four chick pea plants for each replicate treated with test chemical as described above were removed from their pots by cutting the stems just above the soil line. The excised leaves and stems from the four plants in each replicate were placed in individual 8-ounce paper cups, each containing a moistened filter paper. Five second-instar (6 days old) tobacco budworms or beet armyworms (7-8 days old) were counted into each cup, taking care not to cause injury. An opaque plastic lid was placed on each cup, which was then held in a growth chamber for a 96 hour exposure period at 25 C. and 50% relative humidity. At the end of the 96 hour exposure period the cups were opened, and the numbers of dead, moribund, and live insects were counted. Using the insect counts, the efficacy of the test chemical was expressed in percent control. Percent control is derived from the total number of dead insects (TD) plus the total number of moribund insects (TM) as compared to the total number of insects (TI) in the test: The condition of the test plants was also observed for phytotoxicity and for reduction of feeding damage as compared to an untreated control. Foliar tests with cabbage looper were conducted in the same manner as described above, the difference being that pinto bean plants ( Phaseolus vulgaris ) were used in place of chick pea plants. The compounds of the present invention were active in the diet test against the tobacco budworm. Over forty of the compounds listed in Table 1 exhibited pI 50 values of 6.0 or greater. Compounds 9, 15, 31-34, 43, 53, 54, 72, 73, 95, 96, 98-101, 103, and 104 all exhibited pI 50 values of 6.5 or greater. Table 3 gives the insecticidal activity data for compounds tested in the diet test. The compounds of the present invention also showed good to excellent insecticidal activity in the foliar test against tobacco budworm, beet armyworm, and cabbage looper. It can be seen from Table 4 that many compounds provided 80% control or greater of one or more of the test insect species at an application rate of 100 ppm in the foliar test. For insecticidal application, the active compounds are formulated into insecticidal compositions by admixture in insecticidally effective amount with adjuvants and carriers normally employed in the art for facilitating the dispersion of active ingredients for the particular utility desired, recognizing the fact that the formulation and mode of application of a toxicant may affect the activity of the material in a given application. Thus, for agricultural use the present insecticidal compounds may be formulated as granules of relatively large particle size, as water-soluble or water-dispersible granules, as powdery dusts, as wettable powders, as emulsifiable concentrates, as solutions, or as any of several other known types of formulations, depending on the desired mode of application. These insecticidal compositions may be applied either as water-diluted sprays, or dusts, or granules to the areas in which insect control is desired. These formulations may contain as little as 0.1%, 0.2% or 0.5% to as much as 95% or more by weight of active ingredient. Dusts are free flowing admixtures of the active ingredients with finely divided solids such as talc, natural clays, kieselguhr, flours such as walnut shell and cottonseed flours, and other organic and inorganic solids which act as dispersants and carriers for the toxicant; these finely divided solids have an average particle size of less than about 50 microns. A typical dust formulation useful herein is one containing 1.0 part or less of the insecticidal compound and 99.0 parts of talc. Wettable powders are in the form of finely divided particles which disperse readily in water or other dispersant. The wettable powder is ultimately applied to the locus where insect control is desired either as a dry dust or as an emulsion in water or other liquid. Typical carriers for wettable powders include Fullers earth, kaolin clays, silicas, and other highly absorbent, readily wet, inorganic diluents. Wettable powders normally are prepared to contain about 5-80% of active ingredient, depending on the absorbency of the carrier, and usually also contain a small amount of a wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agent to facilitate dispersion. For example, a useful wettable powder formulation contains 80.8 parts of the insecticidal compound, 17.9 parts of Palmetto clay, and 1.0 part of sodium lignosulfonate and 0.3 part of sulfonated aliphatic polyester as wetting agents. Other useful formulations for insecticidal applications are emulsifiable concentrates (ECs) which are homogeneous liquid compositions dispersible in water or other dispersant, and may consist entirely of the insecticidal compound and a liquid or solid emulsifying agent, or may also contain a liquid carrier, such as xylene, heavy aromatic naphthas, isophorone, or other non-volatile organic solvent. For insecticidal application these concentrates are dispersed in water or other liquid carrier, and normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated. The percentage by weight of the essential active ingredient may vary according to the manner in which the composition is to be applied, but in general comprises 0.5 to 95% of active ingredient by weight of the insecticidal composition. Flowable formulations are similar to ECs except that the active ingredient is suspended in a liquid carrier, generally water. Flowables, like ECs, may include a small amount of a surfactant, and contain active ingredient in the range of 0.5 to 95%, frequently from 10 to 50%, by weight of the composition. For application, flowables may be diluted in water or other liquid vehicle, and are normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated. Typical wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agents used in agricultural formulations include, but are not limited to, the alkyl and alkylaryl sulfonates and sulfates and their sodium salts; alkylaryl polyether alcohols; sulfated higher alcohols; polyethylene oxides; sulfonated animal and vegetable oils; sulfonated petroleum oils; fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols and the ethylene oxide addition products of such esters; and the addition product of long-chain mercaptans and ethylene oxide. Many other types of useful surface-active agents are available in commerce. The surface-active agents, when used, normally comprise from 1 to 15% by weight of the composition. Other useful formulations include suspensions of the active ingredient in a relatively non-volatile solvent such as water, corn oil, kerosene, propylene glycol, or other suitable solvents. Still other useful formulations for insecticidal applications include simple solutions of the active ingredient in a solvent in which it is completely soluble at the desired concentration, such as acetone, alkylated naphthalenes, xylene, or other organic solvents. Granular formulations, wherein the toxicant is carried on relatively coarse particles, are of particular utility for aerial distribution or for penetration of cover crop canopy. Pressurized sprays, typically aerosols wherein the active ingredient is dispersed in finely divided form as a result of vaporization of a low boiling dispersant solvent carrier, such as carbon dioxide, propane, or butane, may also be used. Water-soluble or water-dispersible granules are also useful formulations for insecticidal application of the present compounds. Such granular formulations are free-flowing, non-dusty, and readily water-soluble or water-miscible. The soluble or dispersible granular formulations described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,920,442 are useful herein with the present insecticidal compounds. In use by the farmer on the field, the granular formulations, emulsifiable concentrates, flowable concentrates, solutions, etc., may be diluted with water to give a concentration of active ingredient in the range of say 0.1% or 0.2% to 1.5% or 2%. The active insecticidal compounds of this invention may be formulated and/or applied with other insecticides, fungicides, nematicides, plant growth regulators, fertilizers, or other agricultural chemicals. In using an active compound of this invention, whether formulated alone or with other agricultural chemicals, to control insects, an effective amount and concentration of the active compound is applied to the locus where control is desired. The locus may be., e.g., the insects themselves, plants upon which the insects feed, or the insect habitat. When the locus is the soil, e.g., soil in which agricultural crops have been or will be planted, the composition of the active compound may be applied to and optionally incorporated into the soil. For most applications the effective amount may be as low as, e.g. about 10 to 500 g/ha, preferably about 100 to 250 g/ha. It is apparent that various modifications may be made in the formulation and application of the compounds of this invention without departing from the inventive concepts herein as defined inventive concepts herein as defined in the claims.

Most of the described aryl derivatives are known compounds. In EP 503 411 and EP 481 299 are described N-phenyl-4-amino-piperidines with antiarrythmic and psychotropic activities. In WO 9715549 are described compounds of the present of formula I, which have a potent effect of stimulating beta-3 adrenaline receptors. These compounds were known to be useful for the treatment of urinary disorders such as frequent urination and urinary incontinence, convulsion and exasperation of the function of digestive tract movement, obesity and diabetes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a method of treatment of a neurodegenerative disease comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the general formula wherein Ar 1 is phenyl, naphthyl or tetrahydronaphthyl, optionally substituted by hydroxy, lower alkoxy, nitro, amino or methanesulfonamide; Ar 2 is phenyl, naphthyl or tetrahydronaphthyl, optionally substituted by lower alkyl or halogen; X is C, CH, C(OH) or N; Y is CH 2 , CH or O; Z CH 2 , CH(CH 3 ) or C(CH 3 ) 2 ; R 1 is hydrogen, lower alkyl or acetyl; A is CO or (CHR 2 ) n , wherein R 2 is hydrogen, lower alkyl or hydroxy-lower alkyl; B is (CH 2 ) n , O, CH(OH)(CH 2 ) n , CH(CH 2 OH)(CH 2 ) n , (CH 2 ) n CH(OH) or CH(CH 2 OH); - - - may be a bond; and n is 0-4, or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. The diseases that may be treated in accordance with the present invention include stroke, brain trauma, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, Huntingtons disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, neurodegeneration associated with bacterial sclerosis and neurodegeneration associated with bacterial or viral infection. Moreover, the present invention relates to the method of treatment wherein the compound is administered in an amount from about 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg per day. Detailed Description of the Invention It has now surprisingly been found that compounds of the present invention are NMDA(N-methyl-D-aspartate)-receptor subtype selective blockers, which have a key function in modulating neuronal activity and plasticity. These therepeutic properties make the compounds of formula I and their salts key players in mediating processes underlying development of CNS as well as learning and memory formation. Under pathological conditions of acute and chronic forms of neurodegeneration, overactivation of NMDA receptors is a key event for triggering neuronal cell death. NMDA receptors are composed of members from two subunit families, namely NR-1 (8 different splice variants) and NR-2 (A to D) originating from different genes. Members from the two subunit families show a distinct distribution in different brain areas. Heteromeric combinations of NR-1 members with different NR-2 subunits result in NMDA receptors displaying different pharmaceutical properties. Possible therapeutic indications for NMDA receptor subtype specific blockers include acute forms of neurodegeneration caused, e.g., by stroke and brain trauma, and chronic forms of neurodegeneration such as Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, Huntingtons disease, ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), neurodegeneration associated with bacterial sclerosis and neurodegeneration associated with bacterial or viral infections. In accordance with the present invention, the use of compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof are administered in the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases, caused by overactivation of respective NMDA receptor subtype. Also encompassed by the present invention are methods of treatment by administering a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof or a pharmaceutical composition containing such compound. The present invention embraces treatment with racemic mixtures and all their corresponding enantiomers of the compounds of formula I. Referring to X as position 1 of the ring, the N(R 1 )ABAr 2 group can be a subsituent at ring position 2 (where 4 is not 0), 3 or 4. The following definitions of the general terms used in the present description apply irrespective of whether the terms in question appear alone or in combination. As used herein, the term lower alkyl denotes a straight- or branched-chain alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl and the like. The term halogen denotes chlorine, iodine, fluorine and bromine. The term lower alkoxy denotes a group wherein the alkyl residue is as defined above for lower alkyl. The term pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts embraces salts with inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methane-sulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like. The term leaving group has the meaning conventionally used, and refers to, for example, halogen, alkylsulfonyloxy, arylsulfonyloxy and the like. The most preferred leaving group in the present case is a halogen. The compounds of the present invention may be subdivided in the following subgroups: wherein Z is CH(CH 3 ) or C(CH 3 ) 2 , Ar 1 , Ar 2 , X, A, B, the dotted line and R 1 have the significances given above and X 1 is C(OH) or N. Preferred compounds of formula Ia in the scope of the present invention are the following: trans-4-4-(3-phenyl-propylamino)-cyclohexyl-phenol, trans-4-4-methyl-(3-phenyl-propyl)-amino-cyclohexyl-phenol, trans-4-4-ethyl-(3-phenyl-propyl)-amino-cyclohexyl-phenol, trans-4-4-(4-phenyl-butylamino)-cyclohexyl-phenol, trans-4-4-3-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-propylamino-cyclohexylphenol, trans-4-(4-3-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-propyl -methyl-amino-cyclohexyl)-phenol, trans-4-4-methyl-(2-p-tolyloxy-ethyl)-amino-cyclohexyl-phenol, (RS)-4-trans-4-(1-hydroxymethyl-3-phenyl-propylamino)-cyclohexyl-phenol, (RS)-4-trans-4-(2-hydroxymethyl-3-phenyl-propylamino)-cyclohexyl-phenol, and trans-N-(4-4-methyl-(3-phenyl-propyl)-amino-cyclohexyl-phenyl)-methanesulfonamide. The following examples are preferred compounds of formula Ib: cis-4-1-hydroxy-4-(3-phenyl-propylamino)-cyclohexyl-phenol, 4-4-methyl-(3-phenyl-propyl)-amino-piperidin-1-yl-phenol and 4-4-(3-phenyl-propylamino)-piperidin-1-yl-phenol.

Test Method R-(R*,S*)-a-(4-Hydroxy-phenyl)-b-methyl-4-(phenyl-methyl)-1-piperidine propanol) Binding Male Fllinsdorf albino rats weighing between 150-200 g were used. Membranes were prepared by homogenization of the whole brain minus cerebellum and medulla oblongata with a Polytron (10.000 rpm, 30 seconds), in 25 volumes of a cold Tris-HCl 50 mM, EDTA 10 mM, pH 7.1 buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 48.000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C. The pellet was resuspended using the Polytron in the same volume of buffer and the homogenate was incubated at 37 C. for 10 minutes. After centrifugation the pellet was homogenized in the same buffer and frozen at 80 C. for at least 16 hours but not more than 10 days. For the binding assay the homogenate was thawed at 37 C., centrifuged and the pellet was washed three times as above in a Tris-HCl 5 mM, pH 7.4 cold buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and used at a final concentration of 200 mg of protein/ml. Binding experiments were performed using a Tris-HCl 50 mM, pH 7.4 buffer. For displacement experiments 5 nM of R-(R*,S*)-a-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-b-methyl-4-(phenyl-methyl)-1-piperidine propanol) were used and non specific binding was measured using 10 mM of tetrahydroisoquinoline and usually it accounts for 10% of the total. The incubation time was 2 hours at 4 C. and the assay was stopped by filtration on Whatmann GF/B glass fiber filters (Unifilter-96, Packard, Ztrich, Switzerland). The filters were washed 5 times with cold buffer. The radioactivity on the filter was counted on a Packard Top-count microplate scintillation counter after addition of 40 mL of microscint 40 (Canberra Packard S.A., Zrich, Switzerland). The effects of compounds were measured using a minimum of 8 concentrations and repeated at least once. The pooled normalized values were analyzed using a non-linear regression calculation program which provide IC 50 with their relative upper and lower 95% confidence limits (RS1, BBN, USA). The IC 50 value refers to the concentration of a compound needed to give 50% inhibition, i.e., the concentration at which 50% of the ligands bonded to the receptor are displaced.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is prepared under 35 U.S.C. Section 371 of International Patent Application PCT/JP97/04856, filed Dec. 25, 1997. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to novel N-hydroxyurea derivative and pharmaceutical composition containing the same. These compounds have a lipoxygenase inhibitory activity and a thromboxane synthase inhibitory activity, so are useful in treating or alleviating allergic diseases or inflammatory diseases. BACKGROUND ART In recent years, the role of chemical mediators in asthma and other allergic diseases has been quickly elucidated. In addition to histamine, PAF, leukotrienes, thromboxane A 2 , etc. have become known. It has been shown that leukotrienes are biosynthesized by the action of 5-ipoxygenase from arachidonic acid, and thromboxane A 2 is biosynthesized by thromboxane synthase after the catabolism with cyclooxygenase from arachidonic acid. Further, leukotrienes and thromboxane A 2 have both been found to be important chemical mediators in allergic reactions causing various diseases such as asthma, psoriasis, enteritis, nephritis, ulcers, and ischemia. Therefore, if it were possible to inhibit the biosynthesis of both chemical mediators, a greater effect could be obtained in treating or alleviating the above diseases when compared with the inhibition of single mediator. Recently, as compounds for inhibiting the biosynthesis of such two mediators, benzothiazole derivatives (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 5-178855), quinone derivatives (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 5-78321), imidazolylphenol derivatives (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 6-9571), and N-hydroxyurea derivatives (WO96/23772) have become known. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide compounds capable of inhibiting both the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and thromboxane A 2 , that is, novel compounds having both the dual inhibition against lipoxygenase and thromboxane synthase at the same time. In accordance with the present invention, there are provided N-hydroxyurea derivatives having the formula (I): wherein, either one of R 1 , R 3 and R 4 represents A, either one of the other groups of R 1 , R 3 , and R 4 and R 2 represents a 3-pyridyl group or 3-pyridyl alkyl group, the remaining groups of R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , and R 4 independently represent a hydrogen atom, halogen atom, or a substituted or unsubstituted C 1 to C 8 alkyl group where the substituent represents a halogen atom, cyano group, phenyl group, carboxyl group, or lower alkoxycarbonyl group, R 5 represents a hydrogen atom or lower alkyl group, R 6 represents a hydrogen atom, lower alkyl group, C 3 to C 7 cycloalkyl group, or a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group, where the substituent represents a halogen atom, lower alkyl group, or lower alkoxy group, B indicates a bond, C 1 to C 20 alkylene group, C 2 to C 8 alkenylene group, or C 2 to C 8 alkynylene group or BC(R 5 ) represents a C 2 to C 6 alkylene group having a benzene ring in the middle thereof. In accordance with the present invention, there is further provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising this N-hydroxyurea derivative or its optically active substances, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or the hydrates or solvates thereof as an active principle, in particular an antiasthmatic or anti-inflammatory drug.

The usable starting substances are commercially available compounds or compounds produced from known compounds by known methods. That is, the compound according to the present invention represented by the formula (I) may be synthesized, for example, by the following reaction process (1) and further may be synthesized by methods other than this reaction process. wherein, R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 , and B are the same as those defined in the formula (I). The reactions used in this synthetic process are known, standard methods. That is, hydroxyamine (vi) and trimethylsilyl isocyanate are reacted to obtain the target compound (vii). Further, in the compounds represented by the formula (I), for example, a compound where R 6 is a methyl group, cyclohexyl group, etc. may be synthesized by the reaction of the hydroxylamine and the corresponding R 6 NCO (e.g., methyl isocyanate, cyclohexyl isocyanate). Further, as the other method, a compound where R 6 is a hydrogen atom may be easily synthesized from hydroxylamine (vi) using a known standard method. For example, hydroxylamine may be reacted under an acidic condition with potassium cyanate or sodium cyanate to prepare the hydroxyurea (see WO95/12589). Hydroxylamine (vi) is easily synthesized from a ketone or aldehyde (ii) or alcohol (i) or halogen compound (iv) using a known standard method. For example, it is possible to react a corresponding alcohol (i) using a condition of Mitsunobu reaction with N,O-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)hydroxylamine to synthesize an N,O-protected hydroxylamine (vi), followed by an acid hydrolysis to give the hydroxylamine (vi) (see WO92/01682).

As the preferable agents sodium cyanoborohydride, a borane-pyridine complex, etc. may be mentioned. Further, as the other method, hydroxylamine (vi) is easily synthesized from a reaction intermediate, halogen compound (iv) using a known standard method.

Further, the synthetic intermediate aldehyde, ketone, or other carbonyl compound (ii) is synthesized by a standard method. For example, it is synthesized by oxidation of alcohol (i). The oxidation reaction used may be manganese dioxide oxidation, Jones oxidation, Swern oxidation, etc. On the other hand, the synthetic intermediate alcohol (i) is also synthesized by a standard method. For example, a carbonyl compound (ii), such as an aldehyde, ketone and ester, is reduced by various reductant. As the reductant used here, sodium borohydride, lithium aluminum hydride, diisobutylaluminum hydride, etc. may be mentioned. Further, the alcohol (i) may be synthesized, as another method, by using for a Grignard reagent or organometallic compound etc. from the carbonyl compound.

The synthetic intermediate halogen compound (iv) is synthesized by halogenation of the alcohol (i) by a standard method. For example, it is synthesized by reacting a suitable alcohol with carbon tetrahalide and triphenyl phosphine in methylene chloride. The indole compounds used in the present invention may be synthesized from a readily available other indole compound by a standard method. For example, a suitable indole compound may lead to a formylindole compound by a Vilsmeier reagent, or an indole compound may lead to an acylindole compound by an acid chloride or acid anhydride by a Friedel Crafts reaction. As a preferable process, condensation under Vilsmeier-Haack reaction conditions of, for example, dimethylformamide in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride may be mentioned. The precursor of a compound where B in the formula (I) is a vinylene group or ethylene group is increased number of carbon atom by using a Wittig reaction, Horner-Emmons reaction, etc. on those having aldehyde. As the phosphonium salt and phosphonate ester used here, trimethylphosphonoacetate, ethyl(triphenyl phosphoranylidene)acetate or ethyl diethylphosphono acetate etc. may be mentioned. Further, according to the Horner-Emmons reaction, synthesis is carried out by reacting with phosphonocarboanion which is formed by treating alkyl phosphorate diester with a base. The base used here may be sodium hydride, sodium amide, etc. Further, the double bond of the olefin is reduced by a known method (e.g. catalytic hydrogenation). The catalyst used here may be platinum oxide, platinum on activated carbon, palladium on activated carbon, Raney nickel, etc. As a preferable example, palladium on activated carbon may be mentioned. The reaction may be performed in the range of from atmospheric pressure to 5 atmospheres. Further, the intermediate alcohol of the compound where B in the formula (I) has a triple bond is easily synthesized by a known method using a catalyst. For example, reactions using various palladium catalysts can be mentioned. As a preferable reaction, a method of reacting a suitable halogen, 10% palladium on carbon, triphenyl phosphine, copper iodide and potassium carbonate, in mixed solvent of 1,2-dimethoxyethane and water solvent may be mentioned to corresponding alcohol (see Synlett 1995, p. 1115).

These were made to fast from the day before the test. The test drug was suspended in 0.5% sodium carboxymethylcellulose and orally administered one hour before the blood was taken. The blood was taken from the abdominal aorta and divided for the measurement of the thromboxane synthase inhibitory activity and the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory activity. The thromboxane synthase activity was shown using as an indicator the amount of production of the thromboxane A 2 stable metabolite thromboxane B 2 . The divided blood was allowed to naturally coagulate (25 C., 90 minutes) and then the serum was centrifuged (3000 rpm, 20 minutes, 4 C.) and the amount of thromboxane B 2 in the serum was measured by the EIA method. For the thromboxane synthase inhibitory activity, the 50% inhibitory amount was calculated from the rate of inhibition of the test drug group with respect to the solvent control group. The 5-lipoxygenase activity was shown using as an indicator the amount of production of leukotriene B 4 . 50 pM calcium ionophor (A23187) was added to the divided blood to start the reaction (37 C., 30 minutes), and 1 mM Indomethacin, 1 mM Phenidone, and 0.1 mM EGTA were added to stop the reaction. The plasma was centrifuged (3000 rpm, 20 minutes, 4 C.) and the leukotriene B 4 in the plasma was measured by the EIA method. For the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory activity, the 50% inhibitory amount was calculated from the rate of inhibition of the test drug group with respect to the solvent control group. As the test compounds, the above compounds 18 to 21, 24 to 26, 31, 33, 35, 40, 41 and 45 were used for the test. The results are shown in Table 3. TABLE 3 ED 50 (/kg) Compound no.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to IP receptor antagonists, especially to certain 2-(substituted-phenyl)amino-imidazoline derivatives; pharmaceutical compositions containing them; and methods for their use as therapeutic agents. 2. Background Information and Related Disclosures Prostaglandins or prostanoids (PG) are a group of biologically active compounds derived from membrane phospholids and are formed from certain polyunsaturated fatty acids. They fall into several main classes designated by letters including D, E, F, G, H, and I (prostacyclin). The main classes are further subdivided as indicated by subscripts 1, 2, or 3, which reflect the fatty acid precursor, for example PGE 1 or PGE 2 . Prostanoids are ubiquitously produced and the rate of their production usually increases in response to diverse stimuli. They thereby exhibit a wide variety of pharmacological properties. The diversity of effects of prostanoids can be explained by the existence of a number of distinct receptors that mediate their action. The receptors have been named for the natural prostaglandin for which they have the greatest affinity and have been divided into five main types, designated as DP (PGD 2 ), FP (PG 2 ), IP (PGI 2 ), TP (TXA 2 ), AND EP (PGE 2 ). Additional information relating to prostaglandins and their receptors are described in Goodman Gillmans, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics , ninth edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996, Chapter 26, pages 601-616. Prostanoids are generated by most cells in response to mechanical, thermal or chemical injury and inflammatory insult, and are responsible for the sensitization or direct activation of nearby sensory nerve endings. The hyperalgesic effects (an increased responsiveness to a stimulus that is normally painful) of several prostanoids have been reported in several inflammatory models of nociception. Even though PGE 2 has attained wide recognition as the primary mediator of hyperalgesia, significant quantities of other prostanoids, including PGI 2 , are released by injury or inflammation. Indeed, when the effects of PGE 2 and PGI 2 on sensory neurons are compared directly, PGI 2 is equally or more effective as a hyperalgesic or sensitizing agent both in vivo and in vitro assays. However, to date, there have been no selective receptor antagonists which could unequivocally characterize the prostanoid receptor subtype(s) that mediate the sensitizing effects of PGE 2 or PGI 2 . When the intrinsic instability and pharmacokinetic properties of PGI 2 are taken into account, a preponderance of in vivo analgesia studies in rodents suggest that PGI 2 plays a major role in the induction of hyperalgesia. Likewise, in vitro studies provide substantial evidence to suggest that IP receptors act as important modulators of sensory neuron function. Since IP receptors in sensory neurons are coupled to activation of both adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C, and hence, cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, these receptors can exert powerful effects on ion channel activity and thus neurotransmitter release. Recent compelling evidence for a prominent role for IP (PGI 2 -preferring) receptors in inflammatory pain has been obtained from recent studies in transgenic mice lacking the IP receptor (T. Murata et al., Nature 1997, 388, 678-682). In these animals, the acetic acid-induced writhing response or the carrageenan-induced paw edema was reduced to levels similar to those seen with administration of indomethacin in wild-type mice. In contrast, spinal nociceptive reflexes measured by the tail-flick and hot-plate test were normal. The modest writhing response induced by PGE 2 was unchanged in the transgenic animals. Based upon these observations, the compounds of the present invention are expected to be effective anti-nociceptive agents. In addition to being mediators of hyperalgesia, prostanoids are known to be generated locally in the bladder in response to physiologic stimuli such as stretch of the detrusor smooth muscle, injuries of the vesical mucosa, and nerve stimulation (K. Anderson, Pharmacological Reviews 1993, 45(3), 253-308). PGI 2 is the major prostanoid released from the human bladder. Several lines of evidence suggest that prostanoids may be the link between detrusor muscle stretch produced by bladder filling and activation of C-fiber afferents by bladder distension. It has been proposed that prostanoids may be involved in the pathophysiology of bladder disorders, e.g., bladder outlet obstruction, and conditions associated with urinary incontinence such as urge incontinence, stress incontinence, and bladder hyperreactivity. Therefore, antagonists of prostanoid IP receptors are expected to be useful in the treatment of such conditions. Certain 2-(substituted-phenyl)amino-imidazoline compounds have been exemplifed in the patent literature. For example, European Patent No. 0 017 484 B1 (Fujisawa Pharmaceutical) discloses compounds useful for treatment of hypertensive, inflammatory and gastrointestinal disorder and relief from pain of various origins; U.S. Pat.

Crystal form refers to various solid forms of the same compound, for example polymorphs, solvates, and amorphous forms. (a) Polymorphs are crystal structures in which a compound can crystallize in different crystal packing arrangements, all of which have the same elemental composition. Different polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, storage temperature, and other factors may cause one crystal form to dominate. (b) Solvates are generally a crystal form that contains either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent. Often, during the process of crystallization some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar ratio of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state, thus forming a solvate. When the solvent is water, hydrates may be formed. (c) Amorphous forms are noncrystalline materials with no long range order and generally do not give a distinctive powder X-ray diffraction pattern. Crystal forms of the present invention have been obtained for 24-(4-isoproxybenzyl)phenylamino-imidazoline sulfate, and are designated as Crystal Forms I and II. Crystal Forms I and II were obtained by utilizing the methods described in Examples 1 and 22, respectively, and are described in more detail in Examples 21-23. Crystal forms, in general, are further described in in Byrn et aL, Pharmaceutical Research , 1995, vol 12(7), 945-954, and in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 1995, edited by E. W. Martin, Mack Publishing Company, 19th edition, Easton, Pa., Vol. 2, Chapter 83, 1447-1462. Treating or treatment of a disease includes: (1) preventing the disease, i.e., causing the clinical symptoms of the disease not to develop in a mammal that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease, (2) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting the development of the disease or its clinical symptoms, or (3) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease or its clinical symptoms. A therapeutically effective amount means the amount of a compound that, when administered to a mammal for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease. The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending on the compound, the disease state being treated, the severity of the disease treated, the age and relative health of the subject, the route and form of administration, the judgement of the attending medical practitioner, and other factors. As is well-known in the art, the imidazolin-2-ylamino group in compounds such as the compounds of Formula I is in tautomeric equilibrium with the imidazolin-2-ylideneamino group: For convenience, all the compounds of Formula I are shown as having the imidazolin-2yi-amino structure, but it is to be understood that compounds of both tautomeric forms are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Nomenclature The naming and numbering of the compounds of this invention is illustrated below: Side chains of the R 1 substituent are numbered as shown below: The compounds of the invention are named as imidazoline derivatives, and the nomenclature used in this application is generally based on the IUPAC recommendations. However, because a strict adherence to these recommendations would result in the names changing substantially when only a single substituent is changed, compounds have been named in a form that maintains consistency of nomenclature for the basic structure of the molecule. For example, a compound of Formula I wherein R 1 is a group represented by formula (A), R 2 and R 4 are hydrogen, and R 3 is sec-butoxy, is named 2-4-(4-sec-butoxybenzyl)phenylamino-imidazoline. For example, a compound of Formula I wherein R 1 is a group represented by formula (B) in which X is S, R 2 and R 4 are hydrogen, and R 5 is methoxy, is named 2-4-(5-methoxythienyl-2-ylmethyl)phenylamino-imidazoline. For example, a compound of Formula I wherein R 1 is a group represented by formula (C) in which X is N, R and R are hydrogen, and R 6 is ethylaminocarbonyl, is named 2-4-(1-ethylaminocarbonyl-piperidin-4-ylmethyl)phenylamino-imidazoline.

Accordingly, these compounds are therefore useful as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents in mammals, especially humans. They find utility in pain conditions (states) from a wide variety of causes, including but not limited to, inflammatory pain, surgical pain, visceral pain, dental pain, premenstrual pain, central pain, pain due to burns, migraine or cluster headaches, nerve injury, neuritis, neuralgias, poisoning, ischemic injury, interstitial cystitis, cancer pain, viral, parasitic or bacterial infection, post-traumatic injuries (including fractures and sports injuries), and pain associated with functional bowel disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. The compounds also find utility in inflammatory conditions from a variety of causes, including but not limited to, bacterial, fungal or viral infections, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, surgery, bladder infection or idiopathic bladder inflammation, over-use, old age, or nutritional deficiencies, prostatis, conjunctivitis. The compounds also find utility in bladder disorders associated with bladder outlet obstruction and urinary incontinence conditions such as urge incontinence, stress incontinence, and bladder hyperreactivity. The compounds also find utility in respiratory conditions such as asthma, in which the C-fibers in the lungs are hyper-responsive to a number of environmental stimuli, including cold air, dust, pollen and other antigens. Since these C-fibers express IP prostanoid receptors, the activation of these receptors by PGI 2 , and a subsequent release of neurokinins may contribute to the contraction of lung smooth muscle tissues, edema, and mucus secretion.

Example 30 Carrageenan-Induced Mechanical Hyperalgesia Assay The anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity of compounds of this invention was determined by the Carrageenan-Induced Mechanical Hyperalgesia Assay by measuring the inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw hyperalgesia in the rat, using a modification of the method described in L. O. Randall and J. J. Selitto, Archives of International Pharmacodynamics , 1957, 11, 409-419, and Vinegar et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics , 1969, 166, 96-103. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (130-150 g) were weighed and randomly assigned to treatment groups (n1 0). To induce mechanical hyperalgesia, rats were lightly anesthetized with halothane and administered 1% carrageenan or vehicle 1 (100 l) in the plantar surface of the left hindpaw. Rats were administered vehicle (10 ml/kg, p.o.or 1 ml/kg, i.v) or compounds of this invention (at 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) or (0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 10mg/kg, i.v.) one hour before testing. Mechanical hyperalgesia was measured using an Analgesy-meter (UGO BASILE, Biological Research Apparatus, Comerio, Italy). The vehicle- or carrageenan-treated hindpaw was placed on the dome of the apparatus, plantar surface facing down. A constantly increasing force was then applied to the dorsal surface of the paw. The force at which the rat withdrew its paw, struggled, or vocalized was considered the end point. Treatment groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance on the paw withdrawal force (RESP). Pairwise comparisons for the drug-treated groups to the vehicle group were made using Fishers LSD strategy and Dunns procedure. Percent inhibition of mechanical hyperalgesia was calculated for each animal, and the average ID 50 value was estimated using the following sigmoidal model: % inhibition100/(1exp ((ID 50 dose)/N)) where ID50 is the dose of the compound needed to inhibit half of the maximum response (i.e., 100% in this model) and N is a curvature parameter. The compounds of this invention were active in this assay. Example 31 Complete Freunds Adjuvant-Induced Mechanical Hyperalgesia Assay The anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity of compounds of this invention may also be determined using an adjuvant-induced arthritis pain model in the rat, where pain is assessed by the animals response to the squeezing of the inflamed foot, using a modification of the method described in J. Hyiden et al., Pain 1989, 37, 229-243. The modification includes the assessment of hyperalgesia instead of changes in activity of spinal cord neurons. Briefly, rats were weighed and randomly assigned to treatment groups. To induce mechanical hyperalgesia, rats were lightly anesthetized with halothane and 100 l of Complete Freunds Adjuvant or saline was administered into the plantar surface of the left hindpaw. Twenty-four hours later, water (vehicle) or compounds of this invention were orally administered to the rats one hour before testing. Mechanical hyperalgesia was measured using an Analgesy-meter (UGO BASILE, Biological Research Apparatus, Comerio, Italy). The saline or carrageenan-treated hindpaw was placed on the dome of the apparatus, plantar surface facing down. A constantly increasing force was then applied to the dorsal surface of the paw, and the force at which the rat withdrew its paw, struggled, or vocalized was considered the end point. The treatment groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance on the paw withdrawal force. Percent inhibition was calculated for each animal in the form: 100((c/dc/v)(s/vc/v)) where c/d is the paw withdrawal force for the carrageenan-treated paw in an animal to which drug has been administered; c/v is the paw withdrawal force for the carrageenan-treated paw in an animal to which vehicle has been administered; and s/v is the paw withdrawal force for the saline-treated paw in an animal to which vehicle has been administered. Significance was determined using Students t-test. The compounds of the invention were active in this assay. Example 32 Inhibition of Bladder Contractions Induced by Isovolumetric Bladder Distension in Rats The inhibition of bladder contractions was determined by an assay using a modification of the method described in C. A. Maggi et aL, J. Pharm. and Exper. Therapeutics , 1984, 230, 500-513. Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were weighed and randomly assigned to treatment groups. A catheter was inserted through the urethra into the bladder to induce bladder contractions, and a warm saline solution (5 mL) was infused. Rhythmic contractions were produced in about 30% of the animals. The compounds of the invention (0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg) were administered intravenous at the onset of regular rhythmic contractions. The effects on rhythmic contracts were then measured. The compounds of this invention were active in this assay. Example 33 Inhibition of Volume-Induced Contractions in Rats The inhibition of bladder contractions was determined by an assay using a modification of the method described in S. S. Hegde et al., Proceedings of the 26 th Annual Meeting of the International Continence Society (Aug. 27th-30th) 1996, Abstract 126. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with urethane and instrumented for intravenous administration of drugs and, in some cases, measurement of arterial pressure, heart rate and intra-bladder pressure. The effect of test compounds on volume-induced bladder contractions was determined in separate groups of animals. Volume-induced reflex bladder contractions were induced by filling the bladder with saline. The test compounds were administered intravenously in a cumulative manner at 10-minute intervals. Atropine (0.3 mg/kg, iv) was administered at the end of the study as a postive control. The compounds of this invention were active in this assay. Example 34 Reversal of Endotoxin-Induced Hypotension in Rats Septic shock, sometimes referred to as endotoxic shock, is caused by the presence of infectious agents, particularly bacterial endotoxins, in the bloodstream and is characterized by hypotension and organ dysfunction. Many symptoms of septic shock, in particular, hypotension, are induced in the rat by the administration of bacterial endotoxins. The ability of a compound to inhibit endotoxin-induced hypotension is therefore predictive of the utility of the compound in the treatment of septic or endotoxic shock. The activity of the compounds of the invention in the treatment of septic or endotoxic shock was determined by measuring the reversal of endotoxin-induced hypotension in the rat, using a modification of the method described in M. Giral et al, British Journal of Pharmacology , 1969,118, 1223-1231. Briefly, adult rats (200 g) were anesthetized with an inhalation anesthetic and femoral arteries and veins were cannulated for insertion of blood pressure transducers and drug administration lines, respectively. They were placed in Mayo restrainers while still under the influence of the anesthetic. After recovery from anesthesia and stabilization of heart rate and blood pressure (which typically required about 30 minutes), endotoxin (50 mg/kg E. coli and 25 mg/kg Salmonella) was administered intravenously. Changes in blood pressure and heart rate were monitored. After one hour, compounds of this invention or vehicle were also administered intravenously, and cardiovascular parameters were continuously monitored for the next three hours. Responses are represented as percentage return to initial diastolic blood pressure. Significance was determined using Students t-test. The compounds of this invention were active in this assay.

(5) Measurement of the cell growth by the MTT method This was carried out based on the MTT measurement method of Mosmann et al. 10 ml quantities of the MTT of concentration 5 mg/ml were added to each well of the plate on which cellshad been incubatedfor 20 hours in (4), and further culturing carried out for 4 hours. Subsequently, 100 ml of 10% (SDS)/0.01 N-HCl solution was added per well and the MTT formazan was dissolved by warming at 37 C. overnight. Absorbance(620 nm) of each well was mesured in an Immunoreader. (6) Calculation of the measured absorbance and the conversion of units A regression line was drawn based on the absorbance of an IL-3 50 U/ml control for each plate, and then the number of units calculated based on the absorbance for each series based on the ED 50 value thereof. A control plate of DMSO alone was set, and the percentage increase calculated with reference thereto. The results are shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 Concentration Percentage Compound (M) Growth 1 500 119 2 250 140 3 125 134 4 250 181 Example 31 Haemopoietic activityin ordinary mice Using Compound 4 as the test drug, this was administered intravenously fora four days to C57BL/6 mice (6 weeks old, male) (n6) at a dose of 10 mg/kg, and 7 days outset of injection the number of blood cells in the peripheral blood was measured. FIG. 1 shows the percentage increase in terms of a control group (taken as 100%). From the results, it is clear that the test drug significantly increased the number of red blood cells, demonstrating the value of the compounds described in this patent as haemopoietic agents. Industrial Utilization Potential The cyclic ketones of the present invention bring about a significant increase in red blood cells and other cells, and they are effective as outstanding haemopoietic agents in medicine, in particular for the prevention or treatment of cytopaenia brought about by cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, bone marrow transplantation or drug therapy, or by immunological abnormality or anaemia.

loss-affecting cosmetic/pharmaceutical compositions for treating mammalian subjects with hair or scalp disorders, comprise an effective amount of at least one 2-amino-1,3-alkanediol compound having the structural formula (I): formulated into a physiologically topically acceptable carrier medium therefor. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Technical Field of the Invention The present invention relates to novel cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical compositions for topical application to the hair and/or scalp of mammalian subjects, comprising an effective amount of at least one 2-amino-1,3-alkanediol, or derivative thereof, and to the use of such novel compositions for inducing and/or stimulating hair growth and/or retarding hair loss. 2. Description of the Prior Art In human subjects, hair growth and its renewal are principally determined by the activity of the hair follicles. This activity is cyclical and essentially entails three phases, namely, the anagenic phase, the catagenic phase and the telogenic phase. The active anagenic phase, or growth phase, which lasts for several years and during which the hair grows longer, is followed by a very short and transitory catagenic phase, which lasts a few weeks, and then by a resting or quiescent phase, designated the telogenic phase, which lasts a few months. At the end of the rest period, the hair falls out and another cycle begins anew. The head of hair is thus constantly renewed and, of the approximately 150,000 hairs on a human head, at any given instant approximately 10% are at rest and will therefore be replaced in a few months. In a significant number of cases, early hair loss occurs in genetically predisposed subjects and it affects men in particular. It is more particularly androgenetic or androgenic alopecia or, alternatively, androgeno-genetic alopecia. This alopecia is essentially due to a disturbance in hair renewal which results, at first, in an acceleration in the frequency of the cycles at the expense of the quality of the hair and then of its amount. A progressive thinning of the head of hair occurs by regression of the so-called terminal hairs to the downy stage. Certain regions are preferentially affected, in particular the temple or frontal areas in men and, in women, a diffuse alopecia of the vertex is observed. Compositions that eliminate or reduce the effects of alopecia and, in particular, that induce or stimulate hair growth or decrease hair loss have long been considered desiderata in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. In this regard, a large number of very diverse active compounds or substances have already been suggested for such purposes, for example vitamins, such as vitamin E, amino acids, such as serine or methionine, vasodilators, such as acetylcholine and derivatives thereof, female hormones, such as estradiol, keratolytic agents, such as salicylic acid, or chemical compounds, such as 2,4-diamino-6-piperidinopyrimidine 3-oxide or Minoxidil, described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,596,812 or, alternatively, its many derivatives, such as those described in EP-353,123, EP-356,271, EP-408,442, EP-522,964, EP-420,707, EP-459,890 and EP-519,819. Also exemplary thereof are 6-amino-1,2-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2-imino-4-piperidinopyrimidine and derivatives thereof, which are described, more particularly, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,139,619. Nonetheless, considerable research and development is continuing in this art in quest of yet other such valuable active agents. Minoxidil, while it remains the reference compound in the field, exhibits not insignificant side effects which complicate the use thereof. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, a major object of the present invention is the provision of compounds of the 2-amino-1,3-alkanediol type for efficaciously inducing/stimulating hair growth and/or decreasing hair loss, without exhibiting the disadvantages and drawbacks to date characterizing the state of this art. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF BEST MODE AND SPECIFIC/PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION More particularly according to the present invention, the 2-amino-1,3-alkanediol type compounds or derivatives thereof constitute active agents emanating from tissues which are known to the art by the very general term of sphingolipids. Among these sphingolipids, N-acylated derivatives based on sphinganine (2S,3R)-2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol are ceramides mostly present in the hair, whereas the analogous derivatives based on sphingenine (2S,3R,4E)-2-amino-4-octadecene-1,3-diol), other ceramides, constitute a fraction of the lipids mostly present in the stratum corneum of the skin. The ceramides are formulated into cosmetics in the natural or synthetic state, for example, to reinforce the barrier effect of the stratum corneum in order to reduce water loss and thus dryness of the skin (GB-2,178,312, GE-2,213,723, EP-227,994, EP-282,616 and EP-556,957). They are also formulated into cosmetic compositions for their properties which confer a better elasticity on the skin (EP-500,437) or into compositions for hair use in order to reinforce the hair and/or to repair the damage caused by the continual attacks to which the latter is subjected. Hitherto, to the knowledge of the assignee hereof, it has never been described nor even suggested that 2-amino-1,3-alkanediols or derivatives thereof exert an effect or influence on cell proliferation and still less on keratinocyte proliferation. It is on the basis of this new property of these aminodiols that it has unexpectedly been shown that these compounds also exert an effect on the survival of the hair follicle. Thus, by increasing the survival time of the hair follicle, the anagenic phase of the hair cycle is lengthened, which has the effect of delaying hair loss. Among the sphingolipids, compounds based on sphingenine induce apoptosis, directly or through a series of events involving cellular proteins. This phenomenon, which results in cell death, transposed to the hair cycle, elicits a halt in the growth of the follicle and in hair loss. The synthesis of compounds based on sphingenine results from several distinct mechanisms. Exemplary are the activation of cellular sphingomyelinase by -type tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), by vitamin D, by interleukin-1, by the FAS antigen or ionizing radiation. It is also known that compounds based on sphingenine can also be generated by activation of acyl-CoA: sphinganine (sphingosine) N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.24). Thus, it has now unexpectedly been determined that the compounds of formula (I) can interfere both during the synthesis of the compounds based on sphingenine and during the events induced by these compounds. The consequence of this is to prevent the apoptosis induced by the compounds based on sphingenine and also to stimulate cell growth and viability. In chemotherapeutic anticancer treatments, the use of anticancer agents causes cell death in the hair follicle, resulting in hair loss. This induced alopecia is generally transitory, but can sometimes be permanent (A. M. Hussein, South Med. J., 1993, 86, 489-496). This side effect causes some patients to refuse this type of therapy (K. O. Baxley et al., Cancer Nurs., 1984, 7, 499-503). Doxorubicin, for example, induces such a hair loss. It is known that doxorubicin activates ceramide synthase, an enzyme whose activation results in an increase in the intracellular level of compounds based on sphingenine which themselves induce the phenomenon of apoptosis and of cell death. It has now been determined that the compounds of formula (I) below counteract the harmful side effects of anticancer agents, such as, for example, doxorubicin, by increasing the cell viability of the keratinocytes of the hair follicles. The present invention features the formulation, into cosmetic/pharmaceutical compositions, as active agents promoting hair survival and/or growth, of at least one compound having the general formula (I): in which R 1 is a saturated or unsaturated, optionally hydroxylated, linear or branched hydrocarbon radical having from 4 to 28 carbon atoms; R 2 is a hydrogen atom or the radical: wherein R 3 is a saturated or unsaturated, optionally hydroxylated, linear or branched hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 29 carbon atoms, with the proviso that the hydroxyl group thereof may be esterified by a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched acyl radical having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms; and X is a hydrogen atom or the OH radical, or of at least one of its optical isomers or one of the diastereoisomers. R 1 preferably has from 11 to 23 carbon atoms and even more preferably 14 carbon atoms. R 2 preferably is the radical: wherein R 3 preferably has from 7 to 25 carbon atoms. R 1 is preferably a saturated and/or linear hydrocarbon radical, more particularly a saturated linear hydrocarbon radical. R 1 is more preferably a saturated hydrocarbon radical having 14 carbon atoms and even more preferably R 1 is a saturated linear hydrocarbon radical having 14 carbon atoms. The active agent promoting hair survival and/or growth can be a mixture of compounds of formula (I) for which R 1 and/or R 2 are radicals of different chain lengths. These compounds can be employed in the form of a pure isomer or of a mixture of isomers. These compounds present the advantage of not inducing undesirable side effects, which makes their use without risk for the user. Exemplary compounds of formula (I) include: 2-Amino-1,3-octadecanediol; 2-Acetylamino-1,3-octadecanediol; 2-Octanoylamino-1,3-octadecanediol; 2-Tetracosanoylamino-1,3-octadecanediol; 2-N-(2-Hydroxyhexadecanoyl)amino-1,3-octadecanediol; 2-Oleoylamino-1,3-octadecanediol; 2-Hexadecanoylamino-1,3-octadecanediol; 2-N-(2-Hydroxydocosanoyl)amino-1,3-octadecanediol; 2-Amino-1,3,4-octadecanetriol; 2-Hexadecanoylamino-1,3,4-octadecanetriol; and 2-N-(2-Hydroxyhexadecanoyl)amino-1,3,4-octadecanetriol. In a preferred embodiment according to the invention, 2-N-(2-hydroxyhexadecanoyl)amino-1,3-octadecanediol and 2-oleoylamino-1,3-octadecanediol are employed. The amount of the compounds of formula (I) which are advantageously used according to the invention depends, of course, on the nature of the compound itself, on its physicochemical properties and on the technique for the application thereof. One skilled in this art is cognizant how to adjust the amount of the at least one compound of formula (I) according to the requirements thereof. For example, the compounds of formula (I) can be formulated at concentrations by weight of from 10 4 % to 20% and preferably from 10 3 % to 10% in the composition. The present invention also features the use of at least one compound of formula (I) for combating an alopecia induced by an anticancer treatment entailing chemotherapy. When the compound of formula (I) is formulated into a composition which must be topically applied onto the skin and particularly onto the scalp, this composition can be provided in all of the pharmaceutical dosage forms typically employed. For topical application onto the skin, the composition can be in the form, in particular, of an aqueous, alcoholic, aqueous/alcoholic or oily solution, or of a dispersion of the lotion or serum type, of an emulsion having a liquid or semi-liquid consistency of the milk type, obtained by dispersion of a fatty phase in an aqueous phase (O/W) or vice versa (W/O), or of a suspension or of an emulsion with a soft consistency of the aqueous or anhydrous gel, foam or cream type, or, alternatively, of microcapsules or microparticles, or of a vesicular dispersion of ionic and/or nonionic type. It can also be in the form of an aerosol composition also comprising a pressurized propellent agent. Whatever its form, this composition is formulated according to the usual techniques. The amounts of the different constituents of the compositions according to the invention are those that are conventional in the fields under consideration. The compounds according to the invention can also be formulated into various compositions for hair care and, in particular, shampoos, hair-setting lotions, treating lotions, styling creams or gels, dye compositions (in particular oxidation dyes), optionally in the form of color-enhancing shampoos, hair-restructuring lotions, permanent-wave compositions (in particular compositions for the first step of a permanent wave), shampoos for combating parasites, and the like. When the subject composition comprises an emulsion, the proportion of the fatty phase advantageously ranges from 5% to 80% by weight, and preferably from 5% to 50% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the composition. The oils, the waxes, the emulsifiers and the coemulsifiers comprising the composition in the emulsion form are selected from among those conventionally used in the cosmetics field. The emulsifier and the coemulsifier are present, in the composition, in a proportion advantageously ranging from 0.3% to 30% by weight, and preferably from 0.5% to 20% by weight, with respect to the total weight of the composition. The emulsion can, in addition, contain lipid vesicles. When the composition is an oily gel or solution, the fatty phase can constitute more than 90% of the total weight of the composition. Also intended are compositions comprising at least one compound of formula (I) as an active principle intended to induce and/or to stimulate hair growth and/or to slow down or retard its loss comprising liposomed form, such as, in particular, described in WO-94/22468, filed Oct. 13, 1994 and assigned to Anti-Cancer Inc. The compound encapsulated in the liposomes can thus be delivered selectively to the hair follicle. The subject compositions can also contain additives and adjuvants which are conventional in the cosmetics field, such as hydrophilic or lipophilic gelling agents, hydrophilic or lipophilic additives, preservatives, antioxidants, solvents, fragrances, fillers, screening agents, odor absorbers and colorants. The amounts of these different additives and adjuvants are those typically employed in the cosmetics field and range, for example, from 0.01% to 10% of the total weight of the composition. These additives and adjuvants, depending on the nature thereof, can be introduced into the fatty phase, into the aqueous phase and/or into the lipid spherules. Exemplary oils or waxes according to the invention include mineral oils (liquid petrolatum), vegetable oils (liquid fraction of karite butter, sunflower oil), animal oils (perhydrosqualene), synthetic oils (purcellin oil), silicone oils or waxes (cyclomethicone) and fluorinated oils (perfluoropolyethers), beeswax, carnauba wax or paraffin wax. Fatty alcohols and fatty acids (stearic acid) can be added to these oils. Exemplary emulsifiers which are suitable per the invention include glyceryl stearate, polysorbate 60 and the PEG-6/PEG-32/glycol stearate mixture marketed under the trademark Tefose63 by Gattefosse. Exemplary solvents according to the invention include the lower alcohols, in particular ethanol and isopropanol, or propylene glycol. And exemplary hydrophilic gelling agents include carboxyvinyl polymers (carbomer), acrylic copolymers such as acrylate/alkyl acrylate copolymers, polyacrylamides, polysaccharides such as hydroxypropylcellulose, natural gums and clays and representative lipophilic gelling agents include the modified clays such as bentones, metal salts of fatty acids such as aluminum stearates, and hydrophobic silica, ethylcellulose or polyethylene. The subject compositions can also contain other hydrophilic active principles, such as proteins or protein hydrolysates, amino acids, polyols, urea, allantoin, sugars and sugar derivatives, water-soluble vitamins, plant extracts and hydroxy acids.

According to the invention, it is possible, inter alia, to combine at least one compound of formula (I) with other active agents intended, in particular, for the prevention and/or the treatment of cutaneous conditions, particularly conditions of the scalp. Exemplary of such active agents are: (1) agents which modulate cutaneous pigmentation and/or proliferation and/or differentiation, such as retinoic acid and its isomers, retinol and its esters, vitamin D and its derivatives, estrogens, such as estradiol, kojic acid or hydroquinone; (2) antibacterials, such as clindamycin phosphate, erythromycin or antibiotics from the tetracycline class; (3) agents for combating parasites, in particular metronidazole, crotamiton or pyrethroids; (4) antifungals, in particular compounds belonging to the imidazole class, such as econazole, ketoconazole or miconazole or their salts, polyene compounds, such as amphotericin B, compounds of the allylamine family, such as terbinafine, or alternatively octopirox; (5) antiviral agents, such as acyclovir; (6) steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as hydrocortisone, betamethasone valerate or clobetasol propionate, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as ibuprofen and its salts, diclofenac and its salts, acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen or glycyrrhetinic acid; (7) anaesthetic agents, such as lidocaine hydrochloride and derivatives thereof; (8) antipruriginous agents, such as thenaldine, trimeprazine or cyproheptadine; (9) keratolytic agents, such as - and -hydroxycarboxylic acids or -ketocarboxylic acids, their salts, amides or esters and more particularly hydroxy acids, such as glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, citric acid and, generally, fruit acids, and 5-(n-octanoyl)salicylic acid; (10) agents for combating free radicals, such as -tocopherol or its esters, superoxide dismutases, certain metal chelating agents or ascorbic acid and its esters; (11) antiseborrhoeics, such as progesterone; (12) antidandruff agents, such as octopirox or zinc pyrithione; (13) antiacne agents, such as retinoic acid or benzoyl peroxide; (14) substances such as substance P, CGRP or bradykinin antagonists or NO synthase inhibitors, which compounds are described as being active for the treatment of sensitive skins and as exhibiting antiirritant effects, in particular with respect to irritant compounds possibly present in the compositions. Thus, this invention also features compositions comprising an effective amount of at least one compound of formula (I) and at least one active agent selected from among antibacterial agents, agents for combating parasites, antifungal agents, antiviral agents, anti-inflammatory agents, antipruriginous agents, anaesthetic agents, keratolytic agents, agents for combating free radicals, antiseborrhoeic agents, antidandruff agents, antiacne agents, agents which modulate cutaneous pigmentation and/or proliferation and/or differentiation, substance P, CGRP (calcitonin gene related peptide) or bradykinin antagonists or NO synthase inhibitors.

It is envisaged to employ at least one of the compounds corresponding to the formula (I) for the formulation of a pharmaceutical, particularly dermatological, composition intended to treat hair loss and/or to promote hair regrowth. In general, these pharmaceutical compositions are distinguished, in particular, from cosmetic compositions by the amount of active principle which they contain. One skilled in this art can readily determine the amount of active principle which can be used as a function of the result desired, but also taking account of the mode of administration envisaged. For example, the compound of formula (I) can be employed for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition at a concentration of from 0.01% to 20% and preferably from 0.1% to 10% by weight with respect to the weight of the composition. The cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be topically applied onto the alopecic areas of the scalp and hair of an individual and optionally maintained in contact for a number of hours and optionally rinsed. It is possible, for example, to apply the composition containing an effective amount of at least one compound of formula (I) in the evening, to retain the composition in contact overnight and optionally to shampoo in the morning. These applications can be repeated daily for one or a number of months, depending on the particular individuals involved. Thus, the present invention also features a regimen for the cosmetic treatment of the hair and/or of the scalp, comprising topically applying onto the hair and/or the scalp, a cosmetic composition comprising an effective amount of at least one compound of formula (I) in a physiologically topically acceptable carrier medium therefor, maintaining this composition in contact with the hair and/or the scalp, and optionally later rinsing the same therefrom. In order to further illustrate the present invention and the advantages thereof, the following specific examples are given, it being understood that same are intended only as illustrative and in nowise limitative. In said examples to follow, all parts and percentages are given by weight, unless otherwise indicated. EXAMPLE 1 Measurement of the Proliferative Influence of 2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol and Derivatives Thereof on Cultured Keratinocytes HaCat cells (Boukamp and coworkers, J. Cell Biol. , vol. 106, March 1988, 761-771) were cultured in DMEM medium (marketed by Gibco) containing amino acids (mixture of nonessential amino acids) at a concentration of 0.1 mM, penicillin and streptomycin at respective concentrations of 50 International Units per millimeter and of 50 g/ml, glutamine at a concentration of 2 mM, sodium pyruvate at a concentration of 1 mM and 10% fetal calf serum. These cells were inoculated at a density of 10,000 cells per well in the 24 wells of plates of the multiwell type (Costar, France). 24 hours after inoculation, the cells were contacted with the various test compounds in a KBM medium (marketed by Clonetics) containing 0.15 mM of calcium ion, insulin at 5 g/ml, hydrocortisone at 0.5 g/ml and lipid-free bovine serum albumin at 1 g/ml. Cellular counting was carried out 5 days after the addition of the various ceramides using a cell counter of the Coulter Counter type. The various compounds were tested at 0.5 nM, 5 nM, 50 nM and 500 nM. The results, expressed as percentage, represent the increase in the number of cells with respect to the control, namely, with respect to a culture produced under the same conditions in the absence of sphinganine. The different compounds tested were: A: 2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol, B: 2-oleoylamino-1,3-octadecanediol, C: 2-N-(2-hydroxyhexadecanoyl)amino-1,3- octadecanediol, D: 2-tetracosanoylamino-1,3-octadecanediol, E: 2-acetylamino-1,3-octadecanediol, F: 2-octanoylamino-1,3-octadecanediol.

EXAMPLE 2 Measurement of the Effect of 2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol and Derivatives Thereof on Cell Viability HaCat cells were cultured as in Example 1. These were then inoculated at a density of 20,000 cells per well in the 24 wells of plates of the multiwell type (Costar, France). 24 hours after inoculation, the cells were contacted with the various test compounds in a KBM medium (marketed by Clonetics) containing insulin at 5 g/ml and hydrocortisone at 0.5 g/ml. Cell viability was evaluated 48 hours later by measuring the mitochondrial respiration. This was carried out using an XTT kit, marketed by Boehringer, according to the suppliers instructions. The compounds A, B and C of the above Example 1 were tested at a concentration of 50 nM, as well as a derivative based on sphingenine: N-palmitoylsphingenine marketeed by Sigma (C16H). The results, expressed as percentage, represent the increase in the number of cells with respect to the control, namely, with respect to a culture produced under the same conditions in the absence of alkanediol compounds. Control 0 A 17 B 23 C 20 C16H 25 The results evidence that 2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol (A), 2-oleoylamino-1,3-octadecanediol (B) and 2-N-(2-hydroxyhexadecanoyl)amino-1,3-octadecanediol (C) increased the viability of the cultured keratinocytes, whereas N-palmitoylsphingenine (C16H) elicited a cytotoxic effect on the cultured cells. This result indicates that compounds based on sphingenine cannot be used for the treatment of hair follicles since they cause cell death in culture. EXAMPLE 3 Measurement of the Effect of 2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol and Derivatives Thereof on the Cell Cycle HaCat cells were cultured as above. These were then inoculated at a density of 20,000 cells per well in the 24 wells of plates of the multiwell type (Costar, France). 24 hours after inoculation, the cells were contacted with the various test compounds in a KBM medium (marketed by Clonetics) containing insulin at 5 g/ml and hydrocortisone at 0.5 g/ml and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) at 1 M. The phase of the cell cycle was evaluated 48 hours later by measuring the incorporation of BrdU in genomic deoxyribonucleic acid. This was carried out using a BrdU fast kit, marketed by Boehringer, according to the suppliers instructions. The compounds A, B and C of the above example were tested at a concentration of 50 nM. The results, expressed as percentage, represent the increase in the number of cells which have entered into the S phase with respect to the control, namely, with respect to a culture produced under the same conditions in the absence of alkanediol compounds. 72 hours 96 hours Control 0 0 A 36 41 B 43 51 C 17 43 The results evidence that 2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol (A), 2-oleoylamino-1,3-octadecanediol (B) and 2-N-(2-hydroxyhexadecanoyl)amino-1,3-octadecanediol (C) increase the number of keratinocytes which have entered into the S phase, thus indicating stimulation of cell mitotic activity. EXAMPLE 4 Measurement of the Effect of 2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol and Derivatives Thereof on the Survival of the Hair Follicle in Vitro Viable in vitro hair follicles were prepared according to the technique described in FR-95/08,465, filed Jul. 12, 1995 and assigned to the assignee hereof. From a scalp biopsy, a rather fine strip of scalp was isolated using a scalpel. The adipose tissue surrounding the follicles was removed with microforceps while avoiding damage to the hair bulb. The follicle was cut and removed with a scalpel under a microscope in order to separate it from its epidermal and dermal surroundings. The fragment obtained was maintained in culture in Williams E medium, at 37 C., in a humid atmosphere in the presence of CO 2 . The survival of the follicles was evaluated each day by counting the living follicles, according to their morphological appearance. The results are reported as percentage of surviving follicles per day. The experiment was carried out employing the following compounds at a concentration of 50 nM: B: 2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol, C: 2-oleoylamino-1,3-octadecanediol, D: 2-N-(2-hydroxyhexadecanoyl)amino-1,3-octadecanediol, in comparison with the culture medium without alkanediol (A).

EXAMPLE 5 Effect of 2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol and Derivatives Thereof on Cell Viability in the Presence of Doxorubicin HaCat cells were cultured as in Example 2. 24 hours after inoculation, the cells were contacted with the various test compounds in a KBM medium (marketed by Clonetics) containing insulin at 5 g/ml and hydrocortisone at 0.5 g/ml. The cells were cultured in the presence of the 2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol to be tested until evaluation of cell viability. Doxorubicin at a concentration of 1 g/ml was added to the culture medium for 2 hours at the beginning of the experiment. Cell viability was evaluated 48 hours later by measuring the mitochondrial respiration. This was carried out using an XTT kit, marketed by Boehringer, according to the suppliers instructions. The experiment was carried out with the following compounds at a concentration of 50 nM: C: 2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol, D: 2-oleoylamino-1,3-octadecanediol, E: 2-N-(2-hydroxyhexadecanoyl)amino-1,3-octadecanediol, in comparison with the culture medium without alkanediol and without doxorubicin (A) and with a medium containing only doxorubicin (B). The results, expressed as percentage, represent the increase in the number of cells with respect to the control (A), namely, with respect to a culture produced under the same conditions in the absence of alkanediol compounds and of doxorubicin. A 0 B 20 C 25 D 28 E 23 Doxorubicin caused a decrease in cell viability. The presence in the culture medium of a 2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol inhibited this effect and increased cell viability. EXAMPLE 6 Effect of 2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol and Derivatives Thereof on Cell Viability in the Presence of a Compound Based on Sphingenine, N-acetylsphingenine The cells were cultured as in Example 5. N-Acetylsphingenine was at a concentration of 10 M. The experiment was carried out with the following compounds at a concentration of 50 nM: C: 2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol, D: 2-oleoylamino-1,3-octadecanediol, E: 2-N-(2-hydroxyhexadecanoyl)amino-1,3-octadecanediol, in comparison with the culture medium without alkanediol and without N-acetylsphingenine (A) and with a medium containing only N-acetylsphingenine (B). The results, expressed as percentage, represent the number of cells with respect to the control (A), namely, with respect to a culture produced under the same conditions in the absence of alkanediol compounds and of N-acetylsphingenine. A 100 B 57 C 72 D 76 E 78 N-Acetylsphingenine caused a decrease in cell viability. The presence in the culture medium of a 2-amino-1,3-octadecanediol tended to counteract this effect.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a compound which is useful in silica-filled rubber compositions and the processing of a sulfur curable rubber composition containing silica. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Sulfur containing organosilicon compounds are useful as reactive coupling agents between rubber and silica fillers providing for improved physical properties. They are also useful as adhesion primers for glass, metals and other substrates. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,842,111, 3,873,489 and 3,978,103 disclose the preparation of various sulfur containing organosilicon compounds. These organosilicon compounds are prepared by reacting (a) 2 moles of a compound of the formula Z-Alk-hal where hal is a chlorine, bromine or iodine; Z is where R 1 is an alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms or phenyl and R 2 is alkoxy of 1 to 8 carbon atoms; or cycloalkoxy of 5 to 8 carbon atoms; or alkylmercapto with 1 to 8 carbon atoms; Alk is a divalent aliphatic hydrocarbon or unsaturated hydrocarbon or a cyclic hydrocarbon containing 1 to 18 carbon atoms; with (b) 1 mole of a compound of the formula Me 2 S n where Me is ammonium or a metal atom and n is a whole number from 2 to 6. U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,751 and Japanese Patent Application 124400-1984 disclose the use of an asymmetrical siloxy compound in a silica-filled rubber. Representative asymmetrical siloxy compounds contain a benzothizole moiety or thiocarbamyl moiety. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to asymmetrical siloxy compounds of the formula: DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION There is also disclosed a method for processing a silica-filled rubber composition which comprises mixing (i) 100 parts by weight of at least one sulfur vulcanizable elastomer selected from conjugated diene homopolymers and copolymers and from copolymers of at least one conjugated diene and aromatic vinyl compound; (ii) 10 to 250 phr of particulate precipitated silica; (iii) 0.05 to 15 phr of a compound of the formula wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms; R 4 is selected from the group consisting of alkylene groups having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms and arylene and alkyl substituted arylene groups having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms; and n is an integer of from 1 to 8. There is also disclosed a silica-filled rubber composition comprising an elastomer containing olefinic unsaturation, silica and a compound of the formula wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms; R 4 is selected from the group consisting of alkylene groups having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms and arylene and alkyl substituted arylene groups having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms; and n is an integer of from 1 to 8. The present invention may be used to process rubbers or elastomers containing olefinic unsaturation. The phrase rubber or elastomer containing olefinic unsaturation is intended to include both natural rubber and its various raw and reclaim forms as well as various synthetic rubbers. In the description of this invention, the terms rubber and elastomer may be used interchangeably, unless otherwise prescribed. The terms rubber composition, compounded rubber and rubber compound are used interchangeably to refer to rubber which has been blended or mixed with various ingredients and materials and such terms are well known to those having skill in the rubber mixing or rubber compounding art. Representative synthetic polymers are the homopolymerization products of butadiene and its homologues and derivatives, for example, methylbutadiene, dimethylbutadiene and pentadiene as well as copolymers such as those formed from butadiene or its homologues or derivatives with other unsaturated monomers. Among the latter are acetylenes, for example, vinyl acetylene; olefins, for example, isobutylene, which copolymerizes with isoprene to form butyl rubber; vinyl compounds, for example, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile (which polymerize with butadiene to form NBR), methacrylic acid and styrene, the latter compound polymerizing with butadiene to form SBR, as well as vinyl esters and various unsaturated aldehydes, ketones and ethers, e.g., acrolein, methyl isopropenyl ketone and vinylethyl ether. Specific examples of synthetic rubbers include neoprene (polychloroprene), polybutadiene (including cis-1,4-polybutadiene), polyisoprene (including cis-1,4-polyisoprene), butyl rubber, styrene/isoprene/butadiene rubber, copolymers of 1,3-butadiene or isoprene with monomers such as styrene, acrylonitrile and methyl methacrylate, as well as ethylene/propylene terpolymers, also known as ethylene/propylene/diene monomer (EPDM), and in particular, ethylene/propylene/ dicyclopentadiene terpolymers. The preferred rubber or elastomers are polybutadiene and SBR. In one aspect the rubber is preferably of at least two of diene based rubbers. For example, a combination of two or more rubbers is preferred such as cis 1,4-polyisoprene rubber (natural or synthetic, although natural is preferred), 3,4-polyisoprene rubber, styrene/isoprene/butadiene rubber, emulsion and solution polymerization derived styrene/butadiene rubbers, cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubbers and emulsion polymerization prepared butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers. In one aspect of this invention, an emulsion polymerization derived styrene/butadiene (E-SBR) might be used having a relatively conventional styrene content of about 20 to about 28 percent bound styrene or, for some applications, an E-SBR having a medium to relatively high bound styrene content, namely, a bound styrene content of about 30 to about 45 percent. The relatively high styrene content of about 30 to about 45 for the E-SBR can be considered beneficial for a purpose of enhancing traction, or skid resistance, of the tire tread. The presence of the E-SBR itself is considered beneficial for a purpose of enhancing processability of the uncured elastomer composition mixture, especially in comparison to a utilization of a solution polymerization prepared SBR (S-SBR). By emulsion polymerization prepared E-SBR, it is meant that styrene and 1,3-butadiene are copolymerized as an aqueous emulsion. Such are well known to those skilled in such art. The bound styrene content can vary, for example, from about 5 to about 50 percent. In one aspect, the E-SBR may also contain acrylonitrile to form a terpolymer rubber, as E-SBAR, in amounts, for example, of about 2 to about 30 weight percent bound acrylonitrile in the terpolymer. Emulsion polymerization prepared styrene/butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymer rubbers containing about 2 to about 40 weight percent bound acrylonitrile in the copolymer are also contemplated as diene based rubbers for use in this invention. The solution polymerization prepared SBR (S-SBR) typically has a bound styrene content in a range of about 5 to about 50, preferably about 9 to about 36, percent. The S-SBR can be conveniently prepared, for example, by organo lithium catalyzation in the presence of an organic hydrocarbon solvent. A purpose of using S-SBR is for improved tire rolling resistance as a result of lower hysteresis when it is used in a tire tread composition. The 3,4-polyisoprene rubber (3,4-PI) is considered beneficial for a purpose of enhancing the tires traction when it is used in a tire tread composition. The 3,4-PI and use thereof is more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,087,668 which is incorporated herein by reference. The Tg refers to the glass transition temperature which can conveniently be determined by a differential scanning calorimeter at a heating rate of 10 C. per minute. The cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber (BR) is considered to be beneficial for a purpose of enhancing the tire treads wear, or treadwear. Such BR can be prepared, for example, by organic solution polymerization of 1,3-butadiene. The BR may be conveniently characterized, for example, by having at least a 90 percent cis 1,4-content. The cis 1,4-polyisoprene and cis 1,4-polyisoprene natural rubber are well known to those having skill in the rubber art. The term phr as used herein, and according to conventional practice, refers to parts by weight of a respective material per 100 parts by weight of rubber, or elastomer. The asymmetrical siloxy compounds of the present invention are of the formula wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms; R 4 is selected from the group consisting of alkylene groups having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms and arylene and alkyl substituted arylene groups having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms; and n is an integer of from 1 to 8. Preferably, each R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, R 4 is an alkylene group having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms and n is an integer of from 1 to 4. The asymmetrical siloxy compounds may comprise a high purity product or mixture of products conforming to the above formula. The asymmetrical siloxy compounds may be classified as trialkoxysilylalkyl-phthalimide-sulfides and trialkoxysilylaryl-phthalimide-sulfides. Specific examples include the triethoxysilylpropyl-phthalimide-monosulfide, triethoxysilylpropyl-phthalimide-disulfide, triethoxysilylpropyl-phthalimide-tetrasulfide, triethoxysilylpropyl-phthalimide-hexasulfide and triethoxysilylpropyl-phthalimide-octasulfide. The compounds of Formula I where n is 1 may be prepared according to the reaction scheme listed below. The compounds of Formula I where n is more than 1; ie, 2 to 8 can be made as follows The compounds of Formula I where n is more than 1 may also be prepared as follows The above reactions are generally conducted in the presence of a suitable solvent. The primary criterion is to use a solvent which does not react with the starting materials or end product. Representative organic solvents include chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, xylene, benzene and toluene. Preferably, water is avoided to prevent reaction with the siloxy groups, halogen containing intermediates as well as any halogen reagents. The asymmetrical siloxy compounds used in the present invention may be added to the rubber by any conventional technique such as on a mill or in a Banbury. The amount of the asymmetrical siloxy compound may vary widely depending on the type of rubber and other compounds present in the vulcanizable composition. Generally, the amount of the siloxy compound is used in a range of from about 0.05 to about 15.0 phr with a range of 0.1 to about 8.0 phr being preferred. The siloxy compound is preferably added in the nonproductive stage with the silica. For ease in handling, the asymmetrical siloxy compound may be used per se or may be deposited on suitable carriers. Examples of carriers which may be used in the present invention include silica, carbon black, alumina, alumina silicates, clay, kieselguhr, cellulose, silica gel and calcium silicate. The rubber composition should contain a sufficient amount of silica, and carbon black, if used, to contribute a reasonably high modulus and high resistance to tear. The silica filler may be added in amounts ranging from 10 to 250 phr. Preferably, the silica is present in an amount ranging from 15 to 90 phr. If carbon black is also present, the amount of carbon black, if used, may vary. Generally speaking, the amount of carbon black will vary from 0 to 80 phr. Preferably, the amount of carbon black will range from 0 to 40 phr. It is to be appreciated that the silica coupler may be used in conjunction with a carbon black, namely pre-mixed with a carbon black prior to addition to the rubber composition, and such carbon black is to be included in the aforesaid amount of carbon black for the rubber composition formulation. The commonly employed siliceous pigments used in rubber compounding applications can be used as the silica in this invention, including pyrogenic and precipitated siliceous pigments (silica) and aluminosilicates, although precipitate silicas are preferred. The siliceous pigments preferably employed in this invention are precipitated silicas such as, for example, those obtained by the acidification of a soluble silicate, e.g., sodium silicate. Such silicas might be characterized, for example, by having a BET surface area, as measured using nitrogen gas, preferably in the range of about 40 to about 600, and more usually in a range of about 50 to about 300 square meters per gram. The BET method of measuring surface area is described in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Volume 60, page 304 (1930). The silica may also be typically characterized by having a dibutylphthalate (DBP) absorption value in a range of about 100 to about 400, and more usually about 150 to about 300. Further, the silica, as well as the aforesaid alumina and aluminosilicate may be expected to have a CTAB surface area in a range of about 100 to about 220. The CTAB surface area is the external surface area as evaluated by cetyl trimethylammonium bromide with a pH of 9. The method is described in ASTM D 3849 for set up and evaluation. The CTAB surface area is a well known means for characterization of silica. Mercury surface area/porosity is the specific surface area determined by Mercury porosimetry. For such technique, mercury is penetrated into the pores of the sample after a thermal treatment to remove volatiles. Set-up conditions may be suitably described as using a 100 mg sample; removing volatiles during 2 hours at 105 C. and ambient atmospheric pressure; ambient to 2000 bars pressure measuring range. Such evaluation may be performed according to the method described in Winslow, Shapiro in ASTM bulletin, p.39 (1959) or according to DIN 66133. For such an evaluation, a CARLO-ERBA Porosimeter 2000 might be used. The average mercury porosity specific surface area for the silica should be in a range of about 100 to 300 m 2 /g. A suitable pore-size distribution for the silica, alumina and aluminosilicate according to such mercury porosity evaluation is; considered herein to be five percent or less of its pores have a diameter of less than about 10 nm; 60 to 90 percent of its pores have a diameter of about 10 to about 100 nm; 10 to 30 percent of its pores have a diameter of about 100 to about 1000 nm; and 5 to 20 percent of its pores have a diameter of greater than about 1000 nm. The silica might be expected to have an average ultimate particle size, for example, in the range of 0.01 to 0.05 micron as determined by the electron microscope, although the silica particles may be even smaller, or possibly larger, in size. Various commercially available silicas may be considered for use in this invention such as, only for example herein, and without limitation, silicas commercially available from PPG Industries under the Hi-Sil trademark with designations 210, 243, etc; silicas available from Rhone-Poulenc, with, for example, designations of Z1165MP and Z165GR; and silicas available from Degussa AG with, for example, designations VN2, VN3, BV3380GR, etc; and silicas available from Huber, for example Huber Sil 8745.

The amount of the above sulfur containing organosilicon compound of Formula II in a rubber composition will vary depending on the level of silica that is used. Generally speaking, the amount of the compound of Formula II will range from 0.00 to 1.0 parts by weight per part by weight of the silica. Preferably, the amount will range from 0.00 to 0.4 parts by weight per part by weight of the silica. It is readily understood by those having skill in the art that the rubber composition would be compounded by methods generally known in the rubber compounding art, such as mixing the various sulfur-vulcanizable constituent rubbers with various commonly used additive materials such as, for example, sulfur donors, curing aids, such as activators and retarders and processing additives, such as oils, resins including tackifying resins and plasticizers, fillers, pigments, fatty acid, zinc oxide, waxes, antioxidants and antiozonants and peptizing agents. As known to those skilled in the art, depending on the intended use of the sulfur vulcanizable and sulfur vulcanized material (rubbers), the additives mentioned above are selected and commonly used in conventional amounts. Typical amounts of reinforcing type carbon blacks(s), for this invention, if used, are herein set forth. Representative examples of sulfur donors include elemental sulfur (free sulfur), an amine disulfide, polymeric polysulfide and sulfur olefin adducts. Preferably, the sulfur vulcanizing agent is elemental sulfur. The sulfur vulcanizing agent may be used in an amount ranging from 0.5 to 8 phr, with a range of from 1 to 6 phr being preferred. Typical amounts of tackifier resins, if used, comprise about 0.5 to about 10 phr, usually about 1 to about 5 phr. Typical amounts of processing aids comprise about 1 to about 50 phr. Such processing aids can include, for example, aromatic, napthenic, and/or paraffinic processing oils. Typical amounts of antioxidants comprise about 1 to about 5 phr. Representative antioxidants may be, for example, diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine and others, such as, for example, those disclosed in the Vanderbilt Rubber Handbook (1978), pages 344-346. Typical amounts of antiozonants comprise about 1 to 5 phr. Typical amounts of fatty acids, if used, which can include stearic acid, comprise about 0.5 to about 5 phr. Typical amounts of zinc oxide comprise about 2 to about 5 phr. Typical amounts of waxes comprise about 1 to about 5 phr. Often microcrystalline waxes are used. Typical amounts of peptizers comprise about 0.1 to about 1 phr. Typical peptizers may be, for example, pentachlorothiophenol and dibenzamidodiphenyl disulfide. In one aspect of the present invention, the sulfur vulcanizable rubber composition is then sulfur-cured or vulcanized. Accelerators are used to control the time and/or temperature required for vulcanization and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. In one embodiment, a single accelerator system may be used, i.e., primary accelerator. The primary accelerator(s) may be used in total amounts ranging from about 0.5 to about 4, preferably about 0.8 to about 1.5, phr. In another embodiment, combinations of a primary and a secondary accelerator might be used with the secondary accelerator being used in amounts, such as from about 0.05 to about 3 phr, in order to activate and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. Combinations of these accelerators might be expected to produce a synergistic effect on the final properties and are somewhat better than those produced by use of either accelerator alone. In addition, delayed action accelerators may be used which are not affected by normal processing temperatures but produce a satisfactory cure at ordinary vulcanization temperatures. Vulcanization retarders might also be used. Suitable types of accelerators that may be used in the present invention are amines, disulfides, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams, sulfenamides, dithiocarbamates and xanthates. Preferably, the primary accelerator is a sulfenamide. If a second accelerator is used, the secondary accelerator is preferably a guanidine, dithiocarbamate or thiuram compound. The mixing of the rubber composition can be accomplished by methods known to those having skill in the rubber mixing art. For example, the ingredients are typically mixed in at least two stages, namely at least one non-productive stage followed by a productive mix stage. The final curatives including sulfur vulcanizing agents are typically mixed in the final stage which is conventionally called the productive mix stage in which the mixing typically occurs at a temperature, or ultimate temperature, lower than the mix temperature(s) than the preceding non-productive mix stage(s). The rubber, silica, compound of Formula I and carbon black, if used, are mixed in one or more non-productive mix stages. The terms non-productive and productive mix stages are well known to those having skill in the rubber mixing art. The sulfur vulcanizable rubber composition containing the compound of Formula I, vulcanizable rubber and generally at least part of the silica should, as well as the sulfur-containing organosilicon compound of Formula II, if used, be subjected to a thermomechanical mixing step. The thermomechanical mixing step generally comprises a mechanical working in a mixer or extruder for a period of time suitable in order to produce a rubber temperature between 140 C. and 190 C. The appropriate duration of the thermomechanical working varies as a function of the operating conditions and the volume and nature of the components. For example, the thermomechanical working may be from 1 to 20 minutes. In such manner, then the asymmetrical siloxy compound could be utilized for reaction with the silica and sulfur vulcanizable elastomer and the independent addition of the sulfur donor, particularly a free sulfur source, could be primarily relied upon for the vulcanization of the elastomer. In accordance with another embodiment, the asymmetrical siloxy compound is optionally added to the thermomechanical preparatory mixing in a form of a particulate comprised of (a) about 25 to about 75, preferably about 40 to about 60, weight percent of said asymmetrical siloxy compound and, correspondingly, (b) about 75 to about 25, preferably about 60 to about 40, weight percent particulate carbon black. One advantage of this embodiment is providing the asymmetrical siloxy compound in a form of a particulate so as to add the asymmetrical siloxy compound in a form of a relatively dry, or substantially dry, powder in which the carbon black acts as a carrier for the asymmetrical siloxy compound since it is considered herein that the asymmetrical siloxy compound may be liquid, or substantially liquid. A contemplated benefit for the particulate is to aid in the dispersing of the asymmetrical siloxy compound in the preparatory mixing step(s) of the process of this invention and to aid in the introduction of the asymmetrical siloxy compound into the preparatory mixing of the rubber composition mixture. Accordingly, the invention also thereby contemplates a vulcanized rubber composition prepared by such process. Accordingly, the invention also thereby contemplates a vulcanized tire prepared by such process. Vulcanization of the rubber composition of the present invention is generally carried out at conventional temperatures ranging from about 100 C. to 200 C. Preferably, the vulcanization is conducted at temperatures ranging from about 110 C. to 180 C. Any of the usual vulcanization processes may be used such as heating in a press or mold, heating with superheated steam or hot air or in a salt bath. Upon vulcanization of the sulfur vulcanized composition, the rubber composition of this invention can be used for various purposes. For example, the sulfur vulcanized rubber composition may be in the form of a tire, belt or hose. In case of a tire, it can be used for various tire components. Such tires can be built, shaped, molded and cured by various methods which are known and will be readily apparent to those having skill in such art. Preferably, the rubber composition is used in the tread of a tire. As can be appreciated, the tire may be a passenger tire, aircraft tire, truck tire and the like. Preferably, the tire is a passenger tire. The tire may also be a radial or bias, with a radial tire being preferred. While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating the invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.

Also included are symmetric and non-symmetric poly(dimethylsiloxy) compounds having end groups derived from Formulas (1) and (2). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention concerns Liquid Crystal materials including polymeric and non-polymeric materials, oligomers, intermediates and methods for their preparation. It has applicability in the areas of display technology, thin film magnetic materials for use in (for example) data storage, lubricants and anisotropically supported catalysts. In liquid crystal polymers, the monomers can be attached together in essentially two ways. The liquid crystal part, or mesogenic unit, of the polymer may be part of the polymer backbone resulting in a main chain LC polymer. Alternatively, the mesogenic unit may be attached to the polymer backbone as a pendant group i.e. extending away from the polymer backbone. This results in a side chain LC polymer. The side chain liquid crystal polymer can generally be thought of as containing a flexible polymer with rigid segments (the mesogenic unit) attached along its length by short units which may be flexible or rigid. It is the anisotropic, rigid section of the mesogenic units that display orientational order in the liquid crystal phases. In order to affect the phases exhibited by the liquid crystal and the subsequent optical properties there are many features which can be altered: some of these features are particularly pertinent to the side chain liquid crystal polymers e.g. the flexible part (known as the spacer group) that joins the mesogenic unit to the polymer backbone.

Experimental Procedures 1. Materials and Instrumentation Solvents were dried over appropriate drying agents and distilled prior use. Metal acetate salts were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 783 spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded on a Jeol JNM-GX spectrometer ( 1 H, 270 MHz; 13 C, 67.80 MHz; 29 Si, 53.54 MHz); chemical shifts are reported in parts per million () with reference to internal SiMe 4 or residual protonated species of the deuterated solvent used for 1 H and 13 C analysis. 29 Si NMR was externally referenced to SiMe 4 ; Cr(acac) 3 was added to aid the fast relaxation of the sample. Elemental analysis was performed on a Fisons Instruments Carlo Erba EA 1108 CHN analyser using acetanilide as the reference standard. V 2 O 5 was added to aid combustion in a number of cases. Mass spectra were recorded on a Finnigan 1020 GC-MS spectrometer (electron ionisation mode/70 eV) and on a Kratos MS80 spectrometer (fast atom bombandment mode/NOBA matrix). Molecular weight determinations were carried out on a Knauer vapour osmometer. Differential scanning calorimetry was performed on a Perkin-Elmer DSC2 calorimeter. Phase transitionn temperatures are given as the endothermic onset of the second heating cycle (scan rate 10 C. min 1 ). The results were standardised with respect to indium (measured onset 156.60 C., H28.47 J g 1 ; literature value 156.60 C., H28.45 J g 1 ). Optical analysis was carried out on a Nikon POH polarising microscope equipped with a Metler FP82 microfurnace in conjunction with a FP80 Central Processor. 2. Synthetic Procedures (2-Phenyl)-3-hydroxyprop-2-enal, (1) This was prepared according to literature procedures (A. Liepa; Aust. J. Chem., 1981, 34, 2647). 4-Alkoxy and 4-(-alkenyloxy)phenols, (2) These were prepared by standard alkylation of hydroquinone (Aldrich) with commercial n-alkyl bromides (Aldrich) or -alkenyl bromides (Lancaster) For example: 4-(Dec-9-enyloxy)phenol, (2). Hydroquinone (37.65 g, 342 mmol) and dec-9-enyl bromide (25 g, 114 mmol) were dissolved in ethanol (150 ml) with warming under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solution was heated under reflux and a solution of potassium hydroxide (6.83 g, 121 mmol) in water (20 ml) was added dropwise over 1 h. The resulting suspension was heated under reflux (3 H) then poured on to water (500 ml) and extracted with ether (3100 ml). The combined extracts were dried (MgSO 4 ), evaporated in vacuo and the residue extracted with heptane (300 ml). On cooling, it afforded a first crop of the phenol (10.31 g). The remaining material was chromatographed (flash grade silica gel, petroleum ether 40-60 C./diethyl ether 3/2). 2 was isolated as white plates (R f 0.57). Combined yield15.61 g (55%).

Casiraghi, G. Casnati, G. Puglia, G. Sartori, G. Terenghi; J. Chem. Soc . Perkin l, 1980, 1862.). For example: 2-Hydroxy-5-(dec-9enyloxy)benzaldehyde, (3a) SnCl 4 (0.27 ml, 2.33 mmol) was added to a solution of 4-(dec-9-enyloxy)phenol (5.80 g, 23.33 mmol) in sodium dried, degassed toluene (250 ml) under a nitrogen atmosphere. Tri-n-butylamine (2.22 ml, 9.34 mmol) was added at room temperature. The solution truned yellow and was stirred for 1 h before paraformaldehyde (BDH) (1.54 g, 51 mmol) was added and the yellow suspension heated to 105 C. (3 h). The brown solution was cooled, poured onto saturated aqueous NaCl (200 ml) and acidified to pH 2 with 10% HCl. The product was extracted with esther (3100 ml) and the combined organic layers dried (MgSO 4 ) and evaporated. The residue was purified by column chromatography (flash grade silica gel; petroleum ether 40-60 C./diethyl ether. 3/2). The title compound 3 was isolated as a yellow oil (R f 0.62).

For example: 2-Hydroxy-5-(dec-9-enylcarbonyloxy)benzaldehyde, (4) Triethylamine (2.22 g, 14.48 mmol) was added to a solution of 2,5-deihydroxybenzaldehyde (Fluka) (2.0 g, 14.48 mmol) in sodium dried toluene (300 ml), followed by dropwise addition of 10-undecenoyl chloride (Aldrich) (4.40 g, 14.48 mmol) in toluene (30 ml) of over a period of 2 h. The suspension was stirred (18 h). filtered and the solution evaporated to dryness. 4 was obtained as thin white needles from methanol after column chromatograghy (flash grade silica gel; petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, 4/1).

The ligands were prepared by condensation of an appropriate 2-phenyl-3-hydroxypropenal, 1,2-diaminoethane and a 2-hydroxy-5-substituted benzaldehyde in equimolar amounts in CH 2 Cl 2 solution, with continuous removal of water. This procedure afforded both the symmetrical salen ligand and the unsymmetrical ligand. For example: 8-(3-Dec-9-enyloxy-6-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenyl-4,7-diazocta-2,7-dien-1-al (6) 1,2-Diaminoethane (0.2 g, 3.36 mmol) was added to a vigorously stirred solution of 2-phenyl-3-hydroxypropenal (0.498 g, 3.36 mmol) in CH 2 Cl 2 (300 ml). A white precipitate formed immediately. 2-Hydroxy-5-(dec-9-enyloxy)benzaldehyde (0.93 g, 3.36 mmol) was added and the yellow suspension was stirred at room temperature (18 h) and then heated under reflux (5 h) using a Dean-Stark apparatus protected from moisture with a calcium chloride guard tube. The yellow solution was evaporated in vacuo and the residue purified by column chromatography (flash grade silica gel; CH 2 Cl 2 /THF, 4/1). The band with R f 0.76 yielded 1,6-di(3-dec-9-enyloxy-6-hydroxyphenyl)-2,5-diazahexa-1,5-diene (5) after recrystallisation from ethanol (yield0.19 g, 40%). The band with R f 0.50 was collected and the product recrystallised from ethanol to yield bright yellow crystals of 6. Yield0.46 g (61%).

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel and water-soluble anthracycline derivatives which exhibit an excellent anticancer or antitumor activity at a low dosage thereof and which have 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl group as the sugar moiety. This invention also relates to processes for the preparation of said novel anthracycline derivatives and further to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same as an active ingredient. More particularly, this invention relates to 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl)daunomycinone and 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl)-adriamycinone or their acid addition salts as the novel and water-soluble anthracycline derivatives having an anticancer or antitumor activity and a low toxicity. This invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing the novel anthracycline derivative or an acid addition salt thereof. Further, this invention relates to processes for the preparation of these novel anthracycline derivatives. Yet further, this invention relates to a novel compound useful as an intermediate for the synthesis of these novel anthracycline derivatives. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION As antibiotics of the anthracycline type are known daunomycin which is also named daunorubicin in the specification of U.S. Pat. No. 3,616,242, as well as adriamycin which is also named doxorubicin in the specification of U.S. Pat. No. 3,590,028. These compounds have broad anticancer spectra against experimental tumors and have widely been utilized for clinical purposes as a chemotherapeutic anticancer agent. While, daunomycin and adriamycin can exhibit a somewhat strong anticancer or antitumor activity against various kinds of cancers or tumors, but are not necessarily satisfactory as the anticancer agent or antitumor agent. That is, daunomycin and adriamycin have been utilized widely as a chemotherapeutic anticancer agent for clinical treatment of cancer-bearing patients, but they are also known to bring about serious side-effects such as leukocytopenia, alopecia, myocardiopathy and others, in many instances. Therefore, it has hitherto been attempted to produce newly a variety of novel daunomycin-related compounds with the intention of providing such novel daunomycin-related compounds which would have a much enhanced anticancer or antitumor activity but with exhibiting a low toxicity. As some outcome of the attempts hitherto made, there have been proposed several compounds, for example, those known as aclacinomycins A and B; 4-O-tetrahydropyranyl-adriamycin; N-monobenzyl- or N-dibenzyl-adriamycin. Besides, U.S. Pat. No. 4,427,664 specification discloses 7-O-(3,4-di-O-acetyl-2,6-dideoxy-2-iodo--L-manno-hexopyranosyl)daunomycinone and 7-O- (3,4-di-O-acetyl-2,6-dideoxy-2-iodo--L-talo-hexopyranosyl)daunomycinone. We, the present inventors, proceeded with our investigations in an attempt to provide novel derivatives of daunomycin and adriamycin which will exhibit a higher anticancer or antitumor activity than those of daunomycin or adriamycin but with a low toxicity. As a part of our investigations, we have already synthesized some derivatives of daunomycin and adriamycin in which the sugar moiety of daunomycin and adriamycin has been chemically modified. For example, the present inventors already reported 4-O-tetrahydropyranyl-daunomycin or -adriamycin as well as 3-deamino-3-morpholino-daunomycin or -adriamycin. Further, the present inventors succeeded in synthesizing such anthracycline derivatives having antitumor activities which are represented by the following general formula (A) wherein R a stands for a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group, that is, 7-O-(2,6-dideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl)-daunomycinone and 7-O-(2,6-dideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl)-adriamycinone, which possess an anticancer or antitumor activity (see Japanese Patent Publication Kokoku Hei 6-31298 and European Patent No. 0230013). The present inventors also succeeded in synthesizing such anthracycline derivatives having antitumor activities which are represented by the following general formula (B) wherein R stands for a group (CH 2 ) m H where m is an integer of 16,or R stands for a group (CH 2 ) n COOH where n is an integer of 110 (see Japanese Patent Publication Kokoku Hei 7-42304 and European Patent No. 0275431). The present inventors further succeeded in synthesizing such anthracycline derivatives having antitumor activities which are represented by the following general formula (C) wherein R 1 is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group, R 2 is a methoxy group or a hydrogen atom, and A and B each stand for a hydrogen atom or A and B as taken together form a chain of formula CH 2 CH 2 OCH 2 CH 2 (see Japanese Patent Application First Publication Kokai Sho-64-203397). As examples of the anthracycline derivatives of the general formula (C), there may be mentioned 7-O-(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl)daunomycinone; 7-O-(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl)adriamycinone; 7-O-(2,3,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro-3-morpholino--L-talopyranosyl)adriamycinone and others. 7-O-(2,6-Dideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl)adriamycinone, as one of the anthracycline derivatives of the general formula (A) given above, exhibits a remarkable antitumor activity, but is barely soluble in water, so that it had a difficulty in formulating into injection preparations. Then, the anthracycline derivatives of general formulae (B) and (C) above have been synthesized in an attempt to give such anthracycline derivatives which have an improved solubility in water. Amongst the derivatives of the general formula (C), 7-O-(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl)adriamycinone is soluble in water, but the antitumor activity thereof has not been recognized to be remarkably higher than that of adriamycine, even though the former has the antitumor activity a little higher than that of the latter. The present inventors further have continued our investigations in various ways with the intention of producing such novel anthracycline derivatives which can exhibit higher anticancer or antitumor activities than those of daunomycin, adriamycin and the antitumor anthracycline derivatives of the general formulae (A), (B) and (C) above, even at a low dosage, and which are of satisfactory solubility in water and of low toxicity. The anticancer or antitumor activities of the anthracycline derivatives of the general formulae (A) and (B) above are, in fact, noticeably superior to those of daunomycin and adriamycin, but are not yet satisfactorily high enough. All of the anthracycline derivatives of the general formula (C) above are soluble in water, but most of those derivatives exhibit only an anticancer or antitumor activity substantially as high as or lower than that of adriamycin. Therefore, there still exists a desire for providing such novel anthracycline derivatives which can exhibit higher anticancer or antitumor activities than those of the known anthracycline derivatives. Further, in general, it is always convenient for clinical applications to administer the anticancer or antitumor compounds in the form of injectable preparations. Thus, for the purpose of therapeutic treatments of a variety of cancers and tumors, a demand always exists in the art to provide and explore such novel anticancer or antitumor agents having a nature that they can exhibit a strong anticancer or antitumor activity but with low toxicity and also they are highly soluble in water. In order to solve the problems above-mentioned, the present inventors have proceeded with our further investigations in an attempt to synthesize novel anthracycline derivatives having a new fluorinated amino-sugar moiety. As a result of these further investigations, we have now succeeded in synthesizing 1-O-acetyl derivative of 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-mannopyranose and 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-mannopyranosyl bromide or their 3,4-di-O,N-protected derivatives as new compounds through a multi-step method with starting from methyl 4-O-benzyl-2,6-dideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranoside which has been obtained in the synthesis of the anthracycline derivative of the general formula (A) shown hereinbefore (see the specification of Japanese patent application No. Hei-7-179621 filed Jun. 23, 1995 which is corresponding to PCT application No. PCT/JP96/01697 filed Jun. 19, 1996, now published under International publication No. WO 97/00880). Then, by utilizing these 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-mannopyranose derivatives as synthesized for the first time and by taking such a method which comprises condensing the 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-mannopyranosyl group with the 7-hydroxyl group of daunomycinone or adriamycinone, we have earlier succeeded in synthesizing such novel daunomycinone derivative and adriamycinone derivative which are represented by the following general formula (D) wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group or an acid addition salt thereof, as such anthracycline derivatives which bear as the sugar moiety a 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-mannopyranosyl group where the amino group at the 4-position of this sugar moiety is of the equatorial direction. Furthermore, we have found that the novel anthracycline derivatives of the general formula (D) above are soluble in water, that they exhibit a high anticancer or antitumor activity even when they are administered to test animals at low dosages, and that development of acute toxicity does not take place in the test animals having received the administration of the anthracycline derivative of the formula (D) at the low dosages which can give high anticancer or antitumor effects in the test animals so treated (see the aforesaid Japanese patent application No. Hei-7-179621). The daunomycinone or adriamycinone derivative of the general formula (D) contains the equatorically directed amino group at the 4-position of the sugar moiety thereof, and particular examples thereof include Compound (a) and Compound (b) of the following formulae (D-a) and (D-b), respectively. (1) Compound (a): 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-mannopyranosyl)daunomycinone of the following formula (2) Compound (b): 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-mannopyranosyl)adriamycinone of the following formula It has been confirmed through in vivo tests that, among the anthracycline derivatives of the general formula (D) above, 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-mannopyranosyl)adriamycinone of the formula (D-b) exhibits a remarkably high antitumor activity against experimental tumors in animals and has a remarkably improved antitumor activity against mouse Leukemia L-1210 cell over adriamycin even when the compound of the formula (D-b) is administered at low dosages. While, it has also been found that althoguh the compound of the formula (D-b) is soluble in water and exhibits the above-mentioned excellent antitumor activity against mouse Leukemia L-1210 cell, this compound as tested in in vitro tests remains to exhibit against various human cancer cells such anticancer activities which are substantially as high as those of adriamycin. Accordingly, one of the objects of this invention is to provide and explore new anticancer anthracycline derivatives having such properties that they can exhibit an excellent anticancer or antitumor activity and especially exhibit a stronger anticancer activity against various human cancer cells than adriamycin but they have a low toxicity and a high solubility in water. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In order to achieve the above objects of this invention, the present inventors have continued further investigations in an attempt to synthesize and provide such novel anthracycline derivatives which are able to have the above-mentioned excellent properties and contains a fluorinated amino-sugar moiety. As a result of our further investigations above, the present inventors have now succeeded in synthesizing as new compounds, protected derivatives of 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro-L-talopyranose having the axially directed 4-amino group, as well as 3,4-di-O,N-protected derivatives of 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranocyl bromide through a multi-staged process with starting from 3,4-di-O-acetyl-2,6-dideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl bromide which is a known compound described in the Carbohydrate Research Vol. 169, pages 69-81 (1987). The present inventors also have now succeeded in synthetizing as a novel anthracycline derivative 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl)daunomycinone having the axially directed amino group at the 4-position of the sugar moiety thereof, by means of a process which comprises utilizing the above-mentioned derivatives of 4-amino-2,4,6-tridoexy-2-fluoro-L-talopyranose synthetized now newly as above, and condensing a 4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl group with the 7-hydroxyl group of daunomycinone. The present inventors have now succeeded also in synthetizing as a novel anthracycline derivative 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl)adriamycinone from the new daunomycinone derivative mentioned just above. Furthermore, the present inventors have now found that the two particular, novel anthracycline derivatives now synthetized and specified just above have a high solubility in water to such extent that these novel two anthracycline derivatives can dissolve in amounts of 10 mg and 15 mg, respectively, per 1 ml of water, that these novel two anthracycline derivatives may be formulated into an aqueous injection preparation, and that these novel two anthracycline derivatives as administered even at low dosages are not only able to exhibit an antitumor activity against mouse Leukemia L-1210 cell to a degree substantially equal to or higher than that of adriamycin but also are able to exhibit remarkably improved anticancer activities against various human cancer cells in in vitro tests, in comparison with adriamycin. On the basis of these findings obtained by the present inventors, this invention has now been accomplished. In a first aspect of this invention, therefore, there is provided a daunomycinone or adriamycinone derivative represented by the following general formula wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group, or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. As examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the daunomycinone or adriamycinone derivative of the general formula (I), there are mentioned such acid addition salts which may be formed by reacting the 4-amino group of said derivative with a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid, or a pharmaceutically acceptable organic acid such as acetic acid, propionic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, methanesulfonic acid in a usual manner. Examples of the daunomycinone or adriamycinone derivatives of the general formula (I) include the under-mentioned Compound (a) and Compound (b) of this invention: (1) Compound (a): 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl)daunomycinone (see Example 1 hereinafter given) represented by the following formula (2) Compound (b): 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl)adriamycinone (see Example 2 hereinafter given) represented by the following formula Now, some Test Examples are given to illustrate the antitumor activities of Compound (a) of formula (Ia) and Compound (b) of formula (Ib) shown above, which are embraced by the anthracycline derivatives of the general. formula (I) according to the first aspect of this invention. TEST EXAMPLE 1 In this Example, some tests were made to demonstrate antitumor activities of the compounds of this invention shown against leukemia in CDF 1 mice as induced by a mouse leukemia, Leukemia L-1210 cells. Thus, to evaluate the antitumor effects of the novel compounds of this invention against experimental tumors in animals, CDF 1 mice (four mice per group) were intraperitoneally inoculated with cells of Leukemia L-1210 at an amount of 110 5 cells/mouse. Since an elapse of 24 hours from the inoculation of the leukemia cells, a test compound of this invention was administered intraperitoneally to the mice under test once a day for consecutive 9 days, with the test compound being given as its hydrochloride in the form of a solution in a physiological saline. The mice so treated were observed for 60 days after the administration of the test compound. In the meanwhile, mice of the control group (the untreated group) were administered only with physiological saline after the inoculation of the L-1210 cells. During the observation period, the number of the surviving mice was counted for both the treated group and the control group, and the mean survival days of mice of both the treated group and the control group were calculated. Then, the percentages (%) of the increase in the life-span of the treated mice was estimated, as T/C (%), in terms of the mean survival day (C) of the untreated mice of the control group and the mean survival day (T) of the treated mice of the treated group. For comparison purposes, similar tests were effected using daunomycin (as hydrochloride) and adriamycin (as hydrochloride). The test results are shown in Table 1 below. The mean survival day of mice of the control group (the untreated group) was 8 to 9 days, and the mean survival day of mice of the comparative groups having received the administration of daunomycin or adriamycin usually varied dependently on the dosage of the compound tested. In Table 1 below, the symbol indicates that, among the four mice under test which were inoculated with the tumor cells and then administered with the compound under test, there existed at least one mouse which could be cured and survived for 60 days or longer by the administration of the test compound in spite of their received inoculation of tumor cell. Incidentally, in respect of the fractional numbers parenthesized below the numerical values of increase (%) in the life-span, the denominator of the fraction denotes the number of mice tested in one test group but the numerator of the fraction denotes the number of mice which survived for 60 days or longer. TABLE 1 Increase (%) in life-span (T/C, %) Dosage (mg/kg/day) Compound tested 5 2.5 1.25 0.6 0.3 0.15 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- 175* 235* 463 182 152 127 -L-talopyranosyl)daunomycinone (2/4) Compound (a) of this invention (as hydrochloride) 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro- 92* 139* 330* 403 400 155 -L-talopyranosyl)adriamycinone (1/4) (1/4) (1/4) Compound (b) of this invention (as hydrochloride) Daunomycinone (as hydrochloride) 138* 171* 158 145 112 132 (Comparative) Adriamycin (as hydrochloride) 177* 273* 330 208 132 140 (Comparative) Notes: Asterisks (*) indicate that development of toxicity such as toxicity-related death or a body weight loss was observed on the corresponding mice tested. In the in vivo tests as described above, the daunomycinone derivative of general formula (I) according to the first aspect of this invention, namely Compound (a) of this invention as given at a dosage in a range of 0.61.25 mg/kg was able to exhibit antitumor activities higher than those of daunomycin. On the other hand, it is found that Compound (b) of this invention, namely the adriamycin derivative as given at a low dosage in a range of 0.3 mg/kg0.6 mg/kg was able to exhibit such remarkably high antitumor activities that the percentage of the increase in the life-span (T/C), %) was as high as a value of greater than 400% to a value of greater than 403% and that the number of the mice surviving for 60 days (the mice as fully cured from the leukemia) amounted to two in eight. This indicates that Compound (b) given at a dosage of 0.30.6 mg/kg was able to exhibit markedly enhanced anticancer or antitumor activities, as compared with those of adriamycin as given at a dosage of 0.3 mg/kg0.6 mg/kg. It is also found that Compound (b) of this invention as given at the low dosage of 0.3 mg/kg to 0.6 mg/kg did not involve the development of toxicity. Furthermore, it is found that Compound (b) of this invention as given at a low dosage of 0.15 mg/kg to 0.6 mg/kg was able to exhibit remarkably enhanced anticancer or antitumor activities in terms of percentages of the increase in the life-span of the treated mice (T/C, %), in comparison with daunomycin. Daunomycin or adriamycin used as the comparative drug in the above Test Example 1 is an anticancer agent which has been used clinically and practically administered to human beings at a dosage in the range of 0.4 mg/kg2 mg/kg in dependent upon the nature of cancers to be treated. When daunomycin or adriamycin is administered at a dosage ranging from 2.5 mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg/day to such mice as inoculated with the L-1210 cancer cells, daunomycin or adriamycin exhibits an anticancer or antitumor activities which amount to percentages of increase in the life-span (T/C, %) of 138%273% or of about 330% at maximum, respectively, with being accompanied by the development of toxicity. It is to be noticed that, in contrast to daunomycin or adriamycin, the adriamycinone derivative of the formula (Ib), namely Compound (b) of this invention, when administered at a proper low dosage in the range of 0.30.6 mg/kg/day to the mice as inoculated with the L-1210 cancer cells, is able to exhibit such extremely excellent antitumor effects that the development of toxicities is not involved, while the attainable values of percentages of increase in the life-span (T/C, %) are markedly higher than those attainable by daunomycin or adriamycin, and that particularly, the percentages of increase in the life-span can amount to about 400% or higher with involving a complete cure. Accordingly, Compounds (a) and (b) of this invention, particularly Compound (b), have such advantage that significant antitumor effects can be expected to be attained by them even when they are administered at a not too high dosage to the cancer-bearing patients for clinical treatments. TEST EXAMPLE 2 Compound (a) of this invention or Compound (b) of this invention was added as the test compound at varying concentrations to different kinds of human cancer cells, mouse leukemia P388 cells or adriamycin-resistant P388 cells (P388/ADR) which had been incubated in test tubes containing an appropriate culture medium. The incubation of these cells was then continued for 72 hours from the addition of the test compound, and determination was made to evaluate such concentrations of the test compound which could inhibit the growth of the human cancer cells or mouse leukemia cells by 50% (namely, 50% inhibiting concentration; IC 50 , g/ml). Adriamycin was used as a comparative compound and was tested in the same manner as above. The different kinds of human cancer cells tested were six kinds indicated below, including human chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562), human vaginal melanoma (HMV-1), human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (KB), human gastric adenocarcinoma (MKN-1), human lung non-small cell carcinoma (PC-14) and human bladder carcinoma (T24). The test results obtained are summarized in Table 2 below. TABLE 2 IC 50 (g/ml) Test Compound K562 HMV-1 KB MKN-1 PC-14 T24 P388 P388/ADR 7-O-(4-Amino-2,4,6-trideoxy- 0.087 0.071 0.028 0.12 0.17 0.047 0.0098 0.086 2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl)- daunomycinone Compound (a) of this invention (as hydrochloride) 7-O-(4-Amino-2,4,6-trideoxy- 0.063 0.056 0.023 0.062 0.12 0.026 0.0098 0.18 2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl)- adriamycinone Compound (b) of this invention (as hydrochloride) Adriamycin (comparative) 0.39 0.14 0.050 0.25 0.62 0.16 0.032 2.5 As will be clear from the test results of Table 2 above, it is evident that Compound (a) of this invention and Compound (b) of this invention can inhibit the growth of the different kinds of human cancer cells as well as mouse leukemia cancer P388 cells and P388/ADR cells and hence exhibit higher antitumor or anticancer activities than those of adriamycin. In particular, it should be worthy to note that Compound (b) of this invention exhibited against the human cancer cell MKN-1 an anticaner activity of 4-folds higher than that of adriamycin, against the human cancer cell PC-14 an anticancer activity of 5.2-folds higher than that of adriamycin, and against the human cancer cells K562 and T24 an anticancer activity of 6.2-folds higher than that of adriamycin. Further, it is seen that Compound (a) of this invention and Compound (b) of this invention exhibit against mouse leukemia P388/ADR cell anticancer activities of 29.1-folds and 13.9-folds higher than those of adriamycin, respectively. As be clear from the foregoing, the novel anthracycline derivatives of the general formula (I) according to the first aspect of this invention exhibit the excellent antitumor activities and anticancer activities but are of low toxicity and are highly soluble in water. Judging from the foregoing, it is expected that the novel anthracycline derivatives of the general formula (I) according to the first aspect of this invention, owing to their excellent antitumor activities and their high water-solubility, are very much useful as the antitumor agents to be used for clinical treatments, and that they are utilizable for therapeutic treatments of a variety of tumors, similarly to daunomycin or adriamycin. Accordingly, the compounds of the general formula (I) according to this invention can be used usefully as a therapeutic agent for tumors or cancers in the therapeutic treatments of solid cancers, ascitic cancers and the like. According to a second aspect of this invention, therefore, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition, particularly an antitumor composition, characterized in that it comprises as an active ingredient a daunomycinone or adriamycinone derivative of the general formula (I) defined hereinbefore or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. When the compound of the general formula (I) according to this invention is administered in practice, it may usually be administered orally or parenterally. It is thus feasible to administer the compound of this invention orally or parenterally after the compound is mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable solid or liquid carrier which is used conventionally in the pharmaceutic field, followed by formulating the resulting mixture into various preparation forms such as powder, granules, tablets or syrups, or injections. As a general method for the administration, the compound of this invention may be administered to animals in the form of an injectable preparation by intraperitoneal injection, subcutaneous injection, intravascular injection, either intravenous or intra-arterial, or local injection, and the like. For the administration to human beings, the compound of this invention may be administered in the form of an injectable preparation by intravascular injection, either intravenous or intra-arterial, or local injection, and the like. The compound of this invention may be administered consecutively or intermittently at such dosage and to such extent that the total dosage of the compound given would not exceed a certain level as determined in view of results of preliminary animal tests and various circumstances. Of course, the administration of the compound of this invention should be carried out with changing the dosage of the compound appropriately in accordance with the way of administration and the conditions of the patients or animals to be treated, for example, age, body weight, sex, sensitivity, foods, administration time, administration route, drug(s) to be concurrently administered, and the seriousness of patients or their disease and others. The compound of this invention may be administered at a substantially same dose as or at a lower dose than that of daunomycin or adriamycin when the compound is given as an antitumor or anticancer agent. Optimum dosage and frequency of administration of the compound of this invention under certain specific conditions must be determined by medical experts through preliminary tests in view of the above-mentioned guidelines. These requirements for administration are similarly applied to the oral administration of the compound of this invention. Now, processes for the preparation of the daunomycinone derivative or adriamycinone derivative of the general formula (I) according to the first aspect of this invention will be described below. For the preparation of 7-O-(4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl)-daunomycinone or -adriamycinone represented by the general formula (I), it is necessary to use 1-O-acetyl derivative of a 3-O-protected-4-N-protected-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranose or a 3-O-protected-4-N-protected-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl bromide or iodide which are each a new sugar compound. The respective steps (1)(10) which are effected in the synthesis of these new sugar compounds are firstly explained below in brief. Referential Example 1 given hereinafter will describe in details the reactions which are involved in these respective steps of said synthetic process. In the following descriptions, abbreviation Bn means benzyl group, and abbreviation Ac means acetyl group. Step (1): A known compound, 3,4-di-O-acetyl-2,6-dideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranosyl bromide Compound (1) having the following formula is reacted with benzyl alcohol in anhydrous benzene by Knig-Knorr synthesis method in the presence of silver carbonate, iodine and a powdery Molecular Sieves to benzyloxylate the 1-bromo group of Compound (1). Thereby, there is afforded as a main product benzyl 3,4-di-O-acetyl-2,6-dideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranoside Compound (2) having the formula and there is also obtained as a subsidiary product benzyl 3,4-di-O-acetyl-2,6-dideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranoside Compound (3) having the formula. Step (2): Compound (2) is then treated with sodium methoxide in methanol for its deacetylation to yield benzyl 2,6-dideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranoside Compound (4) having the formula as the deacetylation product. Step (3): Two hydroxyl groups of Compound (4) are reacted with dibutyltin oxide, followed by reaction with benzyl bromide. Thereby, benzyl 3-O-benzyl-2,6-dideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talopyranoside Compound (5) of the formula is obtained as a product of preferential benzylation of the 3-hydroxyl group of Compound (4). Step (4): Compound (5) is oxidized with pyridinium chloro-chromate to produce benzyl 3-O-benzyl-2,6-dideoxy-2-fluoro--L-lyxo-hexopyranose-4-uloside Compound(6) of the formula Step (5): Compound (6) is reacted with O-methylhydroxy-ammonium chloride in anhydrous dichloromethane to produce benzyl 3-O-benzyl-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro-4-(methoxyimino)--L-lyxo-hexopyranoside Compound(7) of the formula as the 4-methoxyiminoated product. Step (6): Compound (7) is reduced with lithium borohydride in the presence of chlorotrimethylsilane to bring about the reduction with a steric selectivity and thus produce benzyl 4-amino-3-O-benzyl-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro--L-talo-pyranoside Compound(8) of the formula as a 4-amino-sugar having the L-talo configuration. Step (7): Compound (8), without being purified, is reacted with trifluoroacetic anhydride to protect the amino group of Compound (8) with trifluoroacetyl group and thus produce benzyl 3-O-benzyl-2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro-4-(trifluoroacetamido)--L-talopyranoside Compound(9) of the foumula Step (8): Compound (9) is subjected to hydrogenolysis in the presence of a palladium catalyst to remove the two benzyl groups from Compound (9). Thereby, there is produced 2,4,6-trideoxy-2-fluoro-4-(trifluoroacetamido)-L-talopryranose Compound(10) having the formula This Compound (10) is a mixture of the -anomer Compound (10-a) and -anomer Compound(10-b). By subjecting Compound (10) to a silica gel column chromatography as developed with dichloromethane, the -anomer Compound (10-a) can be isolated from the -anomer Compound(10-b).

The resulting solution was added with methyl orthoformate (54 l) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes (for the protection of the 13-carbonyl group by the ketalation). Then, the resulting reaction solution was cooled to 0 C. and was added with a solution of bromine (22 mg) in anhydrous dichloromethane (0.2 ml). The mixture obtained was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours, thereby to conduct the bromination at the 14-position of the compound. To the resultant reaction solution were added isopropyl ether (15 ml) and hexane (5 ml) to deposit a red precipitate, which was then separated centrifugally and washed twice with hexane. The precipitate was then suspended in acetone (5 ml) and the suspension was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours for conducting the deketalation reaction. To the resulting reaction solution was added hexane to deposit a precipitate, which was then recovered by centrifugation. The precipitate obtained was taken up into a mixture of water (1.5 ml) and acetone (1 ml), and the resultant solution was added with sodium formate (101 mg) and then stirred at room temperature for 22 hours to effect the reaction intended. The reaction solution was concentrated under a reduced pressure to distill acetone from the solution. The remaining aqueous solution was washed with chloroform. The chloroform solution obtained (as the washing) was further washed twice with water. The aqueous washings so obtained were combined with said aqueous solution, and the resultant mixture was charged into a column packed with 20 ml of a non-ionic adsorbent resin, Diaion HP20 (a product of Mitsubishi Kasei Co., Japan). The resin column was then washed with water for the de-salting and was subsequently eluted with development solvents comprising water, aqueous methanol or methanol, while the concentration of methanol in the development solvents was changed from 0% to 100% gradually. The active fractions of the eluate containing the target compound were thus recovered and combined, followed by concentrating under a reduced pressure. The residue obtained was dissolved in a mixture of chloroform-methanol (2:1), to which was then added a solution of 2N hydrogen chloride in methanol to adjust to pH 1. The solution having the adjusted pH of 1 was then added with isopropyl ether to allow a precipitate to deposit. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation to afford 28.2 mg (yield 58%) of the titled Compound (16) as its hydrochloride in the form of a red solid.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for production of 4-aryl-2-butanol. The invention particularly, relates to a process for the production of two biologically active molecules () betuligenol and () betuloside having the general formula (1) as given below: BACKGROUND Taxol is isolated from the leaves of Taxus wallichiana. Taxol, a highly oxygenated diterpenoid molecule and a potent anticancer drug was first isolated from the stem bark of Taxus brevifolia. Thereafter, it is also been isolated from other Taxus species including Himalayan yew Taxus wallichiana. Various types of cancers have been treated with taxol and the results in the treatment of ovarian and breast cancers are very promising. Taxol has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States for the treatment of ovarian and breast cancers. Taxol, a structurally complicated and chemically labile molecule needing special and careful extraction and separation procedures for its isolation from plant materials. Unfortunately, most of the works are proprietary and have not been published. The American workers have used alcohol to extract taxol from the stem bark of T. brevifolia and separation of taxol from the alcoholic extract uses column chromatography over silica with 2% methanol in chloroform as the eluting solvent to yield a mixture of taxol and cephalomannine. Taxol can be separated and isolated from the mixture with a yield of 0.01% either by repeated column chromatography over silica or by high performance liquid chromatography. Taxol has also been isolated from the Himalayan yew Taxus wallichiana with a yield of 0.02%. The isolation process involves extracting the stem bark with methanol, partitioning of the methanolic extract between water and chloroform and isolating taxol from the chloroform soluble fraction by chromatography over silicagel. Taxus wallichiana known as the Himalayan yew is available in India. The applicants have investigating the different parts of this plant from different Himalayan regions of India for isolation of naturally occurring analogues of taxol, its important precursors and other biologically active compounds. During the course of investigation the applicants have isolated 2 compounds of 4-aryl-2-butanol namely betuligenol having formula C 10 H 14 O 2 , mp 69-70 C., n 20 (C1, MeOH) and betuliloside having formula C 16 H 24 O 7 mp 187-188, n 22 (C1, MeOH) from the leaves of T. wallichiana. Both compounds are known and they have previously been isolated from the plant Acer nikoense. No isolation process has been mentioned in the paper (T. Inoue, Y. Ishidate, M. Fujita, M. Kubo, M. Fukushima and M. Nagai, J. Pharm. Soc. Jpn. 98, 41 (1978): Chem, Abstr. 88, 133254 (1978). However, () betuligenol, a laevoisomer of the compound of formula 1 where RH has been isolated by the applicants from the leaves of Taxus wallichiana. Now, the applicants have been able to isolate the dextro-isomer of () betuligenol which is the compound of formula 1 where RH. The process of isolation of () betuligenol from the leaves of Taxus wallichiana involves extraction of leaves with methanol. Isolation of () betuligenol with a yield of 0.05% from the methanol extract was achieved by partitioning of the methanol extract between water and chloroform and chromatography of the chloroform soluble fraction over silica gel (S. K. Chattopadhyay V. K. Tripathi. R. S. Thakur, R. P. Sharma and S. P. Jain, Indian J. Chem 33B. 409-411 (1994). Compound of formula 1 where Rglucose has not been isolated before from the leaves of T. wallichiana although its laevoisomer, betuloside has previously been isolated by the applicants from the leaves of the above plant (S. K. Chattopadhyay et al., Indian J. Chem. 33B, 409-411 (1994). The process of isolation of betuloside consists of extraction of the leaves of T. wallichiana with methanol, partitioninig of the methanol extract between water and ethyl acetate and column chromatography of the ethyl acetate fraction to give betuloside with a yield of 0.04%. Now, it has recently been reported that both the compounds of formula (1) where RH or glucose significantly exhibit anti-inflammatory properties by reducing the nitric oxide (NO) production (S. Fushiya, Y. Kabe, Y. Ikegaya and F. Takano, Planta Medica 64, 598-602 (1998). Inflammatory macrophages play a key role in inflammatory process by secreting large amount of mediators that control the initiating process of inflammation. Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the critical mediators produced by inducible NO synthase in inflammatory macrophages when stimulated by bacterial products like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and some cytokines. Nitric oxide (NO) produced by inducible NO synthase plays a role in non specific immune defence against tumors, parasitic fungi, bacteria and protozoa. Moreover, NO is known to be responsible for the hypotension observed in endotoxin shock. Activation of inflammatory macrophages resulting in the production of large amounts of NO is considered to be critical for lethal toxicity. Glucocorticoid and immuno suppressive agents strongly inhibit NO production. Now, it has been reported recently that compounds of formula (1) where RH or glucose also suppress the NO production. As NO is one of the critical mediators in inflammation, both compounds of formula (1) where RH or glucose possess significant anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing the production of NO. During the chemical investigation done by the applicants on the leaves of T. wallichiana collected from different parts of India, the applicants have been able to isolate two molecules of 4-aryl-2-butanol compounds of the formula (1) wherein if RH the compound is () betuligenol and wherein if Rglucose the compound is () betuloside with yields of 0.2 and 0.2% respectively. Thus, the leaves of Taxus wallichiana could be a viable source for the above two important molecules. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION Thus, the main object of the present invention is to provide a process for production of 4-aryl-2-butanols of general formula (1) shown below: which obviates the drawbacks of the earlier methods. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process which gives the higher yields 0.2% each of these compounds than the known process (0.05 and 0.04% respectively).

Field of the Invention This invention is in the field of the chemistry of targeting anticancer anthracycline derivatives. More particularly, it concerns doxorubicin (DOX) or its daunosamine modified derivatives (DM-DOX) linked covalently to analogs of peptide hormones such as LH-RH, bombesin and somatostatin.

Discussion of the Prior Art LH-RH Analogs which have cytotoxic moieties at the sixth position are shown in Schally, Janaky and Bajusz, European Patent Publication number 0 450 461 B1, grant publication Sep. 6, 1995. GnRH (LH-RH) analogs for destroying gonadotrops are described in Nett and Glode, European Patent, international Publication No.: WO 90/09799 published on September 7, 1990. The patent describes toxins, like ricin, linked to analogs of LH-RH for destroying gonadotrophs and thus curing sex hormone dependent cancers. LH-RH doxorubicin derivative is also mentioned without specification of the chemistry of linking. Cytotoxic somatostatin analogs are described by Schally et al. in U.S. Patent application filed on Apr. 6, 1990 and refiled in Jul. 15, 1993 under Ser. No. 08/076,846. A review by A. V. Schally in Anti-Cancer Drugs 5, 115-130 (1994) gives details about the presence of receptors on the cell membranes of a wide variety of tumors for analogs of LH-RH, bombesin or somatostatin. G. Weckbecker lists several references that show the presence of receptors and receptor subtypes for somatostatin analogs on several normal and tumorous tissues in his review in Farmac. Ther. 60, 245-264 (1993). Bombesin-like peptides and the presence of bombesin/GRP receptors for them on various normal and tumorous tissues are discussed in the review by N. Bunnett in Gut Peptides: Biochemistry and Physiology 423-445 (1994) Ed.: J. Walsh and G. J. Dockray, Raven Press, New York and by E. Spindell in Recent Progress in Hormone Research 48, (1993) (Academic Press). Doxorubicin is, at this time, the most widely used, and very potent anticancer agent. However, certain tumors do not respond to it at all and its use is also limited by multidrug resistance (MDR) and cardiotoxicity as well as neutropenia, which are the results of chronic treatment. In order to overcome these drawbacks and to further exploit the enormous tumoricidal potential inherent in the structure of anthracycline antibiotics, thousands of synthetic derivatives have been described, including their targeted analogs linked to various carrier macromolecules. Most of the history of DOX and its analogs is described in Adriamyc-in, David W. Henry, ACS Symposium Series, No. 30, Cancer Chemotherapy, American Chemical Society, pp. 15-57 (1976) and in the book Doxorubicin, Federico Arcamone, Academic Press, (1981). Highly active, alkylating, non-cross resistant 3-deamino-3-(3-cyano-4-morpholinyl)DOX and derivatives thereof which have antitumor activity are described in Mosher, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,464,529, Aug. 7, 1984. The synthesis and biological evaluation of these Intensely Potent Morpholinyl Anthracyclines are also described in J. Med. Chem. 1984, 27, 638-645. In Proc. Natl. Acad.

The use of an -,-diiodo compound for the alkylation of the daunosamine nitrogen of DOX and thus the formation of a new morpholinyl DOX derivative is described in European Patent EP 434 960, filed by Pharmacia Carlo Erba on Dec. 12, 1989. N-Trifluoroacetyladriamycin 14 -O-hemiglutarate and -hemiadipate are disclosed as analogs of N-trifluoroacetyladriamicyn 14 -O-valerate (AD-32) with improved water solubility in Israel, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,299,822, Nov. 10, 1981. Horton and Priebe ( J. Antibiotics , XXXVI, 1211-1215.) describe several 14-O-esters of different anthracycline analogs with no dramatic changes in anticancer activity as compared to the 14-OH parent analogs. In the art of designing targeted chemotherapeutic agents, the following objectives are sought: 1. Stable linkage between the carrier molecule and the chemotherapeutic agent until the target is reached. 2. Retained biological characteristics of the carrier molecule within the conjugate, such as retained binding properties. 3. Retained pharmacological activity of the chemotherapeutic agent within the conjugate, such as retained cytotoxic activity. 4. As a result of conjugation, the production of analogs of more intense activity and/or lower peripheral toxicity relative to the unconjugated moieties. Conjugation of DOX by NalO 4 oxidation of the daunosamine moiety of DOX followed by reductive alkylation involving a primary amine of a carrier molecule is described in Sela, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,263,279, Apr. 21, 1981. A cis-aconitic acid spacer was used to link the daunosamine nitrogen to macromolecular carriers with a pH-sensitive bond, as described in Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981 102, 1048-1054. Morpholino-DOX (a highly active, daunosamine modified analog of DOX) was conjugated to antibody via a hydrolyzable (lysosomotrop, pH sensitive) hydrazone linkage, involving the C-13 oxo function of the cytotoxic agent, as described in Bioconjugate Chemistry 1990 1(5), 325-330. Sensitivity of the carboxamide bond of a leucine residue to enzymatic degradation was used successfully in conjugates of DOX containing a spacer arm peptide, preferentially Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu, where the carboxy terminal Leu acylates the daunosamine nitrogen in DOX and the amino terminal Ala is linked to the carrier through dicarboxylic acid spacer as described in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1982 79, 626-629. The daunosamine nitrogen of DOX was acylated by a glutaric acid spacer and linked to LH-RH analogs with a severe loss of cytotoxic activity as described in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1992 89, 972-976. All the citations referred to are incorporated herein by reference. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The compounds of the invention are novel, targeted cytotoxic peptide hormones comprising an anthracycline cytotoxic agent, such as DOX or DM-DOX, conjugated to a peptide hormone, such as analogs of LH-RH, bombesin, and somatostatin. These cytotoxic peptide hormone conjugates are designed for the treatment of tumors bearing specific receptors for the conjugate, such as breast cancer, ovarian, cancer, endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer, and lung cancer. Certain of these (unconjugated) anthracycline cytotoxic agents utilized herein are per se novel, and are highly potent, their level of toxicity however is too high for them to be used in unconjugated form. Daunosamine modified DOX analogs presented in this invention were developed during a search for new, highly active, non-cross resistant analogs of DOX suitable for the formation of covalent conjugates with peptide carriers. The formation of stable, covalently linked conjugates with fully retained biological activities of their components was achieved by using a dicarboxylic acid spacer, like glutaric acid. One carboxyl group of the spacer forms an ester bond with the 14-OH group of DOX or DM-DOX and the other carboxyl group of the spacer forms a carboxamide bond with a well chosen free amino group of the peptide carrier. The compounds of this invention are represented by General Formula Q 14 ORPI wherein Q has the general formula wherein: Q 14 signifies a Q moiety with a side chain at the 14 position, R is H or C(O)(CH 2 ) n C(O) and n0-7, R is NH 2 or an aromatic, saturated or partially saturated 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic compounds having at least one ring nitrogen and optionally having a butadiene moiety bonded to adjacent carbon atoms of said ring to form a bicyclic system, P is H or a peptide moiety, suitably an LHRH, somatostatin or bombesin analogs, but not excluding other physiologically active peptides. Particularly desirable are those LHRH analogs having affinity for neoplastic cell receptors, especially those analogs having a D-Lys moiety at the 6 position, as well as shortened somatostatin and bombesin analogs. Nevertheless where R is NH 2 then R and P are other than H. When R and P are H, then R is other than NH 2 . A novel synthetic reaction has been discovered in the course of this work. Not only was it found that doxorubicin and its derivatives can be coupled via a dicarboxylic moiety at the 14 position to yield novel pharmacologically effective conjugates but a novel way was provided to form partially saturated heterocyclic moieties from vicinal and disjunct i.e., , or , hydroxy primary amines. The particular application in the present invention was the formation of 2-pyrollinyl and 1,3-tetrahydropyridinyl moieties on the daunosamine sugar. However, this reaction has broader applicability. 5 and 6 membered partially saturated heterocyclic moieties may be formed when a vicinal or disjunct hydroxy amine is reacted with a halo-substitued aldehyde having 2 or 3 moieties between the aldehyde carbon and the carbon atom having the halo group. These moieties may all be methylene, or a hetero atom such as oxygen may be involved. The reaction takes place in three stages. A very large excess of the haloaldehyde is reacted with the acid salt of the hydroxy amine, suitably in a polar inert anhydrous organic solvent. There is thus formed a five membered oxazolidine ring (or a six-membered 1,3-tetrahydrooxazine ring) by condensation of the aldehyde group with the hydroxyl and the amine groups. This product is treated with a organic base, suitably a tertiary amine, whereby the elements of hydro-halic acid are eliminated between the halo moiety of the former halo aldehyde and the secondary amino group of the oxazolidine or 1,3-tetrahydrooxazine ring to form a fused ring structure by the addition of a 5 or 6 membered ring. The base is then neutralized with a weak acid suitably an organic acid such as glacial acetic acid. Treatment with aqueous acid, suitably an organic acid opens the oxazolidine or 1,3-tetrahydrobxazine portion of the fused ring. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that depending on the starting aldehyde, the final nitrogen containg ring may contain at least one additional hetero atom as mentioned above. The general reaction may be illustrated as follows: Wherein X is halo, suitably bromo or iodo, preferably iodo, Y is CH 2 , OCH 2 , CH 2 -CH 2 , Z is nil or CH 2 When Z is nil, the aldehyde moiety forms a 5-membered oxazolidine ring as the first step of the reaction. When Z is CH 2 , the aldehyde moiety forms a 6-membered 1,3-tetrahydrooxazine ring. While such ring formations are well known, in combination with the ring closure effected by the haloalkane side chain in a basic medium such as a tertiary amine in an anhydrous medium, the reaction is new and surprising.

FIG. 4 is a table (Table 24-2) showing the effect of treatment with cytotoxic LH-RH analog Q 6 14 gL on tumor volumes and survival of mice with estrogen-independent breast cancers. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The moiety Q, when substituted at R by certain preferred groups, has submoiety designations of Q 1 through Q 8 , of which Q 2 through Q 8 are novel cytotoxic moieties. R has the preferred values, leading to the desired Q x moieties listed in parentheses as follows: NH 2 (Q 1 ), pyrrolidine-1-yl (Q 2 ), isoindoline-2-yl (Q 3 ), 3-pyrroline-1-yl (Q 4 ), 3-pyrrolidone-1-yl (Q 5 ), 2-pyrroline-1-yl (Q 6 ), 3-piperidone-1-yl (Q 7 ), or 1,3-tetrahydropyridine-1-yl(Q 8 ). Thus if RP is H and R is NH 2 , Q 1 is DOX, if RP is H and R is pyrrolidine-1-yl, Q 2 is 3-deamino-3-(pyrrolidine-1-yl)doxorubicin (Q 2 ); if RP is H and R is isoindoline-2-yl, Q 3 is 3-deamino-3-(isoindoline-2-yl)doxorubicin (Q 3 ); if RP is H and R is 3-pyrroline-1-yl, Q 4 is 3-deamino-3-(3-pyrroline-1-yl)doxorubicin (Q 4 ); if RP is H and R is 3-pyrrolidone-1-yl, Q 5 is 3-deamino-3-(3-pyrrolidone-1-yl)doxorubicin (Q 5 ); if RP is H and R is 2-pyrroline-1-yl, Q 6 is 3-deamino-3-(2-pyrroline-1-yl)doxorubicin (Q 6 ); if RP is H and R is 3-piperidone-1-yl, Q 7 is 3-deamino-3-(3-piperidone-1-yl)doxorubicin (Q 7 ); if RP is H and R is 1,3-tetrahydropyridine-1-yl, Q 8 is 3-deamino-3-(1,3-tetrahydropyridine-1-yl)doxorubicin (Q 8 ). The compounds incorporating the daunosamine nitrogen in a five membered ring with alkylating function are 10-50 times more active in vitro than their homolog counterparts, incorporating the daunosamine nitrogen in a six membered ring. (Such pairs are Q 5 and Q 7 as well as Q 6 and Q 8. ) In the preferred embodiments of the present invention, in the subtance of formula Q 14 ORP, R and P are other than hydrogen.

In the novel compounds of the present invention incorporating analogs of LH-RH, the cytotoxic radical Q is attached to the D-Lys side chain of the LH-RH analogs through a dicarboxylic acid spacer as formulated in Formula VII: Aaa-Bbb-Ccc-Ser-Tyr-D-Lys(Q 14 OR)-Leu-Arg-Pro-DddVII In the novel compounds of the present invention incorporating analogs of somatostatin the cytotoxic radical Q is attached to the amino terminal of the somatostatin analogs through a dicarboxylic acid spacer as formulated in Formula VIII: In the novel compounds of the present invention incorporating analogs of bombesin antagonists, The cytotoxic radical Q is linked to the amino terminal of the bombesin antagonists as formulated in Formula IX: Q 14 -O-R-Aaa-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-LeuBbb-NH 2 IX Especially preferred embodiments of this invention are those peptide conjugates that contain Q 1 and Q 6 as the cytotoxic radicals and glutaric acid (n3) as the dicarboxylic acid spacer forming a 14-O-ester bond with Q 1 (doxorubicin) or Q 6 (2-pyrrolino-doxorubicin) and a carboxamide bond with the peptide carrier. The most preferred embodiments of this invention are cytotoxic LH-RH analogs of the following formulae: 1. Glp-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-D-Lys(Q 1 14 -O-glt)-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH 2 ; 2.

Q 6 14 -O-glt-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leu(CH 2 NH)Leu-NH 2 In the novel process of forming a partially saturated heterocyclic ring with the nitrogen of a vicinal or disjunct i.e., , or , hydroxy amine the first step of the reaction is carried out in an anhydrous inert organic polar non-hydroxylic (aprotic) solvent, suitably dimethyl formamide using substantial excess, suitably a 30 fold excess of the halo aldehyde, 4-iodobutyraldehyde and 5-iodovaleraldehyde are especially effective. The invention is not limited to these however, bromo may be used in place of iodo. This reaction as well as the subsequent steps may be carried out at ambient temperature. The basification step is carried out with an excess, suitably a 2-4 fold excess of an organic base. Tertiary amines such as trialkylalkylamines are suitable for this purpose.

The column used was Dynamax C-18 (2504.6 mm; pore size:300 ; particle size:12 m. The solvent system consisted of two components: (i) 0.1% TFA in water, and (ii) 0.1% TFA in 70% aqueous acetonitrile and used in linear gradient mode, growing 1% (ii) in 1 min., for monitoring the chemical reactions. The system was used in isocratic mode for purity control. A Beckman model 342 semipreparative HPLC system was used for isolation and purification of the compounds of this invention. The column was Aquapore Octyl (25010 mm; pore size: 300 ; particle size: 15 m). The solvent system was the same described for the analytical HPLC above. Analysis Bruker ARX300 NMR spectrometer (300 MHz 1 H frequency, 75 MHz 13 C frequency) and electrospray mass spectrometer Finnigan-MAT TSQ 7000 were used for the structure identification of the doxorubicin derivatives (FIG. 2 ). Synthesis of Peptide Carriers The peptides of the invention are often administered in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic salts, such as acid additional salts. Illustrative of such acid addition salts are hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, phosphate, fumarate, glyconate, tannate, maleate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, citrate, benzoate, succinate, alginate, pamoate, malate, ascorbate, tartrate, and the like. If the active ingredient is to be administered in tablet form, the tablet may contain a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent which includes a binder, such as tragacanth, corn starch or gelatin, a disintegrating agent, such as alginic acid and a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate. If administration in liquid form is desired, sweetening and/or flavoring may be used as part of the pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent, an intravenous administration in isotonic saline, phosphate buffer solutions or the like may be effected. The pharmaceutical compositions will usually contain the peptide in conjunction with a conventional, pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. Usually, the dosage will be from about 1 to about 100 micrograms of the peptide per kilogram of the body weight of the host when given intravenously; oral dosages will be much higher. Overall, treatment of subjects with these peptides is generally carried out in the same manner as the clinical treatment using other analogs of LHRH, somatostatin and analogs of doxorubicin. These peptides can be administered to mammals intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, orally, intranasally or intravaginally to achieve biological hormonal effects through binding to specific receptors. In the case of LHRH analogs, these effects may include reversible suppression of gonadal activity, and in the case of somatostatin analogs, inhibition or gastrointentinal function. Effective dosages will vary with the form of administration and the particular species of mammal being treated. An example of one typical dosage form is a physiological saline solution containing the peptide which solution is administered to provide a dose in the range of about 0.1 to 2.5 mg/kg of body weight. Oral administration of the peptide may be given in either solid form or liquid form. The synthesis of the peptide carriers of the present invention can be performed by any techniques that are known to those skilled in the art of peptide chemistry. A summary of the suitable techniques can be found in M. Bodanszky, Principles of Peptide Synthesis, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, 1984. Techniques for solid phase peptide synthesis can be found in the textbook of J. M. Stewart and J. D. Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, Pierce Chem.

Accordingly, this method was used to compare the cytotoxic somatostatin analogs of the present invention to their parent carrier molecules with respect to their hormonal activities. Inhibition of human growth hormone-releasing hormone (hGH-RH(1-29)NH 2 ) induced growth hormone release from superfused rat pituitary cells by somatostatin analogs S-98-l in comparison with their cytotoxic derivative, Q 1 14 gS 98-1 (DOX 14 -O-gIt-S-98-l) and Q 1 14 gS 121 (DOX 14 -O-glt-S-121), respectively. In rat pituitary superfusion system, the somatostatin analogs were administered for 3 min at 1 nM dose simultaneously with 1 nM hGH-RH(1-29)NH 2 . The infusion of the somatostatin analogs was maintained for another 6 min. GH responses to 3 min administration of 1 nM hGH-RH(1-29)NH 2 were determined during the perfusion of the somatostatin analogs (0 min) and 30, 60 and 90 min after the administration stopped. The data are presented in Table 22-1.

EXAMPLE 23 Receptor binding studies with cytotoxic bombesin antagonists Radio iodination of Tyr 4 BN (Sigma) using a Bio-Rad Enzymobead Radio lodination kit and isolation of mono-iodinated 125 l-Tyr 4 BN was performed as described earlier (1). Binding of labeled Tyr 4 BN and displacement by cytotoxic bombesin antagonist analog, Q 6 14 gB was conducted using confluent Swiss 3T3 cells (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection) in 24-well plates in a modification (2) of the method of Kris et al (3). Three to five days after seeding, the confluent cells were washed twice with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and incubated for 30 min at 37 C. with 50 pM 125 l-Tyr 4 BN in the absence or presence of several concentrations of unlabeled competitors (Q 6 14 gB or BN) in a total volume of 0.5 ml binding buffer (DMEM with 50 mM HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 5 mM MgCl 2 and 100 g/ml bacitracin, pH: 7.4). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 M unlabeled ligand. After three washings with ice-cold HBSS containing 0.1% BSA (pH: 7.4) the cells were detached with 0.05% Trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA solution and transferred to tubes. Radioactivity was measured with a gamma-counter (Micromedic Systems Inc, Huntsville, Ala.). Binding data were evaluated using radio ligand binding analysis programs by McPherson (4). K i values presented in Table 23-1, were calculated according to the formula of Cheng and Prusoff (5). 1. Halmos, et al., Cancer Letters, 85, 111-118 (1994) 2. Cai, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.

One day after transplantation the mice were randomly divided into groups of five animals and the treatment started. The compounds were dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (pH 2) and given intraperitoneally. Groups, treatment schedules and doses as well as average survival times are shown in Table 24-1. Results are summarized in Table 24-2 and FIG. 1 . As is shown in FIG. 4 , (Table 24-2), 1.25 nmol Q 6 administered on day 1, 2, 7 and 8 (Group 2) exerted strong toxicity characterized with an average survival of 17.4 days, which is significantly shorter than that of the untreated control group. In comparison, the same dosage of Q 6 14 gL (Group 6) resulted in an average survival of 30.8 days, which is significantly longer than that of the untreated control group. Higher efficacy of Q 6 14 gL over Q 6 can also be demonstrated by comparing the average final tumor volumes in Group 2 (1065 mm 3 at day 16) and in Group 6 (863 mm 3 at day 31). Similar conclusions can be demonstrated by comparing Q 6 and Q 6 14 gL in a different treatment schedule where 0.5 nmol of the drugs were administered five days a week for three consecutive weeks. Doxorubicin at a toxic dose (total amount: 1560 nmol, average survival: 20 days) could not eradicate the tumor, while treatment with Q 6 14 gL at nontoxic dose (total amount: 7 nmol, average survival: 31 days) to the survival of 2 out of 5 animals, without development of the tumor.

Pp. 972-976 (1992)); and DOX The assays were run as follows: In order to determine the maximum tolerated doses and compare the effects, MXT (3.2) ovex tumor pieces (1 mm 3 ) were implanted s.c. in female B 6 D 2 F1 mice. One day after transplantation the mice were randomly divided into groups of five animals and they were treated with a single injection i.p. The groups and doses are shown in the Table 25-1. The Table also shows the numbers of mice that had tumors when volume was measured and the average survival times for groups. Tumor volume changes are shown in FIG. 2 . The compounds were dissolved in 0.1% TFA (pH: 2.0). Tumor volume was measured on days 10, 13, 17, and 20. As shown in Table 25-1 and FIG. 2 , T-107, (D-Lys 6 LH-RH linked to N-glutaryl-DOX) is completely ineffective in inhibiting the growth of this tumor at a dose of 850 nmol/20 g mouse. In contrast, Q 1 14 gL, (D-Lys 6 LH-RH linked to 14-O-glutaryl-DOX) exerted strong suppression of tumor growth (Figure) at a nontoxic dose of 650 nmol/20 g mouse. DOX alone was highly toxic (average survival time: 13.6 days) at a single dose of 650 nmol/20 g mouse and significantly less effective, than Q 1 14 gL (FIG. 2 ).

EXAMPLE 26 Effect of cytotoxic LH-RH analogs on estrogen independent MXT mouse mammary cancers (KS-47) Substances Used for Treatment In an earlier experiment, Q 2 at 20 nmol daily dose for 17 days had only a moderate inhibitory effect on tumor growth, and it was toxic at 40 nmol dose (mean survival was 14.6 days). A daily dose of 30 nmol was chosen for the present experiment, which compared the efficacy and toxicity of Q 2 14 gL (Q 2 coupled to D-Lys 6 LH-RH), Q 2 (pyrrolidino-doxorubicin), D-Lys 6 LH-RH, and D-Lys 6 LH-RHQ 2 . MXT (3.2) ovex tumor pieces (1 mm 3 ) were transplanted in female B 6 D 2 F1 mice. The treatment started one day after transplantation and was continued for 12 days by i.p. injections once a day. All groups received equimolar amounts of the compounds as shown in Table 26-1. Tumors were measured on days 10, 14 and 18, and tumor volume was calculated. The data are shown in Table 26-1 and in FIG. 3 . Treatment with a daily dose of 30 nmol of daunosamine modified doxorubicin analog Q 2 (pyrrolidino-DOX) resulted in strong inhibitory effect on tumor growth (tumor volume: 144 mm 3 at day 14 vs. 1391 mm 3 for the control group), but exerted severe toxicity killing all the animals before the end of the experiment (mean survival 17.9 days). Similarly, Q 2 combined (mixture) with D-Lys 6 LH-RH resulted in strong tumor inhibitory effect (tumor volume: 80 mm 3 at day 14) but the mean survival (18.5 days) was significantly shorter than that of the untreated control group (23.1 days). As a result of the treatment with Q 2 14 gL, (Q 2 covalently linked to D-Lys 6 LH-RH) two animals died, one at day 16 and another at day 26. From the 8 surviving animals only one developed tumors at the last measurement at day 18 and they all looked healthy, but later on all of them started to develop the tumors. The mean survival for this group was significantly longer (28.3 days), than that of the control group. Treatment with D-Lys 6 LH-RH alone did not affect tumor growth. This experiment demonstrates that the higher efficacy and the lower peripheral toxicity of Q 2 14 gL over the cytotoxic radical Q 2 is attributable to the covalent conjugation of the cytotoxic radical to the targeting carrier LH-RH analog.

The novel compounds are effective as stabilizers for organic material against the damaging effect of light, oxygen and heat; they are also suitable for use in skin or hair protection preparations. The invention relates to novel compounds of the hydroxyphenyl-s-triazine type containing one blocked and 2 free o-hydroxyl groups, to the use of these compounds for stabilizing organic material, especially in plastics, coating materials, cosmetic preparations, sun screen lotions or photographic material, against damage by light, oxygen and/or heat, and to correspondingly stabilized organic material. When it is desired to increase the stability of an organic material, especially a coating, to light, it is common to add a light stabilizer. One very frequently employed class of light stabilizers are the UV absorbers, which protect the material by absorbing the harmful radiation via chromophores. One important group of UV absorbers are the triphenyl-s-triazines, as are described, inter alia, in the publications U.S. Pat. No. 3,118,887, U.S. Pat. No. 3,242,175, U.S. Pat. No. 3,244,708, GB-A-1 321 561, EP-A-0 434 608, U.S. Pat. No. 4,619,956, U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,749, U.S. Pat. No. 5,461,151, EP-A-0 704 437 and WO-96/28431. Also known are individual compounds of the hydroxyphenyl-s-triazine type some or all of whose hydroxyl groups in ortho position are blocked (U.S. Pat. No. 3,113,940, U.S. Pat.

These compounds are particularly suitable for use as UV filters in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and veterinary preparations. To prepare compounds of the formula I and especially of the formula II it is judicious to start from compounds of the formula A and, respectively, of the formula A, in which the radicals R 2 independently of one another are C 6 -C 18 alkyl; C 2 -C 6 alkenyl; phenyl; C 7 -C 11 phenylalkyl; COOH; COOR 4 ; CN; NHCOR 5 ; halogen; trifluoromethyl; or OR 3 ; and R 3 , R 4 , R 5 and R 11 , have the definitions given for formula I, R 3 additionally embracing H. Compounds of the formulae A and A are known or can be obtained in analogy to known compounds by common methods, for example in accordance with or in analogy to one of the methods given in EP-A-434 608 or in the publication by H. Brunetti and C. E. L{umlaut over (t)}hi, Helv. Chim. Acta 55, 1566 (1972), by Friedel-Crafts addition of halotriazines onto corresponding phenols. This can be followed by a further reaction in accordance with known methods, for example for esterifying free carboxyl groups to give esters in which R 2 is COOR 4 . Further details on starting compounds which can be used and on their preparation can be found in the literature cited at the outset and in EP-A-165 608. Other methods of preparing starting compounds of the formula A are described by Cousin and Volmar, Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 15, 414-421 (1914), U.S. Pat. No. 3,113,942 or EP-A-648753; in accordance with or in analogy to these methods it is possible to trimerize 3 equivalents of a 2-hydroxybenzonitrile of the formula B or of a 2-hydroxybenzamide of the formula C at elevated temperature, usually in the range 180-260 C., to give the compound of the formula A. This route is particularly suitable for compounds of the formula A in which R 2 is not OH or OR 3 . A particularly preferred starting compound of the formula A is tris(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine; the novel compounds obtainable therefrom by preparation methods indicated below correspond to the formula II in which R 2 is OR 3 and R 11 is hydrogen. Options for the further reaction of the compound of the formula A to the compound of the formula I, and especially of the formula II, include the following: a) Stepwise Reaction of Free OH Groups with Halides or Sulfates This is done using, for each OH to be reacted, about one equivalent of a reagent R 1 -Hal in which Hal is a halogen atom, preferably Cl, and R 1 embraces the definitions given in connection with formula I above, together with about one equivalent of base. R 1 -Hal can also be a mixture of reagents. Instead of the halide R 1 -Hal it is also posisble to use one equivalent of a sulfate ( R 1 OSO 2 OR 1 ). If the intention is to introduce not only the radical R 1 but also another, different radical (R 2 in the definition of OR 3 ) then it is judicious first of all to carry out reaction with the required number of equivalents of R 3 -Hal, where R 3 embraces the definitions given for R 1 , and base and then reaction with one equivalent of R 1 -Hal. The reaction is preferably carried out in an organic solvent, for example an aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon, alcohol, ether, ester or amide of appropriate boiling range; preferred solvents are toluene, xylene, propanol, butanol, 2-methoxyethanol, 2-ethoxyethanol, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme), dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Suitable bases are organic or, preferably, inorganic bases such as hydroxides, oxides or carbonates; important examples are alkali metal hydroxides and carbonates, such as KOH, NaOH, K 2 CO 3 , Na 2 CO 3 . The reaction temperature is usually in the range 80-180 C., preferably in the range 100-150 C. The reaction can also be carried out as a 2-phase reaction in the presence of phase transfer catalysts such as tetraalkylammonium salts, for example; in this case the halide or sulfate is usually and especially when it is employed as a pure alkylating reagentpresent in the organic phase and the triazine precursor in the aqueous phase. For instance, a compound of the formula II, in which R 2 is OR 3 can be obtained, for example, by the following reaction schemes: b) Stepwise Reaction of Free OH Groups with Epoxides Instead of the reagents described under a) it is also possible to employ epoxides. For each OH group to be reacted, in each case about 1 equivalent or more of an epoxide of the type is employed, together with a catalyst, in bulk or in a solvent. This reaction usually takes place without the addition of bases. The primary reaction product of the formula I or II, in which R 3 or, if appropriate R 3 and R 1 correspond to the formula CH 2 CH(OH)R can, if desired, be reacted further by known methods, for example with etherification or esterification of the aliphatic OH group. If the intention is to introduce not only the radical R 3 as CH 2 CH(OH)R but also another, different radical R 1 , then it is judicious first of all to carry out reaction with the required number of equivalents of , where usually no excess is used and where CH 2 CH(OH)R embraces the definitions given for R 1 , and then to carry out reaction with one equivalent of the desired further reagent, for example R 1 -Hal and base, or with one further equivalent of Conversely, in accordance with a) it is also possible first to introduce a radical R 3 and then to react the reaction product with to give the compound of the formula I or II. The ring opening of the epoxide is preferably carried out in an organic solvent, especially an apolar organic solvent; examples are aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons of appropriate boiling range, preferably toluene, xylene, mesitylene. Examples of suitable catalysts are phase transfer catalysts, including quaternary phosphonium salts, or tertiary amines; e.g. ethyltriphenylphosphonium bromide or benzyldimethylamine. The reaction temperature is usually in the range 80-200 C., preferably in the range 100-180 C. For instance, a compound of the formula II in which R 2 is OR 3 can be obtained, for example, by the following reaction schemes: The products of the above-described reactions can be modified further by known methods in the context of the definitions given for formula I. The reactions can be carried out in the absence of oxygen, for example by flushing with an inert gas such as argon; however, in every case oxygen does not interfere, so that the reaction can also be carried out without this measure. After the end of the reaction, the product can be worked up by common methods. The novel compounds are particularly suitable for stabilizing organic materials against damage by light, oxygen or heat. The novel compounds are especially suitable as light stabilizers (UV absorbers). The materials to be stabilized can, for example, be oils, fats, waxes, coating materials, cosmetics, photographic materials or biocides. Of particular interest is their use in polymeric materials as are present in plastics, rubbers, coating materials, photographic materials or adhesives. When used in cosmetic preparations, the material to be protected is frequently not the preparation itself but skin or hair to which the preparation is applied. Examples of polymers and other substrates which can be stabilized in this way are the following: 1. Polymers of monoolefins and diolefins, for example polypropylene, polyisobutylene, polybut-1-ene, poly-4-methylpent-1-ene, polyisoprene or polybutadiene, as well as polymers of cycloolefins, for instance of cyclopentene or norbornene, polyethylene (which optionally can be crosslinked), for example high density polyethylene (HDPE), high density and high molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-HMW), high density and ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-UHMW), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), (VLDPE) and (ULDPE). Polyolefins, i.e. the polymers of monoolefins exemplified in the preceding paragraph, preferably polyethylene and polypropylene, can be prepared by different, and especially by the following, methods: a) radical polymerisation (normally under high pressure and at elevated temperature). b) catalytic polymerisation using a catalyst that normally contains one or more than one metal of groups IVb, Vb, VIb or VIII of the Periodic Table. These metals usually have one or more than one ligand, typically oxides, halides, alcoholates, esters, ethers, amines, alkyls, alkenyls and/or aryls that may be either or -coordinated. These metal complexes may be in the free form or fixed on substrates, typically on activated magnesium chloride, titanium(III) chloride, alumina or silicon oxide. These catalysts may be soluble or insoluble in the polymerisation medium. The catalysts can be used by themselves in the polymerisation or further activators may be used, typically metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkyl halides, metal alkyl oxides or metal alkyloxanes, said metals being elements of groups Ia, IIa and/or IIIa of the Periodic Table. The activators may be modified conveniently with further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups. These catalyst systems are usually termed Phillips, Standard Oil Indiana, Ziegler (-Natta), TNZ (DuPont), metallocene or single site catalysts (SSC). 2.

No. 5,252,643; DE-A-4316611; DE-A-4316622; DE-A-4316876; EP-A-0589839 or EP-A-0591102 or 3-4-(2-acetoxyethoxy)phenyl-5,7-di-tert-butyl-benzofuran-2-one, 5,7-di-tert-butyl-3-4-(2-stearoyloxyethoxy)phenylbenzofuran-2-one, 3,3-bis5,7-di-tert-butyl-3-(4-2-hydroxyethoxyphenyl)benzofuran-2-one, 5,7-di-tert-butyl-3-(4-ethoxyphenyl)benzofuran-2-one, 3-(4-acetoxy-3,5-dimethylphenyl)-5,7-di-tert-butyl-benzofuran-2-one, 3-(3,5-dimethyl-4-pivaloyloxyphenyl)-5,7-di-tert-butyl-benzofuran-2-one, 3-(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-5,7-di-tert-butyl-benzofuran-2-one, 3-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)-5,7-di-tert-butyl-benzofuran-2-one. The nature and amount of the further stabilizers added are determined by the nature of the substrate to be stabilized and by its intended use. It is common to employ 0.1-10, for example 0.2-5% by weight, based on the material to be stabilized. It is particularly advantageous to employ the novel compounds in combination with sterically hindered amines, for example 2,2,6,6-tetraalkylpiperidine derivatives. The invention therefore embraces a synergistic stabilizer mixture comprising (a) a compound of the formula I and (b) at least one sterically hindered amine, its salt with any desired acid or its complex with a metal, and also embraces a composition comprising A) an organic material which is sensitive to oxidative, thermal and/or actinic breakdown/buildup, B) at least one compound of the formula I, and C) a conventional additive of the type of the sterically hindered amines. Preferred sterically hindered amines are, for example, those indicated in the list above under 2.6 or those indicated below as additives to the novel coating compositions. Of particular interest is the use of the compounds of the formula I as stabilizers in synthetic organic polymers, and corresponding compositions. The organic materials to be protected are preferably natural, semisynthetic or synthetic organic materials. When using cosmetic preparations, the organic material to be protected is usually human or animal skin or hair. The novel stabilizer mixtures can be employed with particular advantage in compositions which comprise as component A a synthetic organic polymer, especially a thermoplastic polymer, a binder for coatings such as, for example, paints, or a photographic material. Examples of suitable thermoplastic polymers are polyolefins, especially polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), and polymers containing heteroatoms in the main chain. Examples of such polymers are the following classes of thermoplastic polymers: 1. Polyacetals, such as polyoxymethylene, and those polyoxymethylenes which contain comonomers such as ethylene oxide; polyacetals which are modified with thermoplastic polyurethanes, acrylates or MBS. 2. Polyphenylene oxides and sulfides and their mixtures with styrene polymers or polyamides. 3. Polyamides and copolyamides, for example those derived from diamines and dicarboxylic acids and/or from amino carboxylic acids or the corresponding lactams, such as polyamide 4, polyamide 6, polyamide 6/6, 6/10, 6/9, 6/12, 4/6, polyamide 11, polyamide 12, aromatic polyamides based on m-xylene, diamine and adipic acid; polyamides prepared from hexamethylenediamine and iso- and/or terephthalic acid with or without an elastomer as modifier, for example poly-2,4,4-trimethylhexamethyleneterephthalamide, poly-m-phenylene isophthalamide. Block copolymers of the abovementioned polyamides with polyolefins, olefin copolymers, ionomers or chemically bonded or grafted elastomers; or with polyethers, for example with polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol or polytetramethylene glycol. Furthermore, copolyamides or polyamides modified with EPDM or ABS; and polyamides which are condensed during processing (RIM polyamide systems). 4. Polyureas, polyimides, polyamideimides and polybenzimidazoles. 5. Polyesters, for example those derived from dicarboxylic acids and dialcohols and/or from hydroxy carboxylic acids or the corresponding lactones, such as polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, poly-1,4-dimethylolcyclohexane terephthalate, polyhydroxybenzoates, and also block polyetheresters derived from polyethers having hydroxyl end groups; and also polyesters modified with polycarbonates or MBS. 6. Polycarbonates and polyestercarbonates, especially aromatic polycarbonates, for example those based on 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane or 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane. 7. Polysulfones, polyether sulfones and polyether ketones, especially aromatic polymers from this class. 8. Mixtures (polyblends) of such polymers with one another or with other polymers, for example with polyolefins, polyacrylates, polydienes or other elastomers as impact modifiers. Among these, preference is given to the polycarbonates, polyesters, polyamides, polyacetals, polyphenylene oxides and polyphenylene sulfides, but especially to the polycarbonates. Polycarbonates are to be understood as meaning, in particular, those polymers whose constitutional repeating unit is of the formulaOAOCO, in which A is a divalent phenolic radical. Examples of A are given, inter alia, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,960,863 and in DE-A-39 22 496. The polymers of component (A) can be linear or branched. The shaping of these polymers takes place at a relatively high temperature; polycarbonate, for example, is injection molded at 220-330 C. At these temperatures the majority of the customary light stabilizers and antioxidants are unstable and begin to break down. The abovementioned mixtures, however, are extremely temperature-stable and are therefore particularly suitable for stabilizing the polymers mentioned. Use in multicoat systems is also of interest. In this case a novel polymer composition having a relatively high content of novel stabilizer, for example 5-15% by weight, is applied in a thin coat (10-100 m) to a shaped article comprising a polymer which contains little or no stabilizer of the formula I. Application can take place at the same time as the shaping of the base structure, for example by coextrusion. Application can also be made, however, to the ready-shaped base structure, for example by lamination with a film or by coating with a solution. The outer coat or coats of the finished article have the function of a UV filter which protects the interior of the article against UV light. The outer coat contains preferably 5-15% by weight, in particular 5-10% by weight, of at least one compound of the formula I. The polymers stabilized in this way are notable for high weathering stability, and especially by high resistance to UV light. As a result, even when used outdoors, they retain their mechanical properties and their colour and their gloss over a long period. Likewise particularly preferred organic materials are coating compositions and photographic material. The invention therefore preferably also provides a composition in which the novel compound is incorporated in a thermoplastic polymer, a film-forming binder, especially one based on acrylic, alkyd, polyurethane, polyester or polyamide resin or appropriately modified resins, a photographic material or a cosmetic preparation, including a cosmetic hair preparation, for example a cosmetic or a suncream. The material to be protected (component A) can in this case be, for example, a thermoplastic polymer, a film-forming binder, especially one based on acrylic, alkyd, polyurethane, polyester or polyamide resin or appropriately modified resins, a photographic material, or human or animal skin or hair. The use of the novel compounds as stabilizers for coatings, for example for paints, is of particular interest. The invention also therefore provides those compositions whose component A is a film-forming binder. The novel coating composition contains preferably 0.01-10 parts by weight, especially 0.05-10 parts by weight and, in particular, 0.1-5 parts by weight of the novel stabilizer B per 100 parts by weight of solid binder A. Multicoat systems are also possible here, in which the concentration of the compound of the formula I (component B) in the top layer can be higher, for example from 1 to 15 parts by weight, especially 3-10 parts by weight of B per 100 parts by weight of solid binder A. The use of the compound of the formula I as a stabilizer in coatings brings with it the additional advantage that delamination, i.e. the flaking of the coating from the substrate, is prevented. This advantage is particularly manifest in the case of metallic substrates, even in the case of multicoat systems on metallic substrates. Suitable binders (component A) are in principle all those which are customary in the art, for example those described in Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th ed., Vol. A18, pp. 368-426, VCH, Weinheim 1991. The binder is generally a film-forming binder based on a thermoplastic or thermosetting resin, predominantly on a thermosetting resin. Examples thereof are alkyd, acrylic, polyester, phenolic, melamine, epoxy and polyurethane resins and mixtures thereof. Component A can be a cold-curable or a heat-curable binder, the addition of a curing catalyst possibly being advantageous. Examples of suitable catalysts which accelerate the curing of the binder are described in Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Vol. A18, p.469, VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim 1991. Preference is given to coating compositions in which component A is a binder comprising a functional acrylate resin and a crosslinker. Examples of coating compositions with specific binders are: 1. Paints based on cold- or heat-crosslinkable alkyd, acrylate, polyester, epoxy or melamine resins or mixtures of such resins, with or without addition of a curing catalyst; 2. two-component polyurethane paints based on hydroxyl-containing acrylate, polyester or polyether resins and on aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates; 3. one-component polyurethane paints based on blocked isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates which are deblocked in the course of stoving; 4. one-component polyurethane paints based on aliphatic or aromatic urethanes or polyurethanes and on hydroxyl-containing acrylate, polyester or polyether resins; 5. one-component polyurethane paints based on aliphatic or aromatic urethane acrylates or polyurethane acrylates having free amine groups in the urethane structure and on melamine resins or polyether resins, with or without addition of a curing catalyst; 6. two-component paints based on (poly)ketimines and on aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates; 7. two-component paints based on (poly)ketimines and on an unsaturated acrylate resin or a polyacetoacetate resin or a methacrylamidoglycolate methyl ester; 8. two-component paints based on carboxyl- or amino-containing polyacrylates and polyepoxides; 9. two-component paints based on acrylate resins containing anhydride groups and on a polyhydroxy or polyamino component; 10. two-component paints based on acrylate-containing anhydrides and polyepoxides; 11. two-component paints based on (poly)oxazolines and on acrylate resins containing anhydride groups, or unsaturated acrylate resins or aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates; 12. two-component paints based on unsaturated polyacrylates and polymalonates; 13. thermoplastic polyacrylate paints based on thermoplastic acrylate resins or externally crosslinking acrylate resins in combination with etherified melamine resins; 14. paint systems based on siloxane-modified or fluorine-modified acrylate resins. The novel coating composition preferably comprises, in addition to components A and B, as component C a light stabilizer of the sterically hindered amine, 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine and/or 2-hydroxyphenyl-2H-benzotriazole type, for example as set out in the above list under sections 2.1, 2.6 and 2.8. Of particular technical interest in this context is the addition of 2-monoresorcinyl-4,6-diaryl-1,3,5-triazines and/or 2-hydroxyphenyl-2H-benzotriazoles. In order to achieve maximum light stability it is particularly advantageous to add sterically hindered amines, as set out in the above list under 2.6. The invention therefore also provides a coating composition which in addition to components A and B comprises as component C a light stabilizer of the sterically hindered amine type. This stabilizer is preferably a 2,2,6,6-tetraalkylpiperidine derivative which comprises at least one group of the formula in which R is hydrogen or methyl, especially hydrogen. Component C is preferably used in an amount of 0.05-5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the solid binder. Examples of tetraalkylpiperidine derivatives which can be used as component C are given in EP-A-356 677, pages 3-17, sections a) to f). These sections of this EP-A are considered as part of the present description. It is particularly judicious to employ the following tetraalkylpiperidine derivatives: bis-(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl) succinate, bis-(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl) sebacate, bis-(1,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperidin-4-yl) sebacate, di(1,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperidin-4-yl) butyl(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)malonate, bis-(1-octyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl) sebacate, tetra(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl) butane-1,2,3,4-tetracarboxylate, tetra(1,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperidin-4-yl) butane-1,2,3,4-tetracarboxylate, 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-oxa-3,20-diaza-21-oxodispiro5.1.11.2heneicosane, 8-acetyl-3-dodecyl-1,3,8-triaza-7,7,9,9-tetramethylspiro4.5decane-2,4-dione, 1,1-bis(1,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperidin-4-yl-oxycarbonyl)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethene, or a compound of the formulae where m is 5-50. In addition to components A, B and, if present, C, the coating composition may also comprise further components, for example solvents, pigments, dyes, plasticizers, stabilizers, thixotropic agents, drying catalysts and/or levelling assistants. Examples of possible components are those as descibred in Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th ed., Vol. A18, pp. 429-471, VCH, Weinheim 1991. Possible drying catalysts or curing catalysts are, for example, organometallic compounds, amines, amino-containing resins and/or phosphines. Examples of organometallic compounds are metal carboxylates, especially those of the metals Pb, Mn, Co, Zn, Zr or Cu, or metal chelates, especially those of metals Al, Ti or Zr, or organometallic compounds such as organotin compounds, for example. Examples of metal carboxylates are the stearates of Pb, Mn or Zn, the octoates of Co, Zn or Cu, the naphthenates of Mn and Co or the corresponding linoleates, resinates or tallates. Examples of metal chelates are the aluminum, titanium or zirconium chelates of acetylacetone, ethyl acetylacetate, salicylaldehyde, salicylaldoxime, o-hydroxyacetophenone or ethyl trifluoroacetylacetate, and the alkoxides of these metals. Examples of organotin compounds are dibutyltin oxide, dibutyltin dilaurate or dibutyltin dioctoate. Examples of amines are, in particular, tertiary amines, for example tributylamine, triethanolamine, N-methyldiethanolamine, N-dimethylethanolamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-methylmorpholine or diazabicyclooctane (triethylenediamine) and their salts. Further examples are quaternary ammonium salts, for example trimethylbenzylammonium chloride. Amino-containing resins are simultaneously binder and curing catalyst. Examples thereof are amino-containing acrylate copolymers. Phosphines, for example triphenylphosphine, can also be used as curing catalyst. The novel coating compositions can also be radiation-curable coating compositions. In this case the binder consists essentially of monomeric or oligomeric compounds having ethylenically unsaturated bonds (prepolymers), which after application are cured, i.e. converted into a crosslinked, high molecular mass form, by actinic radiation. Where the system is a UV-curing system, it generally also includes a photoinitiator. Appropriate systems are described in the abovementioned publication Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th ed., Vol. A18, pages 451-453. In radiation-curable coating compositions the novel stabilizers can be employed even without the addition of sterically hindered amines. The novel coating compositions can be applied to any desired substrates, for example to metal, wood, plastic or ceramic materials. In the case of the finishing of automobiles they are preferably used as topcoat. If the topcoat consists of two layers of which the lower layer is pigmented and the upper layer is not, then the novel coating composition can be used for the upper or the lower layer or for both layers, but preferably for the upper layer. The novel coating compositions can be applied to the substrates by the customary techniques, for example by spreading, spraying, flow coating, dipping or electrophoresis; see also Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th ed., Vol.A18, pp. 491-500. Depending on the binder system the coating c an be cured at room temperature or by heating. The coating is preferably cured at 50-150 C., powder coatings also at higher temperatures. The coatings obtained in accordance with the invention possess an outstanding resistance to the damaging effects of light, oxygen and heat; particular mention should be made of the good light stability and weathering stability of the resulting coatings, for example paints. The invention therefore also provides a coating, especially a paint, which is stabilized against the damaging effects of light, oxygen and heat by the addition of a compound of the formula I. The paint is preferably a topcoat for automobilies. The invention in addition comprises a process for stabilizing a coating based on organic polymers against damage by light, oxygen and/or heat, which comprises mixing with the coating composition a compound of the formula I, and provides for the use of compounds of the formula I in coating compositions as stabilizers against damage e by light, oxygen and/or heat. The coating compositions can comprise an organic solvent or solvent mixture in which the binder is soluble. The coating composition can also be an aqueous solution or dispersion, however. The vehicle can also be a mixture of an organic solvent and water. The coating composition may also be a high-solids system or can be solvent-free (for example powder coating). Powder coatings are those, for example, as described in Ullmanns Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th ed., A18, pages 438-444. The powder coating can also be in the form of a powder slurry, i.e. a dispersion of the powder inpreferablywater. The pigments can be inorganic, organic or metallic pigments. The novel coating compositions preferably contain no pigments and are used as clearcoat. Likewise preferred is the use of the coating composition as a topcoat for applications in the automotive industry, especially as a pigmented or unpigmented top layer of the coating system. Its use for underlying coats, however, is also possible. The novel compounds of the formula I are also particularly suitable as UV filters for protecting the skin and the hair of humans and animals against the damaging action of UV radiation. These compounds are therefore suitable as light stabilizers in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and veterinary preparations. These compounds can be used either in solution or in the micronized state. The invention therefore additionally provides a cosmetic preparation comprising at least one compound of the formula I and cosmetically compatible excipients or auxiliaries. For cosmetic use the novel light stabilizers, unless dissolved, usually have a mean particle size in the range from 0.02 to 2, preferably 0.05 to 1.5, and, with very particular preference, from 0.1 to 1.0. The insoluble novel UV absorbers can be brought to the desired particle size by customary methods, for example grinding with, for example, a jet, ball, vibration or hammer mill. Grinding is preferably carried out in the presence of from 0.1 to 30, preferably from 0.5 to 15% by weight, based on the UV absorber, of a grinding assistant such as, for example, an alkylated vinylpyrrolidone polymer, a vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, an acylglutamate or, in particular, a phospholipid. In addition to the novel UV absorbers, the cosmetic compositions may also include one or more other UV protection agents, for example triazines, oxanilides, triazoles or vinyl-containing amides or cinnamamides. Such protectants are described, for example, in GB-A-2,286,774 or else are known from Cosmetics Toiletries (107), 50 ff (1992). The novel cosmetic compositions contain from 0.1 to 25, for example from 0.1 to 15, especially from 0.5 to 10% by weight, based on the overall weight of the compositon, of a UV absorber or a mixture of UV absorbers and a cosmetically compatible auxiliary. The cosmetic compositions can be prepared by physical mixing of the UV absorber or absorbers with the auxiliary by customary methods, for example by simply stirring together the individual components. The novel cosmetic compositions can be formulated as a water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsion, as an oil-in-alcohol lotion, as a vesicular dispersion of an ionic or nonionic amphiphilic lipid, as a gel, as a solid stick or as an aerosol formulation. As a water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsion the cosmetically compatible auxiliary contains preferably from 5 to 50% of an oil phase, from 5 to 20% of an emulsifier and from 30 to 90% of water. The oil phase in this case can be any oil suitable for cosmetic formulations, for example one or more hydrocarbon oils, a wax, a natural oil, a silicone oil, a fatty acid ester or a fatty alcohol. Preferred monools and polyols are ethanol, isopropanol, propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, glycerol and sorbitol. Cosmetic hair compositions can be in the form of a shampoo, a lotion, a gel or an emulsion for rinsing, before or after shampooing, before or after dyeing or bleaching, before or after a permanent wave or before or after a straightening operation, in the form of a lotion, a mousse or a gel for styling or treatment, in the form of a lotion or a gel for brushing or for waving, in the form of a hair lacquer, in the form of a composition for permanent waving or for straightening, for dyeing or bleaching the hair. For example, the following cosmetic hair formulations can be used: a 1 ) a spontaneously emulsifying stock formulation consisting of the UV absorber, PEG-6-C 10 oxo alcohol and sorbitan sesquioleate, to which water and any desired quaternary ammonium compound, for example 4% minkamidopropyl-dimethyl-2-hydroxyethylammonium chloride or quaternium 80 are added; a 2 ) a spontaneously emulsifying stock formulation consisting of the UV absorber, tributyl citrate and PEG-20-sorbitan monooleate, to which water and any desired quaternary ammonium compound, for example 4% minkamidopropyl-dimethyl-2-hydroxyethylammonium chloride or quaternium 80 are added; b) quat-doped solutions of the UV absorber in butyltriglycol and tributyl citrate; c) dispersions of micronized UV absorbers, obtained by known methods (precipitation from solutions or mixed solutions, grinding), having a mean diameter of 0.05-1.0 mm in APG (e.g. Plantaren) and a quat (e.g. mink-amidopropyldimethyl-2-hydroxyethylammonium chloride) in an aqueous formulation; d) mixtures or solutions of the UV absorber with n-alkylpyrrolidone. The cosmetic compositions may also include further components, examples being emollients, emulsion stabilizers, skin moisteners, tanning accelerators, thickeners such as xanthan, moisture retention agents such as glycerol, preservatives, fragrances and colorants. The novel cosmetic formulations feature excellent protection of the human skin and hair against the damaging influence of sunlight. Other materials to be stabilized with the novel compositions are recording materials. By such materials are meant, for example, those described in Research Disclosure 1990, 31429 (pages 474-480) for photographic reproduction and other reprographic techniques. The novel recording materials comprise, for example, those for pressure-sensitive copying systems, microcapsule photocopier systems, heat-sensitive copier systems, photographic material and ink-jet printing. The novel recording materials feature an unexpectedly high quality, especially in terms of their light stability. The novel recording materials have a structure which is known per se and which corresponds to the utility. They consist of a base, for example paper or plastic film, on which one or more coatings are applied. Depending on the type of material, these coats contain the suitable components required, in the case of photographic material for example silver halide emulsions, colour couplers, dyes and the like. The material intended especially for ink-jet printing has a customary base on which there is an absorption layer suitable for ink. Uncoated paper can likewise be employed for ink-jet printing; in this case, the paper functions simultaneously as a base and has the absorbent for the ink. Suitable material for ink-jet printing is described, inter alia, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,448, the disclosure content of which is regarded as part of the present description. The recording material can also be transparent, for example in the case of projection films. The compound or compounds of the formula I can be incorporated into the material even in the course of manufacture; in papermaking, for example, by addition to the pulp. Another method of use is the spraying of the material with an aqueous solution of compound(s) of the formula I, or the addition thereof to the coating. Coatings for transparent recording materials for projection must not contain any light-scattering particles such as pigments or fillers. The colour-binding coatings can contain further additives, for example antioxidants, light stabilizers (including UV absorbers which are not included among the novel UV absorbers), viscosity improvers, brighteners, biocides and/or antistats. The coating is usually prepared as follows: The water-soluble components, for example the binder, are dissolved in water and mixed. The solid components, for example fillers and other additives as already described, are dispersed in this aqueous medium. Dispersion is advantageously brought about with the aid of equipment such as ultrasonic devices, turbine agitators, homogenizers, colloid mills, bead mills, sand mills, high-speed stirrers and the like. A particular advantage of the compounds of the formula I is their ease of incorporation into the coating. As mentioned, the novel recording materials cover a broad field of use. Compounds of the formula I can be employed, for example, in pressure-sensitive copier systems. They can be added to the paper to protect the microencapsulated dye precursors against light, or to the binder of the developer layer for protecting the dyes formed therein. Photocopier systems with light-sensitive microcapsules which are developed by pressure are described, inter alia, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,416,966; 4,483,912; 4,352,200; 4,535,050; 4,5365,463; 4,551,407; 4,562,137 and 4,608,330; and also in EP-A-139,479; EP-A-162,664; EP-A-164,931; EP-A-237,024; EP-A-237,025 and EP-A-260,129. In all these systems the compounds of the formula I can be added to the colour-accepting layer. Alternatively, the compounds of the formula I can be added to the donor layer for protecting the colour formers against light. The compounds of the formula I can also be employed in recording materials which are based on the principle of photopolymerization, photosoftening or the rupture of microcapsules, or when heat-sensitive or photosensitive diazonium salts, leuco dyes with oxidizing agent or colour lactones with Lewis acids are used. Heat-sensitive recording material exploits the colour-imparting reaction between a colourless or weakly coloured base dye and an organic or inorganic colour developer, the recorded image being produced by heat-induced contact of the two materials. This type of heat-sensitive recording material is very widespread, not only as the recording medium for faxes, computers, etc., but also in many other fields, for example in label printing. The heat-sensitive recording material according to the present invention is composed of a base, a heat-sensitive colour-forming recording layer on this base, and, optionally, a protective layer on the heat-sensitive, colour-forming recording layer. The heat-sensitive, colour-forming recording layer contains as its principal constituent a colour-imparting compound and a colour-developing compound, and also a compound of the formula (I). If the said protective layer is present, the compound of the formula (I) can also be incorporated into the protective layer. Heat-sensitive recording materials are described, for example, in JP-A 8-267 915. Further fields of use are recording materials for dye diffusion transfer printing, thermal wax transfer printing and dot matrix printing, and for use with electrostatic, electrographic, electrophoretic, magnetographic and laser-electrophotographic printers, recorders or plotters. Of the materials mentioned, preference is given to recording materials for dye diffusion transfer printing, as are described, for example, in EP-A-507,734. Compounds of the formula I can also be employed in inks, preferably for ink-jet printing, for example those as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,098,477, the disclosure content of which is regarded as part of the present description. The invention therefore also provides an ink comprising at least one compound of the formula I as stabilizer. The ink, especially for ink-jet printing, contains preferably water. Inks contain the stabilizer of the formula I usually in a concentration of from 0.01 to 20% by weight, in particular from 0.5 to 10% by weight. The novel recording materials, for example photographic recording materials, also offer the advantage over materials comprising conventional UV absorbers that the UVAs of the formula (I) are required in a comparatively small amount, meaning also that the thickness of the UVA-containing layer remains low, a factor which has a positive effect, inter alia, on the imaging properties. Another advantage of the novel stabilizers is their heightened inherent stability under extreme climatic conditions, especially at high humidity and high temperature. The novel photographic material can be a black and white or a colour photographic material; colour photographic material is preferred. Examples of colour photographic materials are colour negative films, colour reversal films, colour positive films, colour photographic paper, colour reversal photographic paper, colour-sensitive materials for the dye diffusion transfer process or the silver dye bleach process. Examples of suitable bases for the production of colour photographic materials are films and sheets of semisynthetic and synthetic polymers, such as cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate, cellulose butyrate, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate and polycarbonate, and paper laminated with a barytes layer or an a-olefin polymer layer (e.g. polyethylene). These bases can have been coloured with dyes or pigments, for example titanium dioxide. They can also have been coloured black for the purposes of light shielding. The surface of the base is generally subjected to a treatment for improving the adhesion of the photographic emulsion layer, for example corona discharge with subsequent application of a substrate layer. The novel material preferably comprises the silver halide emulsion layers starting from the base, in the sequence blue-sensitive, green-sensitive and red-sensitive layer. In the novel colour photographic material the UV absorber is preferably in a layer above the green-sensitive layer, particularly preferably in a layer above the silver halide emulsion layer(s). The novel UV absorber is preferably present in the photographic material in an amount of from 0.001 to 10 g per m 2 , for example from 0.1 to 8 g/m 2 , especially from 0.005 to 6 and, in particular, from 0.01 to 4 g/m 2 . The novel colour photographic recording material is preferably a material having the following layer sequence: a a: Protective layer b b: Interlayer (may be absent) c c: Red-sensitive layer d d: Interlayer e e: Green-sensitive layer f f: Interlayer g g: Blue-sensitive layer h h: Base Another example is a material having a similar layer structure but in which layer a is absent. The novel UV absorber of the formula (I), in the layer sequence depicted, is present judiciously, for example, in at least one of layers a-e, preferably in layer a, b, c and/or d, especially in a, b and/or c, and in particular in a and/or b. Preference is generally given to a photographic recording material comprising a compound of the formula (I) in a layer above the silver halide emulsion layer(s). Preference is also given to photographic recording material comprising at least one each of a red-sensitive and green-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and, in between them, an interlayer, where at least one compound of the formula (I) is present in the interlayer between the red-sensitive and the green-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer. Very particularly preferred photographic recording material comprises at least one each of a red-sensitive, a green-sensitive and a blue-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and also at least two interlayers between the aforementioned layers and a protective layer, where at least one compound of the formula (I) is present in at least one layer above the green-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, and the silver halide emulsion layers contain dark-storage stabilizers and/or light stabilizers. Essential constituents of the colour-photographic emulsion layers are binders, silver halide particles and colour couplers. Of especial interest, for example, is a colour photographic recording material comprising. on a base, at least one blue-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing at least one yellow coupler, at least one green-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing at least one magenta coupler, at least one red-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing at least one cyan coupler, and customary top layer(s) and interlayer(s), at least one of the layers comprising a compound of the formula (I). The photographic emulsions can be spectrally sensitized using methine dyes or other dyes. Particularly suitable dyes are cyanine dyes and merocyanine dyes, including complex merocyanine dyes. An overview of the polymethine dyes which are suitable as spectral sensitizers, their appropriate combinations and supersensitizing combinations is given in Research Disclosure 17643 (Dec. 1978), Chapter IV. The differently sensitized emulsion layers are allocated non-diffusing monomeric or polymeric colour couplers, which may be located in the same layer or in an adjacent layer. It is common to assign cyan couplers to the red-sensitive layers, magenta couplers to the green-sensitive layers and yellow couplers to the blue-sensitive layers. Yellow couplers which can be used in the novel material are preferably compounds of the formula A in which R 1 is alkyl, cycloalkyl, arylamino, anilino, a heterocyclic group or aryl, R 2 is aryl and Q is hydrogen or a group which can be eliminated by reaction with the oxidized developer. Magenta couplers can, for example, be simple 1-aryl-5-pyrazolones, or pyrazole derivatives fused with 5-membered hetero-rings, for example imidazopyrazoles, pyrazolopyrazoles, pyrazolotriazoles or pyrazolotetrazoles. Cyan couplers can, for example, be derivatives of phenol, 1-naphthol, pyrazoloazole, pyrroloazole or of pyrazoloquinazolone. One group of cyan couplers is of the formula E in which R 21 , R 22 , R 23 and R 24 are hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, carbamoyl, amino, sulfonamido, phosphoramido or ureido. R 21 is preferably H or Cl, R 22 is preferably an alkyl or amino group. R 23 is preferably an amino group and R 24 is preferably hydrogen. Q is hydrogen (4-equivalent coupler) or a leaving group (2-equivalent coupler) which is eliminated on reaction with the oxidized developer. An exhaustive listing of cyan couplers can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,456,681. The cyan couplers employed in the red-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer of the novel material are preferably of the formula and/or of the formula in which Z 1 is alkyl, aryl, Z 2 is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, a heterocyclic group or a ballast group, Z 3 is hydrogen or halogen, Z 1 and Z 3 together can form a ring, and Z 4 is hydrogen or a leaving group, and Z 5 is a ballast group, Z6 is hydrogen or a leaving group and Z 7 is alkyl; and also those of the formulae E20 and/or E21 in which R 1 is preferably substituted phenyl and R 2 and R 3 are preferably H and X is preferably H or a group which is cleaved by reaction with the oxidized form of the developer, and in which Za is NH or CH(R 3 ); Zb and Zc independently of one another are C(R 4 ) or N; R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are each an electron-attracting group having a Hammett substituent constant p of at least 0.2, with the sum of the p values of R 1 and R 2 being at least 0.65; R 4 is H or a substituent, and if two R 4 s are present in the formula, they can be identical or different; and X is H or a group capable of elimination in the coupling reaction with the oxidation product of an aromatic primary amine as colour developer; or R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 or X is a divalent group by means of which the cyan coupler is able to form a dimer or higher polymer, or to react with a polymer chain to form a homo- or copolymer. Preference is given to a photographic material in which the red-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer comprises a cyan coupler of one of the formulae C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7 and C8 in which Z 1 is alkyl or aryl, Z 2 is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, a heterocyclic group or a ballast group, Z 3 is H or halogen, or Z 1 and Z 3 together form a ring, Z 4 is H or a leaving group, Z 5 is a ballast group, Z 6 is H or a leaving group, Z 7 is alkyl, Z 8 and Z 9 independently of one another are H or a substituent, at least one of the groups Z 8 and Z 9 being an electron-withdrawing group having a Hammett constant (- p ) of 0.15 or more Z 8 and Z 9 can be connected to one another to form a ring structure; Z 10 is a substituent and Z 11 is H or a leaving group. The cyan couplers can also be connected to one another by way of the radicals Z 8 , Z 9 , Z 10 or Z 11 to form dimers or polymers. Suitable leaving groups are in general those substituents which are set free after coupling with the oxidation product of a colour developer based on aromatic primary amines. The novel photographic material preferably comprises those cyan couplers of the formulae C1-C8 in which Z 1 is alkyl or aryl, Z 2 is alkyl, aryl, or a ballast group, Z 3 is H or halogen, Z 4 is H or a leaving group, Z 5 is a ballast group, Z 6 is H or a leaving group, Z 7 is alkyl, Z 8 and Z 9 independently of one another are CN, CF 3 , COOZ 12 , COZ 12 , SO 2 Z 12 , CON(Z 13 )Z 14 , SO 2 N(Z 13 )Z 14 , and Z 12 is unsubstituted alkyl or aryl, Z 13 and Z 14 independently of one another are unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, aryl, heterocyclyl, alkoxy, aryloxy or heterocyclyloxy, and Z 13 can also be H; Z 10 embraces the definitions given for Z 8 and Z 9 or is alkyl, aryl, heterocyclyl, nitro, NHCOZ 15 , N(Z 15 )Z 16 , NHCON(Z 15 )Z 16 , NHSO 2 N(Z 15 ), SZ 15 , NHCOOZ 15 , NHSO 2 N(Z 15 )Z 16 , SOZ 15 , and Z 15 and Z 16 are each a substituent, and Z 16 can also be H. The photographic layers in the novel material, especially the layers b, c and/or d in the colour photographic material described above by way of example, can preferably include further UV absorbers. Examples of such UV absorbers are benzotriazoles, 2-hydroxybenzophenones, oxanilides, cyanoacrylates, salicylic esters, acrylonitrile derivatives or thiazolines, and also conventional 2-hydroxyphenyltriazines. Such UV absorbers are described in more detail, for example, in the following publications: U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,314,794, 3,352,681, 3,705,805, 3,707,375, 4,045,229, 3,700,455, 3,700,458, 3,533,794, 3,698,907, 3,705,805, 3,738,837, 3,762,272, 4,163,671, 4,195,999, 4,309,500, 4,431,726, 4,443,543, 4,576,908, 4,749,643, 5,500,332, 5,455,152, GB-A-1,564,089, GB-A-2,293,608, EP-A-190,003, -747755, -717313 and JP-A-71/2784, 81/111,826, 81/27,146, 88/53,543, 88/55,542 and 96/69087. Preferred UV absorbers are benzotriazoles, especially 2-(2-hydroxy-phenyl)benzotriazoles. Preference is also given to photographic recording material comprising in addition a UV absorber, not of the formula (I), from the series of the 2-hydroxyphenyltriazines, as are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,300,414, U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,503, U.S. Pat. No. 5,480,108, U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,978, EP-A-706083, JP-A han 08-267915 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,749. The amount of the additional UV absorber or absorbers added is judiciously within the same range as indicated above for the novel UV absorbers. Examples of particularly suitable compounds are: 2-Hydroxyphenyltriazines of the formula in which j is 0, 1, 2 or 3; G 1 is alkyl, alkenyl or cycloalkyl; G 2 and G 6 independently of one another are H, OH, halogen, alkyl, halomethyl, for example CF 3 ; G 3 , G 5 and G 7 independently of one another are H, OH, OG 1 , halogen, alkyl, halomethyl, for example CF 3 ; G 4 is H, OH, OG 1 , halogen, alkyl, phenyl, halomethyl, for example CF 3 , or alkenyl; and G 12 is alkyl, phenylalkyl, cycloalkyl, OG 1 , or in particular, a group of the formula Alkyl or alkenyl substituents, or substituents which are aromatic or aliphatic ring systems, usually containwithin the context of the stated definitionsfrom 1 to 50 carbon atoms and can be interrupted one or more times by O, S, NR, SO 2 , CO, phenylene, cyclohexylene, COO, OCO, (SiR p R q O) and/or substituted one or more times by OH, OR, NRR, halogen, CN, alkenyl, phenyl, SiR p R q R r or COOH, where R and R independently of one another are H, alkyl, alkenyl or acyl, and R p , R q and R r independently of one another are H, alkyl, alkenyl, phenyl, alkoxy, acyl or acyloxy. The abovementioned groups can also carry other substituents as well. Dimers or polymers are also possible. Preferred 2-hydroxyphenyltriazines of this class are, for example, those of the formula where, in formula AIII n is 1 or 2 and G 1 , if n1, is alkyl which is uninterrupted and unsubstituted or is interrupted by one or more O and/or substituted by one or more of the radicals OH, glycidyloxy, alkenoxy, COOH, COOR e , OCOR f , or is alkenyl, cycloalkyl, unsubstituted or OH, Cl or CH 3 -substituted phenylalkyl; or COR g ; SO 2 R h ; CH 2 CH(OH)R j ; where R e is alkyl; alkenyl; hydroxyalkyl; alkyl or hydroxyalkyl interrupted by one or more O; cycloalkyl; benzyl; alkylphenyl; phenyl; phenylalkyl; furfuryl; or CH 2 CH(OH)R j ; R f , R g independently of one another are alkyl, alkenyl or phenyl; R h is alkyl, aryl or alkylaryl; R j is aralkyl or CH 2 OR k ; R k is cyclohexyl, phenyl, tolyl or benzyl; and G 1 , if n2, is alkylene; alkenylene; xylylene; alkylene or hydroxyalkylene interrupted by one or more O; hydroxyalkylene; G 2 and G 2 independently of one another are H, alkyl or OH; G 4 and G 4 independently of one another are H, alkyl, OH, alkoxy, halogen, and, if n1, OG 1 ; G 3 and G 3 independently of one another are H, alkyl or halogen; and where, in formula A V, R 101 is H, C 1 -C 8 alkyl, C 1 -C 8 alkoxy; R 102 and R 103 independently of one another are H, halogen, OH, C 1 -C 8 alkyl, C 1 -C 8 alkoxy; R 104 is H, OH, C 1 -C 8 alkyl; C 1 -C 8 alkoxy. Within the scope of the stated definitions G 1 , G 2 , G 2 , G 3 , G 3 , G 4 and G 4 may also carry additional substituents, for example an ethylenically unsaturated, polymerizable group.

No. 5,580,710 or U.S. Pat. No. 5,543,276. Examples of particularly suitable compounds are: Further details on the structure of colour photographic material, and the components which can be employed in the novel material, can be found, inter alia, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,538,840, column 27, line 25, to column 106, line 16, and in the publications cited therein; these passages of U.S. Pat. No. 5,538,840 are hereby incorporated by reference. Further important components, especially couplers, are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,437. The present invention additionally provides a method of stabilizing photographic recording material comprising, on a base, at least one silver-halide emulsion layer and, if desired, at least one interlayer and/or one protective layer, which comprises adding a UV absorber of the formula (I) to at least one of the said layers. The present invention also provides for the use of compounds of the formula (I) for stabilizing photographic recording material comprising, on a base, at least one silver halide emulsion layer and, if desired, at least one interlayer and/or one protective layer. The preferences described earlier above in connection with the novel compounds of the formula (I) apply analogously to the novel compositions, the novel method and the novel use. Incorporation into the organic material to be stabilized can take place, for example, by mixing or applying the compounds of the formula I and any other additives by methods customary in the art. Where the materials are polymers, especially synthetic polymers, incorporation can take place prior to or during shaping, or by applying the dissolved or dispersed compound to the polymer, with or without subsequent evaporation of the solvent. In the case of elastomers, these can also be stabilized as latices. A further option for incorporating the compounds of the formula I into polymers is to add them prior to, during or directly after the polymerization of the corresponding monomers and/or prior to crosslinking. In this context the compounds of the formula I can be added as they are or else in encapsulated form (for example in waxes, oils or polymers). In the case of addition prior to or during polymerization the compounds of the formula I may also act as a regulator of the chain length of the polymers (chain terminators). The compounds of the formula I can also be added in the form of a masterbatch which contains this compound, for example, in a concentration of from 2.5 to 25% by weight, to the polymers that are to be stabilized. The compounds of the formula I can judiciously be incorporated by the following methods: as an emulsion or dispersion (e.g. to latices or emulsion polymers), as a dry mix during the mixing in of additional components or polymer mixtures, by direct addition to the processing apparatus (e.g. extruders, internal mixers etc.) as a solution or melt. The stabilized polymer compositions obtained in this way can be converted into shaped articles, for example into fibres, films, tapes, sheets, sandwich boards, vessels, pipes and other profiles, by the customary methods, for example by hot pressing, spinning, extrusion or injection moulding. The invention therefore also provides for the use of the novel polymer composition for producing a shaped article.

The mixtures are extruded at 200-230 C. to granules; these granules are subsequently processed to fibres using a pilot plant (Leonard; Sumirago/VA, Italy) under the following conditions: Extruder temperature: 190-230 C. Head temperature: 255-260 C. Draw ratio: 1:3.5 Drawing temperature: 100 C. Fibres: 10 den The fibres prepared in this way are exposed against a white background in a Weather-O-Meter Type 65 WR (Atlas Corp.) with a black standard temperature of 63 C. in accordance with ASTM D 2565-85. After different exposure times the residual tensile strength of the samples is measured. From the measurements the exposure time T 50 after which the tensile strength of the samples has fallen to half its signal level is calculated. For comparison purposes, fibres without novel stabilizer are produced and tested under otherwise identical conditions. The fibres stabilized in accordance with the invention exhibit outstanding strength retention.

The clearcoat is diluted with Solvesso 100 to spray viscosity and is sprayed onto a prepared aluminum panel (Uniprime, light green metallic basecoat) and stoved at 130 C. for 30 minutes, to give a dry film thickness of 40-50 mm of clearcoat. The samples are then weathered in an UVCON weathering instrument from Atlas Corp. (UVB-313 Lamps) with a cycle of 8 h of UV irradiation at 70 C. and 4 h of condensation at 50 C. The surface gloss (20 gloss, DIN 67530) of the samples is measured at regular intervals. The results are compiled in the table below. Tab.

Example B3 Facility for Incorporation into Photographic Layers A gelatin coat of the following composition (per m 2 ) is applied in the customary manner to a polyester base. Components: Amount: Gelatin 1200 mg Tricresyl phosphate 510 mg Hardener 40 mg Wetting agent 100 mg Comp. of formula I 400 mg The hardener is: potassium salt of 2-hydroxy-4,6-dichloro-1,3,5-triazine. The wetting agent is sodium 4,8-diisobutyinaphthalene-2-sulfonate. The gelatin coats are dried at 20 C. for 7 days. When the novel compound 2 is used, clear transparent coats are obtained which are suitable for a photographic recording material for example as a UV filter coat. Example B4 A polyethylene-coated Base Material is Coated with a Gelatin Coat Comprising Silver Bromide and Magenta Coupler (M-9) of the Formula The gelatin coat includes the following components (per m 2 of base material): Component AgBr coat Gelatin 5.15 g Hardener 300 mg Wetting agent 85 mg Silver bromide 260 mg Magenta coupler 325 mg Tricresyl phosphate 162 mg The hardener used is the potassium salt of 2,4-dichloro-6-hydroxytriazine; the wetting agent used is the sodium salt of diisobutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid. A step wedge having a density difference of 0.3 log E per step is exposed onto each of the resulting samples, which are then processed in accordance with the manufacturers instructions in the P94 processing process of Agfa Gevaert for negative colour papers. After exposure and processing, the density of reflectance in the green region for the magenta stage is measured at a density of between 0.9 and 1.1 of the wedge. A UV absorber filter comprising the compound 11 is prepared on transparent base material as described in Example B3. The wedge is subsequently exposed behind the UV absorber filter in an Atlas exposure instrument at 15 kJ/cm 2 and the reflectance density is measured again. The magenta dye density loss (-D) is greatly reduced by the compound 11 as stabilizer in comparison with the sample containing no stabilizer. Example B5 The procedure described in Example B3 is repeated but using a mixture of 2 parts by weight of the compound No. 1 and 1 part by weight of HPT 7.

No. 1 (385 mg) without UV absorber: gelatin (800 mg) The hardener used is 2,4-dichloro-6-hydroxytriazine K salt solution, the wetting agent is the sodium salt of diisobutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid. Three step wedges with a density difference of 0.3 log E per step are exposed onto each of the samples (with blue, green and red light, respectively). Then the processing process RA-4 (Kodak) for colour papers is carried out. After exposure and processing, the reflectance densities in the red for the cyan step, in the green for the magenta step and in the blue for the yellow step are measured at a density of between 0.9 and 1.1 of the wedges. The wedges are then exposed in an Atlas exposure instrument at a total of 15 kJ/cm 2 , and the reflectance densities are measured again. In the case of the magenta wedge as well, the reflectance density before and after exposure is measured in the blue for the yellowing. The presence of the UV absorbers reduces the dye density loss of the cyan, magenta and yellow image dye. Example B7 Use in Cosmetics A sun protection cream is prepared using the phases A, B and C described in the following tables: Phase A Ceteareth-6 (and) stearyl alcohol 2% Ceteareth-25 2% Cetearyl alcohol 5% Caprylic/capric triglyceride 5% Cetearyl octanoate 10% Vaseline 5% Compound No. 11 4% Phase B Propylene glycol 3.0% Carbopol 934 0.2% H 2 O 63.53% Phase C Triethanolamine 0.27% The percentages indicated relate to the overall weight of the mixture comprising the phases A, B and C; the given names of the additives, where they are not chemical names, are CTFA designations (Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, USA). Phases A and B are heated separately to 75-80 C. Then first phase B and subsequently phase C are added to phase A with homogenization. Subsequent homogenization is carried out. An SPF analyser SPF 290 (Manufacturer: Optometrix) is used to determine the light protection factor and UVA/UVB ratio of the resulting emulsion in accordance with the method of Diffey and Robson, J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem. 40, 127-133 (1989); the light protection factor is 6, the UVA/UVB ratio 0.87. Use of compound No. 12 instead of compound No. 11 leads to a similar result.

TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to the field of antivirals and in particular to derivatives of acyclic nucleosides useful against herpes and retroviral infections and methods for their manufacture and novel intermediates. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The practical utility of many acyclic nucleosides is limited by their relatively modest pharmacokinetics. A number of prodrug approaches have been explored in an effort to improve the bioavailability of acyclic nucleosides in general. One of these approaches involves the preparation of ester derivatives, particularly aliphatic esters, of one or more of the hydroxy groups on the acyclic side chain. European patent EP 165 289 describes the promising antiherpes agent 9-4-hydroxy-(2-hydroxymethyl)butylguanine, otherwise known as H2G. European patent EP 186 640 discloses 6-deoxy H2G. European patent EP 343 133 discloses that these compounds, particularly the R-() enantiomer, are additionally active against retroviral infections such as HIV. Various derivatives of H2G, such as phosphonates, aliphatic esters (for example, the diacetate and the dipropionate) and ethers of the hydroxy groups on the acyclic side chain are disclosed in EP 343 133. This patent also discloses methods for the preparation of these derivatives comprising the condensation of the acyclic side chain to the N-9 position of a typically 6-halogenated purine moiety or, alternatively, the imidazole ring closure of a pyrimidine or furazano-3,4-d-pyrimidine moeity or the pyrimidine ring closure of an imidazole moiety, where the acyclic side chain is already present in the precursor pyrimidine or imidazole moiety, respectively. In the broadest description of each of these methods the acyclic side chain is pre-derivatised but individual examples also show a one-step diacylation of H2G with acetic or proprionic anhydride and DMF. Harnden, et al., J. Med. Chem. 32, 1738 (1989) investigated a number of short chain aliphatic esters of the acyclic nucleoside 9-4-hydroxy-(3-hydroxymethyl)butylguanine, otherwise known as penciclovir, and its 6-deoxy analog. Famciclovir, a marketed antiviral agent, is the diacetyl derivative of 6-deoxy penciclovir. Benjamin, et al., Pharm. Res. 4 No. 2, 120 (1987) discloses short chain aliphatic esters of 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)-methylguanine, otherwise known as ganciclovir. The dipropionate ester is disclosed to be the preferred ester. Lake-Bakaar, et al., discloses in Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 33 No. 1, 110-112 (1989) diacetate and dipropionate derivatives of H2G and monoacetate and diacetate derivatives of 6-deoxy H2G. The diacetate and dipropionate derivatives of H2G are reported to result in only modest improvements in bioavailability relative to H2G. International patent application WO94/24134, published Oct. 27, 1994, discloses aliphatic ester prodrugs of the 6-deoxy N-7 analog of ganciclovir, including the di-pivaloyl, di-valeroyl, mono-valeroyl, mono-oleoyl and mono-stearoyl esters. International patent application WO93/07163, published Apr. 15, 1993 and International patent application WO94/22887, published Oct. 13, 1994, both disclose mono-ester derivatives of nucleoside analogs derived from mono-unsaturated C18 or C20 fatty acids. U.S. Pat. No. 5,216,142, issued Jun. 1, 1993, also discloses long chain fatty acid mono-ester derivatives of nucleoside analogs. A second approach to providing prodrugs of acyclic nucleosides involves the preparation of amino acid esters of one or more of the hydroxy groups on the acyclic side chain. European patent EP 99 493 discloses generally amino acid esters of acyclovir and European patent application EP 308 065, published Mar. 22, 1989, discloses the valine and isoleucine esters of acyclovir. European patent application EP 375 329, published Jun. 27, 1990, discloses amino acid ester derivatives of ganciclovir, including the di-valine, di-isoleucine, di-glycine and di-alanine ester derivatives. International patent application WO95/09855, published Apr. 13, 1995, discloses amino acid ester derivatives of penciclovir, including the mono-valine and di-valine ester derivatives. DE 19526163, published Feb. 1, 1996 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,543,414 issued Aug. 6, 1996, disclose achiral amino acid esters of ganciclovir. European patent application EP 694 547, published Jan. 31, 1996, discloses the mono-L-valine ester of ganciclovir and its preparation from di-valyl-ganciclovir. European patent application EP 654 473, published May 24, 1995, discloses various bis amino acid ester derivatives of 9-(1,2-bishydroxymethyl)-cyclopropan-1ylmethylguanine. International patent application WO95/22330, published Aug. 24, 1995, discloses aliphatic esters, amino acid esters and mixed acetate/valinate esters of the acyclic nucleoside 9-3,3-dihydroxymethyl-4-hydroxy-but-1-ylguanine. This reference discloses that bioavailability is reduced when one of the valine esters of the trivaline ester derivative is replaced with an acetate ester. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION We have found that diester derivatives of H2G bearing specific combinations of an amino acid ester and a fatty acid ester are able to provide significantly improved oral bioavailability relative to the parent compound (H2G). In accordance with a first aspect of the invention there is thus provided novel compounds of the formula I wherein a) R 1 is C(O)CH(CH(CH 3 ) 2 )NH 2 or C(O)CH(CH(CH 3 )CH 2 CH 3 )NH 2 and R 2 is C(O)C 3 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl; or b) R 1 is C(O)C 3 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl and R 2 is C(O)CH(CH(CH 3 ) 2 )NH 2 or C(O)CH(CH(CH 3 )CH 2 CH 3 )NH 2 ; and R 3 is OH or H; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The advantageous effect on oral bioavailability of the mixed fatty acid and amino acid esters of the invention is particularly unexpected in comparison to the oral bioavailability of the corresponding fatty acid esters. Based on the results using a urinary recovery assay (Table 1A) or a plasma drug assay (Table 1B) of H2G from rats, neither the mono or di-fatty acid esters of H2G provide any improvement in oral bioavailability relative to the parent compound H2G. Indeed the di-stearate derivative provided significantly lower bioavailability than the parent, indicating that a stearate ester may be detrimental for improving oral bioavailability of H2G. Converting one or both of the hydroxyls in certain other acyclic nucleoside analogues to the corresponding valine or di-valine ester has been reported to improve bioavailability. Conversion of H2G to the coresponding mono- or di-valyl ester derivatives produced similar improvement in bioavailability relative to the parent compound. Given that fatty acid derivatives of H2G are shown to be detrimental for improving bioavailability, it was unexpected that a mixed amino acid/fatty acid diester derivative of H2G would provide improved or comparable oral bioavailability to that of the valine diester derivative of H2G, based on urine recovery and plasma drug assays, respectively.

Further aspects of the invention include the compounds of Formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts for use in therapy and the use of these compounds and salts in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of viral infection in humans or animals. The compounds of the invention are potent antivirals, especially against herpes infections, such as those caused by Varicella zoster virus, Herpes simplex virus types 1 2, Epstein-Barr virus, Herpes type 6 (HHV-6) and type 8 (HHV-8). The compounds are particularly useful against Varicella zoster virus infections such as shingles in the elderly including post herpetic neuralgia or chicken pox in the young where the duration and severity of the disease can be reduced by several days. Epstein Barr virus infections amenable to treatment with the compounds include infectious mononucleosis/glandular fever which has previously not been treatable but which can cause many months of scholastic incapacity amongst adolescents.

Accordingly a further aspect of the invention provides a method for the prophylaxis or treatment of a viral infection in humans or animals comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of Formula I or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt to the human or animal. Advantageously group R 3 is hydroxy or its tautomer O so that the base portion of the compounds of the invention is the naturally occuring guanine, for instance in the event that the side chain is cleaved in vivo.

Hydrochloric acid salts are convenient. The compounds of Formula I may be isolated as the hydrate. The compounds of the invention may be isolated in crystal form, preferably homogenous crystals, and thus an additional aspect of the invention provides the compounds of Formula I in substantially pure crystalline form, comprising 70%, preferably 90% homogeneous crystalline material, for example 95% homogeneous crystalline material. The compounds of the invention are particularly suited to oral administration, but may also be administered rectally, vaginally, nasally, topically, transdermally or parenterally, for instance intramuscularly, intravenously or epidurally. The compounds may be administered alone, for instance in a capsule, but will generally be administered in conjunction with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The invention extends to methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising bringing a compound of Formula I or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt in conjunction or association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle. Oral formulations are conveniently prepared in unit dosage form, such as capsules or tablets, employing conventional carriers or binders such as magnesium stearate, chalk, starch, lactose, wax, gum or gelatin. Liposomes or synthetic or natural polymers such as HPMC or PVP may be used to afford a sustained release formulation. Alternatively the formulation may be presented as a nasal or eye drop, syrup, gel or cream comprising a solution, suspension, emulsion, oil-in-water or water-in-oil preparation in conventional vehicles such as water, saline, ethanol, vegetable oil or glycerine, optionally with flavourant and/or preservative and/or emulsifier. The compounds of the invention may be administered at a daily dose generally in the range 0.1 to 200 mg/kg/day, advantageously, 0.5 to 100 mg/kg/day, more preferably 10 to 50 mg/kg/day, such as 10 to 25 mg/kg/day. A typical dosage rate for a normal adult will be around 50 to 500 mg, for example 300 mg, once or twice per day for herpes infections and 2 to 10 times this dosage for HIV infections. As is prudent in antiviral therapy, the compounds of the invention can be administered in combination with other antiviral agents, such as acyclovir, valcyclovir, penciclovir, famciclovir, ganciclovir and its prodrugs, cidofovir, foscarnet and the like for herpes indications and AZT, ddl, ddC, d4T, 3TC, foscarnet, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, delaviridine, Vertex VX 478, Agouron AG1343 and the like for retroviral indications. The compounds of the invention can be prepared de novo or by esterification of the H2G parent compound which is prepared, for example, by the synthesis methodology disclosed in European Patent EP 343 133, which is incorporated herein by reference. A typical reaction scheme for the preparation of H2G is depicted below: The condensation in step 1 is typically carried out with a base catalyst such as NaOH or Na 2 CO 3 in a solvent such as DMF. Step 2 involves a reduction which can be performed with LiBH 4 /tetrahydrofuran in a solvent such as t-BuOH. The substitution in step 3 of the chlorine with an amino group can be performed under pressure with ammonia. Step 4 employs adenosine deaminase which can be conveniently immobilized on a solid support. Cooling the reaction mixture allows unreacted isomeric precursor to remain in solution thereby enhancing purity. Starting materials for compounds of the invention in which R 3 is hydrogen may be prepared as shown in European Patent EP 186 640, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. These starting materials may be acylated as described for H2G below, optionally after protecting the purine 2-amino group with a conventional N-protecting group as defined above, especially BOC (tBuOCO), Z (BnOCO) or Ph 3 C. The compounds of the invention may be prepared from H2G as described below in Schemes A and B. A. Direct Acylation Method Scheme A depicts the preparation of compounds in which R 1 is derived from the amino acid and R 2 is derived from the fatty acid, but the converse scheme is applicable to compounds where R 1 is derived from the fatty acid and R 2 is derived from the amino acid ester. In the variant specifically depicted in scheme A above, G is guanine or 6-deoxyguanine, PG is an optional N-protecting group or hydrogen, R 1 * is the valine or isoleucine side chain and R 2 * is the fatty acid chain. H2G is depicted above as a starting material but this of course may be optionally protected at R 3 or the 2 position of the purine with conventional N-protecting groups (not shown). The H2G (derivative) reacts in the first step with an activated R 1 -amino acid derivative, as further described below, in a solvent such as dimethylformamide or pyridine, to give a monoacylated product. The R 1 -amino acid may be suitably N-protected with N-BOC or N-CBz or the like. Under controlled conditions, the first acylation can be made to predominantly take place at the side chain 4-hydroxy group on the side chain of H2G. These controlled conditions can be achieved, for example, by manipulating the reagent concentrations or rate of addition, especially of the acylating agent, by lowering the temperature or by the choice of solvent. The reaction can be followed by TLC to monitor the controlled conditions. After purification, the R 1 monoacylated compounds are further acylated on the side chain 2-CH 2 OH group with the appropriate activated fatty acid derivative to give diacylated products using similar procedures as for the first esterification step. The diester products are subsequently subjected to a conventional deprotection treatment using for example trifluoroacetic acid, HCl(aq)/dioxane or hydrogenation in the presence of catalyst to give the desired compound of Formula I. The compound may be in salt form depending on the deprotection conditions. The activated R 1 /R 2 acid derivative used in the various acylations may comprise e.g. the acid halide, acid anhydride, activated acid ester or the acid in the presence of coupling reagent, for example dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, where acid in each case represents the corresponding R 1 /R 2 amino acid or the R 1 /R 2 fatty acid. Representative activated acid derivatives include the acid chloride, formic and acetic acid derived mixed anhydrides, anhydrides derived from alkoxycarbonyl halides such as isobutyloxycarbonylchloride and the like, N-hydroxysuccinamide derived esters, N-hydroxyphthalimide derived esters, N-hydroxy-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxamide derived esters, 2,4,5-trichlorophenol derived esters, sulfonic acid derived anhydrides (for example, p-toluenesulonic acid derived anhydrides and the like) and the like. B. Via Protection of the Chain 4-hydroxy Group wherein G, PG, R 1 * and R 2 * are as described for scheme A. Scheme B has been exemplified with reference to the preparation of a compound where R 1 is derived from an amino acid and R 2 is derived from the fatty acid ester, but a converse scheme will be applicable to compounds where R 2 is derived from the amino acid and R 1 is derived from the fatty acid. This scheme relies on regioselective protection of the H2G side chain 4-hydroxy group with a bulky protecting group. In scheme B above this is depicted as t-butyldiphenylsilyl, but other regioselective protecting groups such as trityl, 9-(9-phenyl)xanthenyl, 1,1-bis(4-methylphenyl)-1-pyrenylmethyl may also be appropriate. The resulting product is acylated at the side chain 2-hydroxymethyl group using analogous reagents and procedures as described in scheme A above, but wherein the activated acid derivative is the R 2 fatty acid, for example, myristic, stearic, oleic, elaidic acid chloride and the like. The thus monoacylated compounds are subjected to appropriate deprotection treatment to remove the side chain 4-hydroxy protecting group which can be done in a highly selective manner with such reagents, depending on the regioselective protecting group, as HF/pyridine and the like and manipulation of the reaction conditions, viz reagent concentration, speed of addition, temperature and solvent etc, as elaborated above. The then free side chain 4-hydroxy group is acylated with the activated -amino acid in a similar way as described in scheme A above. Additional techniques for introducing the amino acid ester of R 1 /R 2 , for instance in schemes A, B, C, D or E herein include the 2-oxa-4-aza-cycloalkane-1,3-dione method described in International patent application No. WO 94/29311. Additional techniques for introducing the fatty acid ester of R 1 /R 2 , for instance in schemes A, B, C, D or E herein include the enzymatic route described in Preparative Biotransformations 1.11.8 (Ed S M Roberts, J Wiley and Son, NY, 1995) with a lipase such as SP 435 immobilized Candida antarcticus (Novo Nordisk), porcine pancreatic lipase or Candida rugosa lipase. Enzymatic acylation is especially convenient where it is desired to avoid N-protection and deprotection steps on the other acyl group or the purine 2-amine. An alternative route to compounds of Formula I in which R 3 is hydrogen is to 6-activate the correponding guanine compound of Formula I (wherein the amino acid ester moiety of R 1 /R 2 is optionally protected with conventional N-protecting groups such as BOC) with an activating group such as halo. The thus activated 6-purine is subsequently reduced to purine, for instance with a palladium catalyst and deprotected to the desired 6-deoxy H2G di-ester. A further aspect of the invention thus provides a method for the preparation of the compounds of formula I comprising a) optionally N-protecting the purine 2 and/or 6 positions of a compound of formula I wherein R 1 and R 2 are each hydrogen; b) regioselectively acylating the compound of Formula I at the side chain 4-hydroxy group with either i) an optionally N-protected valine or isoleucine group, ii) an optionally substituted, saturated or monounsaturated C 3 -C 21 COOH derivative, or iii) a regioselective protecting group; c) acylating at the side chain 2-hydroxymethyl group with i) an optionally N-protected valine or isoleucine derivative, or ii) an optionally substituted, saturated or monounsaturated C 3 -C 21 COOH derivative; d) replacing the regioselective protecting group at R 1 , if present, with i) an optionally N-protected valine or isoleucine derivative; or ii) an optionally substituted, saturated or monounsaturated C 3 -C 21 COOH derivative; and e) deprotecting the resulting compound as necessary. Schemes A and B above employ selective acylation to stepwise add the amino acid and fatty acid esters. An alternative process for the preparation of the compounds of formula I starts with a diacylated H2G derivative, wherein both the acyl groups are the same, and employs selective removal of one of the acyl groups to obtain a monoacyl intermediate which is then acylated with the second, differing, acyl group in the same manner as Schemes A and B above. Accordingly a further aspect of the invention provides a method for the preparation of a compound of the formula I, as defined above, which method comprises A) the monodeacylation of a diacylated compound corresponding to formula I wherein R 1 and R 2 are both a valyl or isoleucyl ester (which is optionally N-protected) or wherein R 1 and R 2 are both C(O)C 3 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl; and B) acylating the thus liberated side chain 4-hydroxy or side chain 2-hydroxymethyl group with the corresponding valyl, isoleucyl or C(O)C 3 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl; and C) deprotecting as necessary. This alternative process has the advantage that the preparation of the diacylated H2G derivative is facile and requires little or no purification steps. Selective removal of one only of the acyl groups of a diacylated H2G derivative can be achieved by manipulating the reaction conditions, in particular the temperature, rate of reactant addition and choice of base. Compounds amenable to this alternative synthesis route are thus of the formula: wherein R 1 and R 2 are valyl or isoleucyl (which are optionally N-protected) or a C(O)C 3 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl; and R 3 is OH or H. For ease of synthesis in this alternative route, it is preferred that R 1 and R 2 are both initially identical and are most preferably the same amino acid ester. Such a di-amino acid ester will generally be N-protected during its preparation and may be used directly in this condition in the selective deacylation step. Alternatively, such an N-protected di-aminoacylated H2G derivative may be deprotected and optionally reprotected, as described below. The unprotected di-aminoacyl H2G derivative thus comprises one of the following compounds: (R)-9-2-(L-isoleucyloxymethyl)-4-(L-isoleucyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-(L-valyloxymethyl)-4-(L-valyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-2-amino-9-4-(L-isoleucyloxy)-2-(L-isoleucyloxymethyl)butylpurine, and (R)-2-amino-9-4-(L-valyloxy)-2-(L-valyloxymethyl)butylpurine. These unprotected H2G diacylated derivatives can be directly subject to selective deacylation of one of the acyl groups (typically the side chain 4-position acyl) followed by enzymatic acylation of the liberated 4-hydroxy as described above. Alternatively, the unprotected H2G diacylated derivative can be re-protected and then subjected to the selective deacylation, followed in turn by conventional acylation with the fatty acid ester, as described in Schemes A and B. Conveniently, such a reprotection step is done with a different N-protecting group, having properties appropriate to the subsequent acylation. For example, it is convenient to employ a lipophilic N-protecting group, such as Fmoc when preparing a di-amino acid H2G derivative, as the lipophilic nature of the protecting group assists with separation of the acylated products. On the other hand, the lipophilic nature of Fmoc is of less utility when conducting an acylation with a fatty acid, and thus it is convenient to reprotect a diacylated H2G with an alternative N-protecting group such as BOC. It will also be apparent that the preparation of the compounds of formula I can commence with the novel monoacylated intermediates of step b i), ii) or iii) in the above defined first method aspect of the invention. These compounds are thus of the formula: wherein one of R 1 and R 2 is i) C(O)CH(CH(CH 3 ) 2 )NH 2 or C(O)CH(CH(CH 3 )CH 2 CH 3 )NH 2 , ii) a C(O)C 3 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl, or iii) a regioselective protecting group; the other of R 1 and R 2 is hydrogen; and R 3 is OH or H. Useful compounds thus include: (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(t-butyldiphenylsilyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(trityloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(9-(9-phenyl)xanthenyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(1,1-bis(4-methylphenyl)-1-pyrenylmethyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(decanoyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl)-4-(dodecanoyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(tetradecanoyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl)-4-(hexadecanoyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(octadecanoyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl)-4-(eicosanoyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(docosanoyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(decanoyloxymethyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(dodecanoyloxymethyl) butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(tetradecanoyloxymethyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(hexadecanoyloxymethyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(octadecanoyloxymethyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(eicosanoyloxymethyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(docosanoyloxymethyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(L-valyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl)-4-(L-isoleucyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(L-isoleucyloxymethyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(L-valyloxymethyl) butylguanine. (R)-2-amino-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(L-valyloxy)butylpurine, (R)-2-amino-9-2-hydroxymethyl)-4-(L-isoleucyloxy)butylpurine, (R)-2-amino-9-4-hydroxy-2-(L-isoleucyloxymethyl)butylpurine, and (R)-2-amino-9-4-hydroxy-2-(L-valyloxymethyl)butylpurine. Regioselectively protected, sidechain 4-hydroxy intermediates from step c) of the above described first method aspect of the invention are also novel compounds. Useful compounds thus include: (R)-9-2-decanoyloxymethyl-4-(t-butyldiphenylsilyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-dodecanoyloxymethyl-4-(t-butyldiphenylsilyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-tetradecanoyloxymethyl-4-(t-butyldiphenylsilyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hexadecanoyloxymethyl-4-(t-butyldiphenylchlorosilane)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-octadecanoyloxymethyl-4-(t-butyldiphenylsilyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-eicosanoyloxymethyl-4-(t-butyldiphenylsilyl)butylguanine, and (R)-9-2-docosanoyloxymethyl-4-(t-butyldiphenylsilyl)butylguanine. An alternative process for the preparation of compounds of the invention of the formula I wherein R 3 is OH is shown in Scheme C. Referring to Scheme C, malonate 1 (R 4 and R 5 are lower alkyl or benzyl or the like) is alkylated by reaction with from about 0.5 to about 2.0 molar equivalents of acetal 2 (R 6 and R 7 are lower alkyl or benzyl and the like or R 6 and R 7 taken together are CH 2 CH 2 or CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 or CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 and X 1 is a leaving group (for example, Cl, Br or l, or a sulfonate such as methanesulfonate, triflate, p-toluenesulfonate, benzenesulfonate and the like)) in the presence of from about 0.5 to about 2.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example, potassium t-butoxide or sodium ethoxide or NaH or KH and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, DMF or THF or dioxane or dioxolane or N-methylpyrrolidone and the like) at a temperature of from about 40 C. to about 190 C. to provide alkylated malonate 3. Alkylated malonate 3 can be purified by distillation or by first treating the crude alkylated malonate with dilute aqueous base (for example, 7% aqueous KOH), followed by removal of volatile impurities by distillation. Reduction of 3 with from about 0.5 to about 4.0 molar equivalents of an ester to alcohol reducing agent (for example, LiBH 4 or Ca(BH 4 ) 2 or NaBH 4 or LiAlH 4 and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or methyl t-butyl ether or t-BuOH and the like) at a temperature of from about 20 C. to about 100 C. provides diol 4. Enzymatic esterification of 4 by reaction with from about 1.0 to about 20.0 molar equivalents of a vinyl ester 5 (R 8 is C 1 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl) in the presence of a lipase (for example, Lipase PS-30 or Lipase PPL or Lipase CCL and the like) or a phospholipase (for example phospholipase D and the like) provides the desired stereoisomer of ester 6. This reaction can be carried out in the absence of solvent or in the presence of an inert solvent (for example, methyl t-butyl ether or toluene or hexane and the like). The reaction is carried out at a temperature of from about 20 C. to about 80 C. The alcohol substituent of 6 is converted to a leaving group (for example, a halogen or a sulfonate) by reaction with a halogenating agent (for example NBS/P(Ph) 3 or NCS/P(Ph) 3 or POCl 3 or NCS/P(Ph) 3 /Nal in acetone and like) in an inert solvent (for example, methylene chloride or toluene or ethylacetate and the like) or by reaction with from about 0.8 molar equivalents to about 2.0 molar equivalents of a sulfonyl halide (for example, benzenesulfonylchloride, toluenesulfonylchloride or methane sulfonylchloride and the like) in the presence of from about 1.0 to about 4.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example, triethylamine or potassium carbonate or pyridine or dimethylaminopyridine or ethyldiisopropylamine and the like) in an inert solvent (for example methylene chloride or toluene or ethylacetate or pyridine or methyl t-butyl ether and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. to provide ester 7 (X 2 is a halogen or sulfonate leaving group). Reaction of 7 with from about 0.9 to about 2.0 molar equivalents of 2-amino-6-chloropurine 8 in the presence of from about 1.0 to about 6.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example, potassium carbonate or LiH or NaH or KH or NaOH or KOH or lithium diisopropylamide or LiN(Si(CH 3 ) 3 ) 2 and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, DMF or THF or acetonitrile or N-methylpyrrolidone or ethanol or DMSO and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 140 C. provides substituted purine 9. Alternatively, the base can be a sterically bulky amine base (for example, 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-diazabicyclo2.2.2octane (Dabco), 1,5-diazabicyclo4.3.0non-5-ene (DBN), tetramethylguanidine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine and the like) or a sterically bulky phosphazine base (for example, tert-butylimino-tri(pyrrolidino)-phosphorane, tert-butylimino-tri(dimethylamino)phosphorane, tert-octylimino-tri(dimethylamino)phosphorane and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or DMF or DMSO and the like). Alternatively Mitsunobu coupling (for example P(Ph) 3 /diethyl azidocarboxylate) of alcohol 6 with 2-amino-6-chloropurine 8 provides 9. Reaction of 9 with from about 2.0 to about 20 molar equivalents of an alcohol R 9 OH (R 9 is an alcohol protecting group such as benzyl or diphenylmethyl and the like) in the presence of from about 1.0 to about 6.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example, potassium t-butoxide or potassium carbonate or NaH or KH or lithium diisopropylamide and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or DMF and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 150 C. provides alcohol 10. Removal of the alcohol protecting group R 9 of 10 (for example, by catalytic hydrogenation in an inert solvent such as ethanol or benzyl alcohol or methanol or THF and the like in the presence of an hydrogenation catalyst such as Pd/C or Pd(OH) 2 and the like) provides substituted guanine 11. Esterification of 11 by reaction with a) from about 0.8 to about 2.0 molar equivalents of R 10 COOH and a coupling agent (for example DCC/DMAP) and the like in an inert solvent (for example THF or DMF and the like) or b) from about 0.8 to about 2.0 molar equivalents of an activated derivative of R 10 COOH (for example, the acid chloride or N-hydroxysuccinimide ester or R 10 C(O)OS(O) 2 R 30 (R 30 is loweralkyl, phenyl or toluyl) or R 10 C(O)OC(O)R 10 or R 10 C(O)OC(O)R 10a (R 10a is loweralkyl and the like) in the presence of from about 0 to about 3.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example, pyridine or dimethylaminopyridine or triethylamine or ethyldiisopropylamine or N-methylmorpholine or DBU or potassium carbonate and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, methylene chloride or THF or pyridine or acetonitrile or DMF and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. provides ester 12. R 10 is C 3 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl. The acetal substituent of 12 is deprotected and the resulting aldehyde is reduced by first reacting 12 with from about 0.1 to about 10.0 molar equivalents of an acid (for example, triflic acid or HCl or formic acid or acetic acid/formic acid or sulfuric acid and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF/H 2 O or methylene chloride/H 2 O or ethylacetate/H 2 O or ethanol/H 2 O or methanol/H 2 O or water and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. To the crude reaction mixture is added from about 0.1 to about 10.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example, sodium bicarbonate or potassium carbonate or triethylamine or pyridine or KOH and the like), (optionally, additional inert solvent (for example, THF and or methylene chloride or ethylacetate or methyl t-butyl ether or isopropoanol and the like) is added) and from about 0.3 to about 5.0 molar equivalents of an aldehyde reducing agent (for example, sodium borohydride or RaNi/H 2 or borane t-butylamine complex and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. to provide alcohol 13. The optical purity of compound 13 can be enhanced by reaction with optically active oraganic sulfonic acids such as (S)-()-camphorsulfonic acid and the like. A preferred sulfonic acid for this purpose is (S)-()-camphorsulfonic acid. Alternatively, the acetal substituent of 12 can be hydrolyzed by reaction in an inert solvent with an acid resin (for example, Amberlyst 15 resin, Nafion NR50 resin, Dowex 50WX4-200R resin or Amerlite 120 resin and the like) to provide the corresponding aldehyde. The aldehyde can be isolated prior to reduction to the alcohol 13 as described above or the crude aldehyde can be reduced directly in situ. Reaction of 13 with from about 0.8 to about 3.0 molar equivalents of N-protected amino acid P 1 NHCH(R 11 )COOH or an activated derivative thereof (P 1 is an N-protecting group (for example, benzyloxycarbonyl, t-butyloxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl and the like) and R 11 is isopropyl or isobutyl) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or dioxane or dioxolane or DMF or methylene chloride and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. provides alcohol 14. N-deprotection of 14 provides the compound of the invention of formula I wherein R 3 is OH. For example, when the protecting group can be removed by hydrogenation, such as when the protecting group is Cbz, hydrogenation in the presence of Pd/C in ethanol or Pd/BaCO 3 or Pd/BaSO 4 and the like in THF or isopropanol/THF and the like is preferred. Alternatively, compound 13 can be reacted with the symmetrical anhydride derived from P 1 NHCH(R 11 )COOH (i.e., P 1 NHCH(R 11 )C(O)OC(O)CH(R 11 )NHP 1 ) to provide 14. The anhydride can be prepared in situ or can be separately prepared prior to reaction with 13. Alternatively, 11 can be prepared by hydrolysis of the ester of 9 to an alcohol (for example, by reaction with a base such as K 2 CO 3 , Li 2 CO 3 , Na 2 CO 3 , KHCO 3 , LiOH, NaOH or KOH and the like in an inert solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, THF, water or mixtures thereof and the like, most prefereably with K 2 CO 3 in MeOH/H 2 O and the like), followed by direct conversion of the chloro group to an OH (for example, by reaction with an inorganic base such as KOH or NaOH and the like in H 2 O with heating and the like). In another alternative method, 11 can be prepared directly by hydrolysis of the chloro-ester 9 (for example, by reaction with an inorganic base such as KOH or NaOH and the like in H 2 O with heating and the like). In another alternative, the ester of 9 can be hydrolyzed by an esterase in water or an aqueous buffer, with or without the presence of an added organic solvent such as an alcohol (for example, ethanol or isopropanol and the like), THF, DMF or DMSO and the like. In another alternative method, 11 can be prepared from 9 (or from the hydroxy compound resulting from the hydrolysis of the ester in 9) by reaction with an inorganic base (for example, NaOH, LiOH, KOH and the like, preferably, NaOH) and trimethylamine in an aqueous solvent. In yet another alternative method, 11 can be prepared directly by hydrolysis of the chloro-ester 9 (for example, by reaction with 1-3 equivalents of a base such as sodium methoxide (and the like) in the presence of mercaptoethanol in a mixed solvent of water and methanol or dioxane (and the like) at a temperature of from about 20 C. to about relfux and the like). In yet another alternative method, prior to conversion of 9 to 10 or 11, the ester of 9 can be hydrolyzed to the alcohol as described above. The alcohol can then be reesterified and purified (for example, from methyl t-butyl ether and the like). This process leads to an increase in the enantiomeric excess (i.e., purity) of the resulting ester 9. Preferably, the alcohol is reesterified to provide the acetate, which is purified from methyl t-butyl ether. In yet another alternative method, 13 can be prepared by reaction of 9 (wherein R 8 R 10 )with formic acid, optionally with heating, followed by reduction of the aldehyde to give 13. In yet another alternative, 13 can be prepared from 11 without isolation of intermediates and with in situ generation of the esterification agent, thus increasing purity of the resulting product and allowing increased throughput in the process. Another alternative process for the preparation of compounds of Formula I wherein R 3 is OH is shown in Scheme D. Malonate 1 (R 4 and R 5 are lower alkyl or benzyl and the like) is alkylated with from about 0.5 to about 2.0 molar equivalents of ether 15 wherein X 1 is a leaving group (for example Cl, Br or I, or a sulfonate such as methane sulfonate, triflate, p-toluenesulfonate, benzenesulfonate and the like) and R 12 is CH(Ph) 2 , C(Ph) 3 or Si(t-Bu)(Me) 2 and the like (Phphenyl) in the presence of from about 0.5 to about 2.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example potassium t-butoxide or sodium ethoxide or NaH or KH and the like) in an inert solvent (for example DMF or THF or dioxane or dioxolane or N-methyl pyrrolidinone and the like) at a temperature of from about 40 C. to about 190 C. to provide alkylated malonate 16. Reduction of 16 with from about 0.5 to about 4.0 molar equivalents of an ester to alcohol reducing agent (for example LiBH 4 or Ca(BH 4 ) 2 or NaBH 4 or LiAlH 4 and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or methyl t-butyl ether or ethanol or t-butanol and the like) at a temperature of from about 20 C. to about 100 C. provides diol 17. Enzymatic esterification of 17 by reaction with from about 1.0 to about 20.0 molar equivalents of a vinyl ester 5 (R 8 is C 1 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl) in the presence of a lipase (for example, Lipase PS-30 or Lipase PPL or Lipase CCL and the like) or a phospholipase (for example phospholipase D and the like) provides the desired stereoisomer of ester 18. The reaction can be carried out in the absence of solvent or in the presence of an inert solvent (for example methyl t-butyl ether or toluene or hexane or the like). The reaction is carried out at a temperature of from about 20 C. to about 80 C. The alcohol substituent of 18 is converted to a leaving group (for example a halogen or sulfonate) by reaction with a halogenating agent (for example NBS/P(Ph) 3 or NCS/P(Ph) 3 or POCl 3 or NCS/P(Ph) 3 /Nal in acetone and the like) in an inert solvent (for example methylene chloride or toluene or ethylacetate and the like) or by reaction with from about 0.8 molar equivalents to about 2.0 molar equivalents of a sulfonyl halide (for example benzenesulfonylchloride, toluenesulfonylchloride or methane sulfonylchloride and the like) in the presence of from about 1.0 to about 4.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example triethylamine or potassium carbonate or pyridine and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, methylene chloride or toluene or ethyl acetate or methyl t-butyl ether and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. to provide ester 19 (X 2 is a halogen or sulfonate leaving group). Reaction of 19 with from about 0.9 to about 2.0 molar equivalents of 2-amino-4-chloropurine 8 in the presence of from about 1.0 to about 6.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example potassium carbonate or LiH or NaH or KH or NaOH or KOH or lithium diisopropylamide or LiN(Si(CH 3 ) 3 ) 2 and the like) in an inert solvent (for example DMF or THF or acetonitrile or N-methylpyrrolidone or ethanol and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 140 C. provides substituted purine 20. Alternatively, Mitsunobu coupling (for example, P(PH) 3 /diethyl azidocarboxylate) of alcohol 18 with 2-amino-4-chloropurine 8 provides 20. Reaction of 20 with from about 2.0 to about 20.0 molar equivalents of an alcohol R 9 OH (R 9 is an alcohol protecting group such as benzyl or diphenylmethyl and the like) in the presence of from about 1.0 to about 6.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example, potassium t-butoxide or potassium carbonate or NaH or KH or lithium diisopropylamide and the like in an inert solvent (for example, THF or DMF and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 150 C. provides alcohol 21. Removal of the alcohol protecting group R 9 of 21 (for example by catalytic hydrogenation in an inert solvent such as ethanol or benzyl alcohol or methanol or THF and the like in the presence of an hydrogenation catalyst such as Pd/C or Pd(OH) 2 and the like) provides substituted guanine 22, which can be esterified as described in Scheme C (i.e., 11 to 12) to provide 23. The ether substitutent of 23 is deprotected by reaction with a) a reducing agent (for example, HCO 2 H and Pd/C and the like) wherein R 12 is CH(Ph) 2 or C(Ph) 3 , or b) a desilylating agent (for example Bu 4 NF and the like) wherein R 12 is Si(t-Bu)(Me) 2 and the like to provide 13. Alcohol 13 can be converted to I as outlined in Scheme C. Alternatively, 22 can be prepared by hydrolysis of the ester of 20 to an alcohol (for example, by reaction with K 2 CO 3 in MeOH/H 2 O and the like), followed by direct conversion of the chloro group to an OH (for example, by reaction with KOH in H 2 O with heating and the like). In another alternative method, 22 can be prepared directly by hydrolysis of the chloro-ester 20 (for example, by reaction with KOH in H 2 O with heating and the like). In another alternative method, 22 can be prepared from 20 (or from the hydroxy compound resulting from the hydrolysis of the ester in 20) by reaction with an inorganic base (for example, NaOH, LiOH, KOH and the like, preferably, NaOH) and trimethylamine in an aqueous solvent. In yet another alternative method, 22 can be prepared directly by hydrolysis of the chloro-ester 20 (for example, by reaction with 1-3 equivalents of a base such as sodium methoxide (and the like) in the presence of mercaptoethanol in a mixed solvent of water and methanol or dioxane (and the like) at a temperature of from about 20 C. to about relfux and the like). In yet another alternative method, 23 can be prepared by reaction of 20 (wherein R 8 R 10 ) with formic acid, optionally with heating, followed by reduction of the aldehyde to give 23. An additional alternative involves enzymatic esterification of alcohol 4 or 17 with the vinyl ester CH 2 CHOC(O)R 10 (i.e., R 8 R 10 in Schemes C and D) to directly incorporate into 6 or 18 the desired carboxylic acid ester of the final product I. This allows the elimination of the ester hydrolysis and reesterification involved in going from 9 to 12 or from 20 to 23. The processes of Schemes C and D are characterized by the fact that each of the hydroxyl groups of the acyclic side chain is differentiated by the use of different hydroxy protecting groups or precursor groups. This allows the selective acylation of each of the hydroxy groups with either an amino acid or a fatty acid group. Schemes C and D have been illustrated and described with reference to embodiments of the invention wherein R 1 is derived from an amino acid and R 2 is derived from a fatty acid. However, it will be apparent that respective converse schemes will apply to compounds where R 1 is derived from a fatty acid and R 2 is derived from an amino acid. Yet another method for preparing compounds of Formula I is shown in Scheme E. Enzymatic esterification of 4 (see Scheme C) by reaction with from about 1.0 to about 20.0 molar equivalents of a vinyl ester 24 (R 10 is C 3 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl) in the presence of a lipase (for example, Lipase PS-30 or Lipase PPL or Lipase CCL and the like) or a phospholipase (for example phospholipase D and the like) provides the desired stereoisomer of ester 25. This reaction can be carried out in the absence of solvent or in the presence of an inert solvent (for example, methyl t-butyl ether or toluene or hexane and the like). The reaction is carried out at a temperature of from about 20 C. to about 80 C. The alcohol substituent of 25 is converted to a leaving group (for example, a halogen or a sulfonate) by reaction with a halogenating agent (for example NBS/P(Ph) 3 or NCS/P(Ph) 3 or POCl 3 or NCS/P(Ph) 3 /Nal in acetone and like) in an inert solvent (for example, methylene chloride or toluene or ethylacetate and the like) or by reaction with from about 0.8 molar equivalents to about 2.0 molar equivalents of a sulfonyl halide (for example, benzenesulfonylchloride, toluenesulfonylchloride or methane sulfonylchloride and the like) in the presence of from about 1.0 to about 4.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example, triethylamine or potassium carbonate or pyridine or dimethylaminopyridine or ethyldiisopropylamine and the like) in an inert solvent (for example methylene chloride or toluene or ethylacetate or pyridine or methyl t-butyl ether and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. to provide ester 26 (X 2 is a halogen or sulfonate leaving group). The acetal substituent of 26 is hydrolyzed to the aldehyde 27 by reacting 26 with an acid (for example, trifluoroacetic acid, triflic acid or HCl or formic acid or acetic acid/formic acid or sulfuric acid and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF/H 2 O or methylene chloride/H 2 O or ethylacetate/H 2 O or ethanol/H 2 O or methanol/H 2 O or water and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. To the aldehyde 27 in an inert solvent (for example, THF and or methylene chloride or ethylacetate or methyl t-butyl ether or isopropoanol and the like) is added an aldehyde to alcohol reducing agent (for example, sodium borohydride or RaNi/H 2 or borane t-butylamine complex and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. to provide the corresponding alcohol. Reaction of the resulting alcohol with from about 0.8 to about 3.0 molar equivalents of N-protected amino acid P 1 NHCH(R 11 )COOH or an activated derivative thereof (P 1 is an N-protecting group (for example, benzyloxycarbonyl, t-butyloxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl, trichloroethylcarbonyl and the like) and R 11 is isopropyl or isobutyl) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or dioxane or dioxolane or DMF or methylene chloride and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. provides diester 28. Alternatively the alcohol can be reacted with the symmetrical anhydride derived from P 1 NHCH(R 11 )COOH (i.e., P 1 NHCH(R 11 )C(O)OC(O)CH(R 11 )NHP 1 ) to provide 28. Conversion of 27 to 28 can be accomplished with or without isolation/purification of the intermediate alcohol. A preferred aldehyde to alcohol reducing agent is borane t-butylamine complex. A preferred esterification agent is the symmetrical anhydride. Reaction of 28 with purine 29 in the presence of a base (for example potassium carbonate or LiH or NaH or KH or NaOH or KOH or lithium diisopropylamide or LiN(Si(CH 3 ) 3 ) 2 and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, DMF and the like) provides 30. Purine 29 is prepared from 6-chloro-2-amino purine by reaction with R 9 OH in an inert solvent (for example, toluene or THF and the like) in the presence of a base (for example, NaH or KH or NaOH or KOH or potassium t-butoxide and the like). A preferred process for the the preparation of purine 29 involves reaction of 2-amino-6-chloropurine with neat R 9 -OH in the presence of a base such as NaOH or KOH or potassium t-butoxide and the like. Substituted purine 30 is deprotected to provide the compound of Formula I. Alternatively, in the reaction of 28 with 29, the base can be a sterically bulky amine base (for example, 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0-undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-diazabicyclo2.2.2octane (Dabco), 1,5-diazabicyclo4.3.0non-5-ene (DBN), tetramethylguanidine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine and the like) or a sterically bulky phosphazine base (for example, tert-butylimino-tri(pyrrolidino)-phosphorane, tert-butylimino-tri(dimethylamino)phosphorane, tert-octylimino-tri(dimethylamino)phosphorane and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or DMF or DMSO and the like). Yet another method for preparing compounds of Formula I is shown in Scheme F. Reaction of 28 with amino-chloropurine 8 in the presence of a base (for example potassium carbonate or LiH or NaH or KH or NaOH or KOH or lithium diisopropylamide or LiN(Si(CH 3 ) 3 ) 2 and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, DMF THF and the like) provides 31. Hydrolysis of 31 to 14 can be accomplished under basic or acidic conditions (for example, with trimethlyamine or DABCO or KOH or LiOH or NaOH and the like in water/THF or methylene chloride and the like or with acetic acid and the like). Alternatively, 8 can be be alkylated with 28 using a sterically bulky amine base (for example, 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-diazabicyclo2.2.2octane (Dabco), 1,5-diazabicyclo4.3.0non-5-ene (DBN), tetramethylguanidine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine and the like) or a sterically bulky phosphazine base (for example, tert-butylimino-tri(pyrrolidino)-phosphorane, tert-butylimino-tri(dimethylamino)phosphorane, tert-octylimino-tri(dimethylamino)phosphorane and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or DMF or DMSO and the like). In each of Schemes C, D and F, the 2-amino-6-chloro-purine (8) can be replaced with 2-amino-6-iodo-purine or 2-amino-6-bromopurine, which can be alkylated and then transformed to the substituted guanine in a manner analogous to that disclosed for alkylation and transformation of 8 Yet another method for preparing the compounds of formula I is shown in Scheme G. Alkylation of 32 with 7 in the presence of a base (for example, potassium carbonate, LiH, NaH and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, DMF THF and the like) provides 33. R 25 is hydrogen or C(O)NR 27 R 28 wherein R 27 and R 28 are independently selected from loweralkyl, phenyl and benzyl or R 27 and R 28, taken together with the nitrogen to which they are attached, form a pyrrolidinyl group or a piperidinyl group. R 26 is loweralkyl, phenyl or benzyl. Hydrolysis of 33 to 11 can be accomplished under basic conditions (for example, with KOH in water and the like). Alternatively, 32 can be alkylated with 7 using a sterically bulky amine base (for example, 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-diazabicyclo2.2.2octane (Dabco), 1,5-diazabicyclo4.3.0non-5-ene (DBN), tetramethylguanidine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine and the like) or a sterically bulky phosphazine base (for example, tert-butylimino-tri(pyrrolidino)-phosphorane, tert-butylimino-tri(dimethylamino)phosphorane, tert-octylimino-tri(dimethylamino)phosphorane and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or DMF or DMSO and the like).

Biology Example 1 Bioavailability Testing in Rats The bioavailability of compounds of the invention were compared to the parent compound H2G and other H2G derivatives in a rat model. Compounds of the invention and comparative compounds were administered, per oral (by catheter into the stomach), to multiples of three individually weighed animals to give 0.1 mmol/kg of the dissolved prodrug in an aqueous (Example 4, 5, Comparative example 1-3, 5, 8), peanut oil (Comparative examples 4, 9, 10) or propylene glycol (Example 1-3, 6-12, 17, Comparative example 6, 7) vehicle dependent on the solubility of the test compound ingredient. The animals were fasted from 5 hours before to approximately 17 hours after administration and were maintained in metabolic cages. Urine was collected for the 24 hours following administration and frozen until analysis. H2G was analysed in the urine using the HPLC/UV assay of Sthle Oberg, Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 36 No 2, 339-342 (1992), modified as follows: samples upon thawing are diluted 1:100 in aq dist H 2 O and filtered through an amicon filter with centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. Duplicate 30 l samples are chromatographed on an HPLC column; Zorbax SB-C18; 754.6 mm; 3.5 micron; Mobile phase 0.05M NH 4 PO 4 , 3-4% methanol, pH 3.3-3.5; 0.5 ml/min; 254 nm, retention time for H2G at MeOH 4% and pH 3.33,12.5 min. Bioavailability is calculated as the measured H2G recovery from each animal averaged over at least three animals and expressed as a percentage of the averaged 24 hour urinary H2G recovery from a group of 4 individually weighed rats respectively injected i.v.jugularis with 0.1 mmol/kg H2G in a Ringers buffer vehicle and analysed as above. Comparative example 1 (H2G) was from the same batch as used for preparation of Examples 1 to 12. The preparation of Comparative example 2 (monoVal-H2G) and 3 (diVal-H2G) are shown in Examples 20 and 23. Comparative example 4 (distearoyl H2G) was prepared by di-esterification of unprotected H2G in comparable esterification conditions to step 2 of Example 1. Comparative examples 5 8 (Val/Ac H2G) were prepared analogously to Example 4 using acetic anhydride with relevant monovaline H2G. Comparative example 6 (Ala/stearoyl H2G) was prepared analogously to Example 6 using N-t-Boc-L-alanine in step 4. Comparative example 7 (Gly/decanoyl) was prepared analogously to Example 5 but using the step a) intermediate made with N-t-Boc-L-glycine. The preparation of Comparative examples 9 and 10 is shown in Examples 24 and 25 respectively. The results appear on Table 2 below: TABLE 2 Compound R 1 R 2 Bioavailability Comparative example 1 hydrogen hydrogen 8% Comparative example 2 valyl hydrogen 29% Comparative example 3 valyl valyl 36% Example 1 valyl stearoyl 56% Comparative example 4 stearoyl stearoyl 1% Example 2 valyl myristoyl 57% Example 3 valyl oleoyl 51% Example 4 valyl butyryl 45% Comparative example 5 valyl acetyl 11% Example 5 valyl decanoyl 48% Example 6 valyl docosanoyl 48% Example 7 isoleucyl stearoyl 53% Example 8 isoleucyl decanoyl 57% Example 9 isoleucyl myristoyl 49% Example 10 valyl 4-acetylbutyryl 52% Example 11 valyl dodecanoyl 46% Example 12 valyl palmitoyl 58% Example 17 stearoyl valyl 52% Comparative example 6 alanyl stearoyl 23% Comparative example 7 glycyl decanoyl 25% Comparative Example 8 acetyl valyl 7% Comparative Example 9 hydrogen stearoyl 12% Comparative Example 10 stearoyl hydrogen 7% Comparison of the bioavailabilities of the compounds of the invention with the comparative examples indicates that the particular combination of the fatty acids at R 1 /R 2 with the amino acids at R 1 /R 2 produces bioavailabilities significantly greater than the corresponding diamino acid ester or difatty acid ester. For example, in this model, the compound of Example 1 displays 55% better bioavailability than the corresponding divaline ester of Comparative example 3. The compound of Example 4 displays 25% better availability than the corresponding divaline ester. It is also apparent, for instance from Comparative examples 5, 6 and 7 that only the specified fatty acids of this invention in combination with the specified amino acids produce these dramatic and unexpected increases in pharmacokinetic parameters. Biology Example 2 Plasma Concentrations in Rats A plasma concentration assay was done in male Sprague Dawley derived rats. The animals were fasted overnight prior to dosing but were permitted free access to water. Each of the compounds evaluated was prepared as a solution/suspension in propylene glycol at a concentration corresponding to 10 mg H2G/ml and shaken at room temperature for eight hours. Groups of rats (at least 4 rats in each group) received a 10 mg/kg (1 ml/kg) oral dose of each of the compounds; the dose was administered by gavage. At selected time points after dosing (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 24 hours after dosing), heparinized blood samples (0.4 ml/sample) were obtained from a tail vein of each animal. The blood samples were immediately chilled in an ice bath. Within two hours of collection, the plasma was separated from the red cells by centrifugation and frozen till analysis. The components of interest were separated from the plasma proteins using acetonitrile precipitation. Following lyophilisation, and reconstitution, the plasma concentrations were determined by reverse phase HPLC with fluorescence detection. The oral uptake of H2G and other test compounds was determined by comparison of the H2G area under the curve derived from the oral dose compared to that obtained from a 10 mg/kg intravenous dose of H2G, administered to a separate group of rats. The results are depicted in Table 1B above. Biology Example 3 Bioavailability in Monkeys The compounds of Example 1 and Comparative example 3 (see Biology Example 1 above) were administered p.o. by gavage to cynomolgus monkeys. The solutions comprised: Example 1 150 mg dissolved in 6.0 ml propylene glycol, corresponding to 25 mg/kg or 0.0295 mmol/kg. Comparative 164 mg dissolved in 7.0 ml water, corresponding to Example 3 23.4 mg/kg or 0.0295 mmol/kg. Blood samples were taken at 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10 and 24 hours. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2500 rpm and the samples were inactivated at 54 C. for 20 minutes before being frozen pending analysis. Plasma H2G levels were monitored by the HPLC/UV assay of Example 30 above. FIG. 1 depicts the plasma H2G recovery as a function of time. Although it is not possible to draw statistically significant conclusions from single animal trials, it appears that the animal receiving the compound of the invention experienced a somewhat more rapid and somewhat greater exposure to H2G than the animal which received an alternative prodrug of H2G. Biology Example 4 Antiviral Activity Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1)-infected mouse serves as an animal model to determine the efficacy of antiviral agents in vivo. Mice inoculated intraperitoneally with HSV-1 at 1000 times the LD 50 were administered either with a formulation comprising the currently marketed anti-herpes agent acyclovir (21 and 83 mg/kg in a 2% propylene glycol in sterile water vehicle, three times daily, p.o.) or the compound of Example 29 (21 and 83 mg/kg in a 2% propylene glycol in sterile water vehicle, three times daily, p.o.) for 5 consecutive days beginning 5 hours after inoculation. The animals were assessed daily for deaths. The results are displayed in FIG. 2 which charts the survival rate against time. In the legend, the compound of the invention is denoted Ex.29 and acyclovir is denoted ACV.

This application is a Divisional of application Ser. No. 09/091,263, filed on Jun. 18, 1988, pending, which was originally filed as International Application No. PCT/EP96/05525, filed on Dec. 11, 1996. DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to novel 1,7-disubstituted perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydrides of the general formula I and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acids of the general formula Ia where L 1 and L 2 independently of one another are 1,2-ethylene, 1,2-ethenylene and 1,2-ethynylene; R 1 and R 2 independently of one another are hydrogen or C 1 -C 30 -alkyl, whose carbon chain can be interrupted by one or more groups O, S, NR 3 , CO and/or SO2 and/or which can be substituted one or more times by COOR 3 , SO 3 R 3 , hydroxyl, cyano, C 1 -C 6 -alkoxy, C 5 -C 8 -cycloalkyl or aryl or by a 5- to 7-membered heterocyclic radical which is attached via a nitrogen atom and can include further heteroatoms and/or can be aromatic, R 3 being hydrogen or C 1 -C 6 -alkyl, and to a process for preparing the perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydrides (I) or the acids (1a) and to their use as pigments, laser dyes and precursors for preparing fluorescent dyes, polymeric colorants, pigments and pigment additives. The invention additionally relates to novel 1,7-disubstituted perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimides of the general formula VI where X 1 is bromine or is LR, where L is 1,2-ethylene, 1,2-ethenylene or 1,2-ethynylene and R is hydrogen or C 1 -C 30 -alkyl whose carbon chain can be interrupted by one or more groups O, S, NR 3 , CO and/or SO 2 and/or which can be substituted one or more times by COOR 3 , SO 3 R 3 , hydroxyl, cyano, C 1 -C 6 -alkoxy, C 5 -C 8 -cycloalkyl or aryl or by a 5- to 7-membered heterocyclic radical which is attached via a nitrogen atom and can include further heteroatoms and/or can be aromatic, R 3 being hydrogen or C 1 -C 6 -alkyl; X 2 is bromine or LR; R 4 is C 4 -C 30 -alkyl whose carbon chain can be interrupted by one or more groups O, S or CO, or is C 5 -C 8 -cycloalkyl or aryl which can be substituted one or more times by C 1 -C 6 -alkyl or C 1 -C 6 -alkoxy, as intermediates for the perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydrides (I) or the acids (Ia), and to a process for preparing the perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimides (VI). Perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acids and their anhydrides are known to be important intermediates for preparing perylimide pigments and perylimide dyes, but are also useful themselves for coloring or pigmenting high molecular mass organic materials. In addition to unsubstituted perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid, which can be obtained by hydrolyzing perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide in concentrated sulfuric acid at about 200 C., there is particular interest in perylene-tetracarboxylic acids which are substituted in the perylene skeleton and whose properties in use, such as solubility, inherent color and fluorescence, can be tailored by introducing suitable substituents. WO-A-94/25504 discloses 1,6,7,12-tetraaroxy-substituted perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydrides prepared by alkaline hydrolysis of the corresponding diimides in a polar protic solvent. The tetraaroxy-substituted diimides themselves are obtained by reacting the tetrachlorinated diimides with arylates (EP-A-227 980). 1,7-disubstituted perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acids, such as the novel compounds (Ia) which, like all perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acids, are generally in the form of the dianhydrides, have not been disclosed to date. In addition, the dihalogenated perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimides described in EP-A-39 912 and in DE-A-412 122 are always mixtures of products with differing degrees of halogenation (especially tetra-, tri- and monohalogenated products); it has not been possible to prepare the dihalogenated diimides specifically. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide novel disubstituted perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acids and dianhydrides. We have found that this object is achieved by the 1,7-disubstituted perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydrides and the corresponding acids of the above-defined formulae I and Ia (referred to below as dianhydrides I), which may be substituted symmetrically or asymmetrically. Preferred dianhydrides I are the subject of the subclaim. We have also discovered a process for preparing the symmetric dianhydrides I, which comprises a) reacting 1,7-dibromoperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (II) or 1,7-dibromoperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid (IIa) in the presence of a polar aprotic solvent and in the presence or absence of an imidation catalyst with a primary amine of the general formula III R 4 NH 2 III where R 4 is C 4 -C 30 -alkyl whose carbon chain can be interrupted by one or more groups O, Sor CO, or is C 5 -C 8 -cycloalkyl or aryl which can be substituted one or more times by C 1 -C 6 -alkyl or C 1 -C 6 -alkoxy, b) reacting the 1,7-dibromoperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimides formed in step a), of the general formula IV in the presence of an aprotic solvent, a palladium complex as catalyst, a copper salt as cocatalyst and a base with a 1-alkyne of the general formula V HCCR 1 V in a molar ratio of from 1:2 to 1:4, and c) hydrolyzing the symmetric, 1,7-disubstituted perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimides, formed in step b), of the general formula VI after additional reduction of the unsaturated bonds in L 1 , if desired, in the presence of a polar protic solvent and a base to form the symmetric dianhydrides I. We have also discovered a process for preparing the asymmetric dianhydrides I, which corresponds to the process for preparing the symmetric dianhydrides I in step a) but in which the 1,7-dibromoperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimides IV are reacted in step b)which is likewise carried out in the presence of an aprotic solvent, a palladium complex as catalyst, a copper salt as cocatalyst and a basefirst with a 1-alkyne of the general formula Va HCCR 1 Va and then with a different 1-alkyne of the general formula Vb HCCR 2 Vb in each case in a molar ratio of from 1:1 to 1:2 and the resulting asymmetric 1,7-disubstituted perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimides of the general formula VI are then hydrolyzed, in step c), after additional reduction of the unsaturated bonds in L 1 and L 2 , if desired, in the presence of a polar protic solvent and a base to form the asymmetric dianhydrides I. We have, furthermore, discovered the 1,7-disubstituted perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimides of the above-defined formula VI (referred to as perylimides VI), which can likewise be symmetrically or asymmetrically substituted, as intermediates for the dianhydrides I, and processes for preparing the perylimides VI which comprise steps a) and b) of the process for preparing the corresponding dianhydrides I. Preferred perylimides VI are the subject of the subclaim. Yet further, we have discovered the use of the dianhydrides I as pigments, laser dyes and precursors for preparing fluorescent dyes, polymeric colorants, pigments and pigment additives. Finally, we have also discovered the use of the perylimides VI as pigments and dyes for coloring high molecular mass organic materials and inorganic materials, as laser dyes, and as organic materials for electroluminescence applications. Each alkyl in the formulae I (including Ia), III, IV, V (including Va and Vb) and VI (including VI and VI) can be either straight-chain or branched.

The novel preparation of the dianhydrides I is a multistage synthesis. In step a) 1,7-dibromoperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (II) is reacted with a primary amine III to form the corresponding 1,7 -dibromoperylene-3,4,9,10 -tetracarboxylic diimide IV, which in step b) is reacted with a 1-alkyne V (or stepwise with different 1-alkynes Va and vb) to form the perylimide VI, which finally in step c) is hydrolyzed under basic conditions, after additional reduction of the unsaturated bond in the bridge member L, if desired, to form the dianhydride I. The starting product for the novel preparation process, 1,7-dibromoperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (II), can be obtained by selective bromination of perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride in 100% by weight sulfuric acid (monohydrate). An expedient procedure comprises first of all stirring perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride in the sulfuric acid for 2-16 hours and then heating this mixture, after adding a halogenation catalyst such as iodine (preferably 30-40 mmol per mole of anhydride) to the reaction temperature (generally 80-90 C.). At this point the bromine is added slowly dropwise (usually over 6-10 hours), using preferably 2-2.5 mol of bromine (Br 2 ) per mole of anhydride. After cooling to room temperature and displacing the unreacted bromine by nitrogen, water is added, a little at a time, in order to reduce the concentration of sulfuric acid to about 85-88% by weight. Working up the reaction mixture to the 1,7-dibromoperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (II) can be carried out by filtering off the precipitated product, washing it with 85-88% by weight sulfuric acid, stirring it into water, filtering the mixture again, washing the product with water and then drying it. Step a) of the novel preparation process, the reaction of the 1,7-dibromoperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (II) with the primary amine, is carried out in the presence of a polar aprotic solvent and in the presence or absence of an imidation catalyst. Suitable polar aprotic solvents for this step are, in particular, aprotic nitrogen heterocycles such as pyridine, pyrimidine, quinoline, isocuinoline, quinaldine, N-methylpiperidine, N-methylpiperidone and, in particular, N-methylpyrrolidone. The quantity of solvent used is not critical per se and is usually 5-20 kg, preferably 10-15 kg, per kg of (II). Suitable imidation catalysts include organic and inorganic acids, for example formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid and phosphoric acid, which are preferably employed in highly concentrated form, and also organic and inorganic solvents of transition metals such as zinc, iron and copper and of magnesium, for example zinc acetate, zinc propionate, zinc oxide, iron(II) acetate, iron(III) chloride, iron(II) sulfate, copper(II) acetate, copper(II) oxide and magnesium acetate. Of course it is also possible to use mixtures of these catalysts. The presence of an imidation catalyst is particularly advisable when reacting aromatic amines and is also advantageous when reacting cycloaliphatic amines, whereas for short-chain aliphatic amines no catalyst is usually required. 5-80% by weight of catalyst based on (II) is generally employed. With the organic acids, preferred quantities are 50-80%, and with the transition metal salts and magnesium salts they are 10-40% by weight, based in each case on (II). Primary amines which can be employed in the novel preparation process are all those which are stable under the reaction conditions and which, with perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydrides, form diimides which can be hydrolyzed under basic conditions. Examples of particularly preferred primary amines III are stearylamine, 5-nonylamine, cyclopentylamine, cyclohexylamine, cycloheptylamine, aniline, 4-methylaniline, 4-ethylaniline, 4-tert-butylaniline, 3,5-dimethylaniline, 3,5-diethylaniline and 3,5-di-tert-butylaniline. The molar ratio of amine III to (II) is normally from about 2:1 to 4:1, preferably from about 2.2:1 to 3:1. Step a) is generally carried out at 40-180 C. 60-100 C is the preferred range when reacting aliphatic and cycloaliphatic amines, and 120-160 C. when reacting aromatic amines. It is advisable to work under an inert-gas atmosphere (for example using nitrogen). Step a) of the novel process can be carried out at atmospheric pressure or under superatmospheric pressure at, normally, up to 10 bar. The use of superatmospheric pressure is especially expedient when working with volatile amines (boiling pointabout 180 C.) The reaction is normally over after 2-10 hours, especially 4-7 hours. The specific procedure for step a) is expediently as follows: 1,7-Dibromoperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (II), solvent and, if used, catalyst are charged to the reactor, the amine III is added at room temperature with stirring, the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen for about 15 minutes, and the mixture is heated with stirring to the reaction temperature and held there for about 4-7 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the ereation product is filtered off, washed with an aliphatic alcohol such as methanol and dried. When working under superatmospheric pressure, the reaction vessel used is a pressure apparatus to which a nitrogen pressure of about 1-2 bar is applied after the components have been introduced, which are then heated at the reaction temperature for the desired period and then cooled, after which the reactor is let down. For further purification the resulting 1,7-dibromoperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide IV can be dissolved in a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride, chloroform or tetrachloroethane, the solution can be filtered over silica gel and the filtrate can be concentrated to dryness. The purity of the diimide IV thus treated is usually98% and it can therefore be used directly for the subsequent reactions. Step b) of the novel preparation process, the reaction of the 1,7-dibromoperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diidide IV with the 1-alkyne V, is carried out in the presence of an aprotic solvent, a palladium complex as catalyst, a copper salt as cocatalyst and a base. Suitable solvents in this step include linear and cyclic aliphatic ethers having up to 10 carbon atoms, such as diethyl ether, di-n-propyl ether, di-n-butyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane, dioxane and in particular, tetrahydrofuran. The quantity of solvent employed is not critical per se and is usually 30-100 kg, preferably 40-60 kg, per kg of diimide IV. The base which is added serves simultaneously as cosolvent. Bases particularly suitable for this purpose are organic nitrogen bases which can be mixed with the ethers and have a melting point below room temperature and a boiling point above the reaction temperature. Preferred bases are aliphatic amines having up to 15 carbon atoms, especially tertiary amines such as triethylamine, tri-n-propylamine and tri-n-butylamine, and cycloaliphatic amines such as, in particular, piperidine. 0.2-1.5 kg, preferably 0.8-1.2 kg, of base are usually added per kg of solvent. The catalysts used are palladium complexes which are employed in conjunction with copper (I) salts as cocatalysts. Examples of suitable palladium complexes are tetrakis(tris-o-tolylphosphine)palladium(0), 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)-ethanepalladium(II) chloride, 1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocenepalladium(II) chloride, bis(triethylphosphine)palladium(II) chloride, bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)palladium(II) chloride, bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) acetate, (2,2-bipyridyl)palladium-(II) chloride and, in particular, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0), bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) chloride, bis(acetonitrile)palladium(II) chloride and bis(benzonitrile)-palladium(II) chloride. Examples of particularly suitable copper(I) salts are copper(I) iodide and copper(I) bromide. In general 2-15 mol-%, preferably 5-10 mol-%, of palladium complex and generally 2-20 mol-%, preferably 7-12 mol-%, of copper(I) salt are employed, based in each case on the diimide IV. The reaction temperature in step b) is usually 20-140 C., especially 40-90 C. Depending on the alkyne employed the reaction can be carried out at atmospheric pressure or under superatmospheric pressure, at, normally, up to 50 bar. The use of superatmospheric pressure is necessary when working with volatile alkynes such as acetylene. When symmetric perylimides VI (VI) are prepared, the molar ratio of the starting compounds, diimide IV and alkyne V, is generally from 1:2 to 1:5, preferably from 1:2 to 1:4. When preparing asymmetric perylimides VI (VI), when first of all only one of the two bromine atoms in the perylene skeleton is replaced by the reaction with an alkyne Va and then th e second bromine atom is replaced by the reaction with a different alkyne Vb, the molar ratio of diimide IV to alkyne V is generally in each case from 1:1 to 1:2, preferably from 1:1 to 1:1.5. The reaction forming the symmetric perylimides VI is usually over after 1-15 hours, in particular 2-10 hours. In contrast, the preparation of the monosubstituted monobromoperylimide as an intermediate in the reaction to form the asymmetric perylimides VI generally takes only 15-60 minutes, in particular 15-30 minutes. The subsequent reaction forming the disubstituted perylimide VI, is then subject to the reaction time specified for the symmetric perylimides VI. Depending on the chosen reaction conditions, step b) of the novel preparation process may produce perylimides VI comprising 1,2-ethynylenes or 1,2-ethenylenes as bridge member L. To prepare perylimides VI comprising unsaturated bridge members, it is advisable to work under inert gas (for example argon or nitrogen). if reaction is carried out for more than 4 hours and/or at more than 100 C., the acetylenic bond is reduced directly to the ethylenic bond. Perylimides VI comprising ethylene radicals L can be obtained by subsequently stirring the reaction mixture in a hydrogen atmosphere. However, it is also possible to carry out subsequent reduction of the unsaturated bond using, for example, hydrogen with catalysis by palladium on active charcoal in a procedure which is customary for such reductions (cf. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers New York, 1989, 6-17; March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, John Wiley and Sons New York, 4th Edition 1992, 775-777; Journal of Organic Chemistry, Volume 45, 4926-4931 (1980)). The specific procedure in step b) for preparing the symmetric perylimides VI is expediently as follows: A stirred solution or suspension of the diimide IV in a mixture of solvent and base (both anhydrous as far as possible) is charged to the reactor, the suspension is saturated with nitrogen by repeated degassing and gassing with dry nitrogen, the copper(I) salt, the palladium complex and the 1-alkyne V are introduced in a nitrogen countercurrent (volatile alkylenes such as acetylene are weighed out and introduced in gaseous form into the closed apparatus), and the reaction mixture is heated at the desired reaction temperature for the desired period (4 h or 4 h). Then, if desired, gaseous hydrogen is introduced and the mixture is stirred at the reaction temperature for a further 4-8 hours. Subsequently (after letting down the reactor beforehand if appropriate) the reaction mixture is introduced directly, ie. without being cooled, with vigorous stirring into about three times the volume of a mixture of approximately equal parts by weight of concentrated hydrochloric acid and ice, and the crude product is filtered off, washed with half-concentrated hydrochloric acid until the washings are colorless and then with water until the washings are neutral, and dried. For further purification the resulting perylimide VI can be recrystallized with appropriate solvents such as, for example, halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform or tetrachloroethane, or cyclic ethers such as dioxane or tetrahydrofuran, or can be chromatographed over a short silica gel column, in which case the abovementioned solvents or mixtures thereof, depending on the functionality of R, can be used as eluent. To prepare the asymmetric perylimides VI the specific procedure is expediently as already described for the symmetric perylimides VI except that first of all the reduced quantity of 1-alkyne Va is added and the mixture is then heated at the desired reaction temperature for 15-30 minutes. The monosubstituted monobromoperylimide VI can then be first isolated as described above or else reacted directly with the second 1-alkyne Vb by stirring at the desired reaction temperature for 2-4 hours or more. The working up of the reaction mixture and subsequent purification of the crude product can of course be carried out as described above for the symmetric perylimides VI. The perylimides VI treated in this way usually have a purity of 98% and can be employed directly for the subsequent reactions. However, they can also be used themselves as valuable pigments and dyes. Step c) of the novel process, the hydrolysis of the perylimide VI to form the dianhydride I, is carried out (after reduction of the perylimide beforehand, if appropriate) in the presence of a polar protic solvent and a base. Particularly suitable polar protic solvents for this step are C 1 -C 10 -alkanols such as ethanol, propanol, n-butanol, tert-butanol, 2-methyl-2-butanol, n-hexanol, n-decanol and, preferably, isopropanol. In order to accelerate hydrolysis it is expedient to add water as well, generally 0.1-0.2 mol per millimol of perylimide VI. The quantity of solvent employed is not critical per se and is usually 50-200 kg, preferably 60-80 kg, per kg of perylimide VI. Particularly suitable bases are alkali metal hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, which are generally employed in amounts of 4-10 kg, preferably 5-7 kg, per kg of perylimide VI. The reaction temperature in step c) is usually 20-140 C., in particular 40-90 C. The hydrolysis is normally over after 3-10 hours, in particular 4-6 hours. The specific procedure in step c) of the novel preparation process is expediently as follows: A mixture of perylimide VI, solvent and base is heated at the desired reaction temperature for 4-6 hours and cooled to room temperature, and the crude product which has precipitated in the course of cooling is filtered off and washed with an alcohol, such as isopropanol or propanol, until the washings are colorless. For further purification, the resulting dianhydride I is expediently introduced into 30-100 times the quantity of dilute inorganic acid, for example 5-10% by weight hydrochloric acid, boiled up briefly and filtered after cooling, and the product is washed with water to neutrality and dried. The novel preparation process can be used to obtain the 1,7-disubstituted perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydrides I in a technically simple and economic process in high purities (generally95%) and good yields. The novel dianhydrides I are advantageously useful for pigmenting printing inks, coating compositions, especially daylight-fluorescent colors, and plastics, as laser dyes and precursors for preparing fluorescent dyes, polymeric colorants, pigments and pigment additives. The novel perylimides VI can also be used with advantage as pigments and dyes for coloring high molecular mass organic materials and inorganic materials, as laser dyes and as organic materials for electroluminescence applications. EXAMPLE A) Preparation of 1,7-dibromoperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (II) Example 1 A mixture of 292.5 g (0.75 mol) of perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (purity98%) and 4420 g of 100% by weight sulfuric acid was stirred for 12 hours at room temperature, 7 g of iodine were then added, and it was heated to 85 C. Subsequently, 262.5 g (1.64 mol) of bromine were added dropwise over 8 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, the excess bromine was displaced by nitrogen and then the concentration of sulfuric acid was reduced to 86% by weight by adding a total of 670 g of water, a little at a time, over 1 hour. During this addition the reaction mixture heats up to 85 C. again: it was cooled and the precipitated product was filtered off over a G4 glass frit, washed with 3 kg of 86% by weight sulfuric acid and then stirred up in 5 1 of water; the mixture was filtered again and the product was washed to neutrality and dried under reduced pressure at 120 C. 370 g of II were obtained in the form of a bright red finely crystalline powder with a melting point360 C. and a purity of 98 %, corresponding to a yield of 90%.

R1 and R2 are either identical or different and denote either hydrogen, alkyl with 1-20 C atoms, polyoxyhydrocarbyl units, phenyl or phenylalkyl with 1-3 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain in which the alkyl and/or phenyl residues can be substituted by one or several hydroxy, halogen, sulfonic acid, amino, carboxy or alkoxycarbonyl groups where alkoxy can have 1-4 carbon atoms, R1 contains at least one activatable group, R2 and X4 can be optionally linked together via a bridge composed of 0-2 C atoms. In contrast to the prior art, these compounds are characterized in that A1, A2 and A3 can independently of one another denote hydrogen, cyano, halogen and sulfonic acid; B1 denotes either halogen, cyano or hydrogen; B2 denotes hydrogen, amide, halogen and an alkyl residue with 1-20 C atoms. In addition the invention concerns activated rhodamine derivatives, correspondingly conjugated biomolecules and their use in diagnostic systems. The claimed invention concerns new pentacyclic rhodamine derivatives whose fluorescence emission maxima are in the range of ca. 520 to 720 nm, biomolecules labelled with these derivatives and their use in diagnostic systems. Numerous rhodamine derivatives are known which can be used as markers (labelled substances) in the form of hydrophilic derivatives with appropriate reactive groups. Such compounds are for example obtained by reacting NHS esters of tetramethylcarboxyrhodamine or carboxy-rhodamine 101 (RHODOS) with proteins containing amino groups, which are used in diagnostic systems. Examples of hapten-fluorescent conjugates are described in EP-A-285179 but the described compounds have absorption maxima at wavelengths of less than 600 nm. EP 0 543 333 discloses long wavelength rhodamine-like derivatives which have an absorption maximum above 600 nm. However, at the time of the invention a conversion of the described compounds into corresponding phosphoramidites was unknown. EP 0 567 622 also discloses the preparation of long wavelength rhodamine derivatives with absorption maxima above 600 nm. However, the synthesis of corresponding nucleic acid conjugates and the use of the described compounds as a component of fluorescence resonance energy transfer systems like those that have become established in nucleic acid analysis (Bio Techniques Vol. 22, No.1, p. 130-138, 1997) has not been previously described. The fluorescent dye fluorescein is widely used because of its spectral properties and its general availability and it is used for a wide variety of applications. In so-called FRET systems fluorescein usually acts as a fluorescence resonance energy donor in which various fluorescence resonance energy acceptors can be potentially used depending on the analytical test procedure. However, the use of FRET systems in nucleic acid analysis has previously been limited to the use of cyanine derivatives such as Cy5 (PCR Methods Appl. 4, 357-362, 1995) and the rhodamine derivatives TAMRA and ROX (Anal.Biochem. 252, 78-88, 1997). The object of the present invention is therefore to provide new rhodamine derivatives with improved spectral properties in the long wavelength range which are especially suitable for forming a fluorescence resonance electron transfer pair together with other dyes to enable the use of biomolecules labelled with the rhodamine derivatives for analytical or diagnostic purposes. Hence the invention concerns compounds of the general formulae in which Ca-Cd each denote a C atom, and Ca and Cb as well as Cc and Cd can either be linked together by a single bond or by a double bond; X1 to X16 denote independently of one another either halogen, sulfonic acid, hydrogen or an alkyl residue with 1-20 C atoms in which the alkyl residue can be substituted with one or several halogen or sulfonic acid residues. R1 and R2 are either identical or different and denote either hydrogen, alkyl with 1-20 C atoms, polyoxyhydrocarbyl units, phenyl or phenylalkyl with 1-3 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain in which the alkyl and/or phenyl residues can be substituted by one or several hydroxy, halogen, sulfonic acid, amino, carboxy or alkoxycarbonyl groups where alkoxy can have 1-4 carbon atoms. R1 contains at least one activatable group. R2 and X4 can be optionally linked together by a bridge composed of 0-2 C atoms. In contrast to the previously known state of the art, these compounds are characterized in that A1, A2 and A3 can independently of one another denote halogen, cyano, hydrogen, carboxylic acid, phosphoric acid or sulfonic acid; B1 denotes either halogen, cyano or hydrogen; and B2 is selected from a group comprising hydrogen, amide, halogen and an alkyl residue with 1-20 C atoms. It has turned out to be advantageous when at least one residue of the group A1, A2, A3 and B1 represents a halogen and in particular fluorine or chlorine. Preferably all residues A1, A2, A3 and B1 are halogens and in particular fluorine or chlorine. The preparation of such compounds is relatively simple when all residues A1, A2, A3 and B1 are either only fluorine or only chlorine. Compounds are also preferred in which B2 is identical with a hydrogen atom. However, B2 can alternatively also denote fluorine or chlorine, such compounds being particularly simple to synthesize when all the residues A1, A2, A3, B1 and B2 are either only fluorine or only chlorine. The residues X1, X2, X3, X4, X7, X10, X14 and X15 are preferably hydrogen. The residues X5, X6, X8, X9, X11, X12, X13 and X16 are preferably methyl residues. Those compounds are particularly preferred in which all residues X1, X2, X2, X4, X7 and X10 represent hydrogen residues and all residues X5, X6, X8, X9, X11 and X12 represent methyl residues. The residues R1 and R2 can either be identical or different but at least R1 contains an activatable group such as amino, hydroxyl or carboxyl. R1 preferably contains exactly one activatable group. In a particularly preferred embodiment R1 is a hydroxyethyl residue or a carboxypropyl residue. If R2 is different from R1, R2 is preferably hydrogen or an alkyl with 1 to 20 C atoms. It is then particularly preferably hydrogen or an ethyl residue. The compounds according to the invention provide molecules which, due to their spectral properties (absorption maxima in the range of ca. 500 nm and above and emission maxima in the range between ca. 520 and 720 nm), are very suitable as dyes and in particular as fluorescent dyes. In this connection the spectral properties of the molecules can be changed by modifying the identity, number and position of the halogen residues with regard to A1, A2, A3 and B1. In this manner it is possible to produce fluorescent dyes with almost any absorption and emission maxima in the range between ca. 520 nm and 720 nm. Hence a subject matter of the invention is also the use of the rhodamine derivatives according to the invention as fluorescent dyes. In order to prepare conjugates which contain the rhodamine derivatives according to the invention, activated derivatives can be synthesized which are for example suitable for labelling biomolecules or other analytical reagents. The activated derivatives are prepared by utilizing at least one of the activatable groups on the residues R1 and R2 and the activation can be carried out by known standard protocols that are known to a person skilled in the art. Usually the activation is achieved by means of at least one hydroxyl group, amino or carboxyl group of R1 and R2. Various reactive groups can be introduced depending on the later application. Phosphoramidites and H phosphonates can for example be derived from a hydroxyl group. Hence rhodamine phosphoramidites or H-phosphonates are usually prepared by previously known protocols (Methods in Mol.Biol.Vol 20, Protocols for Oligonucleotides and Analogs, Synthesis and Properties, S. Agrawal publisher Humana Press Totowa, N.J.). In contrast, N-hydroxy-succinimide (NHS) esters and maleinimide alkylamides are usually derived from a carboxyl group. NHS esters are preferably prepared by the process described in EP 0 543 333 in which the free carboxylic acid is reacted with NHS in the presence of a condensation reagent such as DCC or MEI. Rhodamine isothiocyanates are preferably prepared by reacting amino groups with thiophosgene (Advanced Organic Chemistry, McGraw Hill, 2 nd edition, p. 383, 1997). Hence the invention also concerns activated derivatives of the rhodamines according to the invention. The reactive groups of the activated derivatives are preferably phosphoramidite, N-hydroxy-succinimide (NHS) ester, maleinimide alkylamide, H-phosphonate or isothiocyanate. The invention additionally concerns conjugates which are obtainable by binding rhodamine compounds according to the invention or their activated derivatives. Consequently such conjugates are composed of at least two components, of which one component represents a rhodamine derivative according to the invention. The conjugates are prepared by standard protocols starting from the activated derivatives. The conjugation methods that are suitable in each case are known to a person skilled in the art. The conjugates according to the invention can be used for analytical purposes as soon as a second component of the conjugate can bind to a binding partner to be determined and, after excitation with light of a suitable absorption wavelength, the complex that is formed is detected by means of the emitted fluorescence of the formed complex. The conjugates according to the invention are particularly suitable for analyses for diagnostic purposes or for analyses of medical or biological material. Hence a subject matter of the invention are especially those conjugates which can interact with a biomolecule. These are usually conjugates that usually themselves contain one or several biomolecules as an additional component. These biomolecules contained in the conjugates can for example be single-stranded or double-stranded nucleic acids such as DNA, RNA, oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide derivatives and modified nucleic acid analogues such as e.g. PNA, but also individual nucleotides, nucleotide derivatives, nucleotide analogues or nucleoside triphosphates. Such molecules are labelled at the 5 position preferably by means of an NHS ester or a phosphoramidite or, in contrast, they are labelled at the 3 position preferably by means of a dye-substituted carrier material such as CPG. Labelling at other sites such as the nucleic acid bases is also preferably carried out by means of an NHS ester. When labelling proteins, protein complexes, antibodies or amino acids it is preferable to carry out the conjugation via isothiocyanate. Examples of other conjugate components are vitamins, steroid hormones, lipid molecules and haptens. Furthermore it is also possible to correspondingly label more complex biological structures such as membrane fractions or whole cells. Oligonucleotides that are conjugated with a rhodamine derivative according to the invention represent a special embodiment of the conjugates according to the invention. Oligonucleotides labelled in this manner can be used in previously known methods to detect and analyse nucleic acids such as by in situ hybridization (Meyne and Myzis, Methods Mol.Biol. 33, 63-74, 1994) or also as primers in various sequencing methods (Sheealy et al., Anal.Chem. 67, 247-251, 1995). In addition to nucleic acid labelling by chemical synthesis, substrates for nucleic acid polymerases labelled with rhodamine dyes according to the invention such as ribonucleoside triphosphates or deoxyribo-nucleoside triphosphates can be incorporated into nucleic acids by various enzymatic reactions. This is achieved for DNA with the aid of DNA polymerases for example using the method of nick translation (Rigby et al., J.Mol.Biol. 113, p. 237, 1977) or by random primed labelling (Feinberg and Vogelstein, Anal.Biochem. 137, p. 266, 1984). In the case of RNA this is achieved for example by T3, T7 or SP6 RNA polymerases in the sense of a transcription. An additional method for labelling nucleic acids is via a so-called 3 tailing reaction with the aid of terminal transferase. Hence a subject matter of the invention is also the use of conjugates according to the invention to label nucleic acids by chemical or enzymatic methods and the use of hybridization probes labelled according to the invention for the detection and analysis of nucleic acids. For an analytical test the rhodamine derivative according to the invention is firstly excited with light of a suitable wavelength using for example lasers, laser diodes or LEDs as a light source. The fluorescence is detected by measuring methods that are known to a person skilled in the art depending on the analyte. Examples are fluorescence microscopy for in situ methods or the detection of the emitted radiation by suitable photodiodes. As an alternative to the direct excitation of the dye according to the invention with radiation energy of a suitable wavelength, the excitation can also be achieved by a so-called fluorescence resonance energy transfer. In this technique a second fluorescent dye such as fluorescein is excited with light of a suitable wavelength. Subsequently a so-called non-radiative i.e. radiationless energy transfer onto the rhodamine derivative according to the invention occurs due to the spatial proximity of the two dyes (Van der Meer et al., Resonance Energy Transfer, VCH, 1994). Detection of the light emitted from this molecule at a particular wavelength can be preferably used to quantitatively determine the analyte. Hence the invention also concerns the use of a rhodamine derivative according to the invention or of a corresponding conjugate as a component of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer system. In this method the compounds according to the invention preferably serve as resonance energy acceptors in which case compounds with the following structural formulae have proven to be particularly suitable: Preferred resonance energy donors for all compounds according to the invention, especially JA 270 and JF9, are fluorescein or fluorescein conjugates. Hence the invention also concerns the use of rhodamine derivatives according to the invention or of corresponding conjugates together with fluorescein or corresponding conjugates as a fluorescence resonance energy acceptor in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer system. Hybridization probes such as oligonucleotides labelled with fluorescent dyes that can be detected using the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) are suitable for the quantitative detection of nucleic acids. For example in the case of oligonucleotides the 5 end can be labelled with a dye component of the FRET system and the 3 end can be labelled with the other dye component of the FRET system. In alternative embodiments the oligonucleotides can also be internally labelled. In a certain embodiment such an oligonucleotide labelled with two dyes is used during a nucleic acid amplification to detect the products that are formed by determining the emission of the fluorescence resonance energy donor. If the oligonucleotide is not bound to the target, no fluorescence of the donor resulting from radiation-free energy transfer is measurable. However, if the oligonucleotide binds to the target DNA, the two dye components are spatially separated from one another as a result of exonuclease activities of the DNA polymerase that is used so that it is possible to measure a fluorescence of the FRET donor (U.S. Pat. No. 5,210,015). In preferred embodiments the different dyes are located on two different hybridization probes which can hybridize in spatial proximity to the target nucleic acid. These can for example be two oligonucleotide probes which hybridize to the same strand of the target nucleic acid in which case one dye is located on the 3-terminal nucleotide of the first probe and the other dye is located on the 5-terminal nucleotide of the second probe so that the distance between the two is only a low number of nucleotides and this number can be between 0 and 30. When using fluorescein in combination with a rhodamine derivative according to the invention such as JA 270 or JF9, distances of 0-15 and in particular of 1-5 nucleotides and in many cases of 1 nucleotide have proven to be advantageous. If the nucleotide distances between the dye components are adhered to, it is also possible to use probes that are not terminally but rather internally conjugated with one of the dyes. In the case of double-stranded target nucleic acids it is also possible to use probes that bind to different strands of the target provided a certain nucleotide spacing of 0 to 30 nucleotides between the two dye components is adhered to. Hence a further subject matter of the invention is the use of a conjugate according to the invention composed of an oligonucleotide and a rhodamine derivative according to the invention such as JA 270 or JF9 to analyse nucleic acids wherein an additional conjugate composed of a second oligonucleotide and another fluorescent dye, preferably fluorescein, is used and after exciting a dye which is preferably coupled to the second oligonucleotide, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer can take place. Correspondingly labelled oligonucleotide combinations are named FRET pairs in the following. The use of such FRET pairs has proven to be particularly advantageous for the detection of amplification products during or after a polymerase chain reaction. Hence the invention additionally concerns the use of a conjugate according to the invention as a component of a FRET pair to detect reaction products of a nucleic acid amplification reaction. In a particular embodiment one of the two amplification primers can at the same time be labelled with one of the two dyes that are used and thus contributes one of the two components of the FRET. The use of suitable FRET pairs to detect the amplification products enables a so-called real time monitoring of PCR reactions in which data on the generation of the amplification product can be determined in relation to the number of reaction cycles that have occurred. This is usually achieved by the fact that the oligonucleotides of the FRET pair also hybridize to the target nucleic acid as a result of the reaction and temperature conditions during the necessary annealing of the amplification primers and when suitably excited, a corresponding measurable fluorescence signal is emitted. Hence the data obtained allow the amount of the originally used target nucleic acid to be determined quantitatively. Hence such embodiments are particularly significant for quantitative RT-PCR experiments in which RNA concentrations of a biological sample are quantified. Hence the invention also concerns the use of conjugates according to the invention as a component of a FRET pair to detect reaction products of a nucleic acid amplification reaction in which the reaction product is detected in each cycle. A further subject matter of the invention is the use of conjugates according to the invention as a component of a FRET pair to carry out a quantitative determination of the nucleic acid to be amplified. In another embodiment the amplification product is detected after completion of the amplification reaction in which, after hybridization of the FRET pair to the target nucleic acid to be detected, the temperature is in turn continuously increased as part of a melting curve analysis. At the same time the emitted fluorescence is determined in relation to the temperature. In this manner sequences are detected which hybridize less stringently to the FRET pair due to certain mismatches. The melting points determined in this manner thus serve to detect point mutations or other polymorphisms. Hence the invention also concerns the use of conjugates according to the invention as a component of a FRET pair to determine melting curves especially when identifying polymorphisms and point mutations.

Afterwards 20 g phosphorus pentoxide was added carefully while stirring and heated to boiling for 1 h. Subsequently the solvent was removed in a vacuum and 100 ml 70% sulphuric acid was added to the residue. The solution which slowly coloured red was stirred for 40 min at 120 C. After cooling the reaction mixture was slowly poured into 500 ml ice-cooled ethanol and filtered. 50 ml 60% perchloric acid and 5 l water were added dropwise to the filtered solution. The precipitated dye was filtered and dried over phosphorus pentoxide in a desiccator (yield: 5.6 g). Ca. 2 g of the crude product was dissolved in a mixture of 60 ml acetone and 50 ml 2 N hydrochloric acid and refluxed for 20 h. After cooling the dye was precipitated by the addition of perchloric acid and water and dried. The dye was then prepurified by column chromatography (Alox N/ethanol). Subsequently the dye fraction was filtered, concentrated and again precipitated. Ca. 1 g of the dye was then dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene and refluxed for 5 h. Subsequently the solvent was removed in a water yet vacuum. The residue was distilled a further three times with ca. 50 ml water. Subsequently the residue was taken up in ethanol and filtered. The dye was again precipitated by the addition of perchloric acid and water. The absorption maximum in ethanol was determined to have a wavelength of 615 nm. The compound synthesized in this manner has the following structural formula.

The active ester was prepared analogously to the general synthetic procedure in EP 0543 333 in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and N-hydroxy-succinimide. Example 5 Preparation of a 5-Labelled Oligonucleotide with the Aid of an NHS Ester Labelling of oligonucleotides with the NHS ester according to the invention 1-(3-carboxypropyl)-6-(2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenyl)-11-ethyl-2,2,4,8,10,11-hexamethyl-10,11-dihydro-2H-13-oxa-11-aza-1-azonia-pentacene-O-succinimide ester perchlorate Firstly an oligonucleotide substituted at the 5 end with a terminal amino group was prepared for the labelling reaction. The 5 terminal amino function was introduced in the usual manner by reacting the oligonucleotide with an aminolinker phosphoramidite and namely either with Aminolink 2 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) or with 5-Amino-Modifier C6-TFA (GLEN RESEARCH, Sterling, Va., cat. No. 10-1916-02). Amino-modified oligonucleotide (ca. 10-15 A260 units, corresponding to ca. 50-80 nmol) precipitated by ethanol precipitation was dissolved in 200 l sodium borate buffer, 0.1 mol/l, pH 8.5. After addition of 200 l of a 1.6 mmolar solution of the NHS ester 1-(3-carboxypropyl)-6-(2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenyl)-11-ethyl-2,2,4,8,10,11-hexamethyl-10,11-dihydro-2H-13-oxa-11-aza-1-azonia-pentacene-O-succinimide ester perchlorate in DMF solution, the mixture was allowed to stand for 15 h at room temperature while protected from light.

Example 6 Quantitative RT-PCR by On-line Detection During the Amplification An oligonucleotide labelled at the 5 end with the aid of a phosphoramidite according to the invention by the method described in example 3 was used as part of a FRET pair for the quantitative detection of an amplified nucleic acid. For this in vitro-transcribed RNA of the TNF-alpha gene (Shirai et al., Nature 313, 803-806, 1985) was titrated as a template (10 9 -10 7 copies/mixture) and amplified by a one step RT-PCR. The RT-PCR mixture contained two differently-labelled hybridization probes for on-line detection during the individual PCR steps. The probe located downstream was 5-JA270-labelled according to the invention and the upstream probe was 3 labelled with fluorescein. Both probes hybridized to the sequence of the amplicon and were separated only by a few bases so that a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) could take place between the two labels in the hybridized state. Each of the three reaction mixtures contained: 2.5 U Tth DNA polymerase, 1RT-PCR buffer (Tth DNA polymerase kit), 4 mM Mn 2 , 300 M dATP, 300 M dCTP, 300 M dGTP and 900 M dUTP, 500 ng BSA, 1 l in vitro-transcribed RNA (10 9 , 10 8 and 10 7 copies), 1 M forward primer (17mer, nucleotide position 2588-2602), 1 M reverse primer (17mer, nucleotide position 2956-2973), 0.4 M TNF-alpha(wt) specific 3-fluorescein-labelled hybridization probe (25mer, nucleotide position 2638-2662) and 0.4 M TNF-alpha(wt)-specific hybridization probe 5-labelled according to the invention with JA270-phosphoramidite (25mer, nucleotide position 2666-2690). The reaction mixtures were pipetted into capillaries for the amplification and subjected to the following thermocycles in a suitable Light-Cycler (Wittwer et al., BioTechniques 12, 176-181, 1997) for on-line fluorescence detection during an amplification reaction: The template RNA was reversely transcribed within 10 min at 55 C. (temperature ramp 20 C./s, no measurement). Afterwards the cDNA was denatured for 30 sec at 95 C. (temperature ramp 20 C./s, no measurement). Then the cDNA was amplified for 45 cycles with the aid of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the first step of the PCR the template was denatured for 1 sec at 99 C. (temperature ramp 20 C./s, no measurement). In the second step of the PCR the specific forward and reverse primers as well as the two TNF-alpha(wt)-specific hybridization probes hybridized to the template within 15 sec. at 50 C. so that a FRET effect was detectable. The resulting fluorescence was measured at the end of the annealing time in each capillary according to the manufacturers instructions (temperature ramp 20 C./s, single measurement). In the third step the polymerization was carried out within 18 sec at 72 C. (temperature ramp 20 C./s, no measurement). After 45 cycles of the PCR reaction, the capillaries were cooled for 45 sec. to 40 C. The evaluation shown in FIG. 1 was carried out using a quantification program of the LightCycler according to the manufacturers instructions. In the experiment shown it was possible to detect 10 9 -10 7 copies of in vitro-transcribed RNA and titrate them according to amount wherein 10 9 copies were detected for the first time after 31 cycles, 10 8 copies were detected for the first time after 33 cycles and 10 7 copies were detected for the first time after 36 cycles. Example 7 Mutation Analysis By Determining Melting Curves with the Aid of FRET Pairs An oligonucleotide labelled at the 5 end by the method described in example 3 was used as part of a FRET pair for the detection of the point mutation G to A at nucleotide position 1691 in exon 10 of the human factor V gene (Bertina et al., Nature 369, p. 64, 1994). For this a specific genomic factor V fragment was amplified with the aid of a PCR amplification reaction in a LightCycler (Nittwer et al., BioTechniques 12, 176-181, 1997). The PCR mixture (20 l) contained 50 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 250 g/ml BSA, 200 M dATP, 200 M dGTP, 200 M dCTP, 600 M dUTP, 0.2 M forward primer (nucleotide position 1626-1647 from exon 10), 0.2 M reverse primer (nucleotide position 127-146 from intron 10), 0.1 M 3-fluorescein-labelled hybridization probe (nucleotide position 1684-1701 from exon 101-5 from intron 10), 0.5 M hybridization probe 5 labelled according to the invention with JA270 (nucleotide position 1647-1682, exon 10) and 1.6 U Taq polymerase. In addition either 1 ng factor V wild-type plasmid DNA, 1 ng heterozygote plasmid DNA or 1 ng homozygote mutant plasmid DNA was present in the three mixtures. The 3 labelled probe hybridizing to the mutation site was completely complementary to the wild-type DNA sequence. The second 5 labelled probe according to the invention hybridizes upstream of the 3 labelled probe so that both labels were only separated by one base and a resonance energy transfer could take place. During the melting curve that was carried out after the amplification reaction the shorter 3 labelled probe melted at first so that a resonance energy transfer was no longer possible. Denaturation, amplification and subsequent melting curve were carried out in the LightCycler under the following conditions: Time Temperature Temperature ramp Measurement 1st. Denaturation (1st cycle) 30 sec 95 C. 20 C./sec none 2nd. Amplification (50 cycles) 0 sec 95 C. 20 C./sec none 10 sec 50 C. 20 C./sec single meas. 10 sec 72 C. 5 C./sec none 3rd. Melting curve (1st cycle) 0 sec 95 C. 20 C./sec none 10 sec 45 C. 20 C./sec none 0 sec 85 C. 0.2 C./sec continuous meas. As shown in FIG. 2 it was possible to determine at which temperatures the hybridization probe directed against the locus of the point mutation melted using the measured melting curve and the resulting negative first derivative of the fluorescence intensity versus the melting temperature. In the case of the factor V wild-type plasmid DNA the melting point was 68 C., it was 60 C. for homozygous mutant factor V plasmid DNA and 60 C. and 68 C. for heterozygous factor V plasmid DNA. Short Description of the Figures FIG. 1 shows the result of the experiment described in example 6 for the quantification of mRNA by detection of an amplification product using a FRET pair in which one component of the FRET pair was an oligonucleotide labelled according to the invention. The curves graphically represent the measured fluorescence in relation to the number of cycles carried out. 10 9 copies can be detected for the first time after 31 cycles, 10 8 copies for the first time after 33 cycles and 10 7 copies for the first time after 36 cycles. FIG. 2 shows the result of the experiment described in example 7 for the mutation analysis of the factor V gene with the aid of a melting curve determination in which one component of the FRET pair was an oligonucleotide labelled according to the invention.

of an oxidizing agent and an acid: wherein R 1 is an alkyl group etc., R 2 is an alkyl or aryl group, R 3 and R 4 each independently are a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group or an aryl group, X 1 and X 2 each are a group of nonmetal atoms necessary to form a 5- or 6-membered N-containing heteroring, and M is a hydrogen atom or a cation. This method can give acetal compounds with good efficiency and a high yield. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method of producing a compound having an acetal skeleton, with good efficiency and a high yield. The compound is useful for a photographic coupler, or as an intermediate in a variety of organic synthesis. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hitherto, synthesis of acetals having the structure shown below has not been sufficiently studied. One general method therefor is described in JP-A-5-313322 (JP-A means an unexamined published Japanese patent application). Specifically, as shown in scheme (I) below, it was a method wherein (A) was subjected to methylolation with paraformaldehyde, to synthesize (B), and the resultant (B) was reacted with mercapto azole in the presence of zinc iodide, to obtain (C) as an objective product. However, the above-described method had such problems that (i) Two steps are necessary to obtain the object, (ii) The yield is low in each of the steps, (iii) It is extremely difficult to isolate (B) using a means other than column purification, because (B) of an intermediate is synthesized with a low yield and poor crystallinity, (iv) Paraformaldehyde is adhered onto a cooling tube during the synthesis of (B), and (v) Unless the purity of (B) is increased, the synthesis reaction of (C) does not go well. Compared to such a conventional method, JP-A-5-331145 describes a method in which a reaction is efficiently carried out using a metal salt, whose typical example is copper bromide, as a catalyst. However, this method still has such problems that (1) The yield is not satisfactory, and (2) It causes a heavy load on environment, at the dealing and disposal of metal salt (heavy metal) used as a catalyst. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a method of producing acetal compounds, with good efficiency and high yield, which method improves the above-mentioned drawbacks of the conventional methods. Other and further objects, features, and advantages of the invention will appear more fully from the following description.

Among these, (III-1), (III-2), (III-4), (III-5), and (III-6) are preferable, and (III-1) and (III-4) are particularly preferable. Examples of the substituent include not only those mentioned as substituents for R 1 , but also an alkyl group (e.g. ethyl, butyl, tert-butyl, benzyl) and an aryl group (e.g. phenyl). Further, these groups may further have a substituent. Preferably, the substituent is an alkyl group, an aryl group, an alkylthio group, an alkoxycarbonyl group, or an aryloxycarbonyl group. Further, when R 1 of the compounds each represented by formula (I) or (IV) is a group represented by formula (VI) shown below, Ar in formula (VI) represents a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or aryl group. When Ar represents an alkyl group, specific examples thereof include, for example, methyl, propyl, butyl, decyl, 2-hexyldecyl, octadecyl, isobutyl, and 1,1-dimethylpropyl, which may further have a substituent. Further, when Ar represents an aryl group, specific examples thereof include, for example, phenyl, 1-naphthyl, and 2-naphthyl, which may further have a substituent. When a group represented by Ar has a substituent, specific examples thereof are the substituents mentioned for R 1 . The reaction according to the present invention is carried out in the presence of both an oxidizing agent and an acid. Examples of the oxidizing agent that can be used include an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide, sodium percarbonate (2Na 2 CO 3 .3H 2 O 2 ), manganeses (KMnO 4 , MnO 2 ), halogens (I 2 , Br 2 , Cl 2 ), quinones (chloranil, orthochloranil, DDQ, etc.), dimethylsulfoxide, perchlorates (NaClO 4 , NaClO 3 , KClO 3 , etc.), and periodates (NaIO 4 , KIO 3 , H 5 IO 6 , etc.), and N-halocarboxylic acid amides (N-chlorosuccinimide, N-bromosuccinimide, 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, N-bromophthalimide, etc.). Preferred oxidizing agents are an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide, sodium percarbonate, halogens, perchlorates, and periodates, each of which can be easily discharged into an aqueous layer by washing. Particularly preferred, of these compounds, are an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide and sodium percarbonate, because they prevent the waste water of reaction from including halogens. Preferred acids that can be used are proton acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, and formic acid. of these acids, hydrobromic acid is particularly preferred, in view of reaction selectivity. The molar ratio of the compounds in the reaction is not limited in particular. Each of the compound represented by formula (I); the compound represented by formula (II), paraformaldehyde, or trioxane; and the compound represented by formula (III), may be used in an equimolar amount. Further, in order to accelerate a reaction, any of these compounds may be used in an excess amount. In this case, the excess amount is preferably within 10 times the least amount among the three compounds, and more preferably within 2 times. Further, in order to suppress side reaction, each of the compounds represented by formulae (II) and (III) is preferably used in a molar amount of 1.1 to 2.0 times, more preferably 1.2 to 1.6 times, and particularly preferably 1.4 times, that of the compound represented by formula (I). The oxidizing agent can be used in an amount 0.001 times to 10 times the number of moles of the compound represented by formula (I). Within the range, preferable amount is in the range of 0.05 times to 0.5 times. A particularly preferable amount is in the range of 0.2 to 0.3, in view of cost merits and environment. The acid can be used in an amount 0.1 to 10 times the number of moles of the compound represented by formula (I). Within the range, preferable amount is in the range of 0.5 times to 5 times. Particularly preferably, the amount is in the range of 1 time to 2 times in view of cost merits and environment. The reaction can be carried out in the range of 0 C. to 150 C., preferably from 15 C. to 100 C., and particularly preferably from 20 C. to 80 C. A variety of reaction solvents can be used. Of these solvents, preferred are hydrocarbon-series solvents (e.g. benzene, toluene, hexane), halogen-series solvents (e.g. methylene chloride, chloroform, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichloroethane), ether-series solvents (e.g. tetrahydrofuran, anisole), and aprotic polar solvents (e.g. acetonitrile, nitromethane, dimethylsulfoxide, N,N-dimethylimidazolidinone, N,N-dimethylformamide). Further, a plurality of solvents may be used in a mixture, or alternatively the reaction may be carried out in the absence of a solvent. When a solvent is used, hydrocarbon-series solvents (e.g. benzene, toluene, hexane) and halogen-series solvents (e.g. methylene chloride, chloroform, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichloroethane) are preferred, in viewpoints of reactivity and suppression of by-products. Of these, toluene, hexane, and a mixture thereof are particularly preferred. The mixing ratio by volume of toluene/hexane is preferably 1/1 to 1/4, and most preferably 1/3. When the reaction is carried out using a solvent, with respect to the compound represented by formula (I); the compound represented by formula (II), paraformaldehyde, or trioxane; and the compound represented by formula (III), the concentration of the compound having the least number of moles among the three kinds of compounds is preferably 10 2 to 10 M, more preferably 10 1 to 5 M, and particularly preferably 0.3 to 1 M, with the proviso that paraformaldehyde is calculated in terms of HCHO. The time period of reaction to be carried out may be in the range of 30 minutes to 3 days, and it varies widely depending on the properties of reaction substrates. Generally, the reaction is carried out in the range of 1 hour to 15 hours, and preferably in the range of 2 hours to 10 hours. As a post-treatment of the reaction, after completion of the reaction, a reaction solution can be washed, and then the resulting organic layer can be concentrated. An object can be frequently isolated by adding a suitable solvent into the thus-obtained residue.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a novel compound for photography oxidatively releasing a development inhibitor in a development process, and more particularly to a compound for a silver halide color photographic material having an improved interimage effect and an improved sharpness. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is known that by color developing a silver halide color photographic material, dyes such as indophenol, indoaniline, indamine, azomethine, phenoxazin, phenazine, and dyes similar to the above-described dyes are formed by the reaction of an oxidized aromatic primary amino color developing agent and couplers to form color images. In the system, for the color reproduction, a subtractive color process is usually used and for the process, silver halide emulsions selectively having sensitivities to blue, green and red respectively and color image-forming agents of yellow, magenta, and cyan each of which is in a complementary color relation with each of the above-described silver halide emulsions are used. That is, to form yellow color images, for example, acylacetanilide series or dibenzoylmethane series couplers are used, to form magenta color images, for example, pyrazolone series, pyrazolotriazole series, pyrazolobenzimidazole series, pyrazolopyrazole series, cyanoacetophnenone series, or indazolone series couplers are mainly used, and to form cyan color images, for example, phenol series or naphthol series couplers are used. Now, each of the dyes formed from these couplers does not have an ideal absorption spectrum, in particular, the magenta and cyan dyes each has a broad absorption spectrum and/or has a side absorption in a short wavelength region, which are undesirable for color reproduction of color photographic materials. In particular, the side absorption in a short wavelength region has a tendency of lowering the saturation. As one means for improving the fault, it can be improved to some extent by causing an interimage effect. The interimage effect is described, for example, in Hanson et al, Journal of the Optical Society of America , Vol. 42, pages 663 to 669 and A. Theils, Zeitschrift fur Wissenschftliche Photographie, Photophysigue und Photochemie , Vol. 47, pages 106 to 118 and pages 246 to 255. It is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,536,386 and 3,536,487 and JP-B-48-34169 (the term JP-B as used herein means an examined Japanese patent publication) that the interimage effect is obtained by using 4-thiazoline-2-thione compounds. However, when each of these compounds is mixed with a silver halide emulsion for coating, after preparing the coating composition containing them, the compound causes a bad action with the passage of time and also when the silver halide light-sensitive material is used after storing the light-sensitive material for a long period of time, there occurs a problem of lowering the sensitivity, etc. When the compound is added to a layer containing substantially no silver halide emulsion adjacent to a silver halide emulsion layer, the above-described problem cannot be avoided. On the other hand, a means of releasing a compound of emphasizing the interimage effect by the oxidation during the development process by using a DIR hydroquinone is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,379,529, 3,620,746, 4,377,634, and 4,332,878 and JP-A-6-308689 (the term JP-A as used herein means an unexamined published Japanese patent application). By these means, the occurrence of the above-described bad action after preparing the coating solution and the problem of causing lowering of the sensitivity after storing the light-sensitive material for a long period of time, which material is prepared by coating the coating solution are reduced and the interimage effect is obtained but these improvements are yet insufficient. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a compound for photography for offering a silver halide color photographic material giving an excellent sharpness without reducing other photographic properties. It has now been discovered that the above-described object can be achieved by the present invention described hereinbelow.

That is,-when the total silver amount of the same spectral sensitivity layers is 100%, the silver amount of the high-sensitivity emulsion layer is from 15 to 40%, that of the intermediate-sensitivity emulsion layer is from 20 to 50%, and that of the low-sensitivity emulsion layer is from 20 to 50%. In addition, it is preferred that the coated silver amount of the high-sensitivity emulsion layer is less than the coated silver amount of the intermediate-sensitivity emulsion layer or the low-sensitivity emulsion layer.

EXAMPLE 1 (Synthesis methods of the compounds in the present invention) Synthesis Example 1 (Synthesis of PUG (Compound K) of the Compound I-1) To 180.0 g (1.63 mols) of ammonium dithiocarbamate was added 1.5 liters of isopropyl alcohol, the mixture was stirred and then 268.9 g (1.63 mols) of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate was added dropwise to the mixture. After stirring the resultant mixture for 3 hours under refluxing, 300 ml of water was added to the reaction mixture, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and crystals formed were collected by filtration under a reduced pressure to obtain crude crystals. The crude crystals were recrystallized from ethyl acetate to obtain 188 g (yield 57%) of 4-ethoxycarbonylmethyl-2-mercaptothiazole. In 366 ml of water was suspended 185 g (0.91 mol) of 4-ethoxycarbonylmethyl-2-mercaptothiazole and 366 ml (1.84 mols) of an aqueous solution of 5 mol/l sodium hydroxide was added dropwise to the suspension. After heating the mixture for 2 hours in a steam bath with-stirring, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and 165 ml (1.90 mols) of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added dropwise to the mixture. The crystals formed were collected by filtration under a reduced pressure to provide 139.4 g (yield 87.4%) of 4-carboxymethyl-2-mercaptothiazole. In 350 ml of tetrahydrofuran was dissolved 35 g (0.2 mol) of 4-carobxymethyl-2-mercaptothiazole and while cooling the solution to a temperature below 10 C., a solution made up of 41.3 g (0.2 mol) of N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 50 ml of tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise to the solution followed by stirring for one hour at room temperature. Then, while cooling the mixture to a temperature below 5 C., 15.5 g (0.2 mol) of a methanol solution of 40% N-methylamine was added dropwise to the mixture followed by stirring for 2 hours at room temperature. To the reaction mixture were added 750 ml of water and 500 ml of methanol followed by stirring and solids formed were removed by filtration. The filtrate was concentrated under a reduced pressure and purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtained 28.8 g (yield 76.5%) of the desired compound K (N-metylcarbamoylmethyl-2-mercaptothiazole) having a melting point of 146 to 148 C. The structure of the compound thus obtained was confirmed by various kinds of spectra and the elemental analysis. Compound K Synthesis Example 2 (Synthesis of Compound I-1) In 650 ml of chloroform were dissolved 41.3 g (114 mmols) of 2-pentadecanoylamino-1,4-benzoquinone, 24 g (127 mmols) of Compound K, and 5 g (26 mmols) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate and the solution was stirred for 2 hours at 40 C. under a nitrogen gas atmosphere. The reaction mixture was concentrated under a reduced pressure and 300 ml of methanol was added to the residue formed followed by stirring. Crystals formed were collected by filtration under a reduced pressure to obtain 44.1 g (yield 70.4%) of the desired compound I-1 having a melting point of 135 to 137 C. The structure of the compound was confirmed by various kinds of spectra and the elemental analysis. The properties of the compounds synthesized by the synthesis methods as in Synthesis Example 2 are shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3 below. TABLE 1 Melting Elemetal Analysis (%) Compd.

The swelling ratio (the ratio of the swelled layer thickness to the dry layer thickness) of the sample 101 was 1.8. The compounds used for preparing the sample are shown below. Preparation of the dispersion of organic solid disperse dye: The dye E-1 was dispersed by the following method. That is, water and 200 g of Pluronic F88 (ethylene oxidepropylene oxide block copolymer) made by BASF A.G. were added to 1430 g of a wett cake of a dye containing 30% of methanol followed by stirring to form a slurry having a dye concentration of 6%. Then, in a ultraviscomill (UVM-2) (trade name, manufactured by Aimex Co.) were filled 1700 ml of zirconia beads having an average particle diameter of 0.5 mm and the above-described slurry was passed therethrough and ground for 8 hours at the circumference speed of about 10 meters/second and at a jetting amount of 0.5 liter/minute. The beads were removed by filtration and after adding water to the filtrate to dilute at a dye concentration of 3%, the filtrate was heated for 10 hours at 90 C. for the stabilization. The average particle diameter of the fine dye particles obtained was 0.60 m and the distribution width of the particle diameters (particle diameter standard deviation100/average particle diameter) was 18%. Similarly, the solid dispersions of the dye E-2 and the dye E-3 respectively were obtained. The average particle diameters of the fine dye particles were 0.54 m and 0.56 m respectively.

Comparative Compound A: (the compound described in JP-A-3-226745) Comparative Compound B: (the compound described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,380,633) Comparative Compound C: (the compound released from the compounds I-1, I-2, I-12, etc., of the present invention) Comparative Compounds A, B and C and the compounds of the present invention each was dissolved in four times of tricyclohexyl phosphate, two times of high-boiling organic solvent Oil-3, four times of ethyl acetate, 0.1 times of di-t-octylhydroquinone and two times of U-6, as much as the weight of the compound, under heating. An oily phase component on the solution was added to eight times of aqueous phase component (having a gelatin concentration of 10%, and containing surface active agents W-5 and W-3 each at a concentration of 0.1%) as much as the weight of the oily phase component and the mixture was stirred with maintaining the mixture at a temperature of 50 C. to obtain an emulsified dispersion. The dispersion was added to each layer. Evaluation of samples: After exposing each of the samples 101 to 118 to while light through a continuous wedge, the sample was subjected to the photographic processing described below and image densities obtained were measured. The sensitivities were obtained from the reciprocals of the exposure amounts giving the density of 1.0 about the cyan, magenta, and yellow color image densities of each sample as relative sensitivities to those of the sample 101 taken as 100, respectively and shown as the red sensitivity (S(R)), the green sensitivity (S(G)), and the blue sensitivity (S(B)). Then, each of the samples 101 to 118 was exposed to a red light of the same exposure amount as the red light exposure amount at the above-described white light exposure through the same continuous wedge as the white light exposure and subjected to the photographic processing described below. the difference in the logarithmic values of the exposure amounts logE(R) in the cyan density of 1.0 at the white light exposure and the red light exposure was determined, which was defined as the measure for the interimage effect for the red-sensitive emulsion layer. Similarly, the measures logE(G) and logE(B) of the interimage effect for the green-sensitive emulsion layer and the blue-sensitive emulsion layer were determined. Furthermore, each of the samples 101 to 118 was exposed to a white light through a MTF pattern and subjected to the photographic processing described below. Also, the comparison of the sharpness was performed at the value of MTF of 10 cycles/mm. The summaries of the samples prepared as described above and the evaluation results thereof are shown in Table 7 below.

Also, 10 mg/m 2 of silica particles (particle diameter 0.3 m) and 10 mg/m 2 of aluminum oxide (particle diameter 0.15 m) as abrasive coated with 15% by weight 3-polyoxyethylenepropyloxytrimethoxysilane (polymerization degree 15) were added to the magnetic recording layer as matting agents. Drying thereof was performed at 115 C. for 6 minutes (the rollers and the conveyer of the drying zone were all kept at 115 C.). The color density increase of DB of the magnetic recording layer with an X-Right (blue filter) was about 0.1, the saturated magnetic moment of the magnetic recording layer was 4.2 emu/g, the coercive force thereof was 7.310 4 A/m. and the squareness ratio thereof was 65%. 3-3) Preparation of Lubricating layer A mixture of 25 mg/M 2 of diacetyl cellulose, 6 mg/m 2 of C 6 H 13 CH(OH)C 10 H 20 COOC 40 H 8 , (Compound a), and 9 mg/M 2 of C 50 H 101 O(CH 2 CH 2 0) 16 H (Compound b) was coated. In addition, the mixture was molten in xylene/propylene monomethyl ether (1/1) at 105 C., the molten mixture was poured and dispersed in propylene monomethyl ether of a normal temperature in an amount of 10 times the amount of the molten mixture, and then after dispersing in acetone (average particle diameter 0.01 m), the dispersion was added. Then, 15 mg/m 2 of silica particles (0.3 m) as a matting agent and 15 mg/m 2 of aluminum oxide (0.15 m) coated with 15% by weight 3-polyoxyethylenepropyloxytrimethoxysilane (polymerization degree 15) as an abrasive were added to the layer. Drying was performed at 115 C. for 6 minutes (the rollers and the conveyer in the drying zone were all kept at 115 C.). The lubricating layer had excellent characteristics that the kinematic friction coefficient was 0.06 (stainless steel hard ball of 5 mm in diameter, load 100 g, and speed 6 cm/minute), the static friction coefficient was 0.07 (clip method) or the kinetic a C-friction coefficient of the lubricating layer and the emulsion surface described below was also 0.12.

an electrophotographic toner having polymeric binder and 2-(1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-ylidene 1,1-dioxide)acetamides as charge control agent. wherein n is 1 or 2; R and R 1 are defined in the specification. The compounds are useful as charge-control agents in electrostatographic toners and developers. CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This is a Divisional of application Ser. No. 09/465,190 filed Dec. 15, 1999, now allowed. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to electrostatographic developers and toners containing charge-control agents. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In electrography, image charge patterns are formed on a support and are developed by treatment with an electrographic developer containing marking particles which are attracted to the charge patterns. These particles are called toner particles or, collectively, toner. Two major types of developers, dry and liquid, are employed in the development of the charge patterns. In electrostatography, the image charge pattern, also referred to as an electrostatic latent image, is formed on an insulative surface of an electrostatographic element by any of a variety of methods. For example, the electrostatic latent image may be formed electrophotographically, by imagewise photo-induced dissipation of the strength of portions of an electrostatic field of uniform strength previously formed on the surface of an electrophotographic element comprising a photoconductive layer and an electrically conductive substrate. Alternatively, the electrostatic latent image may be formed by direct electrical formation of an electrostatic field pattern on a surface of a dielectric material. One well-known type of electrostatographic developer comprises a dry mixture of toner particles and carrier particles. Developers of this type are employed in cascade and magnetic brush electrostatographic development processes. The toner particles and carrier particles differ triboelectrically, such that during mixing to form the developer, the toner particles acquire a charge of one polarity and the carrier particles acquire a charge of the opposite polarity. The opposite charges cause the toner particles to cling to the carrier particles. During development, the electrostatic forces of the latent image, sometimes in combination with an additional applied field, attract the toner particles. The toner particles are pulled away from the carrier particles and become electrostatically attached, in imagewise relation, to the latent image bearing surface. The resultant toner image can then be fixed, by application of heat or other known methods, depending upon the nature of the toner image and the surface, or can be transferred to another surface and then fixed. Toner particles often include charge control agents that desirably, provide uniform net electrical charge to toner particles without reducing the adhesion of the toner to paper or other medium. Many types of positive charge control agents, materials which impart a positive charge to toner particles in a developer, have been used and are described in the published patent literature. In contrast, relatively few negative charge control agents, materials which impart a negative charge to toner particles in a developer, are known. Prior negative charge-control agents have a variety of shortcomings. Many charge-control agents are dark colored and cannot be readily used-with pigmented toners, such as cyan, magenta, yellow, red, blue, and green. Some are highly toxic or produce highly toxic by-products. Some are highly sensitive to environmental conditions such as humidity. Some exhibit high throw-off or adverse triboelectric properties in some uses. Use of charge-control agents requires a balancing of shortcomings and desired characteristics to meet a particular situation. The prior art discloses the use of 1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-ylidene 1,1-dioxides as negative charge control agents for electrophotographic toners and developers. The general structural formula for this class of compounds is represented as: Such compounds are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,744,277, 5,719,001, 5,976,753, 5,821,025, 5,766,815, 5,714,295, 5,716,749, 5,750,715, 5,719,000, 5,723,249, 5,821,024, 5,922,499, and 5,739,235. Of these disclosures, U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,499 is particularly notable. Disclosed are compositions with the general structural formula: The compound 2-(1,2-Benzisothiazol-3(2H)-ylidene 1,1-dioxide)acetamide (I) has previously been reported (Melchiorre, Carlo, et al., Ann. Chim. (Rome) (1971), 61(6), 399-414). The method of synthesis utilized, however, is not useful for the preparation of the N-substituted amides of the present invention since the formation of the amide reported by Melchiorre requires the hydrolysis of a nitrile. This hydrolysis procedure can only lead to unsubstituted amides, according to the following reaction sequence. It would be highly desirable to obtain negative charge control agents useful in electrostatographic toners and developers which agents have favorable charging and other relevant characteristics. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides an electrophotographic toner having a polymeric binder and a charge control agent, a 2-(1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-ylidene 1,1-dioxide)acetamide, having the following structure: wherein n is 1 or 2; R and R 1 independently represent hydrogen; linear, branched or cyclic, substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C18 alkyl; substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C10 aryl; substituted or unsubstituted C7 to C11 aralklyl; substituted or unsubstituted C5 to C10 heterocyclic ring; or R and R 1 together with N form a ring structure; or R 1 is a divalent linking group; with the proviso that when n is 2, R 1 is a divalent group. The charge-control agents are useful in electrostatographic toners and developers. It is an advantageous effect of the invention that negatively charging toners can be provided which have favorable charging characteristics. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The term particle size as used herein, or the term size, or sized as employed herein in reference to the termparticles, means the median volume weighted diameter as measured by conventional diameter measuring devices, such as a Coulter Multisizer, sold by Coulter, Inc. of Hialeah, Fla. Median volume weighted diameter is an equivalent weight spherical particle which represents the median for a sample; that is, half of the mass of the sample is composed of smaller particles, and half of the mass of the sample is composed of larger particles than the median volume weighted diameter. The term charge-control, as used herein, refers to a propensity of a toner addendum to modify the triboelectric charging properties of the resulting toner. The term glass transition temperature or T g , as used herein, means the temperature at which a polymer changes from a glassy state to a rubbery state. This temperature (T g ) can be measured by differential thermal analysis as disclosed in Techniques and Methods of Polymer Evaluation, Vol. 1, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1966. The invention provides an electrophotographic toner having a polymeric binder and 2-(1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-ylidene 1,1-dioxide)acetamides as charge control agents which have the following structure: wherein n is 1 or 2 and R and R 1 independently represent hydrogen, linear, branched or cyclic, substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C18 alkyl, such as 2-chloroethyl, methyl, t-butyl, octadecyl, and cyclohexyl; substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C10 aryl such as, phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 4-chlorophenyl, 3-nitrophenyl, 3-hydroxyphenyl, 4-nitrophenyl, 3-methoxyphenyl, 4-methyiphenyl, 3,4,5-trichlorophenyl, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl, 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenyl and 4-nitro-1-naphthyl; substituted or unsubstituted C7 to C11 aralkyl such as benzyl; C5 to C10 heterocyclic ring system such as 2-benzothiazolyl, 2-fuiryl, and 2-thiazolyl; or R and R 1 , together with N form a ring structure such as ethyleneimine, azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine or hexamethyleneimine; or R 1 is a divalent linking group such alkylene, alkylidene, arylene, oxydiarylene, arylenedialkylene, alkylenediarylene or alkylidenediarylene. Examples of these linking groups include 1,4-phenylene, 4,4-methylenediphenylene, 4,4-oxydiphenylene, 1,6-hexamethylene, 4,4-isopropylidene and ,-p-xylylene. Compounds containing two 2-(1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-ylidene 1,1-dioxide)acetamide moieties would be the result of this type of substitution. A preferred class of compounds are those charge control agents having the following structure: wherein R is hydrogen and R 1 represents substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C10 aryl or aralkyl, or heterocyclic ring system. A more preferred class of compounds are those charge control agents having the following structure: wherein R is hydrogen and R 1 represents substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, benzothiaozol-2yl, or naphthyl, most preferably 4-chlorophenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl, 3-methylphenyl, 3-chlorophenyl, 2-nitrophenyl, 3,5-dichlorophenyl, 3-nitro-4-methyl-phenyl, and the like.

Nos. 5,766,815, 5,744,277, 5,750,715, 5,821,025 and 5,714,295. The compounds of the invention can generally tautomerize. Thus, the structure would also include the tautomeric forms: For the sake of brevity, alternate tautomeric forms will not be illustrated herein. However, formulas should be understood to be inclusive of alternate tautomers. In addition to tautomeric forms, the compositions of the invention may, with respect to the 3-ylidene double bond, exist as geometric isomers. Although the configuration of the compounds of the invention is unknown, both geometric isomers are considered to fall within the scope of the invention. The toners of the invention include a charge-control agent of the invention, in an amount effective to modify, and improve the properties of the toner. It is preferred that a charge-control agent improve the charging characteristics of a toner, so the toner quickly charges to a negative value having a suitable absolute magnitude and then maintains about the same level of charge. The compositions used in the toners are negative charge-control agents, thus the toners of the invention achieve and maintain negative charges. It is also preferred that a charge-control agent improve the charge uniformity of a toner composition, that is, it insures that substantially all of the individual toner particles exhibit a triboelectric charge of the same sign with respect to a given carrier. The charge-control agents of the invention are generally lightly colored. It is also preferred that a charge-control agent be metal free and have good thermal stability. The charge-control agents of the invention are metal free and have good thermal stability. Preferred materials described herein are based upon an evaluation in terms of a combination of characteristics rather than any single characteristic. The binders used in formulating the toners of the invention with the charge-controlling additive of the present invention are polyesters having a glass transition temperature of 40 to 120 C., preferably 50 to 100 C. and a weight average molecular weight of 2,000 to 150,000, preferably 10,000 to 100,000. The polyesters are prepared from the reaction product of a wide variety of diols and dicarboxylic acids. Some specific examples of suitable diols are: 1,4-cyclohexanediol; 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol; 1,4-cyclohexanediethanol; 1,4-bis(2-hydroxyethoxy)cyclohexane; 1,4-benzenedimethanol; 1,4-benzenediethanol; norbornylene glycol; decahydro-2,6-naphthalenedimethanol; bisphenol A; ethylene glycol; diethylene glycol; triethylene glycol; 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol; 1,4-butanediol; 2,3-butanediol; 1,5-pentanediol; neopentyl glycol; 1,6-hexanediol; 1,7-heptanediol; 1,8-octanediol; 1,9-nonanediol; 1,10-decanediol; 1,12-dodecanediol; 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,6-hexanediol; 4-oxa-2,6-heptanediol and etherified diphenols. Suitable dicarboxylic acids include: succinic acid; sebacic acid; 2-methyladipic acid; diglycolic acid; thiodiglycolic acid; fumaric acid; adipic acid; glutaric acid; cyclohexane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid; cyclohexane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid; cyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid; 2,5-norbomanedicarboxylic acid; phthalic acid; isophthalic acid; terephthalic acid; 5-butylisophthalic acid; 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid; 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid; 1,5-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid; 4,4-sulfonyldibenzoic acid; 4,4-oxydibenzoic acid; binaphthyldicarboxylic acid; and lower alkyl esters of the acids mentioned. Polyfunctional compounds having three or more carboxyl groups, and three or more hydroxyl groups are desirably employed to create branching in the polyester chain. Triols, tetraols, tricarboxylic acids, and functional equivalents, such as pentaerythritol, 1,3,5-trihydroxypentane, 1,5-dihydroxy-3-ethyl-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)pentane, trimethylolpropane, trinellitic anhydride, pyromellitic dianhydride, and the like are suitable branching agents. Presently preferred polyols are glycerol and trimethylolpropane. Preferably, up to about 15 mole percent, preferably 5 mole percent, of the reactant diol/polyol or diacid/polyacid monomers for producing the polyesters can be comprised of at least one polyol having a functionality greater than two or poly-acid having a functionality greater than two. Variations in the relative amounts of each of the respective monomer reactants are possible for optimizing the physical properties of the polymer. The polyesters of this invention are conveniently prepared by any of the known polycondensation techniques, e.g., solution polycondensation or catalyzed melt-phase polycondensation, for example, by the transesterification of dimethyl terephthalate, dimethyl glutarate, 1,2-propanediol and glycerol. The polyesters also can be prepared by two-stage polyesterification procedures, such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,140,644 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,217,400. The latter patent is particularly relevant, because it is directed to the control of branching in polyesterification. In such processes, the reactant glycols and dicarboxylic acids, are heated with a polyfunctional compound, such as a triol or tricarboxylic acid, and an esterification catalyst in an inert atmosphere at temperatures of 190 to 280 C., especially 200 to 240 C. Subsequently, a vacuum is applied, while the reaction mixture temperature is maintained at 220 to 240 C., to increase the products molecular weight. The degree of polyesterification can be monitored by measuring the inherent viscosity (I.V.) of samples periodically taken from the reaction mixture. The reaction conditions used to prepare the polyesters should be selected to achieve an I.V. of 0.10 to 0.80 measured in methylene chloride solution at a concentration of 0.25 grams of polymer per 100 milliliters of solution at 25 C. An I.V. of 0.10 to 0.60 is particularly desirable to insure that the polyester has a weight average molecular weight of 10,000 to 100,000, preferably 55,000 to 65,000, a branched structure and a Tg in the range of about 50 to about 100 C. Amorphous polyesters are particularly well suited for use in the present invention. After reaching the desired inherent viscosity, the polyester is isolated and cooled. One useful class of polyesters comprises residues derived from the polyesterification of a polymerizable monomer composition comprising: a dicarboxylic acid-derived component comprising: about 75 to 100 mole % of dimethyl terephthalate and about 0 to 25 mole % of dimethyl glutarate and a diol/poly-derived component comprising about 90 to 100 mole % of 1,2-propanediol and about 0 to 10 mole % of glycerol. Many of the aforedescribed polyesters are disclosed in the patent to Alexandrovich et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,156,937. Another useful class of polyesters is the non-linear reaction product of a dicarboxylic acid and a polyol blend of etherified diphenols disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,681,106; 3,709,684; and 3,787,526. A preferred group of etherified bisphenols within the class characterized by the above formula in U.S. Pat. No. 3,787,526 are polyoxypropylene 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) propane and polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxy, 2,6-dichlorophenyl) propane wherein the number of oxyalkylene units per mol of bisphenol is from 2.1 to 2.5. The etherified diphenols disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,709,684 are those prepared from 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) propane or the corresponding 2,6,2,6-tetrachloro or tetrafluoro bisphenol alkoxylated with from 2 to 4 mols of propylene or ethylene oxide per mol of bisphenol. The etherified diphenols disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,681,106 have the formula: wherein z is 0 or 1, R is an alkylidene radical containing from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, a sulfur atom, an oxygen atom, X and Y are individually selected from the group consisting of alkyl radicals containing from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, hydrogen, and a phenyl radical with the limitation that at least X or Y is hydrogen in any X and Y pair on adjacent carbon atoms, n and m are integers with the proviso that the average sum of n and m is from about 2 to about 7; and each A is either a halogen atom or a hydrogen atom. An average sum of n and m means that in any polyol blend some of the etherified diphenols within the above formula may have more than 7 repeating ether units but that the average value for the sum of n and m in any polyhydroxy composition is from 2 to 7. A preferred group of said etherified diphenols are those where the average sum of n and m is from about 2 to about 3. Thus, although the sum of n and m in a given molecule may be as high as about 20, the average sum in the polyol composition will be about 2 to about 3. Examples of these preferred etherified diphenols include: polyoxyethylene(2.7)-4-hydroxyphenyl-2-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl ethane; polyoxyethylene(2.5)-bis(2,6-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl) sulfone; polyoxypropylene(3)-2,2-bis(2,6-difluoro-4-hydroxyphenyl) propane; and polyoxyethylene(1.5)-polyoxypropylene(1.0)-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) sulfone. A preferred polyhydroxy composition used in said polyester resins are those polyhydroxy compositions containing up to 2 mol percent of an etherified polyhydroxy compound, which polyhydroxy compound contains from 3 to 12 carbon atoms and from 3 to 8 hydroxyl groups. Exemplary of these polyhydroxy compounds are sugar alcohols, sugar alcohol anhydrides, and mono and disaccharides. A preferred group of said polyhydroxy compounds are sorbitol, 1,2,3,6-hexantetrol; 1,4-sorbitan; pentaerythritol, xylitol, sucrose, 1,2,4-butanetriol, 1,2,5-pentanetriol; xylitol; sucrose, 1,2,4-butanetriol; and erythro and threo 1,2,3-butanetriol. Said etherified polyhydroxy compounds are propylene oxide or ethylene oxide derivatives of said polyhydroxy compounds containing up to about 10 molecules of oxide per hydroxyl group of said polyhydroxy compound and preferably at least one molecule of oxide per hydroxyl group. More preferably the molecules of oxide per hydroxyl group is from 1 to 1.5. Oxide mixtures can readily be used. Examples of these derivatives include polyoxyethylene(20) pentaerythritol, polyoxypropylene(6) sorbitol, polyoxyethylene(65) sucrose, and polyoxypropylene(25) 1,4-sorbitan. The polyester resins prepared from this preferred polyhydroxy composition are more abrasion resistant and usually have a lower liquid point than other crosslinked polyesters herein disclosed. Polyesters that are the non-linear reaction product of a dicarboxylic acid and a polyol blend of etherified polyhydroxy compounds, discussed above, are commercially available from Reichhold Chemical Company. To illustrate the invention the examples provided herein use an poly(etherified bisphenol A fumarate) sold as Atlac 382ES by Reichhold or sold as Kao C by Kao Corp. An optional but preferred component of the toners of the invention is colorant: a pigment or dye. Suitable dyes and pigments are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. Re. 31,072 and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,160,644; 4,416,965; 4,414,152; and 2,229,513. One particularly useful colorant for toners to be used in black and white electrostatographic copying machines and printers is carbon black. Colorants are generally employed in the range of from about 1 to about 30 weight percent on a total toner powder weight basis, and preferably in the range of about 2 to about 15 weight percent. The toners of the invention can also contain other additives of the type used in previous toners, including leveling agents, surfactants, stabilizers, and the like. The total quantity of such additives can vary. A present preference is to employ not more than about 10 weight percent of such additives on a total toner powder composition weight basis. The toners can optionally incorporate a small quantity of low surface energy material, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,517,272 and 4,758,491. Optionally the toner can contain a particulate additive on its surface such as the particulate additive disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,192,637. A preformed mechanical blend of particulate polymer particles, charge-control agent, colorants and additives can, alternatively, be roll milled or extruded at a temperature sufficient to melt blend the polymer or mixture of polymers to achieve a uniformly blended composition. The resulting material, after cooling, can be ground and classified, if desired, to achieve a desired toner powder size and size distribution. For a polymer having a Tg in the range of about 50 C. to about 120 C., a melt blending temperature in the range of about 90 C. to about 150 C. is suitable using a roll mill or extruder. Melt blending times, that is, the exposure period for melt blending at elevated temperature, are in the range of about 1 to about 60 minutes. After melt blending and cooling, the composition can be stored before being ground. Grinding can be carried out by any convenient procedure. For example, the solid composition can be crushed and then ground using, for example, a fluid energy or jet mill, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,089,472. Classification can be accomplished using one or two steps. In place of blending, the polymer can be dissolved in a solvent in which the charge-control agent and other additives are also dissolved or are dispersed. The resulting solution can be spray dried to produce particulate toner powders. Limited coalescence polymer suspension procedures as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,833,060 are particularly useful for producing small sized, uniform toner particles. The toner particles have an average diameter between about 0.1 micrometers and about 100 micrometers, and desirably have an average diameter in the range of from about 1.0 micrometer to 30 micrometers for currently used electrostatographic processes. The size of the toner particles is believed to be relatively unimportant from the standpoint of the present invention; rather the exact size and size distribution is influenced by the end use application intended. So far as is now known, the toner particles can be used in all known electrostatographic copying processes. The amount of charge-control agent used typically is in the range of about 0.2 to 10.0 parts per hundred parts of the binder polymer. In particularly useful embodiments, the charge-control agent is present in the range of about 1.0 to 4.0 parts per hundred. The developers of the invention include carriers and toners of the invention. Carriers can be conductive, non-conductive, magnetic, or non-magnetic. Carriers are particulate and can be glass beads; crystals of inorganic salts such as ammonium chloride, or sodium nitrate; granules of zirconia, silicon, or silica; particles of hard resin such as poly(methyl methacrylate); and particles of elemental metal or alloy or oxide such as iron, steel, nickel, carborundum, cobalt, oxidized iron and mixtures of such materials. Examples of carriers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,850,663 and 3,970,571. Especially useful in magnetic brush development procedures are iron particles such as porous iron, particles having oxidized surfaces, steel particles, and other hard and soft ferromagnetic materials such as gamma ferric oxides or ferrites of barium, strontium, lead, magnesium, copper, zinc or aluminum. Copper-zinc ferrite powder is used as a carrier in the examples hereafter. Such carriers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,042,518; 4,478,925; and 4,546,060. Carrier particles can be uncoated or can be coated with a thin layer of a film-forming resin to establish the correct triboelectric relationship and charge level with the toner employed. Examples of suitable resins are the polymers described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,547,822; 3,632,512; 3,795,618 and 3,898,170 and Belgian Patent No. 797,132. Polymeric siloxane coatings can aid the developer to meet the electrostatic force requirements mentioned above by shifting the carrier particles to a position in the triboelectric series different from that of the uncoated carrier core material to adjust the degree of triboelectric charging of both the carrier and toner particles. The polymeric siloxane coatings can also reduce the frictional characteristics of the carrier particles in order to improve developer flow properties; reduce the surface hardness of the carrier particles to reduce carrier particle breakage and abrasion on the photoconductor and other components; reduce the tendency of toner particles or other materials to undesirably permanently adhere to carrier particles; and alter electrical resistance of the carrier particles. In a particular embodiment, the developer of the invention contains from about 1 to about 20 percent by weight of toner of the invention and from about 80 to about 99 percent by weight of carrier particles. Usually, carrier particles are larger than toner particles. Conventional carrier particles have a particle size of from about 5 to about 1200 micrometers and are generally from 20 to 200 micrometers. Carriers can also be in liquid form. Useful liquifiable carriers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,520,681; 3, 975,195; 4,013,462; 3,707,368; 3,692,516 and 3,756,812. The carrier can comprise an electrically insulating liquid such as decane, paraffin, Sohio Odorless Solvent 3440 (a kerosene fraction marketed by the Standard Oil Company, Ohio), various isoparaffinic hydrocarbon liquids, such as those sold under the trademark Isopar G by Exxon Corporation and having a boiling point in the range of 145 C. to 186 C., various halogenated hydrocarbons such as carbon tetrachloride, trichloromonofluoromethane, and the like, various alkylated aromatic hydrocarbon liquids such as the alkylated benzenes, for example, xylenes, and other alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons such as are described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,899,335. An example of one such useful alkylated aromatic hydrocarbon liquid which is commercially available is Solvesso 100 sold by Exxon Corporation. The toners of the invention are not limited to developers which have carrier and toner, and can be used, without carrier, as single component developer. The toner and developer of the invention can be used in a variety of ways to develop electrostatic charge patterns or latent images. Such developable charge patterns can be prepared by a number of methods and are then carried by a suitable element. The charge pattern can be carried, for example, on a light sensitive photoconductive element or a non-light-sensitive dielectric surface element, such as an insulator coated conductive sheet. One suitable development technique involves cascading developer across the electrostatic charge pattern. Another technique involves applying toner particles from a magnetic brush. This technique involves the use of magnetically attractable carrier cores. After imagewise deposition of the toner particles the image can be fixed, for example, by heating the toner to cause it to fuse to the substrate carrying the toner. If desired, the unfused image can be transferred to a receiver such as a blank sheet of copy paper and then fused to form a permanent image. The invention is further illustrated by the following Examples. Thermogravimetric analyses were measured with a Perkin-Elmer Series 7 Thermal Analysis system at a heating rate of 10 C./min in air from 25-500 C. EXAMPLES Preparation of Charge Control Agents: The following illustrates the preparation of N-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-(1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-ylidene 1,1-dioxide)acetamide (Compound S1 in Table 1 below). A mixture of 15.47 g (50 mmol) of 5-(1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-ylidene 1,1-dioxide)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione, 6.91 g (50 mmol) of 4-nitroaniline and 300 ml of toluene was heated at reflux for 1.25 hrs and cooled. The solid was collected, washed with toluene then with ligroine and dried. The yield of product was 16.16 g (93.6% of theory); mp294 C. Analytical data for this compound and analogously prepared compounds are shown in Tables 1 to 3 below. TABLE 1 TGA, Calcd Found Example X Yield, % mp, C. C.

One of the rolls was heated and controlled to a temperature of 120 C., the other roll was cooled with chilled water. A known weight of the charge control agent (CCA) was then compounded into the melt. An example batch formula would be 25 g of polyester and 0.5 g of CCA, giving a product with 2 part CCA per 100 parts of polymer. The melt was compounded for 15 minutes, peeled from the mill and cooled. The melt was coarse ground in a Thomas-Wiley laboratory mechanical mill using a 2 mm screen. The resulting material was fine ground in a Trost TX air jet mill at a pressure of 70 psi and a feed rate of 1 g/hr. The ground toner has a mean volume average particle size of approximately 8.5 microns. Following the-above procedure, clear toners containing only the charge-control agent and polyester were made for each CCA. Employing the same compounding and grinding procedure a control toner containing no charge agent was also prepared. Developers based on these toners were subsequently prepared to determine the effect of the CCA on toner charging properties. Preparation of Developers: Developers comprising a mixture of toner and carrier particles was prepared for each charge agent evaluated. The carrier particles were polysiloxane resin coated strontium ferrite. This carrier type has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,478,925. Developers using this carrier type were formulated at 8% toner concentration: 0.32 g of toner was added to 3.68 g carrier to make a developer. Testing of Developers: Two 4 g developers at 8% toner concentration were prepared by weighing 0.32 g toner and 3.68 g carrier into two separate 4 dram PE plastic vials (Vial1 and Vial2). The developer was mixed together with a spatula. Both capped vials were placed in a Wrist-Shaker. The developer was vigorously shaken at about 2 Hertz and overall amplitude of about 11 cm for 2 minutes to triboelectrically charge the developer. A Q/m measurement on 0.1 g developer from Vial 1 was run using a charge-measurement device described below. The measurement conditions were: 0.1 g developer, 30 sec, 2000 V, negative polarity. The developer in Vial 1 was subsequently exercised on a bottlebrush device for 10 minutes. The bottlebrush consists of a cylindrical roll with a rotating magnetic core at 2000 revolutions per minute. The magnetic core has 12 magnetic poles arranged around its periphery in an alternating north-south fashion. This closely approximates the unreplenished aging of the developer in the electrostatographic development process. After this additional 10 minutes exercising the toner charge was measured on the measurement device. An Admix-dust measurement was run on this developer to estimate the amount of admix dust. Vial 2 was subsequently placed on a bottlebrush device for 60 minutes. After this additional 60 minutes exercising the toner charge was measured on the charge measuring device. The developer from vial 2 was subsequently stripped off of all toner and rebuilt with fresh toner at 8%TC in Vial3. The developer was mixed together with a spatula and the capped vial was placed in a Wrist-Shaker and vigorously shaken at about 2 Hertz and an overall amplitude of about 11 cm for 2 minutes to triboelectrically charge the developer. A 2-minute rebuilt Q/m measurement on 0.1 g developer from. Vial 3 was run using the measurement device. The measurement conditions were: 0.1 g developer, 30 sec, 2000 V, negative polarity. The developer in Vial 3 was subsequently exercised on a bottlebrush device for 10 minutes. After this additional 10 minutes exercising the 10-minute rebuilt toner charge was measured on the device. A 10-minute rebuilt Admix-dust measurement was run on this developer to estimate the amount of admix dust. Method of Charge Measurement: Toner charge was measured by vigorously exercising the developer mix to generate a triboelectrical charge, sampling the developer mix, and then measuring the toner charge with a charge measurement device. U.S. Pat. No. 5,405,727 describes the analytical test method for measuring the toner charge/mass ratio of this developer type. This method was employed to measure charge to mass of developers made with strontium ferrite carrier particles coated with polysiloxane. Toner charge/mass (Q/m) was measured in microcoulombs per gram of toner (C/gm) in a charge-measurement device. To measure the Q/m, a 100 mg sample of the charged developer was placed in the charge measuring device, and the charge to mass of the transferred toner was measured. This involves placing the 100 mg sample of the charged developer in a sample dish situated between a pair of circular parallel plates and subjecting it simultaneously for 30 seconds to a 60 Hz magnetic field and an electric field of about 200 volts/cm between the plates. The toner is thus separated from the carrier and is attracted to and collected on the top plate having polarity opposite to the toner charge. The total toner charge is measured by an electrometer connected to the plate, and that value is divided by the weight of the toner on the plate to yield the charge per mass of the toner (Q/m). The developer was mixed on a device that simulated the mixing that occurs in a printer developer station to charge the toner particles. The triboelectric charge of the toner was then measured after 2, 10, and 60 minutes of mixing. The amount of dust was measure at the 10-minute level as mg of toner that dusts off per gram of fresh toner. The developer was subsequently stripped off of all toner and rebuilt with fresh toner. The triboelectric charge of the toner was then measured after 2 and 10 minutes of mixing. The amount of dust was again measured at the 10-minute level as mg of toner that dusts off per gram of admixed fresh toner. In a printer, replenishment toner is added to the developer station to replace toner that is removed in the process of printing copies. This toner is uncharged and gains a triboelectric charge by mixing with the developer. During this mixing process, uncharged or low charged particles can become airborne and result in background on prints or dust contamination within the printer. Admix Toner Dust Measurement: The propensity of developers to form low charging toner dust was measured using an admix dust test. This procedure has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,405,727. Admix dust values were determined by admixing 50% fresh toner (0.16 g) to the remaining developer and mixing lightly to provide a final toner concentration of about 16%, followed by 30 second exercise on the wrist action shaker. This developer was then placed on a roll containing a rotating magnetic core, similar to a magnetic brush for electrostatic development. A weighing paper was placed inside the metal sleeve and the sleeve was placed over the brush and the end-piece was attached. The electrical connections were checked to ensure that the core was grounded. The electrometer was zeroed and the throw-off device was operated at 2000 rpm for 1 minute. The electrometer charge of the dust and the amount of dust collected on the weighing paper was measured and reported as the admix dust value (mg of dust), also referred to as throw off (TO). In the Tables below, BB refers to the use of a bottle brush and WS refers to the use of a Wrist Shaker. Evaluation of Charging Properties: Effective charge-control agents are ones that increase the absolute charge level of the toner relative to the control toner containing no charge-control agent. The level of charge can generally be increased by increasing the concentration of the charge-control agent. Toners that charge rapidly and maintain that charge with extended exercise time are desirable. The initial Q/m indicates if the toner is charging rapidly. Measurements at 60 and 120 minutes indicate whether the material is maintaining a constant charge with life. This exercise time represents the mixing that the developer experiences in an electrophotographic printer. Exercised toners that show a little or no decrease in Q/m over time are preferred over formulations that show a large decrease. A toner with a constant charge level will maintain a consistent print density when compared to a formulation that does not have a constant charge/mass level. The triboelectric charge of electrophotographic developers changes with life. This instability in charging level is one of the factors that require active process control systems in electrophotographic printers to maintain consistent print to print image density. It is desirable to have low charge/mass (Q/m) developers that are stable with life. A Q/m consistent with electrostatic transfer and higher density capabilities is desired. In some cases, a lower Q/m offers advantages of improved transfer and higher image densities. However, low Q/m is often achieved at a severe penalty in the throw-off (dust) amounts, which is undesirable as it results in a dusty developer. Low throw-off values (10 mg of dust) combined with low Q/m (10 to 40 C/g) is desirable because we attain lower charge without paying the penalty of higher dust. Shown in Tables 4 are the 10-minute Q/m and 10-minute admix throw-off on a rebuilt developer (subsequent to aging for 1 hour on the bottlebrush), for a series of charge agents based on 2-(1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-ylidene 1,1-dioxide)acetamides. In general, high Q/m values resulted in low dust and conversely, low Q/m resulted in high dust values.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to antibacterial and antimicrobial compounds useful for pharmaceutical preparations, veterinary drugs, drugs for fisheries use and antibacterial and antimicrobial preservatives. This invention also relates to antibacterial and antimicrobial drugs and antibacterial and antimicrobial preparations containing these compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Since the discovery of norfloxacin, attempts have been made to improve the antimicrobial activity and pharmacokinetics of synthetic quinolone antimicrobial agents. As a result, a number of compounds are clinically available today as chemotherapeutic drugs efficacious in treating systemic infectious diseases. In recent years, however, bacteria hyposensitive to these drugs have been increasing in the field of clinical medicine. Moreover, some bacteria tolerant to drugs other than these synthetic quinolone antimicrobial agents have also become hyposensitive thereto. Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an example of such bacteria having no sensitivity to -lactam antibiotics. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop highly efficacious drugs in the field of clinical medicine. In addition, it is reported that these antimicrobial agents sometimes induce convulsions when administered together with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and exhibit other side effects such as phototoxicity. Thus, there is also a need to develop safer quinolone drugs. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the above, the present inventors have conducted extensive studies with the aim of providing compounds which satisfy the aforementioned requirements. As a result, the present inventors have discovered that substituted aminomethylpyrrolidine derivatives represented by the following formulae (I) and (XI), their salts and hydrates thereof have a broad antibacterial spectrum, exhibit potent antibacterial activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria including Gram positive bacteria, particularly MRSA, and also have favorable pharmacokinetics and high safety. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of these findings. Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention relates to a compound represented by the following formula (I), its salts and hydrates thereof: wherein R 1 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms; R 2 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, wherein the alkyl group represented by R 2 may have at least one substituent selected from the group consisting of a hydroxyl group, a halogen atom, an alkylthio group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms and an alkoxyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms; R 3 represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a halogen atom, a carbamoyl group, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkoxyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an alkylthio group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, wherein the alkyl group represented by R 3 may have at least one substituent selected from the group consisting of a hydroxyl group, a halogen atom and an alkoxyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms; R 4 and R 5 each independently represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, a halogen atom, a carbamoyl group, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkoxyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an alkylthio group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, wherein the alkyl group represented by R 4 and R 5 may have at least one substituent selected from the group consisting of a hydroxyl group, a halogen atom and an alkoxyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and R 4 and R 5 may be combined to form a hydroxyimino group, a poly-methylene chain having 3 to 6 carbon atoms (so as to form a spiro cyclic structure together with the pyrrolidine ring) or an alkyloxyimino group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms; R 6 and R 7 each independently represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms; n is an integer of 1 to 3; and Q is a partial structure represented by the following formula (II): wherein R 8 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, a halogenoalkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a cyclic alkyl group having 3 to 6 carbon atoms which may have one or more substituents, an aryl group which may have one or more substituents, a heteroaryl group which may have one or more substituents, an alkoxyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an alkylamino group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms;

Particular examples thereof include optionally substituted alkoxycarbonyl groups (e.g., tert-butoxycarbonyl and 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl), optionally substituted aralkyloxycarbonyl groups (e.g., benzyloxycarbonyl, p-methoxybenzyloxycarbony and p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl), optionally substituted acyl groups (e.g., acetyl, methoxyacetyl, trifluoroacetyl, chloroacetyl, pivaloyl, formyl and benzoyl), optionally substituted alkyl groups and optionally substituted aralkyl groups (e.g., tert-butyl, benzyl, p-nitrobenzyl, p-methoxybenzyl and triphenylmethyl), ethers (e.g., metoxymethyl, tert-butoxymethyl, tetrahydropyranyl and 2,2,2-trichloroethoxymethyl) and substituted silyl groups (e.g., trimethylsilyl, isopropyldimethylsilyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl, tribenzylsilyl and tert-butyldiphenylsilyl). The compound of the formula (XV) can be produced as a cis-compound by forming a compound (pyrroline derivative) wherein the carbon atom to which the substituent R 4 is bonded and the adjacent carbon atom is bonded via a double bond followed by catalytic reduction. Alternatively, the cis-compound can be produced by once forming a compound wherein the substituent R 4 and the substituent moiety having the cyclic structure are located at the trans-configuration and then inverting the configuration of the substituent R 4 . When the compound represented by formula (I) or formula (XI) according to the first and second aspects of the present invention has a structure allowing for the existence of diastereomers, it is preferable that a compound comprised of a single diastereomer is administered to human beings or animals. The term comprised of a single diastereomer as used herein means not only one being completely free from other diastereomers, but also one having a certain degree of chemically purity. That is to say, it may contain other diastereomers so long as neither the physical constants nor the physiological activities thereof are affected thereby. Also, the term stereochemically pure as used herein means a compound consisting of one of the isomers, when the compound has two or more isomers due to one or more asymmetric carbon atoms contained therein. The term pure of this case can be understood in the same manner as the abovementioned case. The pyridonecarboxylic acid derivatives of the first and second aspect of the present invention may be in a free state. Alternatively, they may be converted into acid addition salts or carboxylates thereof. Examples of the acid addition salts include inorganic acid salts (e.g., hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, hydrobromide, hydroiodide and phosphate) and organic acid salts (e.g., acetate, methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, citrate, maleate, fumarate and lactate). Examples of the carboxylates include alkali metal salts (e.g., lithium salt, sodium salt and potassium salt), alkaline earth metal salts (e.g., magnesium salt and calcium salt), ammonium salt, triethylamine salt, N-methylglucamine salt and tris-(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane salt. Either inorganic salts or organic salts are usable therefor. These free pyridonecarboxylic acid derivatives or their acid addition salts or carboxylates may occur as hydrates thereof. On the other hand, quinolone derivatives wherein the carboxylate moiety is an ester are useful as intermediates for synthesis or as prodrugs. For example, alkyl esters, benzyl esters, alkoxyalkyl esters, phenylalkyl esters and phenyl esters are useful as synthetic intermediates. The esters usable as prodrugs are those which are easily cleaved in vivo to thereby form free carboxylates. Examples thereof include acetoxymethyl ester, pivaloyloxymethyl ester, ethoxycarbonyl ester, choline ester, dimethylaminoethyl ester, 5-indanyl ester and oxoalkyl esters such as phthalidinyl ester, 5-alkyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxol-4-ylmethyl ether and 3-acetoxy-2-oxobutyl ester and the like.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to catalysts used for the bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins, to novel phosphine chalcogenides which are useful as ligands of the catalysts, to processes for the bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins using the catalysts, and to methods for production of succinate derivatives. 2. Description of the Prior Art Processes for the alkoxycarbonylation of olefins have been proposed in (1) J. Am. Chem. Soc., 98, 1806(1976); (2) J. Mol. Cat. A: Chemical 111, L3-L6(1996); (3) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans., 1031(1993); (4) J. Org. Chem., 57, 4189(1992), and satisfactory results have been achieved by these processes. For the bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins, processes have been reported in documents (5) J. Org. Chem., 37, 2034(1972),; (6) J. Am. Chem. Soc., 98, 1806(1976); (7) Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 64, 3600(1991); (8) Tetrahedron Lett., 28, 325(1987); (9) J. Am. Chem. Soc., 98, 1810(1976); (10) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 32, 1719(1993); and (11) Organometallics, 11, 1975(1992). These processes are, however, respectively disadvantageous: The processes in the documents (5) and (6) are low in yield, the process in the document (7) gives a mixture of a monoalkoxycarbonylated compound and a bisalkoxycarbonylated compound, the process in the document (8) requires the addition of tetramethylurea or propylene oxide and ethyl ortho-acetate, the process in the document (9) should be conducted under high pressure conditions (3 atm), processes in the documents (10) and (11) accompany oligomerization. In a document (12) Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 69, 735(1996) is disclosed the use of an optically active bisoxazoline as a ligand in the bisalkoxycarbonylation to obtain an optically active substance. This process requires a long time for the reaction and is low in reactivity. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a catalyst which can catalyze the bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins with efficiency. It is another object of the invention to provide a novel phosphine chalcogenide compound which is useful as a ligand in a catalyst for the asymmetric bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins. A further object of the invention is to provide an efficient process for the bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins. It is a yet another object of the invention to provide a process by which corresponding succinate derivatives can be obtained from olefins in high yields under moderate conditions. The present inventors made intensive investigations to achieve the above objects, and found that the use of a noble metal compound catalyst including a phosphine chalcogenide as a ligand can catalyze the bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins with efficiency. The invention has been accomplished based upon the finding. To be more specific, the invention provides, in an aspect, a catalyst for the bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins comprising a phosphine chalcogenide and a noble metal compound, the phosphine chalcogenide being of the following formula (1): wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are, independently, an alkyl group or an aryl group each of which may have a substituent, and A is a Group 16 element of the Periodic Table; R 1 , R 2 or R 3 may be combined, directly or through abridging group, with one another where the groups to be combined may be attached either to an identical phosphorus atom or to different phosphorus atoms. The element A may include, for example, an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom and a selenium atom. As examples of the phosphine chalcogenide, there maybe mentioned triphenylphosphine oxide, triphenylphosphine sulfide, triphenylphosphine selenide, 2,2-bis(diphenylthiophosphoryl)-1,1-binaphthyl, 2,3-bis(diphenylthiophosphoryl)butane, and 2,3-O-isopropylidene-2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-bis(diphenylthiophosphoryl)butane. The noble metal compound may include palladium compounds, for instance. The catalyst for the bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins may further include a co-catalyst such as a copper catalyst. By way of illustration, the catalyst can include a palladium(II) halide as a noble metal compound and a copper(I) halide as a co-catalyst. The present invention provides, in another aspect, an optically active 2,2-bis(diphenylchalcogenophosphoryl)-1,1-binaphthyl of the following formula (1a): wherein A 1 is a Group 16 element of the Periodic Table other than oxygen; an optically active 2,3-bis(diphenylchalcogenophosphoryl)butane of the following formula (1b): wherein A 2 is a Group 16 element of the Periodic Table other than oxygen; and an optically active 2,3-O-isopropylidene-2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-bis(diphenylchalcogenophosphoryl)butane of the following formula (1c): wherein A 3 is a Group 16 element of the Periodic Table other than oxygen. In a further aspect, the invention provides a process for the bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins, which includes reacting an olefin with an alcohol, oxygen and carbon monoxide in the presence of the aforementioned catalyst for the bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins. In addition and advantageously, the invention provides a method of producing a succinate derivative, which comprises reacting an olefin with an alcohol, oxygen and carbon monoxide in the presence of the aforementioned catalyst to give a corresponding succinate derivative. The method just mentioned above may preferably include a method composed of reacting an olefin of the following formula (2): wherein each of R 4 , R 5 and R 6 is, independently, a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group or an aryl group each of which may have a substituent, or a substituted silyl group; at least two of R 4 , R 5 and R 6 may together form a ring with the adjacent carbon atom or carbon-carbon double bond, with an alcohol of the following formula (3): R 7 OH(3) wherein R 7 is an alkyl group, cycloalkyl group or aryl group each of which may have a substituent, oxygen and carbon monoxide to give a succinate derivative of the following formula (4): wherein R 4 , R 5 , R 6 and R 7 have the same meanings as defined above. As the olefin, use may be made of, for example, any olefin where R 4 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group which may have a substituent, either one of R 5 and R 6 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group which may have a substituent, and the other is an aryl group which may have a substituent or a substituted silyl group, and R 4 and R 6 may together form a ring with the adjacent carbon-carbon double bond. The method of producing a succinate derivative may be a method which includes reacting an olefin capable of forming a chiral compound by reaction, with an alcohol, oxygen and carbon monoxide in the presence of a catalyst containing an optically active phosphine chalcogenide to give a corresponding optically active succinate derivative. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The catalyst for the bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins according to the invention is composed of a phosphine chalcogenide of the formula (1) and a noble metal compound. In the formula (1), the alkyl groups in R 1 , R 2 and R 3 include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl and other straight chain alkyl groups; and isopropyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl and other branched chain alkyl groups. The carbon number of the alkyl group ranges, but not limited to, for example from about 1 to about 20, preferably from about 1 to about 10, and more preferably from about 1 to about 4.

Of olefins of the formula (2), preferred are those in which R 4 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group which may have a substituent (in particular, a hydrogen atom or a C 1 -C 4 alkyl group), either one of R 5 and R 6 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group which may have a substituent (in particular, a hydrogen atom or a C 1 -C 4 alkyl group), the other is an aryl group which may have a substituent or a substituted silyl group, and R 4 and R 6 may together form a ring with the adjacent carbon-carbon double bond. The alcohols include a variety of aliphatic alcohols, alicyclic alcohols, aromatic alcohols and phenols. The term the alcohol used herein includes phenols as well as other alcohols for the sake of convenience. As the typical examples of the alcohols, there maybe mentioned compounds of the formula (3). Examples of the alkyl group which may have a substituent and the aryl group which may have a substituent in R 7 in the formula (3) can be exemplified as the alkyl groups and aryl groups indicated in the substituent R 1 , for example. The cycloalkyl group includes, cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and cyclooctyl groups. These cycloalkyl groups may have a similar substituent as in the alkyl groups mentioned above. Practical examples of the alcohols include methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropyl alcohol, butanol, t-butyl alcohol, octanol and other aliphatic alcohols (e.g., aliphatic alcohols each having about 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably about 1 to 10 carbon atoms and more preferably about 1 to 4 carbon atoms); cyclopentanol, cyclohexanol and other alicyclic alcohols; benzyl alcohol and other aromatic alcohols; and phenol, cresol and other phenols. The amounts of the phosphine chalcogenide of the formula (1), the noble metal compound and co-catalyst used in a reaction of the process (method) according to the invention are not particularly limited and can be properly selected in consideration of the cost efficiency of substrates or reactants, the reactivity or separability from products. By way of illustration, the amount of the phosphine chalcogenide is less than 1 mole (e.g., about 0.01 to 0.5 mole), and preferably about 0.05 to 0.3 mole per mole of the material olefin. The amount of the noble metal compound is less than 1 mole (e.g., about 0.01 to 0.5 mole), and preferably about 0.05 to 0.2 mole per mole of the olefin. The co-catalyst may be used in an amount of, for example, about 0.05 to 3.0 moles, and preferably about 0.5 to 2.0 moles per mole of the olefin. The amount of the alcohol used in the reaction is, per mole of the olefin, for example equal to or more than 2 moles, and preferably equal to or more than 2.5 moles. The alcohol can also serve as a reaction solvent as well as a reactant. In addition to the above mentioned alcohols, the reaction solvent includes, but not limited to, acetone and other ketones; tetrahydrofuran and other ethers; benzene, toluene and other aromatic hydrocarbons; hexane, octane and other aliphatic hydrocarbons; acetonitrile, propiononitrile and other nitriles; pyridine, triethylamine and other basic solvents; 1,2-dichloroethane and other halogenated hydrocarbons; amides; and esters. The reaction can be carried out either in the presence of or in the absence of any solvent. The amount of oxygen is usually equal to or more than 0.5 mole, and that of carbon monoxide is usually equal to or more than 2 moles both per mole of the olefin. Both oxygen and carbon monoxide are generally used in excess with respect to the olefin. The ratio of carbon monoxide to oxygen is for instance such that the former: the latter ranges from about 5:95 to about 95:5, (by mole) and preferably from about 10:90 to about 90:10 (by mole). The reaction temperature and reaction pressure can suitably be selected in consideration of the reactivity, operativity and cost efficiency. The reaction temperature should fall, for example, in the range from about 0 C. to about 200 C. and preferably from about 20 C. to about 150 C. The reaction is preferably carried out under ambient pressure, but can be conducted under a pressurized condition. The reaction may be carried out in a conventional manner such as in a batch system, semi-batch system or continuous system. After the completion of reaction, reaction products can readily be isolated and purified by a conventional isolation and purification means including filtration, condensation, distillation, extraction, recrystallization or combinations of these isolation means. According to the above process (method), olefins can be bisalkoxycarbonylated with efficiency. In particular, aromatic olefins and vinylsilanes can give bisalkoxycarbonyl derivatives in high yields. Even from aliphatic terminal olefins, corresponding bisalkoxycarbonyl derivatives can be obtained in high yield. In addition, on reacting cyclic olefins conjugated with an aromatic ring, corresponding cis-diesters (cis-bisalkoxycarbonyl compounds) can selectively obtained. A reaction according to the process (method) of the invention gives a corresponding succinate derivative (succinic acid ester derivative) from a material olefin in satisfactory yield. By way of example, the reaction of an olefin of the formula (2) with an alcohol of the formula (3), oxygen and carbon monoxide gives a succinate derivative of the formula (4). Upon the use of a catalyst with the optically active phosphine chalcogenide as a ligand and an olefin, as a material, capable of forming a chiral compound by reaction, a corresponding optically active succinate derivative can be obtained. The use of a 2-substituted propene derivative (e.g., a 2-silylpropene derivative) or the like as the olefin may result in the formation of 1,3-bisalkoxycarbonyl compound (a glutarate derivative). This is probably because of the elimination and re-insertion of -hydrido in the reaction process. When an olefin having a hydroxyl group in the molecule (e.g., an olefin having a hydroxyl group at the - or -position carbon atom) is used as a material, an transesterification between one alkoxycarbonyl group of a succinate derivative once formed and the hydroxyl group proceeds to cyclization and hence a corresponding -alkoxycarbonylmethyllactone is formed. By way of illustration, an olefin having a hydroxyl group at the -position carbon atom gives a corresponding -alkoxycarbonylmethyl--butyrolactone derivative. In this case, the use of a catalyst containing an optically active ligand can provide an optically active lactone. According to the catalyst of the invention, where a noble metal compound is used in combination with a specific ligand, olefins can be bisalkoxycarbonylated with efficiency. The use of the novel phosphine chalcogenide of the invention as a ligand of a catalyst can attain the asymmetric bisalkoxycarbonylation of olefins. According to the process and method of the invention, corresponding succinate derivatives from individual olefins can be obtained in high yield. The present invention will be further illustrated in detail with reference to several examples below which are not directed to limiting the scope of the invention. The yields of products in Examples 6 through 8 were determined by gas chromatography. The optical purity of produced optically active substances was determined by high performance liquid chromatography Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd., Chiralcel OD, hexane/2-propanol (15:1).

Field of the Invention This invention relates to a triazole derivative or salt thereof which has excellent antimycotic action and high safety, an intermediate for preparing said compound and a pharmaceutical comprising said compound as an effective ingredient. 2. Description of the Related Art Mycosis can be classified into two types, that is, superficial mycosis represented by various trichophytosis, marginated eczema, psoriasis, cutaneous candidiasis or the like and deep seated mycosis represented by mycotic meningitis, mycotic infectious disease of respiratory organ, fungemia, mycosis of urinary tract or the like. Of these, deep seated mycosis such as candidiasis or aspergillosis tends to show a marked increase in recent days owing to the frequent use of an anticancer chemotherapeutic agent or immunosuppressive agent or lowering in the bioimmunology due to HIV infection or the like. There is accordingly a demand for a pharmaceutical efficacious against fungi causing such diseases. As pharmaceuticals effective against Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp., Amphotericin B and azole base compounds such as Fluconazole and Itraconazole are conventionally known, but not so many pharmaceuticals have been commercially available yet. In addition, the above-exemplified pharmaceuticals involve problems in safety and antimycotic action. There is accordingly a demand for an antimycotic effective against Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp. Now, more effective azole base compounds are under development. For example, as a compound having a difluoromethylene group, those described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 163374/1984, 163269/1993 and 227531/1997 are known. As an azole base compound having a substituted tertiary hydroxyl group, cyclic compounds as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 217778/1996 and 333367/1996, acyl compounds as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 104676/1996 and 183769/1997, and the like are known but they are not fully satisfactory. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a compound which has high safety and has antimycotic activity effective against Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp. With the forgoing in view, the present inventors synthesized a number of triazole derivatives and salts thereof and carried out an investigation on their antimycotic activity effective against Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp. As a result, it has been found that a cyclopropylthio- or cyclopropylsulfonyl-containing triazole derivative represented by the below-described formula (1) and a salt thereof are superior in antimycotic activity against fungi including Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp. and also in safety to the analogous compounds which have been known to date, leading to the completion of the present invention. In one aspect of the present invention, there are thus provided a triazole derivative represented by the following formula (1): wherein R 1 represents a hydrogen atom, lower alkyl group or aralkyl group, X 1 and X 2 are the same or different and each independently represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or a halogenoalkyl group and n stands for an integer of 0 to 2, or salt thereof; an intermediate for preparing said compound; and a preparation process of these compounds. In another aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a pharmaceutical comprising as an effective ingredient the triazole derivative represented by the formula (1) or salt thereof. In a further aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising the triazole derivative represented by the formula (1) or salt thereof and a pharmacologically acceptable carrier. In a still further aspect of the present invention, there is also provided the use of the triazole derivative represented by the formula (1) or salt thereof as a pharmaceutical. In a still further aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a treating method of mycotic infections, which comprises administering to a patient a pharmacologically effective amount of the triazole derivative represented by the formula (1) or salt thereof.

CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The present application is the national stage under 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT/JP97/04715, filed Dec. 19, 1997. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to novel vitamin D derivatives with high binding ability to vitamin D receptors and weak hypercalcemic activity, useful compounds as pharmaceutical agents such as antitumor agents, antirheumatic agents, etc., and novel synthetic intermediates which are useful for synthesis of said compounds. BACKGROUND ART Activated vitamins D 3 including 1, 25-dihydroxy-vitamin D 3 are known to have many physiological activities such as calcium catabolism regulation, growth inhibition and differentiation induction of tumor cells, immunoregulation. However, some activated vitamins D 3 disadvantageously cause hypercalcemia during long-term and continuous administration so that they are not suitable for use as antitumor agents, antirheumatic agents or the like. Thus, a number of vitamin D derivatives have been synthesized and examined for the purpose of separating activities of these vitamins D. For example, JPA No. 267550/86 discloses 1,3-dihydroxy-20(S)-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyloxy)-9,10-secopregna-5,7,10 (19)-triene and JPA No. 330714/95 discloses a vitamin D derivative substituted by a sulfur atom at the 22-position. Various vitamin D derivatives having a double bond at the 16-position are described in JPA No. 9861/90, JPA No. 17019/91, JPA No. 188159/95, JPA No. 40975/94, JPA No. 179418/95, U.S. Pat. No. 5,087,619 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,846, etc. However, none of these compounds are said to have weak hypercalcemic activity. Many of these known vitamin D compounds have high binding ability to vitamin D receptors but strong hypercalcemic activity, or weak hypercalcemic activity but unsatisfactory binding ability to vitamin D receptors. Therefore, it would be desirable to develop promising compounds with high binding ability to vitamin D receptors and weak hypercalcemic activity. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION As a result of careful studies of compounds with high binding ability to vitamin D receptors and weak hypercalcemic activity in view of the above problems, we found that compounds of general formula (1): wherein X represents an oxygen or sulfur atom, R 11 represents a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group which may be substituted by a hydroxyl group or a protected hydroxyl group, or a COR 12 group where R 12 represents an alkyl, aryl or alkoxy group, R 2 represents OR 9 or a hydrogen atom, and R 9 and R 10 may be the same or different and each represent a hydrogen atom or a protecting group, have high binding ability to vitamin D receptors and weak hypercalcemic activity, and thus accomplished the present invention.

Test Example 1 At hour 24 after an activated vitamin D 3 or each vitamin D 3 derivative dissolved in phosphate buffer was intravenously administered to 8-week old male ddY mice at a dose of 30 g/kg, the ionized calcium level in blood was determined. Experiments were run on 5 examples for each group and the results were expressed as averagestandard deviation. The calcemic activity of the activated vitamin D 3 and each vitamin D 3 derivative was evaluated in comparison with that of a control group to which had been administered the same amount of phosphate buffer alone. The results are shown in FIGS. 1 to 3 . The significance of differences was determined using Dunnetts T test, and the symbols *, ** and *** in the figures mean significant differences at the probability levels of 5%, 1% and 0.1%, respectively. Test Example 2 HL-60 cells were subcultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 g/ml gentamicin under 5% CO 2 at 37 C. Differentiation-inducing activity was evaluated as follows. At first, a 24-well plate was inoculated with 10 5 cells on the medium containing each test compound at various concentrations and incubated for 4 days under the above incubation conditions. Then, the amount of superoxide produced by stimulation of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was determined as cytochrome C-reducing ability. Namely, culture supernatants were removed by suction and then the cells treated with each test compound were suspended in 1.5 ml of the reaction mixture (80 M ferricytochrome C, 500 ng/ml PMA) and incubated at 37 C. for one hour. Then, the absorbance of the culture supernatants was determined at OD 550-540 using a Hitachi dual-wavelength spectrophotometer. The results are shown in FIGS. 4 to 6 . The concentration of reduced cytochrome C was calculated by using a molar absorption coefficient of 19.110 3 cm 1 .

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether having an alkylene oxide in an extremely narrow molar distribution, by directly reacting an fatty acid alkyl ester with an alkylene oxide using a surface-modified composite metal-oxide catalyst. 2. Description of the Related Art Fatty acid esters of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ethers are known as ester-type nonionic surfactants. Of these, stearic polyoxyethylene stearyl ether represented by the following formula (1) is utilized as an emulsifier, a dispersant, or an oil-phase adjuster in the cosmetics field and in various industrial fields. Polyoxyethylene methyl ether laurate represented by the following formula (2) has been investigated as to the possibility for use in a wetting agent (JAOCS, 56:873 (1979)). Application of the fatty acid esters of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ethers to detergent compositions (Jpn. Pat. Appln. Nos. 3-229548, 3-321106), to deinking agents for use in a paper regeneration process (Jpn. Pat. Appln. No. 4-209010), or to others have been also expected. A polyoxyethylene alkyl ether and a polyoxyethylene fatty acid ester, each to be used as a typical nonionic surfactant of an ethylene oxide adduct type, can be obtained by using an alcohol or a fatty acid as a starting material, and directly addition-polymerizing ethylene oxide and the staring material in the presence of an alkaline or an acidic catalyst. In the case of obtaining a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether, however, the addition polymerization reaction of an alkylene oxide does not proceed even if a fatty acid alkyl ester is allowed to react with an alkylene oxide in the presence of an alkaline or an acidic catalyst. The methods of manufacturing a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether by means of a one-step reaction between a fatty acid alkyl ester and an alkylene oxide are reported in the following publications: 1) Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 56-36431: acetic acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether is synthesized from an alkyl acetate and an alkylene oxide, using a calcined hydrotalcite compound as a catalyst. 2) Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKOKU Publication No. 53-24930: a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether is produced through a reaction between an alkylene oxide and an organic carboxylate by using a catalyst consisting of a halide of zinc, aluminum or the like, or consisting of an organometallic compound containing zinc or aluminum, or by using an alternative catalyst consisting of a combination of the aforementioned catalyst and an amine compound or the like. 3) Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 54-1038125: acetic acid ester of polyoxyethylene ethyl ether is produced through a reaction between ethyl acetate and an excessive ethylene glycol monoethyl ether in the presence of a strong acidic cation exchange resin. 4) Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 4-279552: a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether is synthesized by means of a reaction between a fatty acid alkyl ester and an alkylene oxide, using a metal-ion (aluminum etc.) added magnesium oxide as a catalyst. 5) Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 4-505449: a fatty acid ester is ethoxylated or propoxylated by using a calcined hydrotalcite as a catalyst. As mentioned above, when a fatty acid alkyl ester is reacted with an alkylene oxide in the presence of a composite metal-oxide catalyst such as a metal-ion (aluminum etc.) added magnesium oxide or a calcined hydrotalcite, it is known that the alkylene oxide is added to the fatty acid alkyl ester in such a way that the alkylene oxide enters into an ester bond, resulting in a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether. The aforementioned methods are, however, not fully satisfactory from an industrial point of view due to three drawbacks. First, an alkylene oxide adduct distribution in a product is wide. Second, an unreactive fatty acid alkyl ester is remained in a large amount. Third, the product is colored. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether, which permit manufacturing a product having a narrow alkylene oxide adduct distribution and to reduce an amount of a remaining unreactive fatty acid alkyl ester. Another object of the present invention is to provide a composite metal-oxide catalyst which is suitable for use in a method of manufacturing a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether, which permit manufacturing a product having a narrow alkylene oxide adduct distribution and to reduce an amount of a remaining unreactive fatty acid alkyl ester. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether, which comprises reacting a fatty acid alkyl ester with an alkyl oxide in the presence of a composite metal-oxide catalyst whose surface is modified by a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide, thereby manufacturing a fatty acid alkyl ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether represented by the following formula (I): wherein each of R 1 and R 3 independently represents an alkyl group or an alkenyl group, R 2 represents an alkylene group, and n is a positive number. Further, according to the present invention, there is provided a composite metal-oxide catalyst whose surface is modified by a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide and which is utilized in manufacturing a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether represented by the following formula (I), through the reaction between a fatty acid alkyl ester and an alkylene oxide. wherein each of R 1 and R 3 independently represents an alkyl group or an alkenyl group, R 2 represents an alkylene group, and n is a positive number. Still further, according to the present invention, there is provided a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether represented by the following formula (I) and having an adduct distribution satisfying the following formula (A): wherein each of R 1 and R 3 independently represents an alkyl group or an alkenyl group, R 2 represents an alkylene group, and n is a positive number. wherein n max denotes a molar number of added alkylene oxide in an adduct accounting for a maximum proportion by weight in a total adduct, and Yi denotes a proportion by weight of an adduct having an i moles of added alkylene oxide to a total weight of an adduct.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present inventors have conducted intensive studies with the view toward attaining the objects of the present invention. As a result, they found that active acidic points densely present on the surface of the aforementioned composite metal-oxide catalysts contribute to widening an alkylene oxide adduct distribution of the product. Further, they found that the composite metal-oxide catalysts can be modified if the active acidic points densely present on the surface of the composite metal-oxide catalysts are selectively partial-poisoned by a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide. Based on the above findings, they have accomplished the present invention. More specifically, the method of manufacturing a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether according to the present invention comprises a step of reacting a fatty acid alkyl ester with an alkylene oxide in the presence of an composite metal-oxide catalyst whose surface is modified by a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide. Owing to this method, it is possible to obtain a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether represented by the following formula (I), having a narrow alkylene oxide adduct distribution accompanied with a small amount of a remaining unreactive fatty acid alkyl ester. wherein each of R 1 and R 3 independently represents an alkyl group or an alkenyl group, R 2 represents an alkylene group, and n is a positive number. In the fatty acid alkyl ester (R 1 COOR 3 ) used as a starting material of the present invention, R 1 preferably has 3 to 40 carbon atoms, and more preferably 6 to 22. R 3 preferably has 1 to 30 carbon atoms, and more preferably 1 to 4. The alkyl group defined in the present invention includes also a group having a double bond in a carbon chain thereof (e.g. the so-called alkenyl group). It is preferable that the alkylene oxide which is addition-polymerized to a fatty acid alkyl ester have 2 to 8 carbon atoms (the carbon number of R 2 is 2 to 8), and it is particularly preferable that ethylene oxide or propylene oxide having 2 to 3 carbon atoms be used. The fatty acid alkyl ester and the alkylene oxide can be subjected to the reaction singly or in the form of mixture of two or more members. The composite metal-oxides to be used in the present invention include: a magnesium oxide added with at least one metal ion selected from the group consisting of Al (aluminum), Ga (gallium), Zr (zirconium), In (indium), Ti (thallium), Co (cobalt), Sc (scandium), La (lanthanum) and Mn (manganese); a calcined hydrotalcite which may be converted to an AlMg series composite metal-oxide; and a calcined aluminum magnesium hydroxide (a coprecipitate of aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide). The amount of the metal ion to be added to magnesium oxide is preferably 0.1 to 30 wt % based on the composite metal-oxide amount. In the case where the calcined aluminum magnesium hydroxide is particularly used as the composite metal-oxide, a large catalytic surface can be obtained. Consequently, when an alkylene oxide is addition-polymerized to a fatty acid alkyl ester, the catalytic activity of the calcined aluminum magnesium hydroxide is higher than that of other composite metal-oxides. Use of the aluminum magnesium hydroxide as the composite metal-oxide is industrially advantageous since the aluminum magnesium hydroxide makes it possible to efficiently promote the addition-polymerization reaction in a predetermined manner and to easily separate the catalyst from the reaction product after completion of the reaction. A method of manufacturing the metal-ion added magnesium oxide is disclosed in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 1-164437. It is desirable that the metal-ion added magnesium oxide particles be manufactured by precipitating the metal-ion to be added from an aqueous solution containing the metal ion by the following methods: 1) Dipping method: MgO particles are added to an aqueous solution containing a metal ion to be added, such as an aqueous aluminum nitrate solution, mixed well, evaporated to dryness, pulverized and calcined, resulting in the catalyst particles. 2) Coprecipitation method: an aqueous magnesium salt solution, such as an aqueous magnesium nitrate solution, is mixed with an aqueous solution containing a metal-ion to be added, such as an aluminum nitrate solution, and a precipitating agent such as ammonia is added thereto, thereby coprecipitating magnesium and the metal ion to be added as hydroxides in the aqueous solution. These hydroxides are filtered, washed, dried, pulverized, and calcined to prepare catalyst particles. 3) Deposition method: an aqueous solution containing a metal-ion to be added to magnesium particles is added to a dispersion in which magnesium oxide particles are dispersed, and a hydroxide of the metal to be added is allowed to precipitate and deposit on the surface of magnesium oxide particles, subsequently filtrated, dried, and calcined. In the case where a catalyst is manufactured by the precipitation method such as the coprecipitation or deposition method, undesired anions present in a catalyst slurry obtained after completion or precipitation treatment can be removed by an ion exchange resin, so that a washing step following the filtration can be omitted or simplified. A hydrotalcite is represented by the following Formula (II). A natural hydrotalcite and a synthetic hydrotalcite can be used. A calcined hydrotalcite as an AlMg system composite metal-oxide can be obtained by calcining a hydrotalcite. Mg x Al y (OH) z (CO) m .nH 2 O(II) wherein x, y, m and n each is a positive number. The calcining temperature is preferably 400 to 800 C., and more preferably 450 to 700 C. An aluminum magnesium hydroxide is represented by the following formula (III) and converted to an AlMg series composite metal-oxide by calcining. nMgO.Al 2 O 3 .mH 2 O(III) wherein n and m, each is a positive number and n is preferably around 2.5. The calcination temperature of the aluminum magnesium hydroxide is preferably 400 to 950 C., more preferably 400 to 700 C. In the method of the present invention, a modified composite metal-oxide catalyst is obtained by reforming the surface of the composite metal-oxide with a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide,-and then subjected to the reaction for obtaining a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether. A preferable metal hydroxide is an alkoxide of an alkali metal or an alkali earth metal, and a more preferable metal hydroxide is sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. A preferably metal alkoxide is an alkoxide of an alkali metal or an alkali earth metal, and a more preferable metal alkoxide is sodium alkoxide or potassium alkoxide. The modified composite metal-oxide catalyst is manufactured by reforming a composite metal-oxide such as magnesium oxide added with a metal ion, a calcined hydrotalcite, or a calcined aluminum magnesium hydroxide, with a hydroxide of an alkali metal or an alkali earth metal, or an alkoxide of an alkali metal or an alkali earth metal and then subjected to the reaction as a catalyst. Alternatively, the modified composite metal-oxide catalyst is manufactured, in a reaction vessel for use alkoxylation, by steps of adding a composite metal-oxide, and a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide to a fatty acid alkyl ester which is used as a starting material for producing a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether, mixing them, and reforming the composite metal-oxide in the fatty acid alkyl ester, and the composite metal-oxide catalyst thus-modified is reacted with an alkylene oxide. The former method of reforming a composite metal-oxide is not particularly limited and it is preferable that the composite metal oxide be dried and calcined after it is sprayed with an aqueous solution or an alcohol solution of a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide. In the latter method, the addition order of a composite metal-oxide, and a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide to the starting fatty acid alkyl ester is not particularly restricted. In this case, it is preferable that the metal hydroxide or the metal alkoxide by dissolved in a lower alcohol and then added to the fatty acid alkyl ester since acidic points on a catalyst surface can be more uniformly and selectively partial-poisoned. The metal hydroxide or the metal alkoxide for use in reforming the composite metal-oxide is preferably used in an amount of 1 to 10 wt % based on the composite metal oxide amount. The reaction of the present invention can be easily performed according to a customary operational procedure under normal reaction conditions. The reaction temperature employed is preferably 80 to 230 C., and more preferably 120 to 180 C. The reaction pressure employed is preferably 20 atm or less, and more preferably 2 to 8 atm, although it is dependent on the reaction temperature. The amount of the catalyst varies depending on a molar ratio of the alkylene oxide to the fatty acid alkyl ester subjected to the reaction, and the catalyst is generally preferred to add in an amount of 0.1 to 20 wt % based on a fatty acid alkyl ester amount. The reaction of the present invention is performed, for example, in the following procedure: a fatty acid alkyl ester and a modified catalyst are placed in an autoclave. After degassing and dehydration are effected, an alkylene oxide is introduced in the autoclave and the fatty acid alkyl ester is allowed to react with the alkylene oxide at predetermined temperature, under predetermined pressure conditions in an nitrogen atmosphere. After completion of the reaction, the resultant solution is cooled and the catalyst is separated by filtration. Alternatively, the reaction of the present invention can be performed as follows: a fatty acid alkyl ester and a composite metal-oxide are placed in an autoclave. Subsequently, a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide for use in reforming a catalyst is added thereto and mixed well, and the composite metal-oxide is reformed in the autoclave. Thereafter, degassing and dehydrating are effected in the same manner as above. Subsequently, an alkylene oxide is addition-polymerized at a predetermined temperature under a predetermined pressure conditions in a nitrogen atmosphere. After completion of the reaction, the resultant reaction solution is cooled and the catalyst is separated by filtration. As explained above, according to the present invention, owning to the use of the modified catalyst obtained by reforming the surface of a composite metal-oxide catalyst with a metal hydroxide or a metal alkoxide, it is possible to obtain a fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether having an alkylene oxide in an extremely narrow adduct distribution accompanied with a small amount of a remaining unreactive fatty acid alkyl ester, through one-step reaction between a fatty acid alkyl ester and an alkylene oxide. An adduct distribution of fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether is expressed by the following equation. wherein n max denotes a molar number of added alkylene oxide in an adduct accounting for a maximum proportion by weight in a total adduct, and Yi denotes a proportion by weight of an adduct having an i moles of added alkylene oxide to a total weight of an adduct. The adduct distribution of fatty acid ester of olyoxyalkylene alkyl ether according to the present invention is 50% by weight or more, preferably 60% by weight or more in term of the above equation. The amount of unreacted material contained in the fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether according to the present invention is as low as 5% by weight or less. The fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether obtained by the method of the present invention, can be advantageously used for base materials of household cleaning agents and cosmetics, and base materials of cleaning agents in the chemical industry since odor derived from the unreacted fatty acid alkyl ester is weak and the fatty acid ester of polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether having a desired average alkylene oxide adduct number can be obtained in a large effective amount. Hereinbelow, the present invention will be described in detail by way of Examples. EXAMPLE 1 An aqueous solution obtained by dissolving 30 g of aluminum nitrate in 87 g of water was added dropwise to a dispersion obtained by dispersing 70 g of MgO in 525 g of water and aged for 30 minutes to prepare a slurry. To this slurry, 263 cc of a strong-basic ion exchange resin (trade name:SA-20A available from Mitsubishi Kagaku Corp.) was added after being converted to an OH type resin by pretreatment. Ion exchange was effected by stirring the mixture at room temperature for 1 hour. Consequently, NO 3 was removed from the slurry. After completion of ion exchange, the ion exchange resin was separated from the slurry by means of a screen having a mesh size of 300 m. The resultant slurry was spray-dried, calcined for one hour at 600 C., resulting in a composite metal-oxide powder, namely, an Al-ion added MgO. The composite metal-oxide powder was dried while 670 g of a 0.15 wt % methanol solution of NaOH was sprayed thereto, and further dried for 10 hours at 100 C.

The composite metal-oxide was modified in the autoclave. After the nitrogen purge and raising temperature were performed in the same manner as in Example 1, the reaction were performed by introducing 543 g of ethylene oxide. A catalytic activity (a rate of ethylene oxide addition per unit amount of catalyst) was 1.0 g EO/g(catalyst)/min.

In particular, preferable is a process for separating a part of an isomeric mixture of a metallocene complex represented by the formula (2) as a -oxo-complex represented by the formula (3). TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of metallocene complexes containing cyclopentadienyl rings as a ligand which are utilizable for the polymerization of olefins or the like. BACKGROUND ART It is known that in the polymerization of olefins, especially propylene, any of the a tactic polypropylene, isotactic polypropylene and syndiotactic polypropylene can be produced by choosing a ligand of a metallocene complex among uniform catalysts (a metallocene complex/aluminoxane) for polymerization of olefins (Makromol. Chem. Rapid. Commun. 1983, 4, 417-421; Angew. Chem., Int. Engl. 1985, 24, 507-508; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988, 110, 6255-6256; etc.) Depending on the positions of substituents at the time of synthesis, metallocene complexes may permit the existence of stereoisomers. In the event a mixture of complex isomers formed on synthesis is straightforwardly used for polymerization of olefins where different olefin polymers are produced according to the different nature of the isomers, the resultant polymer will become a mixture of two different polymers. In case a uniform polymer is to be produced, therefore, the mixture of polymers has to be separated. Especially, a C 2 symmetrical crosslinking type metallocene complex tends to form a racemic form and a meso form of isomers in a ratio of 1:1 on its synthesis. On polymerization of propylene, the use of the racemic form permits the production of isotactic polypropylene while the use of the meso form permits the production of atactic polypropylene. Hence, the meso form has to be eliminated in case of producing isotactic polypropylene alone. Separation of the recemic form and the meso form is usually carried out by extraction with a solvent and recrystallization. For obtaining a highly pure racemic form, however, repeating of the separation operations was necessary so that efficiency of the production was extremely low. In Japanese Laid-open Patent Appln. No.Hei. 10-67793, there is disclosed that a method of changing the racemic/meso ratio wherein unnecessary isomer is decomposed with a decomposing agent such as acidic hydrogen atom or a reactive halogen atom. This method pertains to changing of the racemic/meso ratio by decomposing either one of the isomers, and more precisely, the racemic form is decomposed with ethylene-bis(4,7-dimethylindenyl)zirconium dichloride to obtain the pure meso form. A number of references are known concerning the reaction for converting a metallocene complex into a -oxo-complex, for example, Inorganic Chemistry 15, No. 9, 1976 disclosing that dimethylhafnocene is brought into contact with water in the air to form -oxo-bis(methylhafnocene) and Comprehensive Organometallic Chemistry 3, 1982, 572-576 disclosing that a metaflocene dihalide is converted into a -oxo-complex in the presence of water and a base. PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing metallocene complexes wherein stereoisomers of metallocene complexes formed on synthesis can easily be resolved into their isomers. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION As a result of extensive research made to achieve the aforesaid object, it has now been found by the inventors that a reaction for replacing a substituent on the central metal of a metallocene complex by MO bond differs in reactivity according to the isomer, and a part or all of a specific isomer can be converted into a complex having MO bond and that the complex having MO bond is significantly different in solubility from the original metallocene complex so that the complex having MO bond can easily be separated according to an ordinary separation method, e.g. extraction or recrystallization while purity of unreacted isomer can efficiently be increased. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of the above finding. Especially for an isomeric mixture of the racemic form and the meso form of a bridged metllocene complex, a reaction for forming a -oxo-complex is carried out whereby the meso form is preferentially converted into the -oxo-complex. Thus, the purity of the racemic form can easily be increased by separating the -oxo-complex thereform. If the total amount of the meso form is converted into the -oxo-complex, the racemic form will be obtained in a higher purity.

The substituents R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, and R10 may be the same or different and each independently stands for hydrogen, an alkyl group having having 1-20 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having 3-20 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group having a 2-20 carbon atoms, an aryl group having 6-20 carbon atoms, an alkylaryl group having 7-20 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group having 7-20 carbon atoms which may contain oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen, or a monocyclic or polycyclic heteroaryl group which may contain a hetero atom or atoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen atoms, sulfur atoms and nitrogen atoms in the 5-membered or 6-membered ring or rings thereof and which may be substituted on the ring or rings thereof by other substituents. Illustrative of these groups are for example, methyl group, ethyl group, isopropyl group, tert-butyl group, cyclopentyl group, cyclohexyl group, vinyl group, allyl group, phenyl group, naphthyl group, tolyl group, dimethylphenyl group, benzyl group, phenylethyl group, trimethylsilyl group, trimethylgermyl group, furyl group, thienyl group, pyridyl group. Any adjacent substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ring or rings may form a cyclic structure having 5-8 carbon atoms and the cyclic structure may be an aromatic ring. In case R1 and R2 are fused together to form an aromatic group as a cyclic structure having 6 carbon atoms, for example, it will become an indenyl ligand. The cyclic structure may have a substituent or substituents. In the event a metallocene complex is converted into a -oxo-complex, the starting complex wherein R3 and R6 are hydrogen and R2 and R7 are substituents other than hydrogen is easily convertible into the -oxo-complex and so is preferable as it is higher in selectivity of isomers. The substituents R9 and R10 in a bridging portion may form a cyclic structure having 4-8 carbon atoms wherein silicon, germanium, oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen may be contained. An isomeric mixture of a metallocene complex of the formula (1) can be prepared, for example, according to the following process: A substituted cycloalkadiene having substituents R1-R4 is anionized by the reaction with a metal salt type base to form a substituted cycloalkadiene anion which is then reacted at a molar ratio of 1:1 with a substituted cycloalkadiene compound connected through (Y) n to (Y) n (X 1 ) 2 wherein X 1 stands for a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, to form a compound wherein two cycloalkadienes are connected each other through Y. The latter compound is then reacted with a metal salt type base to form a dianion wherein each of the cycloalkadiene ring is anionized. The dianion is then reacted with a transition metal compound (X) 2 M(X 2 ) 2 wherein X 2 stands for a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom to obtain the isomeric mixture of a metallocne complex. Examples of the complex having MO bond include a compound wherein one of Xs on M is substituted to form MOR (wherein R stands for hydrogen, an alkyl group having 1-20 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having 3-20 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group having 2-20 carbon atoms, an aryl group having 6-20 carbon atoms. an alkylaryl group having 7-20 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group having 7-20 carbon atoms, with the proviso that these groups may contain silicon, germanium, oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen, or a monocyclic or polycyclic heteroaromatic group which may contain a hetero atom or atoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen atoms, sulfur atoms and nitrogen atoms in the 5-membered or 6-membered ring or rings thereof and which may be substituted on the ring or rings thereof by other substituents, for example, methyl group, ethyl group, isopropyl group, tertbutyl group, cyclopentyl group, cyclohexyl group, vinyl group, allyl group, phenyl group, naphthyl group, tolyl group, dimethylphenyl group, benzyl group, phenylethyl group, trimethylsilyl group, trimethylgermyl group, furyl group, thienyl group, pyridyl group), a compound wherein a central metal M is carried on a support such as silica gel through oxygen, and a -oxo-complex wherein the central metals of two molecules of a metallocene complex is crosslinked via oxygen. As a means for converting a part of isomeric mixture of a metallocene complex shown by the formula (1), there can be mentioned a process wherein the isomeric mixture is reacted with ROH, ROLi, or RONa, a process wherein the isomeric mixture is reacted with a silica gel the surface of which has been modified with OLi or ONa, and a process wherein the isomeric mixture is reacted with water to form a -oxo-complex. Especially preferable is a process wherein the reaction is intended to form a -oxo-complex, since it is higher in selectivity of the isomer and is easy for separation. Selectivity of isomers depends chiefly on the reactivity of X so that an isomer having X of less steric hindrance is preferentially reacted to form a complex having MO bond. This fact will be explained, for example, in connection with the reaction for a mixture of a racemic form and a meso form of dimethylsilylene-bis(2,3,5-trimethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride to prepare a -oxo-complex. In case of the racemic form, both chlorines are equivalent and only one 3-methyl group is present in the vicinity of each chorine. In the case of the meso form, on the other hand, two methyl groups are present in either of chlorine atoms but the other chlorine is less steric hindrance of 3-methyl group. Accordingly, when water is reacted with the mixture, water is preferentially reacted with chlorine of less steric hindrance in the meso form to afford a -oxo-complex. The reaction for forming a -oxo-complex chiefly due to the reaction of water with a metallocene compound is well known and a -oxo-complex is easily obtained. In case of a metallocene dihalide wherein a halogen is a substituent on the central metal, it is necessary in majority of the cases to react the metallocene complex with water in the presence of a base. No limitation exists in the amount of water to be reacted with an isomeric mixture but it is preferable that 0.01-10 equiamount of water is preferable for an isomeric mixture to be converted into the -oxo-complex. In case either one of the isomers is to be eliminated entirely, however, at least 0.5 equimolar water will be necessary for an isomeric mixture to be converted into a -oxo-complex. Further, it is necessary to consider the amount of water or moisture existent in the air, reagents and solvents. In case the reaction is carried out with a small amount of a metallocene complex, the reaction proceeds with water present in the air, reagents or solvents so that it is sometimes unnecessary to add water. A temperature for the reaction is such that the metallocene complex used is not decomposed. Thus, the temperature is preferably within the range of 80 C. to 80 C. No limitation exists in the reaction solvent so far as the metallocene complex used is not decomposed. Examples of the solvent include chloroform, dichloromethane, hexane, toluene, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), etc. In the event a metallocen complex is not reacted with water alone, the presence of a base becomes necessary. Mentioned as a utilizable base are inorganic basic compounds such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide and amines represented by the formula (4): R p NH 3p (4) wherein p stands for an integer of 0-3, R is an alkyl group having 1-20 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having 3-20 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group with 2-20 carbon atoms, an aryl group having 6-20 carbon atoms, an alkylaryl group having 7-20 carbon atoms, or an aralkyl group having 7-20 carbon atoms, when p stands for 2 or 3, Rs may be the same or different and may be combined together to form a cyclic structure having 5-8 carbon atoms which may contain silicon, oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen. Illustrative of the amine are, for example, ammonia, ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, aniline, pyrrolidine, pyridine, and tetramethylethylene diamine. In case a strongly basic substance is used, there is a possibility of decomposition in a metallocene complex used. Accordingly, the use of a weak base such as an amine is preferable. No special limitation exists in the amount of the basic substance used but 0.01-10 equiamount, preferably 0.8-1.2 equiamount of the basic substance is used for a metallocene complex to be converted into a -oxo-complex. After converting a part of the isomeric mixture of a metallocene complex into a complex having MO bond, unreacted isomer is obtained by removing the complex having MO bond. An ordinary separation method, such as extraction with a solvent or recrystallization can be used for this separation. As extraction with a solvent, the reaction liquid is dried until dryness and the residue is extracted with a solvent and the solution is stirred and filtered, or a continuous extraction using a Soxlet extractor may be mentioned. Mentioned as the recrystallization method, the reaction mixture is dissolved with a solvent and the solution is cooled or mixed with a poor solvent to precipitate crystals which are then separated. Illustrative of the solvent are, for example, pentane, hexane, toluene. dichoromethane, THF, diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, and a mixture of these solvents. As a -oxo-complex is especially inferior in solubility to the starting metallocene complex, the former can easily be removed by extraction with a solvent. As a general property of a -oxo-complex, it undergoes reaction with a proton reagent to split off the O-bridge. In case X in the resultant -oxo-complex is a halogen, therefore, the separated -oxo-complex is reacted with HX to split off the O-bridge thereby regenerating the original metallocene complex. It follows that an isomeric form of a metallocene which was once converted into the -oxo-complex from the isomeric mixture can also be obtained in a high purity.

EXAMPLES The present invention will now be illustrated in more detail by way of Examples. In Examples, all of the reactions was carried out in an inert gas atmosphere. Reagents and solvents used in syntheses are wholly those available commercially and actually employed without any dehydrating treatment, while the reagents and solvents used for polymerization were previously dried. Example 1 Synthesis of racemic-dimethylsilylene-bis(2,3,5-trimethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride In a 500 ml reaction vessel made of glass were placed 4.6 g (11 mmole) of an isomeric mixture of dimethylsilylene-bis(2,3,5-trimethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride (the racemic form/the meso form50/50) and 170 ml of toluene, and the content was cooled down to 10 C. in a dry ice-methanol bath. To the mixture was added dropwise a solution of 0.46 g (6 mmole) of diethylamine in 20 ml of toluene, and then added 0.5 g (3 mmole) of water. The dry ice-methanol bath was removed and the mixture was stirred as such for 18 hours at room temperature. An NMR analysis was carried out whereby it was confirmed that a peak of the meso form disappeared. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and 30 ml of toluene and 30 ml of hexane were added to the residue, and the mixture was stirred for one hour at 60 C. and then filtered. The -oxo-complex and the racemic form as filtration residue were 80/20 in weight ratio. The diethylamine hydrochloride was contained in the filtration residue. The -oxo-complex was identified by way of an NMR analysis, elementary analysis and single crystal X-ray diffration and its structure was also determined. A result of an NMR analysis and an elementary analysis of the -oxo-complex is shown in Table 1. The filtrate (-oxo-complex/the racemic form20/80) was cooled to 20 C. and allowed to stand for one day. The precipitated crystals were collected by filtration, washed with hexane and dried whereby racemic-dimethylsilylyene-bis(2,3,5-trimethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride was obtained as light yellow crystals (purity: at least 99%; 0.87 g, Yield: 40%).

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a novel carbosiloxane dendrimer that has a highly branched structure in which the siloxane bond and silalkylene bond alternate, that contains silicon-bonded hydrogen and/or silicon-bonded-alkoxy, that can also be prepared in a high-molecular-weight form, and that exhibits a narrow molecular weight distribution. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Dendrimers are polymers with a narrow molecular weight distribution that have a highly branched structure which elaborates radially from a single core. Dendrimers are characterized by a low viscosity, high reactivity, high solubility, and low glass-transition temperature and as a consequence their applications have been the subject of study. The following are examples of the already known organosilicon dendrimers: siloxane dendrimers (refer to Rebrov et al., Dokl. Acad. Nauk. SSSR, 309, 367 (1989) and Masamune et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 112, 7077 (1990)), carbosiloxane dendrimers (refer to Kakimoto et al., Macromolecules, 24, 3469 (1991); Japanese Published Patent Application (Kokoku or Examined) Number Hei 7-17981 (17,981/1995); and Sheiko et al., Macromol. Rapid Commun., 17, 283 (1996)), and carbosilane dendrimers (refer to Roovers et al., Macromolecules, 26, 963 (1993) and Japanese Published Patent Application (Kokoku or Examined) Number Hei 8-311205 (311,205/1996)). This literature also discloses carbosiloxane dendrimers in which the siloxane bond and silalkylene bond occur in alternation (refer to Japanese Published Patent Application (Kokoku or Examined) Number Hei 7-17981 and Sheiko et al., Macromol. Rapid Commun., 17, 283 (1996)). However, the carbosiloxane dendrimers disclosed therein are limited to dendrimers in which the starting reagent that forms the dendrimer core is a silane compound bearing a plural number of vinyl or allyl groups bonded to a single silicon atom, and the methods disclosed therein can only produce low-molecular-weight dendrimer at a low number of generations. The synthesis by a one-step polymerization method of highly branched polymer in which the siloxane bond and silalkylene bond alternate has also been disclosed (refer to Mathias et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 113, 4043 (1991)), but this method cannot produce dendrimer with a narrow molecular weight distribution. In sum, then, there has yet to appear carbosiloxane dendrimer that has a highly branched structure in which the siloxane bond and silalkylene bond alternate, that can also be prepared in a high-molecular-weight form, and that exhibits a narrow molecular weight distribution. Organosilicon polymers containing a plural number of silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in each molecule are used as crosslinkers in hydrosilylation-based crosslinking reactions and as precursors for the synthesis of functional organosilicon polymers. Desire has recently arisen for the development of novel crosslinkers that can exhibit a high crosslinking efficiency and can generate cured products having excellent properties (e.g., mechanical strength, adhesiveness, and durability) and for the development of novel precursors that would lead to the synthesis of functional organosilicon polymers with unique reactivities. In addition, organosilicon polymers containing a plural number of silicon-bonded alkoxy groups in each molecule are known to be useful as coatings, as starting materials for paint vehicles, and as crosslinkers for moisture-curing compositions. In this case again desire has recently arisen for the development of highly reactive organosilicon polymers that would be useful for improving end-product performance, such as mechanical strength, adhesiveness, and durability. The functional groups bonded at the branch terminals of a dendrimer as a general rule are highly reactive, and in addition a narrow molecular weight distribution can be expected to generate a uniform reactivity. Accordingly, dendrimer bearing the aforementioned reactive groups at its branch terminals would be well-suited for satisfying the desires alluded to above. The present inventors developed the present invention as a result of extensive investigations directed to solving the problems described above. In specific terms, the object of the present invention is to provide a novel carbosiloxane dendrimer that has a highly branched structure in which the siloxane bond and silalkylene bond alternate and that contains silicon-bonded hydrogen and/or silicon-bonded alkoxy. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a carbosiloxane dendrimer that contains at least one siloxane unit with the general formula X 1 R 1 a SiO (3a)/2 where R 1 is C 1 to C 10 alkyl or aryl, a is an integer from 0 to 2, and X 1 is the silylalkyl group with the following formula at i1 where R 1 is C 1 to C 10 alkyl or aryl, R 2 is C 2 to C 10 alkylene, R 3 is C 1 to C 10 alkyl, X i1 is the hydrogen atom or the above-defined silylalkyl group at ii1, i is an integer with a value from 1 to 10 that specifies the generation of said silylalkyl group, and b i is an integer from 0 to 3 with the proviso that b 1 in at least one X 1 in each molecule is an integer from 0 to 2 wherein when more than 1 is present the subject siloxane units may be the same or different, and whose core is a polysiloxane structure that contains at least 2 silicon atoms and the aforesaid siloxane unit(s).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The carbosiloxane dendrimer according to the present invention characteristically has a polysiloxane structure that contains at least 2 silicon atoms and at least one siloxane unit with the general formula X 1 R 1 a SiO (3a)/2 wherein when more than 1 is present the subject siloxane units may be the same or different. R 1 in this general formula is C 1 to C 10 alkyl or aryl. The alkyl encompassed by R 1 can be exemplified by methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl, while the aryl encompassed by R 1 can be exemplified by phenyl and naphthyl. Methyl is preferred among the preceding. The subscript a is an integer with a value from 0 to 2. X 1 is the silylalkyl group with the following formula at i1 R 1 in this general formula is defined as above. R 2 in the preceding general formula is C 2 to C 10 alkylene, for example, straight-chain alkylene such as ethylene, propylene, butylene, and hexylene and branched alkylene such as methylmethylene, methylethylene, 1-methylpentylene, and 1,4-dimethylbutylene. Ethylene, methylmethylene, hexylene, 1-methylpentylene, and 1,4-dimethylbutylene are preferred for R 2 . R 3 is C 1 to C 10 alkyl, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, and isopropyl, among which methyl and ethyl are preferred. X i1 is the hydrogen atom or the above-defined silylalkyl group. i is an integer from 1 to 10 that indicates the number of generations of the silylalkyl group under consideration, i.e., it indicates the number of repetitions of this silylalkyl group.

The invention allows for a convenient method by which to remove the residual tin catalyst from the substituted hydroxyphenylcarboxylic acid ester compounds of formula (I). This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/073,402, filed Feb. 2, 1998. This invention pertains to an improved process for the removal of residual tin catalyst from substituted higher aliphatic esters of hydroxyhydrocinnamic acids made by the tin catalyzed transesterification reaction between the corresponding lower alkyl ester and higher alkanol. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The aliphatic esters and polyesters of substituted sterically hindered hydroxy-hydrocinnamic acid are well-known as effective antioxidants for a wide variety of organic materials protecting them from oxidative and thermal degradation. Many of these esters have gained wide commercial acceptance as phenolic antioxidants. An important known class of transesterification catalysts which may be used to prepare the above compounds include tin catalysts, particularly organotin catalysts. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,594,444 teaches a process for the preparation of sterically hindered hydroxyphenylcarboxylic acid esters by the transesterification of the corresponding methyl or ethyl ester with a higher aliphatic alcohol using an oxide or an organometallic compound of a metal of the fourth main group or subgroup of the periodic table as catalyst in an amount between 0.05 and 1.0 mol percent based on the methyl or ethyl ester. Higher dialkyltin oxides, particularly dibutyltin oxides, are taught as the preferred catalysts for this process. However, as recognized in the art of antioxidants, if the amount of tin residue in the product is too high, the ultimate product stability may be compromised. Care is therefore taken to remove such residues. Unfortunately, one or more of the following disadvantages are commonly associated with known methods for removing tin residue from substituted hydroxyphenylcarboxylic acid esters: product degradation and/or color formation; additional processing steps (including, for example, crystallization or adsorption techniques) which inevitably result in yield loss and increased waste generation; and increased expense due to the need for rather sophisticated equipment which may be required for the separation of product from residual tin catalyst. Japanese Hei 01 316389 (Takee et al.) provides for the removal of organotin compounds from general ester exchange reactions by making the organotin compounds insoluble in organic media with the use of aqueous carboxylic acid solutions. In particular, the Japanese reference requires the use of an organic solvent to make the carboxylic acid derivative of the tin compound insoluble in the ester mixture, which technique increases equipment requirements as well as waste generation. The Japanese reference further requires use of an aqueous solution of a carboxylic acid. Unfortunately, the presence of a large amount of water leads to the formation of the undesirable toxic by-product, 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl4-hydroxy)hydrocinnamic acid (HCA), the presence of which becomes problematic for the instant hydrohydroxycinnamate esters when employed in food contact applications. The reference further teaches the added step of using auxiliary filter aids, such as cellulose or activated charcoal, which are needed in order to effectively remove the reacted tine compound. Clearly, need continues to exist in the industry for a simplified and improved process of removing residual tin from the substituted higher aliphatic esters of hydrohydroxycinnamic acids made by the tin catalyzed transesterification reaction between the corresponding lower alkyl ester and higher alkanol. It is the object of the present invention to satisfy this need. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is directed to an improved process for the preparation of substituted higher aliphatic esters of hydroxyhydrocinnamic acids by transesterifying the corresponding lower alkyl ester with a higher alkanol of the formula A-(OH) m in the presence of a tin catalyst. In particular, the invention provides for an improved method to remove the residual tin by reacting the tin catalyzed transesterification reaction mass with a carboxylic acid or hydrate thereof neat, in the absence of an aqueous medium, until the tin catalyst forms an insoluble derivative, and then separating the insoluble derivative from the reaction by filtration without the assistance of a filtration aid. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The invention is directed to an improved process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) wherein R is an alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, n is 0 to 2, m is 1 to 4; and when m is 1, A is a straight or branched chain alkyl of 4 to 18 carbon atoms; when m is 2, A is a straight or branched chain alkylene of 2 to 12 carbon atoms, or said alkylene interrupted by one to five O or S atoms, or A is 2,2-bis(4-ethyleneoxyphenyl) propane; when m is 3, A is a straight or branched chain alkanetriyl of 3 to 6 carbon atoms; and when m is 4, A is pentaerythrityl, by transesterifying the corresponding lower alkyl ester with a higher alkanol of the formula A-(OH) m (II) in the presence of a tin catalyst; wherein the improvement comprises reacting the tin catalyzed transesterification reaction mass with a carboxylic acid or hydrate thereof neat, in the absence of an aqueous medium, until the tin catalyst forms an insoluble derivative, and separating the insoluble derivative from the reaction mass by filtration without the assistance of a filtration aid. Preferably, the lower alkyl ester is a compound of formula (I) where m is 1 and A is methyl or ethyl, most preferably methyl. Preferably, R is methyl or tert-butyl. When m is 1, A is preferably alkyl of 8 to 18 carbon atoms; most preferably isooctyl, lauryl or n ocladecyl; especially nectadecyl. When m is 2, A is preferably hexamethylene, CH 2 CH 2 SCH 2 CH 2 or CH 2 CH 2 OCH 2 CH 2 OCH 2 CH 2 . When m is 3, A is preferably CH 3 C(CH 2 ) 3 , CH 3 CH 2 C(CH 2 ) 3 or glyceryl. Both organic and inorganic tin catalysts may be employed in the transesterification reaction and removed according to the instant invention. Representative tin catalyst classes include monoalkyltin esters, dialkyltin esters, monoalkyltin oxides, dialkyltin oxides, tin tetrachlorides, monoalkyltin trichloride, dialkyltin dichloride, diaryltin dichlorides, organotin sulfides, organotin sulfates, organotin mercaptans, organotin carboxylic acid or esters thereof, and stannoxanes. Preferred tin catalysts include monobutyltin tris(2-ethylhexoate), dibutyltin bis(2-ethylhexoate), stannous bis(2-ethylhexoate), dibutyltin diacetate, dibutyltin oxide, butyltin trichloride, butyltin trimethylate, dibutyltin dichloride, and diphenyltin dichloride. In particular, FASCAT 4215A organotin catalyst, of proprietary structure belonging to the stannoxane family and containing 18.5-20.5% tin is preferred. FASCAT 4215A organotin catalyst is available in an aromatic hydrocarbon solution from Elf Atochem, headquartered in Philadelphia, Pa. Other particularly preferred catalysts are monobutyltin tris(2-ethylhexoate) and stannous bis(2-ethylhexoate), both available from Elf Atochem under the names FASCAT 9102/4102 and FASCAT 2003, respectively. The transesterification reaction may be one which is known in the literature. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,594,444 teaches a process for the preparation of sterically hindered hydroxyphenylcarboxylic acid esters by the transesterification of the corresponding methyl or ethyl ester with a higher aliphatic alcohol using an oxide or an organometallic compound of a metal of the fourth main group or subgroup of the periodic table as catalyst in an amount between 0.05 and 1.0 mol percent based on the methyl or ethyl ester. Higher dialkyltin oxides, particularly dibutyltin oxides, are taught as the preferred catalyst for this process. The instant process has been found to be particularly effective under conditions where the transesterification reaction proceeds neat in the absence of solvent and where the amount of tin catalyst is minimized, i.e., on the order of about 50 to about 120 ppm tin, based on the starting lower alkyl ester, at a temperature of 150-200 C. In general, the carboxylic acid compounds that react with the tin transesterification catalyst to produce the insoluble derivatives include aliphatic, aromatic, heteroaromatic carboxylic acids of the mono-, di-, tri- and polycarboxylic acid type. Hydrates of these acids are also useful. Preferred carboxylic acids are those of the di-, tri- and polycarboxylic acid type (for example, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)); and more preferably, are those of the dicarboxylic acid type such as oxalic acid, citric aid, maleic acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, adipic acid and the like, and hydrates thereof. Most preferably, the carboxylic acid is oxalic acid dihydrate. Hereinafter, the reaction between the tin compound and the carboxylic acid compound will be termed the tin removal reaction. In general, about 20 moles to about 1 mole of carboxylic acid are used for each mole of tin compound. Preferably, about 10 moles to about 1 mole of carboxylic acid are used for each mole of tin compound. Most preferably, about 5 moles to about 1 mole of carboxylic acid are used for each mole of tin compound. The tin removal reaction may take place at atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure. Preferably, the reaction proceeds at a reduced pressure of between about 250 to about 1 mm of Hg, more preferably, at a reduced pressure of between about 50 to about 1 mm Hg. Most preferably, the reaction proceeds at a reduced pressure of between about 10 to about 1 mm Hg. In general, the tin removal reaction takes place at a temperature above the melting point, but below the decomposition temperature, of the carboxylic acid used. Preferably, the reaction takes place between at least about 100 C. and about 230 C., more preferably between about 110 C. and about 190 C., most preferably between about 110 C. and about 160 C. The tin removal reaction proceeds until the tin transesterification catalyst forms an insoluble derivative. In general, the reaction proceeds at a temperature of about 110 to about 130 C. for at least about two hours, preferably about one hour. Most preferably, the reaction proceeds for at least about 0.5 hours. Upon completion of the reaction, the reaction mass is filtered at a temperature of about 110 to about 130 C. under pressure using a filter of suitable porosity. A filter on the order of about 0.5 micron porosity has been found to be particularly effective. The filtration should take place at a temperature whereby the compound of formula (I) is rendered molten or at least with a viscosity low enough to be filterable so that the insoluble tin compound is easily separated therefrom. It is important to note that that tin compounds are effective catalysts in reactions that produce various compounds other than those of the instant invention. Examples include, but are not limited to, transesterification reactions resulting in 3-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-5-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxybenzenepropanoic acid, octyl esters and 3-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-5-(1,1-dimethylethyl)4-hydroxybenzenepropanoic acid, poly(ethylenedioxy) esters; transesterification of acrylates; esterification resulting in the production of plasticizers like dioctyl phthalate, synthetic lubricants, and fatty acid esters; production of polyester resins; and epoxy acid reactions. It is herein contemplated that the instant tin removal reaction may be useful in removing tin from any reaction mass or product where residual tin may be undesirable. The following experiments are illustrative of the process according to the invention and are not to be construed to limit the scope of the instant invention in any manner whatsoever.

The present invention relates to the preparation of ,-monounsaturated or ,,-diunsaturated ketones which are useful fragrances or useful intermediates for the synthesis of natural substances, by the combination of conventional reactions of allyl alcohols or propargyl alcohols with isopropenyl ethers with the formation of ketals of acetone as a byproduct, the isopropenyl ethers being prepared by reacting ketals of acetone with propyne or allene in the gas phase over heterogeneous catalysts and the ketal of acetone, obtained as byproduct, being fed into the stated preparation of the isopropenyl ether. DE 1 193 490 and R. Marbet and G. Saucy, Helv. Chim. Acta 50, (1967), 2091-2095 and 2095-2100 disclose a process for the preparation of ,-unsaturated ketones by reacting an allyl alcohol with enol ethers, in particular isopropenyl ethers, in the presence of an acid catalyst, e.g. phosphoric acid. Furthermore, U.S. Pat. No. 3,029,287 and G. Saucy and R. Marbet, Helv. Chim. Acta 50, (1967) 1158-1167 disclose the reaction of the propargyl alcohols with enol ethers in the presence of acid catalysts to give ,,-diunsaturated ketones. In both reactions, one mole of the corresponding ketal is formed as a byproduct from 2 moles of enol ether used, for example acetone dimethyl ketal from isopropenyl methyl ether used, in accordance with the following equations: In these equations, R 1 to R 5 are each hydrogen or alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl or aralkyl radicals which are unsubstituted or substituted by oxygen-containing groups, it also being possible for R 1 and R 2 , together with the carbon atom to which they are bonded, to form a 5- or 6-membered ring, and R 6 is alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The ketal IV obtained as a byproduct must be converted back into the enol ether III for economic reasons. It is known that this can be done by converting the ketals, either in the liquid phase with acidic catalysts (according to EP 703 211) or in the gas phase over heterogeneous catalysts (according to DE 19 544 450) with elimination of alcohol, into the corresponding enol ethers according to the following equation: Here, R is hydrogen or alkyl and R 6 has the abovementioned meaning. The stated known processes permit the preparation of the enol ethers in good yields in some cases but have the following disadvantages: The reaction in the liquid phase according to EP 703 211 requires the use of a dissolved foreign substance, ie. an organic acid, the removal of which from the reaction mixture requires an additional separation step. Compared with the process in the liquid phase using a homogeneously dissolved catalyst, the process according to DE 19544450 has the advantage of the reaction in the gas phase over a heterogeneous catalyst that requires fairly high temperatures. Common to both processes is that one mole of alcohol is separated per mole of ketal and has to be separated off in an additional purification step, at considerable expense in some cases, and as a rule has to be discarded. This applies in particular to methanol, which frequently forms azeotropic mixtures. The weight yield, based on the ketal, is thus inevitably reduced. It is an object of the present invention to provide a combination process which on the one hand permits the preparation of the required enol ether III over a heterogeneous catalyst in good yields without the alcohol originating from the ketal being obtained as a byproduct in stoichiometric amount and, on the other hand, recycling of the ketal obtained in the reactions of equations 1 and 2 into the preparation of the enol ethers. We have found that this object is achieved, according to the invention, by a process for the preparation of unsaturated ketones of the formulae Ia and Ib where R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 and R 5 are each hydrogen or alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl or aralkyl radicals which are substituted or unsubstituted by oxygen-containing groups, it also being possible for R 1 and R 2 together to form a 5- or 6-membered ring, which comprises the combination of the following reactions: a) The conventional reaction of an allyl alcohol of the formula IIa or a propargyl alcohol of the formula IIb with an isopropenyl ether of the formula III where R 6 is alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, with formation of a ketal of the formula IV where R 6 has the abovementioned meaning, as a byproduct, b) preparation of the isopropenyl ether of the formula III by reacting a ketal of the formula IV with propyne or allene, or a mixture thereof in the gas phase at elevated temperatures in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst containing zinc or cadmium together with silicon or oxygen, and c) feeding the ketal of the formula iv formed in the reaction (a) into stage (b) for the preparation of the isopropenyl ether of the formula III again. The reaction of stage (a) is described in detail in the technical literature and is claimed in the present invention not for itself, but in combination with steps (b) and (c): The conditions in stage (a) are described in DE 1193490 or U.S. Pat. No. 3,029 287 or the stated publications in Helv. Chim. Acta. In this context, the information in these patent publications and literature publications are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. The conditions in stage (a) are in general not critical for carrying out the novel combination process and can of course also be varied, for example by the choice of the catalyst and, if required, of the starting materials. Accordingly, more recent improvements of the reaction in stage (a) are of course also suitable, as described, for example, in DE 19 649 564.4. Preferred starting materials of the formula IIa are in particular tertiary allyl alcohols, R 1 preferably being a saturated or unsaturated, branched or straight-chain alkyl radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by oxygen-containing groups, e.g. methoxy or ethoxy groups, an aryl radical or an alkylaryl radical of up to 20 carbon atoms and R 2 is preferably C 1 -C 4 -alkyl, in particular methyl, it also being possible for R 1 and R 2 together to be tetramethylene or pentamethylene which is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more lower alkyl groups, and R 3 , R 4 and R 5 are each hydrogen. Specific examples are 3-methyl-1-buten-3-ol, 3,7-dimethyl-1-octen -3-ol (hydrolinalool), 3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-3-ol (linalool), 1-vinylcyclohexanol, 3,7,11-trimethyl-dodeca-1,6,10-trien-3-ol (nerolidol), 3,7,11-trimethyl-dodeca-1,6-dien-3-ol (hydronerolidol) and 3,7,11-trimethyl-dodec-1-en-3-ol(tetrahydronerolidol) and isophytol. Preferred propargyl alcohols are tertiary propargyl alcohols of the formula IIb where R 1 is a saturated or unsaturated, branched or straight-chain alkyl radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by oxygen-containing groups, or an aryl radical or an alkylaryl radical, each of up to 20 carbon atoms, and R 2 is C 1 -C 4 -alkyl, in particular methyl, it also being possible for R 1 and R 2 together to be tetramethylene or pentamethylene which is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more lower alkyl groups, and R 4 is hydrogen. Specific examples are 3-methylbutyn-3-ol, 3,7-dimethyl-l-octyn-3-ol(hydrodehydrolinalool), 3,7-dimethylocta-6-en-1-yn-3-ol(dehydrolinalool), 3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-6,10-dien-1-yn-3-ol(dehydronerolidol), 3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-6-en-1-yn-3-ol and 3,7,11-trimethyldodec-1-yn-3-ol. A particularly suitable isopropenyl ether of the formula III is isopropenyl methyl ether. The preparation of the isopropenyl ethers of the formula III where R 6 has the abovementioned meanings, as described more comprehensively and claimed in German Patent Application 19 726 667.3, is carried out according to stage (b) by reacting a ketal of the formula IV with propyne and/or allene in the gas phase in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst containing zinc or cadmium and silicon and oxygen. Although the mechanism of this reaction is not known in detail, the reaction may be regarded formally as if one mole of an alcohol R 6 OH is transferred from the dialkoxy compound of the formula IV to the acetylene or allene with formation of the enol ether of the formula III. Examples of suitable ketals are the dimethyl, diethyl, di-n-propyl, di-n-butyl and diisobutyl ketals of acetone. 2,2-Dimethoxypropane (acetone dimethyl ketal) is particularly preferred as a starting material. The ketals and their preparation from acetone are disclosed in the technical literature. They are obtained, for example, by reacting acetone with the corresponding alcohols or preferably by an addition reaction of alcohols with alkynes or allene, mixtures of enol ethers and the corresponding ketals being obtained, enol ethers being used immediately after the separation of said mixtures and it being possible to feed the ketals to stage (b). In the overall balance of the novel process, however, only the losses of ketal as a result of secondary reactions should be replenished since, in the overall balance according to Equations 3 and 4 and Summation equation 5, the required enol ether is constantly formed again from propyne and allene. Equation 3 (for the reaction of the allyl alcohols as in the Example) Instead of pure methylacetylene or pure allene, mixtures thereof may also be used, especially mixtures as can be isolated, for example, from a C 3 stream of a steamcracker. The reaction of the ketals or acetals with the acetylenes or allenes is carried out in the presence of the heterogeneous catalyst containing zinc or cadmium and silicon and oxygen in the gas phase, either over a fixed bed or in a fluidized bed at from 50 to 400 C., preferably from 100 to 250 C., particularly preferably from 120 to 200 C., and pressures of from 0.1 to 50, in particular from 0.8 to 20, particularly preferably from 0.9 to 10, bar (all pressures are based on the sum of partial pressures of the starting materials). If required, the reaction mixture may be diluted with inert gases, such as nitrogen, argon, low molecular weight alkanes or olefins for operational safety or better heat removal. The molar ratio of ketal or acetal to alkyne or allene may be from 0.01 to 100, and is preferably from 0.1 to 2, particularly preferably from 0.7 to 1.3. Suitable catalysts containing zinc or cadmium and silicon and oxygen are cadmium silicates and preferably zinc silicates, for example silicates selected from the group consisting of (a) X-ray amorphous zinc silicate and cadmium silicate, prepared by impregnating a silica carrier with a zinc or cadmium salt, (b) crystalline zinc silicate having essentially the composition and structure of hemimorphite of the formula Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 H 2 O, where the zinc may be present in up to 25% more or less than the stoichiometric amount, and/or (c) essentially X-ray amorphous zinc silicate, prepared by precipitation in aqueous solution from a soluble silicon and zinc compound of the formula V Zn a Si c O a2c0.5e (OH) e f H 2 O V, where e is from 0 to 2a4c, the ratio a/c is from 1 to 3.5 and the ratio f/a is from 0 to 200. (a) X-ray amorphous zinc silicate or cadmium silicate catalysts are obtained, for example, by loading amorphous silica with a zinc salt or cadmium salt and forming the catalyst by thermal treatment. The SiO 2 carrier is at least predominantly amorphous, has a BET surface area from 10 to 1500 m 2 /g, particularly preferably from 100 to 500 m 2 /g and water absorbtivity of from 0.1 to 2, particularly preferably from 0.7 to 1.3 ml/g and can be used in the form of a powder or in the form of prepared moldings. The carrier can furthermore be calcined prior to impregnation. Preferably, however, the carrier is not calcined. The zinc or cadmium compound used is a compound which is soluble in a suitable solvent. Zinc(II) salts which are soluble in water or aqueous ammonia or alcohols, preferably lower alcohols, and whose decomposition temperature is below 400 C. to 500 C. are preferably used. An ammoniacal zinc(II) acetate solution is particularly preferably used for the impregnation. In some cases, it has proven advantageous to carry out the loading with zinc in a plurality of successive impregnations. If the carrier is used in the form of a powder, the catalyst may be brought into the desired form by shaping (for example mixing, kneading and extrusion or pelleting). To increase the pore volume, pore formers may also be used during the shaping (for example superabsorbers, such as Lutexal (from BASF Ludwigshafen) or Walocel (methylcellulose/synthetic resin combination, from Wolff, Walsrode)). Alternatively, it is also possible to impregnate another carrier, eg. Al 2 O 3 , with a silica precursor compound (eg. Si(OR) 4 ) and with a zinc salt or cadmium salt. The zinc or cadmium load may vary within wide limits. Typical values for an uncalcined precatalyst which was prepared by impregnating an SiO 2 carrier with a zinc salt or cadmium salt are, for example, from 1 to 60, preferably from 7 to 30, particularly preferably from 10 to 25, % by weight (calculated in each case as ZnO or CdO) of Zn or Cd. The precatalyst may furthermore be doped with other elements, preferably alkali metals, alkaline earth metals or transition metals. Moreover, the catalytically active component may be doped with up to 80, preferably up to 50, in particular up to 20, mol percent of further metals selected from the group (A) consisting of beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel and copper and from the group (B) consisting of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, germanium, tin and lead, some of the elements of group (A) replacing zinc or cadmium and some of the elements from group (B) replacing silicon. The precatalyst can then be calcined at not more than 600 C., in particular from 80 to 300 C., in air or under an inert gas. Calcination at from 120 to 250 C. in air is particularly preferred. After the preparation of the generally still catalytically inactive precatalyst by application of a zinc or cadmium compound to a silica carrier, forming is preferably carried out, in which the actual active phase is formed in particular on the surface of the catalyst. This solid-state reaction is promoted by the presence of water, alcohols, preferably lower alcohols, or carboxylic acids, preferably lower carboxylic acids, and is therefore advantageously carried out by heating the precatalyst at from 50 to 400 C. in a water- or alcohol-containing atmosphere. The reaction is preferably carried out at from 100 to 250 C. in a water- or methanol-containing gas mixture. The reaction is particularly preferably carried out at from 120 to 200 C. with a methanol-containing gas mixture directly in the reactor in which the reaction with the alkyne or allene is subsequently to take place. If a precatalyst based on zinc acetate is used, it is very easy to determine when the solid-state reaction is complete as virtually no methyl acetate is to be found in the exit gas at this time. In some cases it has proven advantageous to treat the precatalyst under reaction conditions with a mixture of methanol with propyne and allene and possibly also other components (eg. propene or propane) for the formation of the active phase. Formation of the active layer is indicated by the increase in the propyne and allene conversion (after from about 5 to 30 minutes, depending on the temperature), by the increase in the selectivity (after from 10 to 300 minutes, depending on the temperature) and by the decline in the concentration of methyl acetate in the exit gas. A steady state (with high propyne or allene conversions) and a high selectivity is reached after from about 2 to 20 hours, depending on the temperature. It is also possible to prepare the corresponding mercury silicates but these are technically and ecologically less suitable. Standard methods were used for characterizing the catalyst samples (fresh samples as well as samples removed from the reactor). The measured BET surface area, which is typically from 10 to 800 m 2 /g, and the hardness are stated in the respective examples. Catalysts having BET surface areas of from 100 to 400 m 2 /g are preferred. Furthermore, the samples were investigated in detail by means of powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Neither of the two structure analysis methods reveals any long-range order in the sense of a crystalline structure; all samples were amorphous. The distribution of the zinc over the carrier was investigated on appropriate sections under the electron microscope and by means of a microprobe. All samples, even after removal from the reactor, show that the catalyst has a substantially homogeneous distribution of elements and contains little or no crystalline ZnO. In the IR investigation (KBr pellets), the active catalyst prepared with zinc acetate shows no acetate bands (these are still visible in the precatalyst at 1570, 1410, 670 and 610 cm 1 ). In the 13 C-CP-MAS-NMR, too, acetate signals are no longer present. In the 29 Si-CP-MAS-NMR, the catalyst shows only the broad band at 109 ppm which is typical of amorphous SiO 2 , and a shoulder at 99 ppm (about 10% of the intensity of the main peak). The elemental analysis of a zinc acetate/SiO 2 precatalyst shows that the molar C/Zn ratio is dependent on the calcination temperature. Catalysts dried at room temperature have a C/Zn ratio of 3.5 4. After calcination at 200-250 C. (optimum temperature), the C/Zn ratio is from 1 to 2. At higher temperatures, the C/Zn ratio decreases even further, as does the catalytic activity of the catalysts formed therefrom. After calcination at 500 C. (24 hours), the C/Zn ratio in the precatalyst is 0.02. Active catalyst cannot be formed from this. Since the decomposition of the zinc acetate on the precatalyst is relatively slow, said precatalyst can be exposed to even higher temperatures for short times without the catalytic activity being completely lost. (b) Hemimorphite as catalyst Hemimorphite is a zinc silicate of the formula Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 H 2 O. However, not only pure hemimorphite but in general heterogeneous catalysts which contain, as active component, at least predominantly zinc silicate having the structure of hemimorphite of the formula Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 22y O y x H 2 O, where x and y are from 0 to 1, are suitable for the novel reaction. The preparation of hemimorphite is disclosed in the literature. It can be carried out under standard pressure conditions or under hydrothermal conditions. (b1) Preparation under standard pressure conditions A. G. Merkulov and B. S. Khristoforov, (Tr. Soveshch, Eksp. Tekh. Mineral. Petrogr., 8th (1971), Meeting Date 1968, 322-8; Editor(s): V. V. Lapin; Publisher: Nauka, Moscow, USSR) describe the preparation of various zinc silicates by reaction of various zinc salts (carbonate, sulfate, chloride, acetate, oxide) with sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide in aqueous solution at 90-100 C. and at atmospheric pressure. Different zinc silicates form depending on the pH established. For example, pure sauconite having the composition Zn 3 Si 4 O 10 (OH) 2 n H 2 O forms at a final pH of 5-6. Pure willemite (-Zn 2 SiO 4 ) is obtained at a pH of 6.5-8.5. On the other hand, pure hemimorphite (Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 H 2 O) crystallizes out only in a weakly alkaline medium at pH greater than 10. In another paper by the stated authors (A. G. Merkulov and B. S. Khristoforov, Izv. Sib. Otd. Akad. Nauk SSSR, Ser. Khim. Nauk 4 (1969), 70-4), it is stated that pure hemimorphite is formed in the reaction of the zinc salts with sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide at 90-100 C. and atmospheric pressure in aqueous solution only at a pH of 10-12. Furthermore, T. Baird, A. G. Cairns Smith and D. S. Snell (Reactivity of Solids, Proc. Int. Symp., 8th (1977), Gothenberg, Meeting Date 1976, 337-42; Editor(s): J. Wood, O. Lindqvist und C. Helgesson; Publisher: Plenum Press, New York, N.Y.) were able to prepare large crystals of hemimorphite by reacting Zn(OH) 2 with silica and LiOH in aqueous solution at a pH of 10. Finally, H. Nagata, M. Matsunage and K. Hosokawa (Zairyo-to-Kankyo 42 (1993), 225-233) prepared hemimorphite by reacting aqueous zinc sulfate solution with sodium hydroxide solution and aqueous sodium silicate solution at a pH of 13, isolating the precipitate obtained and washing it thoroughly and ageing it at 85 C. for at least 24 hours. (b2) Hydrothermal preparation According to EP 165 647, hemimorphite can be prepared from an acid-treated clay mineral and zinc oxide or zinc hydroxide under hydrothermal conditions (170 C., 5 h). However, the acid pretreatment of the clay is very expensive and this process is therefore disadvantageous. According to D. M. Roy and F. A. Mumpton (Econ. Geol. 51 (1956), 432-443), hemimorphite can also be obtained by a hydrothermal reaction of mixtures of ZnO and SiO 2 at 175-200 C. (composition: 3 ZnO2 SiO 2 ). The product obtained contains predominantly hemimorphite but is contaminated with sauconite (Zn 3 Si 4 O 10 O(OH) 2 4 H 2 O). Finally, P. Taylor and D. G. Owen, (Polyhedron 3(2) (1984), 151-155) describe the hydrothermal synthesis of hemimorphite by reacting ZnO with SiO 2 in aqueous solution at 150 C. However, long reaction times of at least 4 days are required for the preparation of products having a high hemimorphite content. Although hemimorphite products obtained by the known methods described above are very suitable as a catalyst for the novel addition reaction, it was found to be desirable further to improve their properties to propose a method which permits the preparation of catalysts with a reproducibly good property profile. Accordingly, a preferred novel preparation method, both under atmospheric pressure and under hydrothermal conditions, is one in which an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal silicate, preferably sodium silicate, is reacted with a zinc salt, in particular zinc nitrate, and a base, such as an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, in particular sodium hydroxide, in aqueous solution at pH of from 4 to 9.5, preferably from 5.5 to 8, in particular at neutral pH, for example, at pH 6-7.5, at from 50 to 100 C., in particular from 70 to 100 C., in the case of atmospheric pressure and at from 100 to 250 C., preferably from 100 to 200 C., in the case of hydrothermal conditions. Pure hemimorphite having a Zn/Si ratio of 2 can be synthesized by this preparation method. However, hemimorphite preparation having a zinc content up to 25% less than or greater than the stoichiometric amount, corresponding to a Zn : Si atomic ratio of from 1.6 to 2.5, are also obtainable. Hemimorphites which contain 0-20% excess of zinc are preferred as catalysts. Hemimorphites which contain 0-10% excess of zinc are particularly preferred. The hemimorphite products are obtained in the synthesis as white crystalline precipitate in the form of an aqueous suspension and must be separated from the aqueous solution by suitable measures, for example filtration or centrifuging. In the case of filtration, the filter cake obtained is then washed sodium- and nitrate-free and then dried. Drying can be carried out at up to 600 C., preferably from 90 to 250 C. Thermogravimetric investigations have shown that the crystallized hemimorphite of the composition Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 H 2 O loses increasing proportions of its water of crystallization at from about 100 to 200 C. with a retention of the hemimorphite structure, resulting in hemimorphite preparations of the composition Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 x H 2 O where x is less than 1 and decreases with increasing temperature. If drying is carried out in a higher temperature range from about 200 to 600 C., the OH ions present in the hemimorphite are additionally converted into O 2 -ions and eliminated H 2 O (2 OH H 2 OO 2 ), likewise with retention of the hemimorphite structure, resulting in hemimorphite preparations of the composition Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 22y O y , where y is from 0 to 1 and increases with increasing temperature. Hemimorphite preparations obtained after drying up to 600 C., preferably from 90 to 450 C., and having the composition Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 22y O y x H 2 O, where x and y are from 0 to 1, are then usually processed by the conventional shaping methods, for example pelleting or extrusion, or are converted into coated catalysts on steatite beads to give catalytic moldings. The details are described in the examples. Standard methods are used for characterizing the catalyst samples (fresh samples as well as samples removed from the reactor). The measured BET surface area is as a rule from 3 to 400 m 2 /g. Catalysts with BET surface areas of from 20 to 300 m 2 /g are preferably used. Furthermore, the samples obtained by the novel preparation process are investigated in detail by means of powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The measured powder X-ray diffraction pattern agrees with that of index card 5-0555 of the JCPDS-ICDD index (1995). (c) X-ray amorphous zinc silicate catalyst If the procedure is carried out essentially under the same preparation conditions but for a shorter reaction time, an X-ray amorphous product having improved catalytic properties is obtained as an intermediate for the preparation of a crystalline hemimorphite. For this purpose, an aqueous suspension of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal silicate is reacted with an aqueous solution of a zinc salt a) at from 20 C., preferably 50 C., to the boiling point of the resulting aqueous suspension b) at a pH of from 4 to 9.5, preferably at a pH close to the neutral point, c) and in ratios of alkali metal silicate to zinc salt such that the conditions of the formula V are fulfilled and d) the residence time is maintained such that crystallization of the zinc silicate does not yet occur to any considerable extent. The essentially X-ray amorphous zinc silicate thus obtainable contains Zn 2 , Si 4 and O 2 ions; in addition, the compound may contain OH ions and water of hydration. The Zn/Si ratio is from 0.3 to 5, preferably from 1 to 2.7, particularly preferably from 2 to 2.3, very particularly preferably 2. In the latter case, the X-ray amorphous zinc silicate thus has the Zn/Si ratio of crystalline hemimorphite (Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 H 2 O). In a graph in which the intensity A of the diffracted X-rays is plotted as a function of twice the diffraction angle (2) , the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the X-ray amorphous zinc silicate, obtained using Cu-K 1 radiation (1.5406 ), has, in the 2 range from 10 to 90, very broad intensity maxima at 2315 and at 2617. The precipitated amorphous zinc silicate catalyst to be used according to the invention can also be doped with up to 80, preferably up to 50, in particular up to 20, mol percent of further metals selected from the group (A) consisting of beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, cadmium and mercury and from the group (B), consisting of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, germanium, tin and lead, the elements of group (A) replacing some of the zinc and the elements of group (B) replacing some of the silicon in the hemimorphite structure. The X-ray amorphous zinc silicate is obtained as a powder in the preparation. This powder can be used as such for the catalytic reaction (for example in a fluidized-bed reactor) or after molding (for example extrusion, pelleting, etc., possibly also with the addition of assistants in a form suitable for a fixed-bed reactor. Before use, the catalyst can be calcined at from 80 to 750 C., preferably from 120 to 500 C., particularly preferably from 200 to 400 C. in the air. To increase the pore volume, pore formers may also be added during the shaping, for example during the pelleting or extrusion (for example superabsorbers such as Lutexal P (from BASF AG) or Walocel (methylcellulose/synthetic resin combination, from Wolff, Walsrode AG)). General reaction conditions of the novel combination process with the steps (a), (b) and (c). The combination of stages (a) to (c) can be carried out batchwise or, preferably, continuously. In the case of the batchwise procedure, the ketal of the formula IV obtained as a byproduct in stage (a) is collected in a storage container and converted into the enol ether of the formula III, temporarily, and, if required, spatially separately from the process of stage (a). In the continuous procedure preferred on the industrial scale, the preparation of the enol ether and the recycling of the ketal to the enol ether preparation stage are spatially integrated in one plant. A very small volume is then required for the buffer container and transport is dispensed with. The reaction of stage (b) is carried out as a rule in a tube reactor, the propyne and/or allene (or preferably a mixture composed of 30-43% by volume of propyne, 16-20% by volume of allene, 20-45% by volume of propene, 5-10 by volume of isobutane and 2-6% by volume of propane, obtained by distillation from a side-stream of a steam cracker) were metered in with the ketal under superatmospheric pressure. The starting materials are mixed shortly before the reactor and are let down into the reactor space. The reaction is carried out as a rule isothermally from 120 to 300 C. and with a feed rate of from 0.5 to 10 mmol/min of propyne and/or allene and from 0.5 to 20 mmol/min of ketal. The reaction pressure is from 0.1 to 50, preferably from 1.1 to 3.5, bar (absolute). The enol ether formed in stage (b) is separated from the propene/propane inert gas stream and then purified by distillation. The distilled enol ether is then used in stage (a). The ketal formed as a byproduct in stage (a) is separated from the reacted mixture, if necessary after prior neutralization, by distillation over a column having about 10 theoretical plates at from 100 mbar to 1 bar, preferably from 300 to 800 mbar, and is taken off via the top. The distillate contains excess enol ether III and acetone in addition to the ketal IV. This stream can, in accordance with stage (c), be fed directly into the synthesis of the enol ether or, preferably, be further purified in another column. This column can be operated batchwise or, preferably, continuously. In this case, the excess enol ether III is obtained as top product and used directly as a starting material for stage (a). Acetone is removed via a side take-off. The ketal IV is obtained at the bottom and is reacted with propyne/allene to give the enol ether III, in accordance with stage (c). EXAMPLES Example 1 Stage a) 200 g of hydrodehydrolinalool (1.3 mol), 306 g of an azeotropic mixture consisting of 2-methoxypropene (prepared by the process of stage b, see below) and methanol (3.9 mol of 2-methoxypropene) and 1 g of potassium hydrogen sulfate (dried and powdered) were introduced into a pressure-resistant vessel. The reactor was flushed with nitrogen and closed. The reaction was initiated during heating up. The temperature increased to 140 C. in the course of about 20 minutes, and the pressure to about 5 bar. The reaction mixture was then stirred for a further 2.5 hours at 120 C. to complete the reaction. First, the low boilers contained in the reacted mixture, ie. primarily 2,2-dimethoxypropane and excess 2-methoxypropene, were separated off in a rotary evaporator at about 500 mbar and condensed in a cold trap. The residue was distilled at a reduced pressure of 1 mbar over a bridge. 249 g of 6,10-dimethylundeca-4,5-dien-2-one were obtained in a purity of 85%. Stage c) The condensate containing 2,2-dimethoxypropane, acetone and excess 2-methoxypropene and obtained from a plurality of batches were subjected to fractional distillation and the fraction consisting of 2-methoxypropene was reused directly for stage (a). The fraction consisting of 2,2-dimethoxypropane was fed into stage (b). The fraction consisting mainly of acetone was discarded. Stage b) ba) Preparation of the catalyst (amorphous zinc silicate; by impregnation) The Zn/SiO 2 supported catalyst was obtained by impregnating X-ray amorphous SiO 2 moldings (beads of diameter 3-6 mm) having a BET surface area of 358 m 2 /g, a water absorbtivity of 0.9 ml/g and a hardness of 43 N/molding with ammoniacal zinc acetate solution. For this purpose, 225 g of SiO 2 carrier (Siligel, from Solvay) were impregnated with 151.70 g of Zn(OAc) 2 2 H 2 O (Merck), dissolved in 220 g of 9% strength NH 4 OH solution at room temperature, and the precatalyst was dried for 16 hours at 120 C. and then calcined for 4 hours under air at 250 C. The precatalyst had a BET surface area of 195 m 2 /g and a hardness of 76 N/molding. The acetate/Zn ratio was 0.9 mol/mol. bb) Reaction About 90 ml of precatalyst were introduced into a stirred reactor. Propyne/allene mixture (55 mol %, remainder propene) and 2,2-dimethoxypropane were then metered in by means of HPLC pumps. The reaction was continued at the first setting (170 C.) until the active catalyst had completely formed and the conversion and selectivity were constant (about 20 hours). The temperature and the feeds were then changed according to Table 1. The results are summarized in Table 1. The pressure was 1.35 bar (abs) in all experiments. Abbreviations: 2 MP: 2-methoxypropene; 22 DMP: 2,2-dimethoxypropane; 1 MP: 1-methoxypropene (cis and trans); 11 DMP: 1,1-dimethoxypropane. The stated selectivities are based on propyne and allene. The condensed reacted mixtures were subjected to fractional distillation. The 2-methoxypropene fraction was used as a starting material in stage (a) and the unconverted dimethoxypropane fraction was recycled to reaction (bb). TABLE 1 Feeds/mmol/min Conversions/% Temp.

The reactor was flushed with nitrogen and closed. After a reaction time of 1 hour at 120 C., the mixture was cooled to about 50 C. and a further 0.58 g of KHSO 4 , dissolved in 1.74 g of water, was added. The mixture was once again heated to 120 C. After a reaction time of one hour, the reaction was complete. Distillation was carried out as in Example 1.147 g of a mixture comprising mainly 2-methoxypropene and 2,2-dimethoxypropane and 213 g of a fraction comprising 1.6% of 3,7,11-trimethyldodec-1-yn-3-ol, 67% of 6,10,14-trimethylpentadeca-4,5-dien-2-one, and 7.3% of 6,10,14-trimethylpentadeca-3,5-dien-2-one were obtained. Stage c) The methoxypropene/2,2-dimethoxypropane/acetone mixture from a plurality of batches was subjected to fractional distillation, the methoxypropene fraction was reused directly for the reaction of stage (a) and the dimethoxypropane fraction was introduced into stage b (see below) as a starting material. Stage b) ba) Preparation of the catalyst (hemimorphite Zn/Si2) In an 8 l stirred container, a suspension A comprising 1.5 mol of SiO 2 and 0.89 mol of Na was prepared from 4.5 l of demineralized water and 145.1 g of soda water glass powder containing 62.1% by weight of SiO 2 and 19.0% by weight of Na 2 O (from Riedel-de Haen, D-30918 Seelze). Furthermore, 910.7 g of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 6 H 2 O (98% strength) were dissolved in 2.25 l of demineralized water at room temperature, a solution B containing 3 mol of Zn and 6 mol of NO 3 being obtained. Finally, an aqueous solution was prepared from 204.4 g of NaOH in 0.225 1 of demineralized water, a solution C having an Na content of 5.11 mol being obtained. Solutions B and C were then added to suspension A at room temperature, a milky suspension D containing the following proportions of elements being obtained: Zn content3 mol, Si content1.5 mol, Na content6 mol, NO 3 content6 mol. The pH of the resulting suspension D was 7.1. The suspension D was heated to 90 C. and stirred at a speed of 200 rpm for 24 hours at this temperature. The suspension was then cooled to room temperature, and a final pH of 7.0 was measured. The white precipitate which crystallized out was filtered off and washed Na-free with demineralized water and the resulting filter cake was dried at 90 C. in a drying oven. The dried white powder was investigated by X-ray diffraction and gave an X-ray powder pattern which corresponded completely to index card 5-0555 of the JCPDS-ICDD index (1995) and thus indicated the preparation of Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 H 2 O. The specific surface area of the resulting powder, determined according to BET, was 30 m 2 /g. For the preparation of a catalyst, the still moist powder was directly molded to give extrudates (diameter3 mm, pressure50 bar), which were then dried for 16 hours at 120 C. The prepared catalyst had a BET surface area of 26 m 2 /g and a hardness of 6 N/molding. bb) Reaction About 90 ml of the catalyst were introduced into a stirred reactor. Propyne/allene (about 63% strength by volume, 1.68 mmol/min) and 2,2-dimethoxypropane (2.17 mmol/min; total feed with inert substances: 6.46 mmol/min; 2,2-dimethoxypropane/(propyneallene) ratio1.29) were then metered in by means of HPLC pumps. The reaction temperature was 170 C. and the pressure 1.35 bar (abs), and the partial pressure of the starting materials was 0.8 bar. The following selectivities were observed from the beginning (ie. the catalyst had no forming time): 2-methoxypropene: 97.4%; acetone: 2.3%; cis- and trans-1-methoxypropene: 0.3%. The condensed reacted mixtures were subjected to fractional distillation. The 2-methoxypropene fraction was used as a starting material in stage (a) and the dimethoxypropane fraction not added was recycled to the reaction (bb). By-products formed in small amounts were discarded. Example 3 Stage a) 25.9 g of hydrolinalool and 45.5 g of isopropenyl ethyl ether (purity 85%) and 93 mg of 75% strength phosphoric acid were introduced into a pressure-resistant container having a volume of 300 ml, and the container was closed, flushed with nitrogen and heated to 175 C. After a reaction time of 12 hours, the container was cooled and emptied and the reacted mixture was distilled over a column (h10 cm, filled with 3 mm wire mesh rings). The first fraction (27.2 g) distilled over at 70 C. at atmospheric pressure and contained 2,2-diethoxypropane as the main product. At 0.9 mbar, 6,10-dimethylundec-5-en-2-one was obtained in a yield of 83%. Stage c) The forerun containing 2,2-diethoxypropane was collected from a plurality of batches and introduced into stage b) as starting material. Stage b) ba) Preparation of the catalyst (hemimorphite Zn/Si2.2) In a 6 l stirred container, a suspension A containing 1.0 mol of SiO 2 and 0.59 mol of Na was prepared from 3.0 l of demineralized water and 96.8 g of soda water glass powder containing 62.1% by weight of SiO 2 and 19.0% by weight of Na 2 O (from Riedel-de Haen, D-30918 Seelze), a solution B containing 2.2 mol of Zn and 4.4 mol of NO 3 was prepared from 667.8 g of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 6 H 2 O (98% strength) in 1.5 l of demineralized water at room temperature and an aqueous solution C having an Na content of 3.81 mol was prepared from 152.3 g of NaOH in 0.4 l of demineralized water. Solutions B and C were added to suspension A at room temperature, a milky suspension D containing the following proportions of elements being obtained: Zn content2.2 mol, Si content1 mol, Na content4.4 mol, NO 3 content4.4 mol. The pH of the resulting suspension D was 7.2. The suspension D was heated to 90 C. and stirred at 200 rpm for 24 hours at this temperature. After the suspension had been cooled to room temperature, a final pH of 7.0 was measured. The resulting white precipitate was filtered off and washed Na-free with demineralized water and the filter cake obtained was dried at 90 C. in a drying oven. The dried white powder was investigated by X-ray diffraction and gave an X-ray powder pattern which completely corresponded to index card 5-0555 of the JCPDS-ICDD index (1995) and thus indicated the preparation of Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 H 2 O. The specific surface area of the resulting powder, determined according to BET, was 60 m 2 /g. 650 g of the powder were mixed with 20.2 g of magnesium stearate (Merck) and molded to give 20 mm pellets. These pellets were processed to give chips (0.5 mm). The pellets were then calcined for 10 hours at 350 C. The prepared catalyst had a BET surface area of 44 m 2 /g and a hardness of 44 N/molding. bb) Reaction About 90 ml of the catalyst were introduced into a stirred reactor. Propyne/allene mixture (about 60% strength by volume, 1.64 mmol/min) and 2,2-diethoxypropane (2.14 mmol/min; total feed with inert substances: 8.34 mmol/min; 2,2-diethoxypropane/(propyneallene) ratio1.30) were then metered in by means of HPLC pumps. The reaction temperature was 170 C. and the pressure 1.35 bar (abs.), and the partial pressure of the starting materials was 0.8 bar. The following selectivities were observed from the beginning (ie. the catalyst had no forming time): 2-ethoxypropene: 97.0%; acetone: 2.3%; cis- and trans-1-ethoxypropene: 0.5%. The following values were determined for the catalyst after removal from the reactor: BET surface area 44 m 2 /g, hardness 12 N/molding. The collected condensed reacted mixture was subjected to fractional distillation and the 2-ethoxypropene fraction was fed to stage a) as a starting material. Unconverted diethoxypropane was recycled to the reaction. Example 4 Stage a) 18.7 g of hydrolinalool, 46 g of isopropenyl propyl ether (purity 80%) and 85 mg of 75% strength phosphoric acid were reacted and worked up as in the previous example. 27 g of a byproduct fraction containing 2,2-dipropoxypropane as the main component and a yield of 79% of theory, based on hydrolinalool, of 6,10-dimethylundec-5-en-2-one were obtained. The 2,2-dipropoxypropane fraction was fed to stage (b). Stage b) (Precipitated X-ray amorphous catalyst; Zn/Si ratio 2.1) In a 12 l stirred container, 120.93 g of soda water glass powder containing 62.1% by weight of SiO 2 and 19.0% by weight of Na 2 O (from Riedel-de-Haen, D-30918 Seelze) were added to 7.5 l of demineralized water at 80 C with constant stirring (100 rpm), a suspension A containing 1.25 mol of SiO 2 and 0.74 mol of Na being obtained. An aqueous solution B comprising 180.4 g of NaOH (corresponding to 4.51 mol of Na) in 0.5 l of demineralized water was then prepared. In addition, 796.8 g of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 6 H 2 O (Zn content98%) were dissolved in 2.5 l of demineralized water, a solution C containing 2.625 mol of Zn and 5.25 mol of NO 3 being obtained. The solution B was then added to the suspension A at 80 C., a clear solution D being obtained after about 5 minutes. The solution C was then added to the solution D obtained. A white suspension E containing 2.625 mol of Zn, 1.25 mol of Si, 5.25 mol of Na and 5.25 mol of NO 3 resulted. The suspension E was heated at 80 C. for 2 hours while stirring (100 rpm) and then cooled to room temperature. After cooling, a final pH of 6.5 was measured. The resulting white precipitate was filtered off and washed Na-free with demineralized water. The filter cake obtained was dried at 80 C. in a drying oven. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The dried white powder was investigated by X-ray diffraction and gave an X-ray powder pattern which corresponded to that of FIG. 1 and thus indicated the preparation of predominant amounts of X-ray amorphous zinc silicate in addition to a small amount of crystalline ZnO (index card 5-0664 of the JCPDS-ICDD index (1995)). The specific surface area of the resulting powder, determined according to BET, was 102.1 m 2 /g. 650 g of the amorphous zinc silicate prepared as described above and having the composition of hemimorphite were mixed with 20.2 g of zinc stearate and precompacted to give 20 mm pellet, then communicated to chips having a diameter of 0.5 mm and then molded to give pellets measuring 4.755.2 mm. The catalyst had a BET surface area of 75 m 2 /g and a hardness of 43 N/pellet. A 100 g portion of the catalyst was then calcined at 350 C. for 10 hours in the air. About 90 ml of the catalyst were introduced into a stirred reactor. Propyne/allene mixture (49.8% strength by volume, 1.84 mmol/min) and 2,2-dipropoxypropane (2.15 mmol/min; total feed with inert substances: 6.79 mmol/min; 2,2-dipropoxypropane/(propyneallene) ratio1.17) were then metered in by means of HPLC pumps. The reaction temperature was 170 C. and the pressure 1.35 bar (abs), and the partial pressure of the starting materials was 0.8 bar. The following selectivities were observed: 2-propoxypropene 97.1%; 2-dipropoxypropane 2.5%; cis- and trans-1-propoxypropene 0.4%. The conversion was 21%, based on propyne/propadiene. This catalyst had virtually no forming time. The stated conversion and the selectivity were virtually constant from the beginning. The BET surface area was 82 m 2 /g after the calcination and 64 m 2 /g after removal from the reactor. The hardness was 28 N/pellet after calcination and 36 N/pellet after removal from the reactor. Example 5 380.8 g of hydrolinalool, 55.5 g of isopropenyl n-butyl ether (purity 90%) and 113 mg of 75% strength phosphoric acid were reacted as in Example 4. Working up was carried out by distillation at 0.3 mbar. 29 g of a mixture consisting mainly of 2,2-dibutoxypropane, isopropenyl n-butyl ether and butanol were obtained and 6,10-dimethylundec-5-en-2-one was obtained in a yield of 74%. Using the catalyst described in Example 4, similar results were obtained on recycling of the 2,2-dibutoxypropane and reaction with fresh 2,2-dibutoxypropane. Example 6 66 g of hydronerolidol, 60 g of an azeotropic mixture of isopropenyl methyl ether and methanol (about 91% of isopropenyl methyl ether) and 248 mg of 75% strength phosphoric acid were combined in a pressure-resistant vessel. After flushing with nitrogen, the reaction mixture was stirred for 8 hours at 150 C. The reacted mixture was neutralized with aluminum triisopropylate and subjected to fractional distillation. 42 g of a mixture comprising 85% of 2,2-dimethoxypropane, 11.3% of acetone, 0.4% of isopropenyl methyl ether and 0.4% of methanol were obtained at atmospheric pressure. At 0.3 mbar, 6,10,14-trimethylpentadeca-5,9-dien-2-one was obtained in a yield of 78%, based on hydronerolidol used. Similar results were obtained if the preparation of the 2-methoxypropene is carried out as described in Example 1 and the 2,2-dimethoxypropane obtained as a byproduct is separated from acetone and then recycled to stage (b).

The compounds of formula I can be obtained by cleavage of the silyl protecting groups contained in compounds of formula II wherein Y and Z are protected hydroxy groups and R 4 is a hydroxy protecting group. Any conventional hydroxy protecting group can be utilized to protect the free hydroxy groups in the compounds of this invention. Any cleavable or hydrolyzable ether or ester group can be utilized. Preferred hydrolyzable ester groups are alkanoic esters and preferred hydrolyzable ether groups are silyl ethers such as tert-butyldimethyl-silyl (TBDMS) for the hydroxy groups Y and Z, whereas R 4 is preferably trimethyl-silyl Si(CH 3 ) 3 . The cleavage of the hydroxy protection groups can be effected by any standard means such as where the silyl ethers are utilized cleavage can be effected by use of tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. Mild acid hydrolysis can be used to cleave the alkanoic ester groups. The intermediates II, which are novel and as such are a further object of the present invention can be prepared by a Wittig-reaction with a compound of formula III according to the reaction scheme 1 depicted below. Compounds of formula III may be prepared according to the method described in EP-A 0 771 789. wherein the symbols are as defined above. Compounds of formula (1) which are oxidized to the aldehyde (2) can be prepared according to the reaction scheme 2: wherein R 5 represents a hydroxy protecting group, preferably the tert. butyldimethylsilyl group, R 6 respresents another hydroxy protecting group, preferably the tetrahydropyranyl group whereas R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are as defined above. Starting from known 4,4-dialkyl-tetrahydropyran-2-one the corresponding 4,4-alkyl-tetrahydropyran-2-ol (3) is obtained by reduction. The alcohol (3) is then reacted with ethoxycarbomethylene-triphosporane to form the corresponding 7-hydroxy-hepten-2-oic acid ester (4). After protection of the hydroxy group to yield the unsaturated ester (5) the double bond is catalytically hydrogenated before the ester group is reduced to form the corresponding mono protected diol (6). Protection and deprotection of the respective hydroxy groups yields the mono-protected diol (7) which is oxidized with a known oxidizing agent as for example 4-methyl-morpholine-4-oxide and tetrapropylammonium-perrhutenate to the aldehyde (8). This aldehyde is then first reacted with tetrabromomethane in the presence of 2 eqivalents of triphenylphosphine to form (9) and subsequently with butyllithium and the corresponding ketone derivative (eg. hexafluoroacetone for the preparation of compounds of formula I wherein R 1 and R 2 are trifluoromethyl) to yield, after final deprotection of the primary alcohol, compounds of formula (1a), i.e. compounds of formula (1) wherein A is CC. In order to obtain the corresponding compounds (1b), i.e. compounds wherein A represents CHCH, and (1c), i.e. compounds wherein A represents CH 2 CH 2 , further reduction steps are required. Compounds of formula II may also be prepared by an alternate route as depicted in Scheme 3: wherein the symbols are defined as above. The pharmacological properties of the compounds of the formula I can be determined by the following test procedures: 1. Calcium Liability (Tolerance Test in Mice) This test gives a global picture of calcemic liability. Profound changes in calcium homeostasis strongly affect the weight development of the animals. This parameter was used as a primary test for tolerance. Mice (25-30 g body weight) received daily subcutaneous administrations of the vitamin D derivative for 4 consecutive days. Body weight was registered just before and at the end of a 5 day treatment period. The highest tolerated dose (HTD sc ) in mice is the dose which results in zero weight gain during this treatment period. The following compounds of formula I were tested: A (1R,3R)-5-(2E,9Z)-12,12,12-trifluoro-11-hydroxy-7,7-dimethyl-11-trifluoromethyl-dodeca-2,9-dienylidene)-cyclohexane-1,3-diol B (Z)-(1R,3S)-4-methylene-5-(2E,9Z)-12,12,12-trifluoro-11-hydroxy-7,7-dimethyl-11-trifluoromethyl-dodeca-2,9-dienylidene-cyclohexane-1,3-diol C (Z)-(1R,3S)-5-((2E,9E)-12,12,12-trifluoro-11-trifluoromethyl-11-hydroxy-7,7-dimethyl-dodec-2,9-dienylidene)-4-methylene-cyclohexane-1,3-diol D (1R,3R)-5-(2E,9E)-12,12,12-trifluoro-11-trifluoromethyl-11-hydroxy-7,7-dimethyl-dodeca-2,9-dienylidene-cyclohexane-1,3-diol E (1R,3R)-5-(2E)-12,12,12-trifluoro-11-hydroxy-7,7-dimethyl-11-trifluoromethyl-dodec-2-enylidene)-cyclohexane-1,3-diol F (Z)-(1R,3S)-5-(2E)-12,12,12-trifluoro-11-hydroxy-7,7-dimethyl-11-trifluoromethyl-dodec-2-enylidene-4-methylene-cyclohexane-1,3-diol G (Z)-(1R,3S)-5-(E)-11-hydroxy-7,7,11-trimethyl-dodec-2-enylidene-4-methylene-cyclohexane-1,3-diol H (2E)-(1R,3R)-5-(11-hydroxy-7,7,11-trimethyl-dodeca-2-enylidene)-cyclohexane-1,3-diol I (E)-(1R,3R)-5-12,12,12-trifluoro-11-hydroxy-7,7-dimethyl-11-trifluoromethyl-dodec-2-en-9-ynylidene-cyclohexane-1,3-diol J (Z)-(1R,3S)-4-methylene-5-(E)-12,12,12-trifluoro-11-hydroxy-7,7-dimethyl-11-trifluoromethyl-dodec-2-en-9-ynylidene-cyclohexane-1,3-diol K (10E)-(3R,5R)-12-(3,5-dihydroxy-cyclohexylidene)-6,6-dimethyl-2-methyl-dodec-10-en-3-yn-2-ol The results are compiled in Table I below. For calcitriol a HTD of 0.5 g/kg was observed. In comparison thereto, for the compounds of formula I (compounds A to K) HTD figures ranging from 80 to 5000 g/kg were observed. 2. VDR Activation In order to measure the activation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) by vitamin D analogs in cells a transcription activation assay was used. COS cells were cotransfected with the human VDR (expressed in pSG5) and a reporter gene containing three response elements (VDRE3) from the rat osteocalcine gene, the thymidine kinase basal promoter, and the luciferase reporter gene, respectively. From Table I it can be been that the listed compounds A to K are very potent with respect to VDR activation. Moreover ail these compounds A to K have a greater therapeutic window than calcitriol (as indicated by the TI shift vs calcitriol). TABLE I VDR act (ED 50 , HTDsc mouse Compound nanomolar) g/kg HTD/VDR TI shift Calcitriol 2.8 0.5 0.18 1 A 180 2500 14 78 B 50 3000 60 333 C 4 200 50 278 D 5.7 100 18 100 E 6.6 100 15 83 F 4 80 20 111 G 110 5000 45 250 H 280 5000 18 100 I 13 333 26 144 J 4.8 310 65 361 K 220 5000 23 127 HTDsc: highest tolerated subcutaneous dose (g/kg) without weight loss TI shift: shift in ,,therapeutic index, defined as the ratio HTD/VDR of the test compound divided by the ratio HTD/VDR of calcitriol. 3. The Mouse Model Orally administered vitamin D analogues can lead to epidermal thickening (acanthosis) in hairless mice. This skin effect is considered as indicative for antipsoriatic potential of vitamin D analogues. Analogues were tested for 4 days at different dosages in order to detect compounds which show this epidermal effect at subtoxic and non-toxic doses (dosage leading to slight or no weight loss). At the higest tolerated dose calcitriol itself was not able to elicit skin effects. The calcitriol data were obtained from animals treated for three days. Hairless mice (Moro hr/hr) received daily administrations of the test compound in arachis oil by gavage for 4 days, using 2-5 different dosages (3 fold increments; 2 animals per dosage group). Daily measurements of body weight allowed to judge toxicity (calcemic liability) and determine the non-toxic dose level defined as the dose which is tolerated without weight loss. The mice were sacrificed at day 5 and skin biopsies were taken, fixed in formalin and treated for histological evaluation. The results in Table II below show that many of the retiferols of formula I, are far superior to calcitriol due to a better ratio between the effective dose and the maximal tolerated dose (HTD po ). This may translate in a better separation between wanted skin effects (ED 50 ) and toxic calcemic effects.

The Pig Model Orally administered vitamin D analogs can lead to epidermal proliferation in minipigs. This skin effect is considered as indicative for an antipsoriatic potential of vitamin D analogs. Compounds were tested for seven days at different doses in order to detect those which showed a skin effect at non calcemic dose (no calcemic effect). The pigs were daily observed as to adverse effects such as behavior, mobility, stool. At day seven bromodeoxyuridine (4 mg/kg) was injected intravenously into the treated pigs and 2 hours later skin biopsies (6 mm diameter) and blood were taken for analysis. The skin biopsies were fixed in formalin, and paraffin sections were prepared using standard procedures. Using standard immuno-histochemical techniques, cells in the S-phase (DNA synthesis phase) were labelled by the binding of a specific monoclonal antibody against the thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine. The number of labelled epidermal cells per unit of length along the surface was taken as a measure of epidermal proliferative activity (labelings index LI). Clinical chemistry was performed using Cobas Mira. Calcitriol itself did not induce hyperproliferation even at highly toxic does (9 times the dose that induces hypercalcemia).

This application is a 371 of PCT/EP97/04248 filed on Feb. 6, 1997. The present invention relates to a process which is an improvement over the prior art for preparing fluorine-containing compounds by means of a halogen-fluorine exchange reaction. Fluorine-containing compounds are employed, inter alia, in liquid-crystalline mixtures (EP 0 602 596). The halogen-fluorine exchange reaction is also known by the name halex reaction. It is an extensively employed method of introducing fluorine substituents into a compound containing fluorine-exchangeable halogen. In the case of aromatic compounds, especially activated aromatic compounds, the halogen-fluorine exchange proceeds in the manner of a nucleophilic substitution. The implementation of this reaction requires relatively high reaction temperatures, which are often between 200 and 300 C., leading to the formation of in some cases considerable amounts of decomposition products. In general it is impossible to operate without a solvent, so that the space-time yields are much lower than those of solvent-free processes. As an alternative to this it is possible to use conventional phase transfer catalysts, by means of which some of the abovementioned disadvantages can be reduced. Other problems, such as poor stirrability of the reaction suspension in the case of solvent-free processes, continue to exist. Phase transfer catalysts used to date have been quaternary alkylammonium or alkylphosphonium salts (U.S. Pat. No. 4,287,374), pyridinium salts (WO 87/04194), crown ethers or tetraphenylphosphonium salts (J. H. Clark et al., Tetrahedron Letters 28 1987, pages 111 to 114). Some of these phase transfer catalysts have comparatively low levels of activity and are only moderately stable at the temperatures required for the implementation of the reaction. In view of these restrictions and disadvantages there is a great need for a process which avoids the disadvantages inherent in the known processes, especially high reaction temperatures and long reaction times, and which, moreover, provides the desired fluorine-containing compounds in yields ranging from good to very good at lower reaction temperatures and in shorter reaction times. This object is achieved by a process for preparing fluorine-containing compounds by reacting a compound which contains fluorine-exchangeable halogen with a fluoride or a mixture of fluorides with the formula I MeF(I), in which Me is an alkaline earth metal ion, NH 4 -ion or alkali metal ion, in the presence or absence of a solvent at a temperature from 40 to 260 C., which comprises carrying out the reaction in the presence of a compound or a mixture of compounds of the formula (II) in which A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , A 4 , A 5 , A 6 , A 7 , A 8 independently of one another are identical or different and are a straight-chain or branched alkyl or alkenyl having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl having 4 to 8 carbon atoms, an aryl having 6 to 12 carbon atoms, or an aralkyl having 7 to 12 carbon atoms, or A 1 A 2 , A 3 A 4 , A 5 A 6 , and A 7 A 8 independently of one another are identical or different and are connected to one another directly or by way of O or NA 9 to form a ring having 3 to 7 ring members, A 9 is an alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and B is a monovalent acid radical or the equivalent of a polyvalent acid radical. It should be regarded as surprising that the use of the compounds of the formula (II) as catalyst leads to a strong acceleration of the reaction, thereby making it possible to implement the halogen-fluorine exchange reaction (halex reaction) under considerably milder conditions, in particular at lower temperatures and/or with shorter reaction times. At the same time it is also possible by this means to suppress or substantially avoid the formation of unwanted byproducts. The novel process has other advantages as well. For instance, the compounds of the formula (II) are not toxic, or at most only slightly toxic, and in addition possess a resistance to thermal stress which is superior to that of the prior art catalysts that are frequently employed. If a compound of the formula (II) in which the radicals A 1 to A 8 are each a methyl group is used and is subjected over 10 hours to a temperature of not less than 230 C., then only 0.2% of carbonaceous decomposition products are subsequently found. The term fluorine-exchangeable halogen refers to chlorine, bromine or iodine, especially chlorine or bromine, preferably chlorine, which can be exchanged for fluoride in the context of a nucleophilic substitution. A further advantage of the novel process is that a large number of compounds can be employed as starting material. Thus it is possible to employ, as the compound containing fluorine-exchangeable halogen, an aromatic compound whose ring system has from 0 to 3 nitrogen atoms and carries a chlorine or bromine substituent, in particular a chlorine substituent, which can be exchanged for fluorine which compound may have at least one further substituent which promotes nucleophilic substitution of the aromatic compound. With no claim to completeness, suitable starting compounds for the novel process are aromatic compounds of the benzene, naphthalene, pyridine, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrimidine and pyrazine type and of the type of benzofused ring systems of pyridine (quinoline, isoquinoline, acridine or acridone type), of pyrimidine, pyrazine and piperazine (benzodiazines of the cinnoline, phthalazine, quinazoline, quinazoline, phenazine or phenoxazine type) and derivatives thereof which may have at least one further substituent which promotes the nucleophilic substitution of the aromatic compound. This further substituent which promotes the nucleophilic substitution of the aromatic compound usually leads to an activation of the aromatic compound, which is thereby more readily amenable to a halogen-fluorine exchange reaction. The further substituent which promotes the nucleophilic substitution of the aromatic compound comprises I and M substituents, which reduce the electron density or, respectively, the nucleophilicity of the aromatic compound and thereby make electrophilic substitution more difficult. However, the aromatic compound is thereby activated with respect to a nucleophilic substitution. The activating effect of these substituents is particularly great when they stand ortho or para to the halogen that is to be exchanged for fluorine, this halogen being, in particular, chlorine or bromine, preferably chlorine. With no claim to completeness mention may be made, as further substituents which promote the nucleophilic substitution and thus the halogen-fluorine exchange reaction, especially the chlorine-fluorine exchange reaction, of F, Cl, Br, I, NO 2 , NO, CF 3 , CN, CHO, COF, COCl, SO 2 F, SO 2 Cl, OCF 3 , SCF 3 , SOCF 3 , SO 2 CF 3 , COOR, CONRR, SO 2 R, COR, OR or a radical COOCO, CONRCO, which links two ortho positions, especially F, Cl, NO 2 , CF 3 , CN, CHO, COCl, SO 2 Cl, COOR, SO 2 CF 3 , CONRR, SO 2 R, or COR, preferably F, Cl, NO 2 , CF 3 , CN, CHO or COCl, where R and R each independently of one another are identical or different and are H, a straight-chain or branched alkyl having 1 to 6, especially 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an aryl having 6 to 12 carbon atoms or aralkyl having 7 to 12 carbon atoms and where the alkyls and aralkyls are unsubstituted or substituted from one to three times by halogen, especially by fluorine or chlorine. It is possible to employ an aromatic compound which possesses on the ring system a fluorine-exchangeable chlorine or bromine substituent, especially a chlorine substituent, and which has at least one further substituent from the series consisting of F, Cl, Br, I, NO 2 , CF 3 , CN, CHO, COF, COCl, SO 2 F, SO 2 Cl, OCF 3 , SCF 3 , SOCF 3 , SO 2 CF 3 , COOR, CONRR, SO 2 R, COR and OR or a radical COOCO, CONRCO, which links two ortho positions, where R and R each independently of one another are identical or different and are H, a straight-chain or branched alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an aryl having 6 to 12 carbon atoms or aralkyl having 7 to 12 carbon atoms, and where the alkyls and aralkyls are unsubstituted or substituted from one to three times by halogen. The abovementioned aromatic compounds may also contain additional substituents, examples being alkyl radicals or amino, alkylamino, hydroxyl or alkoxy groups. It is possible to employ as starting material an aromatic compound which has on the ring system a fluorine-exchangeable chlorine or bromine substituent, especially a chlorine substituent, and which has as a further substituent at least one fluorine-exchangeable chlorine or bromine, especially chlorine, and which may have at least one further substituent from the series consisting of F, NO 2 , CF 3 , CN, CHO, COF, COCl, SO 2 F, SO 2 Cl, OCF 3 , SCF 3 , SO 2 CF 3 , COOR, CONRR, SO 2 R, COR, OR, COOCO and CONRCO. Accordingly, these starting compounds possess at least two fluorine-exchangeable halogen substituents which independently of one another can be chlorine or bromine, especially chlorine. These compounds are usually amenable to single or double halogen-fluorine exchange without necessarily possessing a further substituent from the abovementioned series. They may, however, also possess a further substituent from the series of the abovementioned radicals which promotes the nucleophilic substitution of the aromatic compound. The presence of the substituents increases the reactivity of the aromatic compound in respect of the halogen-fluorine exchange reaction. In the novel process it is possible with great success to employ a compound of the formula (III) in which W is N or CR 3 , X is N or CR 4 , Y is N or CR 5 , Z is N or CR 6 but, W, X and Y are not simultaneously N, R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 and R 6 are identical or different and are H, F, Cl, Br, I, NO 2 , NO, CF 3 , CN, CHO, COF, COCl, SO 2 F, SO 2 Cl, OCF 3 , SCF 3 , SO 2 CF 3 , COOR, CONRR, SO 2 R, COR, OR, or a radical COOCO, CONRCO or CRCRCRCR, which links two ortho positions, R and R are as defined above and radicals R independently of one another are identical or different and have the same meaning as R 1 to R 6 , and at least one of the radicals R 1 to R 6 is chlorine or bromine, especially chlorine. A compound of the formula (III) can be employed in which R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 and R 6 are identical or different and in particular are H, F, Cl, Br, NO 2 , CF 3 , CN, CHO, or COCl, preferably H, F, Cl, NO 2 , CN or CHO. It is also possible to employ a compound of the formula (III) in which only one of the radicals R 1 to R 6 is chlorine or bromine, especially chlorine, none of the radicals W, X, Y and Z is a nitrogen atom and at least one of the remaining radicals from the group R 1 to R 6 is NO 2 , CF 3 , CN, CHO, COF, COCl, SO 2 F, SO 2 Cl, OCF 3 , SCF 3 , SO 2 CF 3 , COOR, CONRR, SO 2 R, COR, OR, COOCO, CONRCO or CRCRCRCR. In the process it is possible to employ a compound of the formula (III) in which 2 or more of the radicals R 1 to R 6 are chlorine or bromine, especially chlorine, the radicals W, X, Y and Z are 0 to 3 nitrogen atoms and the remaining radicals from the group R 1 to R 6 can all be hydrogen. In the process it is also possible to employ a compound of the formula (III) in which only one of the radicals R 1 to R 6 is chlorine or bromine, especially chlorine, at least one of the radicals W, X, Y and Z is a nitrogen atom and the remaining radicals from the group R 1 to R 6 can all be hydrogen. The incorporation of at least one nitrogen atom in the aromatic ring increases the reactivity of the aromatic compound such that a halogen-fluorine exchange is able to take place possibly even without the presence of a further substituent which promotes the nucleophilic substitution of the aromatic compound. It is possible with great success to employ a compound of the formula (IV) in which W is N or CR 3 , one of the radicals R 1 , R 2 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 and, if present, R 3 , is Cl, F, NO 2 , CF 3 , CN, CHO, COF, COCl, SO 2 F, SO 2 Cl, OCF 3 , SCF 3 , SO 2 CF 3 , COOR, CONRR, SO 2 R, COR or OR or two of the radicals which are ortho to one another are COOCO or CONRCO, where R and R each independently of one another are identical or different and are H, a straight-chain or branched alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an aryl having 6 to 12 carbon atoms or aralkyl having 7 to 12 carbon atoms, another of the radicals R 1 , R 2 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 and, if present, R 3 is Cl and the remaining radicals are H, F or Cl. With good prospect of success it is also possible to employ a compound of the formula (IV) in which W is N or CR 3 , one of the radicals R 1 , R 2 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 or the radical R 3 is Cl, F, NO 2 , CF 3 , CN, CHO, COF, COCl, SO 2 F, SO 2 Cl, OCF 3 , SCF 3 , SO 2 CF 3 , COOR, CONRR, SO 2 R, COR or OR or two of the radicals which are ortho to one another are COOCO or CONRCO, where R and R each independently of one another are identical or different and are H, a straight-chain or branched alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an aryl having 6 to 12 carbon atoms or aralkyl having 7 to 12 carbon atoms, another of the radicals R 1 , R 2 , R 4 , R 5 and R 6 is Cl and the remaining radicals are H, F or Cl. The radicals COOCO and CONRCO concern in general two of the radicals R 1 to R 6 which are ortho to one another, especially two mutually ortho radicals from the group R 1 , R 2 , R 4 , R 5 and R 6 , if W is N, or two mutually ortho radicals from the group R 2 , R 3 and R 4 , if W is CR 3 . In the compound of formula (IV) one of the radicals R 1 , R 2 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 and, if present, R 3 or the radical R 3 in particular is Cl, F, NO 2 , CF 3 , CN, CHO, COF, COCl, OCF 3 , COOR, COONRR, COR, OR, COOCO or CONRCO, preferably Cl, F, NO 2 , CF 3 , CN, CHO, COOR or COCl, R and R are in particular H, a straight-chain or branched alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms or aryl having 6 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably H or a straight-chain or branched alkyl having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, particularly preferably methyl or ethyl, one or two of the radicals R 1 , R 2 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 and, if present, R 3 is or are Cl, and the remaining radicals are identical or different and are H or Cl. The formula (IV) given above embraces nonactivated compounds in which one of the radicals R 1 , R 2 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 and, if present, R 3 is Cl or F and in addition one, two or more of the radicals R 1 , R 2 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 and, if present, R 3 are Cl and the compounds resulting therefrom contain one, two or more Cl if one of the abovementioned radicals is F, or contain two, three or more Cl if one of the abovementioned radicals is not F but instead is Cl. Examples of nonactivated pyridine derivatives of this kind in which W in formula (IV) is N are 2,3-dichloropyridine, 2,4-dichloropyridine, 2,5-dichloropyridine, 2,6-dichloropyridine, 3,4-dichloropyridine, 3,5-dichloropyridine, 2,3,4-trichloropyridine, 2,3,5-trichloropyridine, 2,3,6-trichloropyridine, 2,4,6-trichloropyridine, tetrachloropyridine and pentachloropyridine and also fluorinated chloropyridines formed from the abovementioned chloropyridines by partial fluorination. Examples of nonactivated benzene derivatives of this kind in which W in formula (IV) is CR 3 are 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1,3-dichlorobenzene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, 1,2,3-trichlorobenzene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene, 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene, 1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene, 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene, and also fluorinated chlorobenzenes which are formed from the abovementioned chlorobenzenes by partial fluorination. The formula (IV) given above also embraces compounds which comprise an activating radical. A suitable activating radical is NO 2 , CF 3 , CN, CHO, COF, COCl, SO 2 F, SO 2 Cl, OCF 3 , SCF 3 , SO 2 CF 3 , COOR, COONRR, SO 2 R, COR, OR, CO 0 CO or CONRCO, especially NO 2 , CF 3 , CN, CHO, COF, COCl, OCF 3 , COOR, CONRR, COR, OR, CO 0 CO or CONRCO, preferably NO 2 , CF 3 , CN, CHO, COCl, COOR, COR. In the case of the compounds which contain an activating radical one of the radicals R 1 to R 6 in formula (IV), especially one of the radicals from the group R 1 , R 2 , R 4 , R 5 , and R 6 , if W is N, or especially the radical R 3 if W is CR 3 , is the activated radical. The activating radical is particularly effective if the Cl which is to be exchanged for F is ortho or para to the activating radical. In this context it should again be mentioned that the N atom in the pyridine ring is likewise activating in the context of a chlorine-fluorine exchange. The novel process relates not only to the exchange of Cl ortho and/or para to an activating radical but also to the exchange of Cl in the less favored meta positions. Thus it is also possible to employ compounds of the formula (V) in which W is N or CR 3 , where R 3 is NO 2 , CF 3 , CN, CHO, COF, COCl, SO 2 F, SO 2 Cl, OCF 3 , SCF 3 , SO 2 CF 3 , COOR, COONRR, SO 2 R, COR, or OR or are two radicals, in ortho position, from the group R 2 , R 3 , R 4 COOCO and CONRCO, in particular is NO 2 , CF 3 , CN, CHO, COF, COCl, OCF 3 , COOR, CONRR, COR or OR or are two radicals, in ortho position, from the group R 2 , R 3 and R 4 , preferably NO 2 , CF 3 , CN, CHO or COCl, and R 1 , R 2 and R 4 are H, F or Cl. The formulae (III), (IV) and (V), which are set out alongside one another below, are interrelated in a clear way. If X in formula (III) is replaced by CR 4 , Y by CR 5 and Z by CR 6 , then the result is formula (IV). If R 5 and R 6 in formula (IV) are replaced by Cl, then formula (V) is obtained. Thus the formula (V) can also be derived from formula (III). Attention is drawn to this interrelationship at this point in order to avoid a possible misunderstanding. With no claim to completeness the following substances which contain fluorine-exchangeable halogen are given as a small selection: 2-chloronitrobenzene, 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene, 2-chlorobenzaldehyde, 4chlorobenzaldehyde, 2-chlorobenzonitrile, 4-chlorobenzonitrile, 2-chlorobenzoyl chloride, 4-chlorobenzoyl chloride, 2,4-dichlorobenzaldehyde, 2,6-dichlorobenzaldehyde, 2,4-dichlorobenzonitrile, 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile, 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl chloride and 2,6-dichlorobenzoyl chloride. The fluoride of the formula (I) employed is calcium, ammonium, lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium or cesium fluoride or a mixture thereof, especially lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium or cesium fluoride or a mixture thereof, preferably sodium, potassium or cesium fluoride or a mixture thereof, and with particular preference potassium or cesium fluoride or a mixture thereof. It is in many cases sufficient to employ potassium fluoride alone. As far as the proportion of fluoride to starting compounds is concerned, it should be borne in mind that there may be instances in which an excess of fluoride can lead to unwanted side reactions. In such cases it is advisable to employ a substoichiometric amount of fluoride as well. The ratio of fluoride of the formula (II) to equivalent of halogen to be exchanged is usually (0.5 to 10):1, in particular (0.8 to 5):1, preferably (1 to 2):1, and, with particular preference, (1 to 1.5):1. As already mentioned at the outset, the reaction is conducted in the presence of a compound of the formula (II), which functions as catalyst. The compounds of the formula (II) can be prepared, for example, by reacting phosphorus pentachloride with dialkylamines. The equation below shows the reaction using dimethylamine: PCl 5 HN(CH 3 ) 2 PN(CH 3 ) 2 4 Cl Alternatively, it is possible to react phosphorus pentachloride in stages with different secondary amines, for example dialkylamines, so as to obtain asymmetrically substituted compounds of the formula (II). Further options for synthesizing compounds of the formula (II) are described by R. Schwesinger et al. in Angew. Chem. 103 (1991) 1376 and in Chem. Ber. 127 (1994) 2435 to 2454. It is possible to employ a compound of the formula (II) in which A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , A 4 , A 5 , A 6 , A 7 and A 8 independently of one another are identical or different and are straight-chain or branched alkyl or alkenyl, especially alkyl, having 1 to 12, especially 1 to 8, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or cycloalkyl having 4 to 8, especially 5 to 6 carbon atoms. These compounds are of particular interest because they can be prepared in a comparatively simple manner starting from the corresponding dialkylamines, dialkenylamines, dicycloalkylamines or secondary amines which comprise an alkyl and alkenyl radical, an alkyl and cycloalkyl radical or an alkenyl and cycloalkyl radical. Examples of alkyl are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, n-pentyl, 3-methylbutyl, n-hexyl and 2-ethylhexyl, especially methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and n-butyl, and examples of alkenyl are allyl, 2-propenyl and 2-n-butenyl, and examples of cycloalkyl are cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 4-methylcyclohexyl and 4-tert-butylcyclohexyl. It is also possible to employ a compound of the formula (II) in which A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 or A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 A 5 A 6 or A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 A 5 A 6 A 7 A 8 . These compounds, in which two or more of the groups A 1 A 2 , A 3 A 4 , A 5 A 6 and A 7 A 8 are identical to one another, are relatively easy to obtain. It is also possible to employ a compound of the formula (II) in which A 1 A 2 , A 3 A 4 , A 5 A 6 and/or A 7 A 8 . These compounds are comparatively easy to obtain and are therefore of interest. It is also possible to employ a compound of the formula (II), in which A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 or A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 A 5 A 6 or A 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 A 5 A 6 A 7 A 8 . These abovementioned compounds in which four, six or eight of the radicals A 1 to A 8 are identical are likewise of interest on the basis of their ready availability. It is also possible to employ a compound of formula (II) in which A 1 A 2 or A 1 A 2 and A 3 A 4 or A 1 A 2 and A 3 A 4 and A 5 A 6 or A 1 A 2 and A 3 A 4 and A 5 A 6 and A 7 A 8 are connected to one another directly or by way of O or NA 9 to form a saturated or unsaturated ring having 5 or 6 ring members. Accordingly, these compounds comprise one, two, three or four of the abovementioned rings. It is possible, furthermore, to employ a compound of the formula (II) in which A 1 A 2 or A 1 A 2 and A 3 A 4 or A 1 A 2 and A 3 A 4 and A 5 A 6 or A 1 A 2 and A 3 A 4 and A 5 A 6 and A 7 A 8 are connected to form a ring whose ring members comprise the N atom on which the respective radicals A 1 to A 8 are located, if appropriate O or NA 9 , and CH 2 -groups. In this group of substances the N atom together with the radicals A 1 to A 8 present thereon forms, for example, a hexahydropyridine ring, a tetrahydropyrrole ring, a hexahydropyrazine ring or a morpholine ring. Accordingly, these compounds comprise one, two, three or four of the abovementioned rings. In the compound of the formula (II) B is, as already mentioned above, a monovalent acid radical or the equivalent of a polyvalent acid radical, in particular the radical of an inorganic mineral acid, an organic carboxylic acid or an aliphatic or aromatic sulfonic acid. It is usual to employ a compound of formula (II) in which B is F , Cl , Br , I , HF 2 , BF 4 , C 6 H 5 SO 3 , p-CH 3 C 6 H 5 SO 3 , HSO 4 , PF 6 or CF 3 SO 3 , especially F , Cl , Br , I , HF 2 or BF 4 . The compound of the formula (II) is employed in an amount of from 0.5 to 35, in particular from 1 to 30, and, preferably, from 3 to 25% by weight, based on the compound which contains fluorine-exchangeable halogen. In order not to be governed exclusively by the abovementioned percentages by weight it is possible in a large number of cases to employ the compound of formula (II) in an amount of from 0.1 to 3, in particular from 0.4 to 5 and, preferably, from 0.5 to 1 mol-%, based on the compound which contains fluorine-exchangeable halogen. These amounts usually prove sufficient. With no claim to completeness, the following may be mentioned as examples of compounds of the formula (II). Tetrakis(dimethylamino)phosphonium chloride Tetrakis(diethylamino)phosphonium chloride Tetrakis(dimethylamino)phosphonium bromide Tetrakis(diethylamino)phosphonium bromide Tetrakis(dipropylamino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tris(diethylamino)(dimethylamino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tetrakis(dibutylamino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tris(dimethylamino)(diethylamino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tris(dimethylamino)(cyclopentylamino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tris(dimethylamino)(dipropylamino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tris(dimethylamino)(dibutylamino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tris(dimethylamino)(cyclohexylamino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tris(dimethylamino)(diallylamino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tris(dimethylamino)(dihexylamino)phosphoniumchloride or bromide Tris(diethylamino)(dihexylamino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tris(dimethylamino)(diheptylamino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tris(diethylamino)(diheptylamino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tetrakis(pyrrolidino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tetrakis(piperidino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tetrakis(morpholino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tris(piperidino)(diallylamino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tris(pyrrolidino)(ethylmethylamino)phosphonium chloride or bromide Tris(pyrrolidino)(diethylamino)phosphonium chloride or bromide. As catalyst it is possible to use a compound of the formula (II) or a mixture of two or more compounds of the formula (II). This is particularly simple if mixtures of compounds of the formula (II) as obtained in the synthesis are used. As mentioned beforehand above the process can be conducted in the presence or absence of a solvent. If used, suitable solvents include not only dipolar-aprotic and aprotic but also protic solvents. Examples of suitable dipolar-aprotic solvents are dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl sulfone, sulfolane (TMS), dimethylformamide (DMFA), dimethylacetamide, 1,3-dimethylimidazolin-2-one, N-methylpyrrolidone, hexamethylphosphoramide, acetonitrile and benzonitrile. These solvents can also be employed as a mixture. Suitable aprotic solvents without a pronounced dipolar character are aromatic hydrocarbons or chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene, ortho, meta-, para-xylene, industrial mixtures of isomeric xylenes, ethylbenzene, mesitylene, ortho-, meta-, para-chlorotoluene, chlorobenzene and ortho-, meta-, para-dichlorobenzene. It is also possible to use mixtures of these solvents. The aprotic or dipolar-aprotic solvents can be used in any desired amounts, for example from 5 to 500% by weight, although it is preferred to use small amounts in the region of from 5 to 30% by weight, based on the compound which contains fluorine-exchangeable halogen. If protic solvents are used the amounts employed are in the region of from 0.1 to 5, preferably from 0.1 to 2% by weight, based on the compound which contains fluorine-exchangeable halogen. The reaction temperature depends also on the nature of the compound which contains fluorine-exchangeable halogen. Thus compounds which are comparatively slow to react in general require higher reaction temperatures, while comparatively reactive starting materials can be reacted successfully even at relatively low temperatures. The same applies to the reaction times. Starting materials which are slow to react generally require longer reaction times than more reactive starting materials. At this point attention should be drawn to the fact that exchange of only one halogen for fluorine is in general easier to carry out than exchange of two or more halogens for fluorine. Double or multiple halogen-fluorine exchange requires, if indeed it takes place at all, reaction conditions which are usually much more drastic (higher reaction temperatures and longer reaction times) than single halogen-fluorine exchange. In a large number of cases it is sufficient to conduct the novel process at a temperature from 60 to 250 C., in particular from 90 to 220 C. and, preferably, from 120 to 200 C. The novel process can be practiced either under reduced pressure or else under atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure. This possibility is utilized, for example, by supplying small amounts of a low-boiling aprotic solvent which forms an azeotrope with water, for example benzene, xylene, mesitylene, cyclohexane or toluene, to the reaction suspension before the beginning of the reaction. Subsequently, part of the solvent is removed again from the reaction suspension together with water by applying reduced pressure. This procedure makes it possible to increase the reaction rate and the yield and, in addition, to minimize the formation of byproducts. The compound of the formula (II) can be used in the presence or absence of atmospheric oxygen. It is preferred to operate under inert gas, for example argon or nitrogen. When conducting the process it should be ensured that the reaction mixture is thoroughly mixed during the entire reaction. The process can be conducted discontinuously or continuously. The examples which follow demonstrate the invention without restricting it.
