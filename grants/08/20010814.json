ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT This invention was made with government support under Grant No. DE-FC0387-ER60615, awarded by the Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Alzheimers disease affects approximately 20 to 40% of the population over 80 years of age, the fastest growing age group in the United States and other post-industrial countries. Common features in the brain of patients with Alzheimers disease include the presence of abundant intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and extracellular amyloid rich -amyloid plaques. NFTs are cytoskeletal pathologies largely composed of aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins assembled into periodically restricted amyloid fibers called paired helical filaments. The major component of amyloid plaques is a peptide, a small 39-43 aminoacid long -amyloid peptide that is generated from the cleavage of a larger amyloid precursor protein. However, except for diffuse plaques formed almost exclusively of B-amyloid peptides, amyloid plaques are complex lesions containing numerous associated cellular products. Mutations causing increased production of the 42 amino acid form of this peptide have been genetically linked to autosomal dominant familial forms of Alzheimers diseases. Deposits of -amyloid occur very early in the disease process, long before clinical symptoms develop. Because these mutations appear to be pathogenic and cause Alzheimers diseases in transgenic mice, -amyloids are widely believed to play a causal role in the disease. Whether or not amyloid deposits are causal, they are certainly a key part of the diagnosis. Further, because amyloid plaques occur early in the disease, the ability to image deposits would provide a convenient marker for early diagnosis and prevention of the disease as well as a method for monitoring the effectiveness of therapeutic regimens. Alzheimers disease is currently definitively diagnosed by taking sections from postmortem brain and quantifying the density of neocortical amyloid deposits. Unfortunately, current techniques for detecting amyloid deposits and/or NFTs require postmortem or biopsy analysis. For example, thioflavin fluorescent-labeling of amyloid in brain sections in vitro is currently a widely-used method for evaluation of the brain. Another potential amyloid probe, Chrysamine-G, a congo red derivative, has also been developed. Congo red is a charged molecule and thus lacks sufficient hydrophobicity for diffusion through the blood brain barrier and is therefore not useful as an in vivo label. See Klunk et al, Neurobiology of Aging, 16:541-548 (1995), and PCT Publication No. WO 96/34853. Chrysamine G enters the blood brain barrier better than Congo red, but its ability to label amyloid plaques in Alzheimers brain appears weak. See for example, H. Han, C-G Cho and P. T. Lansbury, Jr J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118, 4506 (1996); N. A. Dezutter et al, J. Label. Compd. Radiopharm. 42, 309 (1999). Similarly, earlier attempts to use monoclonal antibodies as probes for in-vivo imaging of -amyloid were hampered by their limited ability to cross the blood brain barrier. See R. E. Majocha et al, J. Nucl. Med. 33, 2184 (1992). More recently, the use of monobiotinylated conjugates of 1251 -A1-40 with permeability through the blood brain barrier has also been proposed (See Y. Saito et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 22, 2288 (1991)), but its ability to label -amyloid plaques and/or NFTs in vivo has not yet been demonstrated. Quantitation of the deposits in vivo is not yet possible with the currently available probes. Accordingly, a need exists for a convenient marker for early diagnosis of Alzheimers disease. In vivo, non invasive determination of regional cerebral glucose metabolic rates (rCMRGl) with positron emission tomography (PET) has been an important tool in the assessment of brain function in Alzheimers disease patients. Numerous studies using 2-F-18fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) have demonstrated a characteristic metabolic pattern of hypometabolism in temporoparietal and frontal association areas. A few of these studies have compared rCMRGl with postmortem regional neuronal pathology. These results and the uncertainties of the Alzheimers disease pathogenic cascade highlight the importance of assessing amyloid and neurofibril deposition in vivo, non-invasively in these patients. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides methods for labeling structures, including -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, in vivo and in vitro, and comprises contacting a compound of formula (I): with mammalian tissue. In formula (I), R 1 is selected from the group consisting of C(O)-alkyl, C(O)-alkylenyl-R 4 , C(O)O-alkyl, C(O)O-alkylenyl-R 4 , CC(CN) 2 -alkyl, CC(CN) 2 -alkylenyl-R 4 , R 4 is a radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl and substituted aryl; R 5 is a radical selected from the group consisting of NH 2 , OH, SH, NH-alkyl, NHR 4 , NH-alkylenyl-R 4 , O-alkyl, O-alkylenyl-R 4 , S-alkyl, and S-alkylenyl-R 4 ; R 6 is a radical selected from the group consisting of CN, COOH, C(O)O-alkyl, C(O)O-alkylenyl-R 4 , C(O)-alkyl, C(O)-alkylenyl-R 4 , C(O)-halogen, C(O)NH, C(O)NH 2 -alkyl, C(O)NH-alkylenyl-R 4 ; R 7 is a radical selected from the group consisting of O, NH, and S; and R 8 is N, O or S. In formula (I), R 2 and R 3 are each independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and alkylenyl-R 10 , wherein R 10 is selected from the group consisting of OH, OTs, halogen, spiperone, spiperone ketal and spiperone-3-yl. Alternatively, R 2 and R 3 together form a heterocyclic ring, optionally substituted with at least one radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkoxy, OH, OTs, halogen, alkylenyl-R 10 , carbonyl, spiperone, spiperone ketal and spiperone-3-yl. In the compounds of formula (I), one or more of the hydrogen, halogen or carbon atoms can, optionally, be replaced with a radiolabel. For in vitro detection of -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in brain tissue, the plaques are labeled, and the brain tissue is then observed with a fluorescence microscope. For in vivo detection, the -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in brain tissue are labeled, preferably by injection of a solution containing a radiolabeled compound of formula (I). The locations of the labeled -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are then observed by any method capable of detecting and depicting the distribution of the radiolabeled compound within the body. According to the methods of the invention, amyloid deposits in cryostat and paraffin sections of Alzheimer-diseased (AD) brain tissue are labeled with a level of sensitivity similar to thioflavin S. Use of the present invention, however, has several advantages over using thioflavin S. Namely, no pretreatments are required. Moreover, unlike with thioflavin S, the methods work with minimal washing and without formalin or paraformaldehyde fixation or differentiation of tissue. Additionally, stock solution can be kept in the freezer for six months and still produce acceptable results at 1/100 to 1/1,000 dilutions, eliminating the need to make the stock up fresh, as is required for thioflavin S labeling. Systemically injected compositions according to the invention readily penetrate the blood brain barrier and label amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles demonstrating the ability of the present compositions to act as an in vivo imaging probe. The methods of the invention achieve in vivo labeling and detection of -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain of a living patient. The methods of the invention not only permit detection of Alzheimers disease, but also provide a way for physicians to monitor the progress of patients undergoing treatment for the disease. Thus, physicians can better determine whether a particular treatment method is successful and worthwhile. In still another embodiment, the invention is directed to a composition comprising a compound of formula (I): R 1 is selected from the group consisting of C(O)-alkyl, C(O)-alkylenyl-R 4 , C(O)O-alkyl, C(O)O-alkylenyl-R 4 , CC(CN) 2 -alkyl, CC(CN) 2 -alkylenyl-R 4 , R 4 is a radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl and substituted aryl; R 5 is a radical selected from the group consisting of NH 2 , OH, SH, NH-alkyl, NHR 4 , NH-alkylenyl-R 4 , O-alkyl, O-alkylenyl-R 4 , S-alkyl, and S-alkylenyl-R 4 ; R 6 is a radical selected from the group consisting of CN, COOH, C(O)O-alkyl, C(O)O-alkylenyl-R 4 , C(O)-alkyl, C(O)-alkylenyl-R 4 , C(O)-halogen, C(O)NH 2 , C(O)NH-alkyl, C(O)NH-alkylenyl-R 4 ; R 7 is a radical selected from the group consisting of O, NH, and S; R 8 is N, O or S; R 2 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl and alkylenyl-R 5 and R 3 is alkylenyl-R 5 , and R 5 is selected from the group consisting of OH, OTs, halogen, spiperone, spiperone ketal, and spiperone-3-yl, or R 2 and R 3 together form a heterocyclic ring, optionally substituted with at least one radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkoxy, OH, OTs, halogen, alkylenyl-R 5 , carbonyl, spiperone, spiperone ketal and spiperone-3-yl. One or more of the hydrogen, halogen or carbon atoms can optionally be replaced with a radiolabel. The invention is more preferably related to a composition comprising a compound of formula (II): R 2 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl and alkylenyl-R 10 and R 3 is alkylenyl-R 10 , wherein R 10 is selected from the group consisting of OH, OTs, halogen, spiperone, spiperone ketal and spiperone-3-yl, or R 2 and R 3 together form a heterocyclic ring, optionally substituted with at least one radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkoxy, OH, OTs, halogen, alkylenyl-R 10 , carbonyl, spiperone, spiperone ketal and spiperone-3-yl, and R 9 is an alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl group, and to pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof. One or more of the hydrogen, halogen or carbon atoms can optionally be replaced with a radiolabel.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to methods for labeling structures such as -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in vivo and in vitro. The methods all involve contacting a compound of formula (I): with mammalian tissue.

R 7 is a radical selected from the group consisting of O, NH, and S. R 8 is N, O or S. In formula (I), R 2 and R 3 are each independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and alkylenyl-R 10 , wherein R 10 is selected from the group consisting of OH, OTs, halogen, spiperone, spiperone ketal and spiperone-3-yl. Alternatively, R 2 and R 3 together form a heterocyclic ring, optionally substituted with at least one radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkoxy, OH, OTs, halogen, alkylenyl-R 10 , carbonyl, spiperone, spiperone ketal and spiperone-3-yl. In the compounds of formula (I), one or more of the hydrogen, halogen or carbon atoms may optionally be replaced with a radiolabel. In a preferred embodiment, the methods of the invention involve contacting a compound of formula (II): with mammalian tissue. In formula (II), R 2 and R 3 are as defined above, and R 9 is an alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl group. As used herein, the term alkyl refers to a straight or branched chain monovalent radical of saturated carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, pentyl, and hexyl. The term alkylenyl refers to a divalent analog of an alkyl group, i.e., methylenyl (CH 2 ), ethylenyl (CH 2 CH 2 ), etc. The term aryl refers to a mono- or polycyclic substituted or unsubstituted aromatic ring. As used herein, the term lower alkyl refers to a straight or branched chain monovalent radical having from one to four saturated carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, and t-butyl. As used herein, the term heterocyclic ring refers to a non-aromatic, monocyclic or bicyclic radical containing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 ring atoms, each of which is saturated or unsaturated, including 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. Nonlimiting examples include aziridine, azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperizine and derivatives thereof. Preferably, these heterocyclic rings are substituted with alkyl groups or substituted alkyl groups, for example, alkyl groups having substituents such as those defined for R 4 above. For the compounds of formula (I) and formula (II), preferably R 2 and R 3 are each independently alkyl, more preferably lower alkyl. For the compounds of formula (II), preferably R 9 is lower alkyl, more preferably methyl or ethyl, aryl and substituted aryl. Particularly preferred compounds for use in connection with the invention are 2-(1,1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-dimethylaminonaphthalene (DDNP) and 2-(1,1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-(ethyl)(methyl)(amino)-naphthalene, both of which can be optionally radiolabeled. Another preferred compound, particularly for use in vivo, is 2-(1.1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-(2- 18 F-fluoroethyl)-methylamino)-naphthalene (F-18FDDNP). The present invention is also directed to methods for detecting structures, such as -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in vitro and in vivo. The term structures refers to aggregates of biological materials containing peptides and other cellular materials that may occur as part of a disease pathology. The term peptides includes proteins. The compounds described above have fluorescent activity in the range of about 470 to 610 nm. In one application, the present invention labels -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in brain tissue. Accordingly, for in vitro detection Alzheimers disease, the compounds are contacted with brain tissue, and the brain tissue observed with a fluorescence microscope. For in vivo detection, preferably the compounds are radiolabeled. A preferred radiolabel is 18 F, which has a half-life of approximately two hours for position emission tomography (PET). Another radiolabel is radioiodine, for example, 123 I for use with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Alternatively, other radiolabels are used, such as 11 C, 13 N and 15 O, although these radiolabels are less desirable due to their relatively short half-lives. Any atom in the compound can be replaced with a suitable radiolabel. Radiolabeling can be achieved by any method known to those skilled in the art. For example, dry F-18fluoride ion 18 O(p,n) 18 F in K 2 CO 3 (0.75 mg) and Kryptofix 2.2.2 (19 mg) are added to a solution of the compound of formula (I) or formula (II) (4 mg in 1 mL CH 3 CN). The mixture is heated in an oil bath at 85 C. for about 10 to 40 minutes. After cooling and dilution with water, the radiolabeled product can be purified by preparative HPLC. Kryptofix 2.2.2 is a crown ether, available from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, Wis.). A solution containing the radiolabeled compound is then injected into the patient. As used herein, the term patient refers to any mammal, including humans, rats, mice, dogs and cats. Neuroanatomical regions can be determined manually using MRI scans, for example, using a Tela magnet, and then on amyloid-PET (positron emission tomography) and FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose-PET) by coregistration of the MRI scans. PET has current resolution of 2 to 3 min, a dynamic determination of radiolabeled compound deposition in the brain, and permits detection of abnormal areas. By the above-described methods, diseases characterized by the accumulation of -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles such as Alzheimers disease and other diseases associated with brain deterioration, can be detected.

After cooling, the mixture was distributed between water and ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was washed with brine, dried and evaporated. The residue was dissolved in acetone and loaded onto a 4 mm dry silica plate for radial chromatography. The plate was eluted with a 1:1 mixture of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate. Appropriate fractions were collected and evaporated to give 125 mg (12%)of 1-6-ethyl-(2-hydroxylethyl)-amino-2-naphthylethanone. A solution of 1-6-ethyl-(2-hydroxylethyl)-amino-2-naphthylethanone (125 mg, 0.486 mmol) in pyridine (3.5 mL) was cooled to 15 C. and p-toluenesulfonic anhydride (252 mg, 0.81 mmol) was added with stirring under argon. The reaction mixture was allowed to slowly warm up to the room temperature, and stirring was continued for 24 hours. Because TLC (silica, 10% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether) revealed that the starting material was still present, more p-toluenesulphonic anhydride (252 mg, 0.81 mmol) was added, and stirring was continued for an additional 24 hours. The mixture was then cooled in an ice-water bath and distributed between brine and ether. The organic layer was dried and evaporated to leave an oily residue. The product, 6-acetyl-2-(ethyl-2-(4-methylphenyl)-sulfonyloxy-ethylamino)-naphthalene, was isolated by radial chromatography (1 mm silica, dichloromethane) in 30% yield.

After recrystallization from ethyl acetate, the sample melted at 170.5-172 C. 1-(6-piperazino-2-naphthyl)-1-ethanone was also prepared by heating 1-(6-hydroxy-2-naphthyl)-1-ethanone (prepared as described in Example 1(b)) (441 mg, 2.36 mmol) at 140-150 C. with 6 g piperazine hydrate (30.9 mmol) and 244 mg (2.35 mmol) NaHSO 3 for 24 hours. Additional sodium bisulfite (2 g, 19.2 mmol) was added. After an additional 24 hours, more bisulfite (1 g) was added, and heating was continued (total reaction time 72 hours). After cooling, the mixture was extracted with 250 mL methanol. The residue after evaporation of methanol was suspended in 50 mL water and extracted with ethyl acetate (580 mL). Combined extracts were dried (magnesium sulfate) and evaporated to give 430 mg of yellow solid. Radial chromatography (4 mm silica, methanol) gave 83 mg (19%) of starting naphthol and 276 mg (46%; 56%, based on unrecovered starting material) of 1-(6-piperazino-2-naphthyl)-1-ethanone. The 1-(6-piperazino-2-naphthyl)-1-ethanone was in all respects identical with the compound obtained using the alternative method described above.

The course of the reaction was followed by TLC (silica, 5% methanol in dichloromethane). Every 10 minutes an additional amount of the dicarbonate was added until all starting material had reacted. A total of approximately 1.5 equivalents were used. A mixture of water and dichloromethane (60 mL each) was added, and, after thorough shaking, the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with an additional 30 mL of dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts were dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. During this procedure, the color of the solution turned from pink to light yellow. Evaporation in vacuo gave 295 mg (83%) of tert-butyl-4-(6-acetyl-2-naphthyl)-1-piperazinecarboxylate, which, on recrystallization from dichloromethane-petroleum ether mixture, melted at 153-154 C.

Dichloromethane (10 mL) was added and the solution was washed with saturated NaHCO 3 solution, dried, and evaporated in vacuo. A light yellow oil was obtained, which, on standing at room temperature, turned dark red. TLC showed that the change in color is due to decomposition of 2-1-(6-piperazino-2-naphthyl)ethylidenemalononitrile into several products, the most intense spot being low-R f red-orange. Selected 1 H NMR signals after neutralization: 2.72 (s, 3H, CH 3 ), 3.09 and 3.35 (t, J5 Hz, 8H, piperazine), 7.08 (s, 1H, 5-H, 8.02 (s, 1H, 1-H). Example 1(f)Preparation of 2-(1.1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-(2- 18 -F-fluoroethyl)-methylamino)-naphthalene (F-18FDDNP) A mixture of 4.15 g (55.5 mmol) NaHSO 3 , 8 mL of water, 0.78 g (4.19 mmol) of 1-(6-hydroxy-2-naphthyl)-1-ethanone (prepared as described in Example 1(b)), and 8 mL of 2-methylaminoethanol was heated and stirred in a steel bomb at 140 C. for 28 hours. After cooling, the mixture was distributed between ethyl acetate and water (500 mL and 200 mL, respectively). The organic layer was dried and evaporated to leave raw 1-(6-(2-hydroxyethyl-methylamino)-2-naphthyl)-1-ethanone (0.749 g, 73%) of which was further purified by radial chromatography (4 mm SiO 3 , CH 2 Cl 2 ). To a solution of 201 mg (0.83 mmol) of 1-(6-2-hydroxyethyl-methylamino-2-naphthyl)-1-ethanone in pyridine (6 mL), malononitrile (236 mg, 3.6 mmol) was added and the mixture was heated at 95 C. for 24 hours. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue was chromatographed by radial chromatography (4 mm SiO 2 1% MeOH/CH 2 Cl 2 ) to give 150 mg (73%) of 2-(1,1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-2-hydroxyethyl)-methyl-amino)-naphthalene. To the solution of 2-(1,1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-(2-hydroxyethyl)-methylamino)-naphthalene (120 mg, 0.41 mmol) in pyridine (5 mL), p-toluensulfonic anhydride was added (441 mg, 1.35 mmol). After stirring at room temperature for 1 hour, pyridine was removed under vacuum, and the residue was chromatographed by radial chromatography (2 mm SiO 2 , CH 2 Cl 2 ) to give 183 mg (80%) of 2-(1,1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-(2-tosyloxyethyl)-methylamino-naphthalene. Radioactive 18 F-fluoride 528.5 mCi from the cyclotron was transferred into a solution of 19 mg of Kryptofix 2.2.2 and 0.75 mg potassium carbonate in 50 L of water and 300 L of acetonitrile. Water was removed in a stream of nitrogen at 115 C. followed by codistillation with acetonitrile (3200 L). The tosylate (2-(1,1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-(2-tosyloxyethyl)-methylamino)-naphthalene, 4 mg) in 1 mL of acetonitrile was added, and the mixture was heated at 85-86 C. for 20 minutes. After cooling, 1 mL of water was added, and the mixture was transferred onto a C-18 Sep-Pak Cartridge, washed with distilled water (34 mL) and eluted with CH 2 Cl 2 (22.5 mL). Eluate was dried by passing through a column packed with sodium sulfate and loaded onto a HPLC column (Whatman Partisil Silica 10, 50010 mm, mL/min CH 2 Cl 2 :hexane7:3, UV detector 254 nm, radioactivity detector). Eluate was collected, appropriate fractions were combined, evaporated under vacuo to yield 50.7 mCi (17%, corrected for decay) of the titled product which was formulated for injection. The synthesis was complete in 50 minutes. Example 2 Detection and labeling of -amyloid plaques in vitro and in vivo, using brain tissue sections and rat brains, were conducted using the following procedures. A 2.1 mg/mL DDNP stock solution was prepared, which was adjusted to 8 mM in 100% ethanol. A DDNP working solution was prepared by diluting the stock solution with distilled water in a ratio of 1:100-1000 (stock solution:distilled water). -amyloid 250 M (1.25 mg/mL in distilled water) was aggregated at 37 C. for 48 hours. 5 L were smeared on slides, air-dried and then rehydrated with distilled water. Alternatively, A-positive brain tissue sections were rehydrated with distilled water. DDNP working solution was applied to each slide for 30 minutes at room temperature. The slides were washed three times for five minutes with distilled water. The slides were coverslipped with fluorescent protectant mounding media (Vectashield, available Vector Labs., Burlingame, Calif.) and observed under a fluorescence microscope with a thioflavin S or FITC filter. -amyloid 250 M (1.25 mg/mL in distilled water) was aggregated at 37 C. for 48 hours to produce fibrils confirmed by smears. Three rats were anesthetized. 3 L of a solution of A fibrils (1.25 g/L) were injected unilaterally into the cortex of each rat (Bregma 0, AP-4.1 mm, ML2.0 mm, DV-3.1 mm). Then 3 L of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were injected into the contralateral side of each rat brain as a vehicle control. After injection, the needle remained for 5 minutes to prevent reflux, and then the cranial hole was sealed with bone wax. Eight days after -amyloid injection into the rat brains, the rats were injected with 10 microliters of DDNP working solution (320 micromolar) prepared by diluting DDNP stock solution into 1.5% BSA (bovine serum albumin) in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2). After one hour, the rats were cardiac perfused with PLP fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, 1% lysin in 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Additional immersion fixation of rat brain was at 4 C. overnight with PLP fixative. The rat brains were washed with PBS, saturated in 10 and 20% sucrose, and snap frozen in chilled isopentane (70 C.) with liquid nitrogen. The brains were cryostat sectioned at 10 M around the needle-track and directly coverslipped with glycerol and fluorescence protectant (Vectashield). The brain sections were observed with a fluorescence microscope. FIGS. 1A to 1 F depict amyloid plaques labeled in sections from brain of an AD patient and a transgenic mouse, demonstrating that DDNP is able to label amyloid plaques. FIGS. 2A to 2 E depict labeled -amyloid plaques, demonstrating that DDNP passes the blood brain barrier in rats. It was found that DDNP readily labeled amyloid deposits in cryostat and paraffin sections of AD brain tissue with a level of sensitivity similar to thioflavin S. Use of DDNP has several advantages over thioflavin S. Namely, the use of DDNP requires no pretreatments and, unlike thioflavin S, works with minimal washing and without formalin or parafornaldehyde fixation or differentiation of tissue. Stock solution can be kept in the freezer for six months and still produce acceptable results at 1/100 to 1/1,000 dilutions, eliminating the need to make the stock up fresh, as is required for thioflavin S labeling. Example 3 Labeling of human -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in vivo were conducted using the following procedures. A patient was placed in a tomograph to obtain brain dynamic PET images. 8.0 mCi of 2-(1.1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-(2- 18 F-fluoroethyl)-methylamino)-naphthalene (F18FDDNP (specific activity: 5-12 Ci/micromol; mass:1 nanomol), prepared as described in Example 1(f), were injected intravenously into the arm of the patient. Dynamic acquisition data of brain images were recorded simultaneously in forty-seven brain planes for two hours. It was found that F-18FDDNP readily crosses the brain blood barrier and labels brain structures in a manner consistent with the presence of beta amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The patient had previously had 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)/positron emission tomography (PET) scans, as well as MRI scans to monitor brain atrophy. In areas where the maximum atrophy was observed in the MRI scans (low temporal and parietal lobes), maximum accumulation of the F-18FDDNP label was observed. In those areas, low glucose metabolism (as measured with FDG/PET scans) was also observed. Example 4 Labeling and detection of human -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in vivo were conducted using the following procedures. Ten human subjects, seven Alzheimers diseased patients (ages 71 to 80) and three control patients (ages 62 to 82) were studied. The patients were positioned supine in an EXACT HR962 tomograph (Siemens-CTI, Knoxville, Tenn.) with the imaging plane parallel to the orbito-meatal line. Venous catheterization was performed, and then F-18FDDNP (5-10 mCi) in human serum albumin (25%) was administered as a bolus via the venous catheter. Sequential emission scans were obtained beginning immediately after F-18FDDNP administration using the following scan sequence: six 30 second scans, four 3 minute scans, five 10 minute scans, and three 20 minute scans. Rapid venous blood sampling was performed via the indwelling catheter in two subjects for input function determination and plasma metabolite analysis. FIG. 3A provides a PET-F-18FDDNP (2-(1.1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-(2- 18 F-fluoroethyl)-methylamino)-naphthalene) image of a brain cross-section through the hippocampus-amygdala-entorhinal/temporal cortex region of an Alzheimers disease patient. The image was reconstructed from scanning data obtained 30 to 60 minutes post F-18FDDNP injection. Co-registered PET-FDG (FDG is 2-F-18fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose) and MRI (proton relaxation times) images of the patient are also shown, in FIGS. 3B and 3C , respectively, to provide information about glucose metabolism and anatomical structures on the cross-section, respectively. The medial temporal region appears darker in the F-18FDDNP scan (slower clearance) and lighter in the FDG scan (reduced glucose metabolism). FIG. 4 demonstrates that estimated residence times of F-18FDDNP in Alzheimers diseased patients are seen to be different from values in control patients. The residence time shown is in reference to that in the pons, an area known to have limited involvement in Alzheimers disease pathology. The residence time was calculated from the clearance rates of the tracer in affected regions of interest (ROI) and in the pons as: Residence time1/clearance rate for affected ROI1/clearance rate for pons Separate ROIs were defined in entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, lateral temporal cortex and pons. The region with the slowest clearance rate was used as the affected ROI in the calculation of the residence time shown in FIG. 4 . It was found that after intravenous injection, F-18FDDNP crosses the blood brain barrier readily in proportion to blood flow. Accumulation of radioactivity was followed by the differential regional clearance of F-18FDDNP. A slower clearance was observed in brain areas reliably known to accumulate -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, specifically the hippocampus-amygdala-entorhinal complex, as well as temporal and parietal cortex in more advanced states of the disease. rCMRGl measured with PET in these subjects were also consistent with the expected -amyloid plaque load and the possible presence of neurofibrillary tangles. In these patients, brain areas with low glucose metabolism were in general matched with high retention of F-18FDDNP. The hippocampus-amygdala-entorhinal cortex presented high retention of activity (F-18FDDNP) in most cases, even in patients with low severity of symptoms. A normal 82 year old volunteer presented deposition of activity in the hippocampus-amygdala-entorhinal complex in a PET study with F-18FDDNP, and low rCMRGl in the same areas, as measured with FDG, as shown in FIG. 4 . These results are consistent with observations that elderly individuals without apparent signs of dementia may present neurofibrillary pathology in the second layer of neurons of the entorhinai cortex and plaques in the hippocampal formation. Increased severity of symptoms was always accompanied with increased retention of activity, and slow clearance from temporal, parietal or frontal cortex, in agreement with expected A and neurofibrillary tangles deposition in these areas. In vitro autoradiography using F-18FDDNP with brain specimens of Alzheimer diseased patients also demonstrated a distribution of activity consistent with the presence of -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Binding was observed in hippocampus, temporal and parietal cortex matching results with immunostaining A and tau antibodies. Since DDNP and its derivatives are fluorescent, an evaluation of the ability of F-18FDDNP to label -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in vitro was also performed with the same brain specimens. In all Alzheimers disease brain specimens, excellent visualization of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid peptides, and diffuse amyloid was produced with both DDNP and F-18FDDNP, matching results with thioflavin S (24) obtained with the same samples. In FIG. 5 , the central image was obtained by immunostaining a forty five micrometer cryostate temporal cortex section of an Alzheimers disease patient incubated with AT8 (anti-phosphotau) and 10G4 (anti-AB1-15) at 1:800. Insets are adjacent sections of the same Alzheimers disease brain specimen stained with FDDNP. Images were generated using fluorescent scanning microscopy. Green arrows indicate approximate origin of inset with reference to central immunostaining section. Beginning in upper left corner and moving clockwise, the insets show (1) neuritic plaques, (2) diffuse plaque, (3) vascular amyloid, (4) dense plaques and tangles, and (5) dense tangles.

Novel compositions Application in cosmetics. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a novel use of N-acylamino acid derivatives. These compounds, for example those described in the international patent applications published under the numbers WO 92/20647, WO 92/21318, WO 94/26694, WO 94/27561 and WO 98/09611, are, in particular on account of their antimicrobial and antielastic activity, used as active agents in formulations for topical use. Such cosmetic, dermopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical formulations intended to care for the skin or mucous membranes must be easy to take up with the fingers before they are applied; when they are applied on the skin or on mucous membranes, they must spread easily, penetrate quickly and melt in well while at the same time affording sensations of freshness and softness, without being perceived as greasy or oily, and, after they have been applied to the skin or mucous membranes, they must not give rise to any sheen on the skin, or any unpleasant odour, or appear sticky; however, the sensations of softness and freshness resulting from their application must remain. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Now, in order to obtain a sensory profile which satisfies a formulation, it is often necessary to include texturing agents therein, which are compounds or mixtures of compounds capable of improving the rheological and sensory properties of the formulation. The applicant has found, unexpectedly, that N-acylamino acid derivatives can be used effectively as texturing agents for cosmetic, dermopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical formulations. Accordingly, a subject of the invention is the use of at least one compound of formula (I): in which R represents the characterizing chain of a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched fatty acid, the fragment RCO comprises from 12 to 22 carbon atoms and more particularly from 16 to 22 carbon atoms, represents the characterizing chain or cyclic radical of an amino acid, R 2 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical comprising from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or the topically acceptable salts thereof, as texturing agents, it being understood that the amino acid characterized by R 1 is not lysine, hydroxylysine or arginine. The expression topically acceptable salt means any salt of the acid of formula (I) which is biologically acceptable for the skin and/or mucous membranes, i,e, any salt which can in particular adjust the pH of the composition to a value of between 3 and 8 and preferably approximately equal to 5, which is a pH in the region of the skins pH. Examples of such salts are, in particular, alkali metal salts, such as sodium, potassium or lithium salts, alkaline-earth metal salts, such as calcium, magnesium or strontium salts; they can also be metal salts such as divalent zinc, copper or manganese salts or alternatively trivalent iron, lanthanum, cerium or aluminium salts. The compound of formula (I) present in the composition which is the subject of the present invention can be in free acid form or in partially or totally salified form. The expression characterizing chain used in the context of the present patent application denotes the main chain of the fatty acid or of the amino acid under consideration. Thus, for a fatty acid corresponding to the general formula RCOOH, the characterizing chain will be the chain represented by R. The linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated radical R represents a radical comprising from 11 to 21 carbon atoms, chosen, for example, from undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, heptadecyl, octadecyl, nonadecyl, eicosyl, uneicosyl, docosyl, heptadecenyl, eicosenyl, uneicosenyl and heptadecadienyl radicals. A subject of the invention is, more particularly, the use as defined above, for which, in formula (I), the fragment RCO represents in particular one of the following radicals: dodecanoyl (lauroyl), tetradecanoyl (myristyl), hexadecanoyl (palmitoyl), octadecanoyl (stearyl), eicosanoyl (arachidoyl), docosanoyl (behenoyl), octadecenoyl (oleyl), eicosenoyl (gadoloyl), docosenoyl (erucyl) or octadecadienoyl (linolenoyl). For an amino acid represented by the general formula: HN (R 2 )CHR 1 COOH, it will be characterized by the definition of R 1 ; for an amino acid represented by the general formula: it will be characterized by the definition of the cyclic radical: In the context of the present invention, the chain or the cyclic radical characterizing the amino acid are chosen from those of glycine, alanine, serine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, valine, threonine, proline, leucine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, histidine, tyrosine, tryptophan, asparagine, cysteine, cystine, methionine, hydroxyproline, ornithine and sarcosine. A subject of the invention is, more particularly, the use as described above for which, in formula (I), the chain or the cyclic radical characterizing the amino acid are chosen from those of glycine, proline, glutamic acid and sarcosine. The expression at least one compound of formula (I) means that the invention can be carried out with one or more of these compounds. The expression or more of these compounds means: either a mixture of compounds of formula (I), resulting from the condensation of a single amino acid with a mixture of fatty acids, and more particularly a mixture of fatty acids of natural origin, or a mixture of compounds of formula (I) resulting from the condensation of a mixture of amino acids with a single fatty acid, or a mixture of compounds of formula (I) resulting from the condensation of a mixture of amino acids with a mixture of fatty acids, and more particularly with a mixture of fatty acids of natural origin. The mixtures of fatty acids of natural origin which can be used advantageously for the preparation of the compounds of formula (I) are, in particular, those derived from coconut oil, palm kernel oil, palm oil, soybean oil, rapeseed oil, bovine tallow, spermaceti oil, herring oil or castor oil. According to a very specific aspect of the present invention, its subject is the use, as described above, of a mixture comprising at least one compound of formula (Ia) corresponding to formula (I), in which the cyclic radical characterizing the amino acid is that of proline, and at least one compound of formula (Ib) corresponding to formula (I) in which the characterizing chain of the amino acid is that of glutamic acid, and optionally at least one compound of formula (Ic) corresponding to formula (I) in which R 2 represents a methyl radical and R 1 represents the characterizing chain of sarcosine; as an example of such a use, mention may be made of the use of the mixture comprising N-palmitoylproline and N-palmitoylglutamic acid or the sodium or magnesium salts thereof or the use of the mixture comprising N-palmitoylproline, N-palmitoylglutamic acid and N-palmitoylsarcosine or the sodium or magnesium salts thereof. According to another very specific aspect of the present invention, its subject is the use, as described above, of a composition comprising N-cocoylglycine or one of the topically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of formula (I) are obtained by the methods known to those skilled in the art and described in particular in the international patent applications published under the numbers WO 92/20647, WO 92/21318, WO 94/26694, WO 94/27561 and WO 98/09611. A subject of the invention is also a composition (A) comprising; a) from 10% to 95% by weight, and more particularly from 60% to 80% by weight, of at least one compound of formula (I): in which R represents the characterizing chain of a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched fatty acid comprising from 12 to 22 carbon atoms, represents the chain or the cyclic radical characterizing the amino acid, chosen from those of glycine, alanine, serine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, valine, threonine, proline, leucine, phenylalanine, isolgucine, histidine, tyrosine, tryptophan, asparagine, cysteine, cystine, methionine, hydroxyproline, ornithine and sarcosine, R 2 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical comprising from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or one of the topically acceptable salts thereof, and R 2 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical comprising from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or one of the topically acceptable salts thereof, and b) from 90% to 5% by weight of at least one compound of formula (II) RCOOH, or one of the topically acceptable salts thereof. A subject of the invention is, more particularly, a composition (A) as defined above, for which the radical R comprises from 16 to 22 carbon atoms, and more particularly from 16 to 18 carbon atoms. According to one very specific aspect of the present invention, its subject is the composition (A) as defined above, comprising: from 30% to 50% by weight of palmitoylproline, from 5% to 25% by weight of N-palmitoylglutamic acid, from 0% to 25% by weight of N-palmitoylsarcosine and from about 5% to about 40% by weight of palmitic acid. According to another very specific aspect of the present invention, its subject is the composition (A) as defined above, comprising: from 30% to 70% by weight of cocoylglycine, from 0% to 25% by weight of N-cocoylsarcosine and from about 5% to about 45% by weight, and more particularly from 5% to about 20% by weight, of the mixture of fatty acids derived from coconut oil. A subject of the present invention is also a cosmetic, dermopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical formulation comprising, as texturing agent, an effective amount of at least one compound of formula I as defined above. In the context of the present invention, the expression effective amount means an amount representing from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight of the formulation. The cosmetic formulation is usually in the form of an aqueous solution, a dilute alcoholic solution or a simple or multiple emulsion, such as a water-in-oil (W/O), oil-in-water (O/W) or water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsion, or a dispersion of liposomes or of aminosomes. The term aminosome denotes a type of liposome formed by amphiphilic amino acid derivatives. Examples which may be mentioned are creams, milks, lotions, antisun emulsions, cosmetic wipes, gels such as shower gels or cream-gels, oils, soaps, liquid soaps, syndets, intimate-hygiene products, shampoos, make-up powders and mascaras, A subject of the invention is also the use of a composition (A) as defined above, to prepare a cosmetic, dermopharnaceutical or pharmaceutical formulation. This formulation is prepared according to the methods known to those skilled in the art which are suitable for the desired type of formulation, by combining composition (A) with the usual cosmetic active agents and excipients. The compounds of formula (I) are compatible with most known excipients, whether this is, for example, with reverse latices such as the compounds sold under the names Sepigel 305, Sepigel 501, Sepigel 502, Simulgel 600, Simulgel A or Simulgel EG, or with the compositions sold under the names Montanov 68, Montanov 14, Montanov 82, Montanov 202 or Sepiperl N and described, for example, in the patent applications published under the numbers WO 92/02778, WO 95/13863, WO 96/37285, WO 98/22207 or WO 98/47610. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The examples which follow illustrate the invention without, however, limiting it. EXAMPLE 1 Sensory Profile of a Composition According to the Invention a) A composition comprising about 45% of palmitoylproline, from 10% to 15% of N-palmitoylglutamic acid, from 10% to 15% of N-palmitoylsarcosine and about 30% of palmitic acid is prepared. b) A cream-gel (I) is prepared containing, as texturing agent, 3% of the composition prepared in paragraph a) and, as thickener, 3.5% of Sepigel 305, and a cream-gel (II) containing, as thickener, 3.5% of Sepigel 305 and containing no texturing agent. c) The sensory test was carried out on a panel of 15 individuals; these individuals assessed and compared the qualities of the two cream-gels in the following three situations: 1) Assessment of the uptake of the cream-gel with the fingers in order subsequently to spread it on the skin The panel assessed the ease of uptake. 2) Assessment of the application of the cream-gel onto the skin The panel assessed the ease of spreading, the melting nature, the sensation of freshness, the softness of the product, the absence of a greasy sensation of the product and the speed of penetration. 3) Assessment after application The panel assessed the odour on the skin, the sheen of the skin, the sticky aspect on the skin, the softness of the skin and the presence of residue. The results are given in the table below in the following manner; positive assessments or negative assessments when at least two thirds of the members are of the same opinion: undifferentiated assessment (indicated by idem) when less than two thirds of the members are of the same opinion: Cream-gel (I) Cream-gel (II) Invention Comparison Ease of uptake Easier Less easy Ease of spreading Easier Less easy Melting nature Melts more Melts less easily easily Sensation of Idem Idem freshness Softness Softer Less soft Greasy sensation Less greasy More greasy Penetration Faster Slower Odour on the skin Idem Idem Sheen of the skin Less shiny More shiny Stickiness on the Idem Idem skin Softness of the skin Softer Less soft Persistence More persistent Less persistent These results show that the presence of compounds of formula (I) in a cosmetic formulation markedly improve the sensory profile of the said formulation by improving its tactile properties.

metal compound thin film on semiconductor devices wherein, M is Ti or Zr; R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are each independently H or C 1-4 alkyl; and m is an integer ranging from 2 to 5. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an organometallic complex useful as a precursor for a thin metal compound layer fabricated in semiconductor devices, a process for the preparation thereof and metal organic chemical vapor deposition using same. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Semi-conductor devices have recently become more highly integrated and smaller in size than ever before, which generated needs to develop sophisticated materials and processes for forming thin films in the fabrication of semi-conductor devices. In response to such needs, there have been developed, for example, barium strontium titanate(BST) used in a capacitor for dynamic random access memory(DRAM), and ferroelectric materials such as lead zirconate titanate(PZT), strontium bismuth titanate(SBT), bismuth lanthanum titanate(BLT) used in ferroelectric random access memory(FRAM) and yttrium stabilized zirconia(YSZ) and metal oxides such as TiO 2 and ZrO 2 . Thin films of such materials are prepared by using such techniques as radio frequency magnetron sputtering, ion beam sputtering, reactive co-evaporation, metal organic decomposition(MOD), liquid source misted chemical decomposition(LSMCD), laser ablation and metal organic chemical vapor deposition(MOCVD). Among these methods, MOCVD is carried out by vaporizing one or more organometallic precursor compounds, transporting, using a carrier gas, the vaporized precursor(s) to the surface of a heated solid substrate and forming a thin film on the surface of the substrate through a chemical reaction. The MOCVD method is advantageous in that: it can be carried out at a relatively low temperature; the constitution and deposition rate of the thin film can be readily controlled by changing the amounts of the source materials and the carrier gas; and the final thin film has good uniformity and excellent conformal step coverage without causing any damage on the surface of the substrate. Therefore, MOCVD is widely used in manufacturing semi-conductor devices such as DRAM and FRAM. Generally, a precursor for CVD is required to have such properties as a high vapor pressure, high purity, high deposition rate, easy handling, nontoxicity, low cost and a suitable deposition temperature. However, conventional organometallic compounds for CVD such as metal alkyls, metal alkoxides and -diketonates have many drawbacks. For example, metal alkyls having relatively high vapor pressures such as Pb(C 2 H 5 ) 4 are very toxic (see Reference of Organometallic Dictionary). Metal alkoxides are sensitive to moisture, which relatively expensive metal -diketonates have low vapor pressures and are solids at room temperature, posing handling difficulties in CVD process(see Anthony C. Jones et al., Journal of the European Ceramic Society , 19(1999), 1431-1434). Besides the above problems, Ti(O i Pr) 4 (titanium tetraisopropoxide) is unstable at room temperature and a thin layer obtained from Ti(O i Pr) 2 (tmhd) 2 (tmhdtetramethylheptanedionate) has a fluctuating amount of Ti depending on the substrate temperature(see Jung-Hyun Lee et al., Electrochemical and Solid - State Letters , 2(10) (1999), 507-509). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a nontoxic organometallic complex which has a good thermal stability; is not sensitive to moisture; stays in the liquid form at room temperature; and can be conveniently used in a low temperature MOCVD for the production of a contaminant-free metal oxide film having a good conformal step-coverage In accordance with on aspect of the present invention, there is provided an organometallic complex of formula(I): where, M is Ti or Zr; R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are each independently H or a C 1-4 alkyl group; and m is an integer ranging from 2 to 5. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing an organometallic complex of formula(I) which comprises the steps of: mixing a metal compound of formula(II) or (III) with an amine compound of formula(IV) in an organic solvent in a molar ratio ranging from 1:4 to 1:5 and refluxing the mixture: M(NR 2 ) 4 (II) M(OR) 4 (III) HO(CR 3 R 4 ) m NR 1 R 2 (IV) wherein, R and R are each independently, a C 1-4 alkyl; R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are each independently H or a C 1-4 alkyl; and m is an integer ranging from 2 to 5. In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for depositing a metal oxide compound film on a substrate which comprises the steps of vaporizing the organometallic complex of formula(I) of claim 1 , optionally together with one or more organometallic precursors, at a temperature ranging from 20 to 300 C. and bringing the resulting vapor into contact with the substrate heated to a temperature ranging from 300 to 600 C.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Among the compounds of formula(I), preferred are titanium tetra(dimethylaminopropoxide) (Ti(dmap) 4 ), zirconium tetra(dimethylaminoethoxide) (Zr(dmae) 4 ) and titanium tetra(dimethylaminoethoxide) (Ti(dmae) 4 ), which are represented by formulae (V) to (VII), respectively: The compound of formula(I) of the present invention can be prepared by reacting a titanium or zirconium compound with an amine compound of formula(IV). The titanium or zirconium compound which can be used in the present invention is the compound of formula (II) or (III) and preferred are titanium tetra(diethylamine), zirconium tetra(diethylamine), titanium tetraalkoxide, zirconium tetraalkoxide. The representative amine compound which can be used in the present invention include N,N-dimethylpropanolamine, N,N-dimethylethanolmine and the like. The solvent which may be used in the preparation of the compound of formula(I) is a conventional organic solvent such as hexane, toluene and pentane. The metal compound of formula(II) or (III) and the amine compound of formula(IV) may be employed in a ratio ranging from 1:4 to 1:5. Refluxing the resulting mixture for 15 to 20 hours gives the desired compound of formula(I) in a yield of 90% or more. The organometallic compound of formula (I) of the present invention is a liquid at room temperature and highly volatile at a low temperature, and thus, it can be used as a precursor for CVD for fabricating a metal-containing thin film on a semi-conductor device. For example, the present invention can be used as a precursor by employing a conventional MOCVD method to obtain a thin layer of a metal oxide compound, e.g., a metal oxide such as TiO 2 , ZrO 2 (see Anthony C. Jones et al., Chemical Vapor Deposition , 4(2) (1998), 46-49), and YSZ(Yttrium stabilized zirconia) (see C. Dubourdieu et al., Thin Solid Films , 339 (1999), 165-173) or a ferroelectric material such as BST(barium strontium titanate)(see Jung-Hyun Lee et al., Electrochemical and Solid - State Letters , 2(10) (1999), 507-509), PZT(lead zirconate titanate)(see Anthony C. Jones et al., Journal of the European Ceramic Society , 19 (1999), 1431-1434), SBT(strontium bismuth titanate) (see C. Isobe et al., Integrated Ferroelectrics, 14 (1999), 95-103), BLT (bismuth lanthanum titanate). In practicing the present invention, the CVD process for the formation of a metal compound thin film using the inventive organometallic precursor may be carried out by vaporizing the inventive precursor at 20 to 300 C. and transporting the resulting vapor with a carrier gas to the surface of a substrate heated to a temperature ranging from 300 to 600 C., more preferably, 400 to 550 C., under a reduced pressure, e.g., 0.1 to 10 torr. The precursor may be vaporized by conventional bubbling delivery or liquid delivery. The bubbling delivery may be carried out by passing a carrier gas through a liquid precursor held in a container and the liquid delivery, by injecting a measured amount of a liquid precursor into an evaporator. In case of a liquid delivery process, the precursor may be diluted with an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran(THF), n-butylacetate and the like. The substrate which can be used in the present invention includes a conventional silicon substrate and a silicon substrate coated with Pt, Ir, IrO 2 , Ru, RuO 2 , SrRuO 3 or others. The thickness of the metal compound film may be conveniently controlled by adjusting the deposition time. The following Examples and Test Examples are given for the purpose of illustration only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of Ti(dmap) 4 (1) Ti(O i Pr) 4 (titanium tetraisopropoxide)(18.45 g, 65 mmol) was added to 150 ml of dry hexane and N,N-dimethylpropanolamine(DMPA)(30.76 ml, 260 mmol) was added slowly thereto. The mixture was refluxed for 20 hours, and then, cooled. The solvent was removed under a reduced pressure to obtain an orange liquid, which was distilled at 150 C. to give Ti(dmap) 4 as a dark brown liquid.(Yield 90%). A TGA scan of Ti(dmap) 4 thus obtained is shown in FIG. 1 . 1 H NMR (CDCl 3 300 MHz): 4.61(t, CH 2 , 8H), 2.43(t, CH 2 , 8H), 2.20(s, CH 3 , 24H), 2.90(t, CH 2 , 8H). EXAMPLE 2 Preparation of Ti(dmap) 4 (2) Ti(Net 2 ) 4 (titanium tetradiethylamine)(21.87 g, 65 mmol) was added to 150 ml of dry hexane and N,N-dimethylpropanolamine(DMPA)(30.76 ml, 260 mmol) was added slowly thereto. The mixture was refluxed for 20 hours, and then, cooled. The solvent was removed under a reduced pressure to obtain Ti(dmap) 4 as a dark brown liquid.(Yield 90%). 1 H NMR (CDCl 3 300 MHz): 4.61(t, CH 2 , 8H), 2.43(t, CH 2 , 8H), 2.20(s, CH 3 , 24H), 2.90(t, CH 2 , 8H). EXAMPLE 3 Preparation of Ti(dmae) 4 Ti(O i Pr) 4 (10 g, 35 mmol) was added to 150 ml of dry hexane and N,N-dimethylethanolamine(DMEA)(12.5 g, 140 mmol) was added slowly thereto. The mixture was refluxed for 20 hours, and then, cooled. The solvent was removed under a reduced pressure to obtain Ti(dmae) 4 as a dark brown liquid. (Yield 90%). 1 H NMR (CDCl 3 300 MHz): 4.34(t, CH2, 8H), 2.55(t, CH2, 8H), 2.28 (s, CH3, 24H) EXAMPLE 4 Preparation of Zr(dmae) 4 Ti(NEt 2 ) 4 (zirconium tetra(diethylamine))(24.68 g, 65 mmol) was added to 150 ml of dry toluene and N,N-dimethylethanolamine(DMEA)(26 ml, 260 mmol) was added slowly thereto. The mixture was refluxed for 20 hours, and then, cooled. The solvent was removed under a reduced pressure to obtain Zr(dmae) 4 as a colorless liquid.(Yield 90%). A TGA scan of Zr(dmae) 4 thus obtained is shown in FIG. 2 . 1 H NMR (CDCl 3 300 MHz): 4.09(t, CH 2 , 8H), 2.48(t, CH 2 , 8H), 2.16(s, CH 3 , 24H) TEST EXAMPLE 1 Thermal Stability FIGS. 3A and 3B show NMR spectra of Ti(dmae) 4 taken at 25 C. and 60 C., respectively. As can be seen from FIGS. 3A and 3B , the NMR spectrum of Ti(dmae) 4 at 25 C. is identical to that taken at 60 C. This suggests that the organometallic complex of the present invention is thermally stable at 60 C. TEST EXAMPLE 2 Mass Analysis FIGS. 4 to 6 represent mass spectra of Ti(dmap) 4 , Ti(dmae) 4 and Zr(dmae) 4 , respectively. As can be seen from FIGS. 4 to 6 , no peaks were observed after the peak corresponding to the molecular weight of each compound, i.e., 457, 401 and 444 for Ti(dmap) 4 , Ti(dmae) 4 and Zr(dmae) 4 , respectively. This suggests that each of the inventive compounds exists in a single molecule form and does not form aggregates. TEST EXAMPLE 3 Evaporation Temperature Generally, an organic precursor used in CVD of a thin film on a semiconductor device is required to vaporize at a temperature in the range of 200 to 260 C. in case of employing liquid delivery. As can be seen from FIGS. 1 and 2 , Ti(dmap) 4 and Zr(dmae) 4 , inventive organometalic complexes of the present invention, evaporate at 200 to 260 C. and thus can be effectively used as a CVD precursor. In contrast, as shown in FIG. 7 by a broken line, the vaporization of conventional precursor, Zr(TMDH) 4 (zirconium tetrakis-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptandione) of formula(VIII), begins after 350 C. which is too high for CVD. Further, although another conventional precursor, Zr(TMDH)(O i Pr) 3 (zirconium 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptandione) of formula(IX), begins to vaporize at 250 C. ( FIG. 7 , solid line), it is a solid at room temperature, posing a handling difficulty. Accordingly, the inventive compounds are more suitably used in MOCVD than the conventional precursors. TEST EXAMPLE 4 Thin Layer Deposition TiO 2 and ZrO 2 thin films were formed on a substrate by MOCVD employing Ti(dmae) 4 and Zr(dmae) 4 obtained in Examples 3 and 4, respectively, as the precursors under the conditions of evaporation temperature(vaporizer): 250 C.; the carrier gas flow rate: Ar/O 2 :300/300(sccm); deposition time: 20 min.; and the concentration of the precursor: 0.2M(in THF). The growth rate of the deposition layer was measured as the substrate temperature was changed as in FIGS. 8 (Ti(dmae) 4 ) and 9(Zr(dmae) 4 ). As can be seen from FIG. 8 , when TiO 2 was deposited by employing Ti(dmae) 4 , the deposition rate peaked at a substrate temperature of about 400 C., and then, tapered off gradually toward 500 C. Therefore, Ti(dmae) 4 can be effectively used as a CVD precursor to from a TiO 2 thin film. Similarly, when ZrO 2 was deposited by employing Zr(dmae) 4 , the deposition rate peaked at a substrate temperature of about 425 C. (see FIG. 9 ). Therefore, Zr(dmae) 4 can also be effectively used as a CVD precursor to from a ZrO 2 thin film. TEST EXAMPLE 5 Deposition of BST Thin Film A BST thin film was formed on a Pt/TaO x /SiO 2 /Si substrate by MOCVD employing Ti(dmae) 4 obtained in Example 3 as a precursor. As the starting materials for Ba and Sr,. Ba(thd) 2 L and Sr(thd) 2 L(thd2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-haptanedionate, LPMDT) were used and the molar ratios of Ba:Sr:Ti were controlled at 1:1:2. The deposition was conducted under the conditions of evaporation temperature(vaporizer): 270 C.; Ar 200 sccm, O 2 400 sccm, N 2 O 400 sccm; and the substrate temperature: 400 to 500 C. FIG. 10 shows the changes in the growth rate of the BST film(right) and the Ti fraction based on the total metal(left) with the substrate temperature. As can be seen from FIG. 10 , the growth rate is high at 420-480 C. and the Ti content remains more or less constant in that temperature range. Therefore, the inventive compound of the present invention can be used for CVD of various ferroelectric composite thin films on a semi-conductor device. While the embodiments of the subject invention have been described and illustrated, it is obvious that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit of the present invention which should be limited only by the scope of the appended claims. What is claimed is: 1.

A large number of known standard processes are available for the preparation of the pyridonylpyrazoles of formula I substituted at the pyridone ring, the choice of a suitable preparation process being governed by the properties (reactivities) of the substituents in the respective intermediates.

H. Wiley, Interscience Publishers, John Wiley Sons, New York, 1967, page 1 ff.; or in Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, Editors A. R. Katritzky and C. W. Rees, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1987, or by derivatisation according to known standard methods as described, for example, in Advanced Organic Chemistry, Third Edition, Editor J. March, John Wiley Sons, New York, 1985; in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, Editor R. C. Larock, VCH Publishers, Inc., New York, 1989; or in Comprehensive Organic Functional Group Transformations, Editors A. R. Katritzky, 0. Meth-Cohn, C. W. Rees, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1995, or as described in the Patent Specifications EP-A-0 361 114, U.S. Pat. No. 5,032,165, WO 92/02509, WO 92/06962, WO 95/33728 and WO 96/01254. The end products of formula I can be isolated in conventional manner by concentration or evaporation of the solvent and purified by recrystallisation or trituration of the solid residue in solvents in which they are not readily soluble, such as ethers, aromatic hydrocarbons or chlorinated hydrocarbons, by distillation or by means of column chromatography and a suitable eluant. The sequence in which it is advantageous for certain reactions to be carried out so as to avoid possible secondary reactions will also be familiar to the person skilled in the art. Unless the synthesis is specifically aimed at the isolation of pure isomers, the product may be obtained in the form of a mixture of two or more isomers. The isomers can be separated according to methods known per se. For the use according to the invention of the compounds of formula I or of compositions comprising them, there come into consideration all methods of application customary in agriculture, for example pre-emergence application, post-emergence application and seed dressing, and also various methods and techniques such as, for example, the controlled release of active ingredient. For that purpose a solution of the active ingredient is applied to mineral granule carriers or polymerised granules (urea/formaidehyde) and dried. If required, it is also possible to apply a coating (coated granules), which allows the active ingredient to be released in metered amounts over a specific period of time. The compounds of formula I may be used in unmodified form, that is to say as obtained in the synthesising process, but they are preferably formulated in customary manner together with the adjuvants conventionally employed in formulation technology, for example into emulsifiable concentrates, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granules or microcapsules. Such formulations are described, for example, in WO 97/34485, pages 9 to 13. As with the nature of the compositions, the methods of application, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, wetting, scattering or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances. The formulations, that is to say the compositions, preparations or mixtures comprising the compound (active ingredient) of formula I or at least one compound of formula I and, usually, one or more solid or liquid formulation adjuvants, are prepared in known manner, e.g. by homogeneously mixing and/or grinding the active ingredients with the formulation adjuvants, for example solvents or solid carriers. Surface-active compounds (surfactants) may also be used in addition in the preparation of the formulations. Examples of solvents and solid carriers are given, for example, in WO 97/34485, page 6. Depending on the nature of the compound of formula I to be formulated, suitable surface-active compounds are non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants and surfactant mixtures having good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. Examples of suitable anionic, non-ionic and cationic surfactants are listed, for example, in WO 97/34485, pages 7 and 8. In addition, the surfactants conventionally employed in formulation technology, which are described in, inter alia, uMcCutcheons Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood New Jersey, 1981, Stache, H., Tensid-Taschenbuch, Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich/Vienna 1981, and M. and J. Ash, Encyclopedia of Surfactants, Vol. I-III, Chemical Publishing Co., New York, 1980-81, are also suitable for the preparation of the herbicidal compositions according to the invention. The herbicidal formulations generally contain from 0.1 to 99% by weight, especially from 0.1 to 95% by weight, of herbicide, from 1 to 99.9% by weight, especially from 5 to 99.8% by weight, of a solid or liquid formulation adjuvant, and from 0 to 25% by weight, especially from 0.1 to 25% by weight, of a surfactant. Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ dilute formulations. The compositions may also comprise further ingredients, such as stabilisers, for example vegetable oils or epoxidised vegetable oils (epoxidised coconut oil, rape oil or soybean oil), anti-foams, for example silicone oil, preservatives, viscosity regulators, binders, tackifiers, and also fertilisers or other active ingredients. The compounds of formula I can be used successfully either in the form of a mixture comprising the isomers IW1a and IW1b or in the form of pure isomer IW1a or IW1b, generally on plants or the locus thereof, at rates of application of from 0.001 to 4 kg/ha, especially from 0.005 to 2 kg/ha. The concentration required to achieve the desired effect can be determined by experiment. It is dependent on the nature of the action, the stage of development of the cultivated plant and of the weed and on the application (place, time, method) and may vary within wide limits as a function of those parameters. The compounds of formula I and, generally, the isomers of formula 1 a especially, are distinguished by herbicidal and growth-inhibiting properties, allowing them to be used in crops of useful plants, especially cereals, cotton, soybeans, sugar beet, sugar cane, plantation crops, rape, maize and rice, and also for non-selective weed control. Crops is to be understood as meaning also crops that have been made tolerant to herbicides or classes of herbicides as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic techniques. The weeds to be controlled may be either monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous weeds, such as, for example, Stellaria, Nasturtium, Agrostis, Digitaria, Avena, Setaria, Sinapis, Lolium, Solanum, Phaseolus, Echinochloa, Scirpus, Monochoria, Sagittaria, Bromus, Alopecurus, Sorghum halepense, Rottboellia, Cyperus, Abutilon, Sida, Xanthium, Amaranthus, Chenopodium, Ipomoea, Chrysanthemum, Galium, Viola and Veronica. The following Examples further illustrate but do not limit the invention.

After 3 hours, the mixture is washed twice with dichloromethane and then rendered acidic with excess concentrated hydrochloric acid while cooling with an ice-bath. The resulting slurry is filtered, washed with water and dried in vacuo. 318 g of the desired product are obtained in the form of a white solid having a melting point of 135 C. (decomposition).

Stirring is then carried out for 5 hours at 100 C., after which the thionyl chloride is distilled off at normal pressure. After the addition of 50 ml of dry toluene, 20 ml thereof are distilled off. The resulting solution is poured into 200 ml of n-hexane and stirred overnight. After cooling in an ice-bath, the mixture is filtered and the filtration residue is washed twice with n-hexane. 68.7 g of the desired compound are obtained in the form of a brown solid. 1 H-NMR (CDCl 3 ): 8.60 ppm (d, 1H); 7.69 ppm (dxd, 1H).

By cooling occasionally with an ice-bath, the internal temperature is maintained below 30 C. The exothermic reaction has subsided after 1 hours. The reaction mixture is then stirred overnight at 22 C. and subsequently cold water is added slowly, while stirring well. Extraction is carried out with diethyl ether, and the combined ethereal phases are washed with dilute sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. 58 g of a tacky solid are isolated.

The residue obtained is digested in n-hexane, filtered, washed and dried. 1.88 g of the title compound are obtained in the form of a beige solid having a melting point of 140-143 C. Example P59 8-Chloro-5-(4-chloro-5-difluoromethoxy-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-6fluoro-imidazo1,2-apyridine-2-carboxylic Acid 0.51 g of 8-chloro-5-(4-chloro-5-difluoromethoxy-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-6-fluoro-imidazo1,2-apyridine-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (Example P58) is dissolved in 3 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide and, with cooling in an ice-bath, 0.63 ml of a 2N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is added. The mixture is then stirred for 1 hour at 22 C. Because the TLC analysis of a worked-up sample indicates that starting material is still present, a further 0.1 ml of 2N sodium hydroxide solution is added. After subsequently stirring for 30 minutes, the mixture is rendered strongly acidic with dilute hydrochloric acid, the resulting slurry is filtered, and the filtration residue is subsequently washed with cold water and dried in vacuo at 50 C. 0.35 g of the desired title compound is obtained in the form of a white solid (crude product). Example P60 8-Chloro-5-(4-chloro-5-difluoromethoxy-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-6-fluoro-imidazo1,2-apyridin-2-yl)methanol 0.56 g of 8-chloro-5-(4-chloro-5-difluoromethoxy-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-6-fluoro- imidazo1,2-apyridine-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (Example P58) is introduced at 22 C. into 5 ml of diethyl ether and then treated with a total of 0.18 g of lithium aluminium hydride in portions with stirring. The resulting reddish-brown suspension is subsequently stirred for 1 hour and then first an excess of ethyl acetate and then dilute hydrochloric acid are added dropwise. The separated organic phase is washed with brine, filtered and concentrated to dryness in vacuo. 0.14 g of a yellowish-brown oil is obtained, which is purified over silica gel using ethyl acetate as eluant. 0.40 g of the desired compound is obtained in the form of a beige solid having a melting point of 152-153 C.

(Example P58) Examples of specific formulations of the compounds of formula I, such as emulsifiable concentrates, solutions, wettable powders, coated, granules, extruder granules, dusts and suspension concentrates, are described in WO 97/34485, pages 9 to 13. BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES Example B1: Herbicidal Action Prior to Emergence of the Plants (Pre-Emergence Action) Monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous test plants are sown in standard soil in plastics pots. Immediately after sowing, the test compounds, each in the form of an aqueous suspension or emulsion prepared from a 25% emulsifiable concentrate (Example F1, c) in WO 97/34485, pages 9 and 10), are applied by spraying at a rate of application of 2000. g of active ingredient/ha (500 liters water/ha). The test plants are then grown in a greenhouse under optimum conditions. After 3 weeks test duration, the test is evaluated in accordance with a scale of nine ratings (1total damage, 9no action). Ratings of from 1 to 4 (especially from 1 to 3) indicate good to very good herbicidal action. Test plants: Avena, Setaria, Sinapis, Stellaria The compounds according to the invention exhibit a good herbicidal action. Examples of the good herbicidal activity of the compounds of formula I are given in Table B1. TABLE B1 Pre-emergence action: Test plant Concentration Compd.

Example B2: Post-Emergence Herbicidal Action Monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous test plants are grown in a greenhouse in plastics pots containing standard soil and at the 4- to 6-leaf stage are sprayed with an aqueous suspension or emulsion of the test substances of formula I, prepared from a 25% emulsifiable concentrate (Example F1, c) in WO 97/34485, pages 9 and 10), at a rate of application corresponding to 2000 g of active ingredient/ha (500 liters water/ha). The test plants are then grown on in the greenhouse under optimum conditions. After approximately 18 days test duration, the test is evaluated in accordance with a scale of nine ratings (1total damage, 9no action). Ratings of from 1 to 4 (especially from 1 to 3) indicate good to very good herbicidal action.

may be isolated from a sacoglossan. The compound may be used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions or in the treatment of tumors or viral conditions. This invention is concerned with a cytotoxic and antiviral compound isolated from the sacoglossan, Elysia rafescens. According to the invention there is provided, a new compound, the peptide, Kahalalide F, of the formula: The antitumor activities of this compound has been determined in vitro in cell cultures of human lung carcinoma A-549 and human colon carcinoma HT-29. The procedure was carried out using the metnhodology described by Raymond J. Bergeron et al. Biochem. Bioph. Res. Comm . 1984, 121(3), 848-854 and by Alan C. Schroeder et al. J. Med. Chem . 1981, 24 1078-1083. The antiviral activities of this compound have also been determined in vitro against HSV (Herpes simplex virus) and VSV (Vesicular stomatitis virus). The methodology used to carry out this determination is described by Raymond J. Bergeron et al. Biochem. Bioph. Res. Comm . 1984, 121(3), 848-854 and by Alan C. Schroeder et al. J. Med. Chem . 1981, 24 1078-1083. Therefore, the present invention also provides a method of treating any mammal affected by a malignant tumor sensitive to compounds above described, which comprises administering to the affected individual a therapeutically effective amount of these compounds or a pharmaceutical composition thereof; and a method of treating viral infections in mammals, comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment, an antiviral effective amount of the compounds described in the present invention. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical preparations which contain as active ingredient these compounds, or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, as well as the process for its preparation. Examples of pharmaceutical compositions include any solid (tablets, pills, capsules, granules, etc.) or liquid (solutions, suspensions or emulsions) suitable composition for oral, topical or parenteral administration, and they may contain the pure compound or in combination with any carrier or other pharmacologically active compounds. These compositions may need to be sterile when administered parenterally. The correct dosage of a pharmaceutical composition of these compounds will vary according to the particular formulation, the mode of application and particular site, host and tumor being treated. Other factors like age, body weight, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, condition of the host, drug combinations, reaction sensitivities and severity of disease shall be taken in account. Administration can be carried out continuously or periodically within the maximum tolerated dose. Kahalalide F was isolated from the sacoglossan, Elysia rufescens (family Plakobranchidae, order Sacoglossa), collected near Black point, Oahu. This animal varies in size between 1 and 4 cm; it is dark red-brown in color with light-colored spots. There is orange fringing of the parapodia, which have very small dark green spots from sequestered chloroplasts. Elysia rufescens feeds on the delicate, feather-like green alga Bryopsis sp. 1 Kahalalide F can also be isolated from this alga. Two hundred animals were collected over the period of several weeks during spring, 1991 and extracted with EtOH. The extracts were then chromatographed by silica gel flash chromatography (hexane, hexane/EtOAc (1:1), EtOAc, EtOAc (1:1), MeOH and MeOH/HOAc (98:2). The peptides were eluted with EtOAc/MeOH (1:1). Final purification was accomplished by repeated HPLC (RP C18) using MeCN/H 2 O with 0.1% TFA (70-45% H 2 O). ISOLATION SCHEME Elysia rufescens The structures of the peptides were elucidated by 2D NMR experiments (HMQC, HMBC, TOCSY, COSY and ROESY). Kahalalide F was isolated as a white amorphous powder in 0.02% yield. A molecular formula of C 75 H 124 N 14 O 16 was deduced from detailed analyses of the 13 C and 1 H NMR spectra and the high resolution FAB mass spectrum. The 14 substructures in this compound arise from five valines, two isoleucines, two threonines, ornithine, dehydroaminobutyric acid. proline, phenilalanine and 5-methythexanoic acid (5-MeHex). Kahalalide F is the largest peptide in this series of compounds. EXPERIMENTAL General Considerations Optical rotations were measured on a Jasco DIP-370 digital polarimeter. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet MX-5 FTIR spectrometer. Gas chromatography was accomplished using a Hewlett-Packard Model 5890 instrument. Mass spectra were measured on a VG-70SE magnetic sector mass spectrometer. NMR spectra were measured on a General Electric QE-300 or a GN OMEGA 500 instrument. 1 H NMR chemical shifts are reported in ppm with the chemical shift of the residual protons of the solvent used as internal standards. 13 C NMR chemical shifts are reported in ppm by using the natural abundance 13 C of the solvent as an internal standard. Ultraviolet spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard Model 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. All solvents were destilled from glass before use. Two hundred sacoglossans ( Elysia rufescens ), were collected at Black Point, Oahu during April and May 1992, and extracted 3 times with EtOH. Spring appears to be the time of year Elysia rufescens is in greatest abundance at Black Point. The combined extracts were then chromatographed using silica gel flash chromatography (hexane, hexane/EtOAc (1:1), EtOAc, EtOAc/MeOH (1:1), MeOH, MeOH/HOAc (98:2). The depsipeptides were found in the EtOAc/MeOH (1:1) fraction. Repeated HPLC RP18 MeCN/H 2 O/TFA (55/45/1)MeCN/H 2 O/TFA ((30/70/1) yielded six new depsipeptides. KAHALALDDE F Final purification was accomplished by HPLC on RP18 MeCN/H 2 O/TFA (55/45/1).

Experimental Example 5 Safety Study Through Toxicity Test Administering 2-oxoasiatic acid of various concentrations to male ICR mice weighing between 2025 g by peritoneal injection, the toxicity of 2oxoasiatic acid was tested. As a result, motor activity was decreased dose-dependently and pilo-erection, tachypnea and convulsion were induced dose-dependently. And the symptom of opisthotonus was showed at a fatal dose. Judging from the toxic symptoms and the time taken till death, 2-oxoasiatic acid was observed to induce the typical toxicity of central nervous system. The surviving mice showed rapid recovery and the weight of them did not change. In the conclusion, LD 50 of 2-oxoasiatic acid for mouse administered by peritoneal injection was 0.75 g/kg, and that shows considerable safety of the compounds according to the present invention.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This is a division application of Ser. No. 08/913,219, filed Sep. 10, 1997, and now U.S. Pat No. 5,910,485, which is a National Phase Application based on International Application PCT/JP97/00200 filed Jan. 29, 1997 and published on Aug. 7, 1997 under number WO 97/27859. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an antitumor agent whose principal ingredient is a mixture of an organic compound which contains an amino group and a silyl group, and Adriamycin. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The conventional antitumor agents in chemotherapy are mainly classified into a group of antibiotics (for instance Adriamycin) and a group of antimetabolites (for instance 5-fluorouracil). Each group relatively has a feature of a concentration dependence drug and a time dependence drug, and both groups have a problem of being toxic to normal cells. Recently, along with the progress of surgical treatment techniques, expectations for chemotherapy, especially for an antitumor agent whose side effects are minimized, are increasing. Strong physiological activity of organic silicon compounds has been found by Voronkov et al of Russia (silatrane), and have been investigated in detail. However, sometimes some kinds of silatrane are strongly toxic in accordance with species of substitution group, and some of them have more strong toxicity than hydrocyanamic acid or strychnine. Recently, a group comprised of Shin-etsu Chemical Products Co., Ltd, and Keio University have investigated antineoplastic features of various kinds of organic silicon compounds, and have proceeded with development of relatively low toxicity and high activaty antitumor agents (Chemical Society of Japan, 1990, No.5, 566-574). Inventors of this invention have already developed new antitumor agents of ring and chain compounds including silicon and nitrogen (hereafter; shortened to silamine compounds) by investigating thoroughly the antitumor features of silamine compounds (Japanese Patent Application 157518/94 and 157519/94). However, although the toxicity of these silamine compounds are weaker than that of the antitumor agents such as Adriamycin, its antitumor activity is about {fraction (1/10)}, and said lower antitumor activity is pointed out as a problem. The object of this invention is to solve the above mentioned problem of silamine compounds, and to provide a new antitumor agent of lower toxicity and high effectiveness. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The important point of this invention is an antitumor agent which comprises a mixture of a compound having the following chemical formula (A) and Adriamycin, wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 represent hydrogen atom, or alkyl group, allyl group or aralkyl group of carbon number 1 to 10; further, a pair of R 1 and R 2 , and a pair of R 5 and R 6 can be chemically bonded via alkylene, allylene or aralkylene group and an antitumor agent which comprises a mixture of a compound indicated by following chemical formula (B) and Adriamycin, wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 represent hydrogen atom, or alkyl group, allyl group or aralkyl group of carbon number 1 to 10; further, a pair of R 1 and R 3 , and a pair of R 6 and R 7 can be chemically bonded via alkylene, allylene or aralkylene group. That is, in this invention, by combining Adriamycin which is an antitumor agent classified into conventional antibiotics with silamine compounds, those antitumor features act synergistically, and as the result, the toxicity which is a feature of Adriamycin can be relatively weakened. Adriamycin, as noted in The Merck Index, Eleventh Edition (1989), was formerly the generic name for Doxorubicin, and is (8S-cis)-10-(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy)--L-lyxo-hexopyranosyl)oxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,8,11-trihydroxy-8-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-methoxy-5,12-naphthacenedione. As the compound indicated by chemical formula (A) of this invention, following compounds can be mentioned. 4,7,13,16-tetraethyl-1,1,10,10-tetramethyl-4,7,13,16-tetraaza-1,10-disilacyclooctadecane, 1,1,4,7,10,10,13,16-octamethyl-4,7,13,16-tetraaza-1,10-disilacycloctadecane, 1,1,4,7,10,10,13,16-octaethyl-4,7,13,16-tetraaza-1,10-disilacycloctadecane and others. Compound (A) can be obtained by the method disclosed in our previous document, Japanese Patent Application 157518/94. That is, it can be synthesized using alkali metal compound, e.g. buthyllithium, as a catalyst, by a reaction of vinylsilane compound indicated by general formula (X) with N,N substituted ethylenediamine derivatives indicated by general formula (Y). H 2 CCHSiR 1 R 2 CHCH 2 (X) wherein R 1 and R 2 have the same meaning as given synonymus with the above. HN R 1 CH 2 CH 2 NHR 2 (Y) wherein R 1 and R 2 have the same meaning as given above. As the reacting mechanism, it is considered that vinylsilane compound reacts with ethylenediamine derivative as a first step, then a cyclization reaction occurs, and this is considered to be so called two step cyclic addition reaction. Chemical reaction formula is indicated as follows. As the compound indicated by chemical formula (B) of this invention, following compounds can be mentioned; 3,6,12,15-tetraethyl-9,9-dimethyl-3,6,12,15-tetraaza-9-silaheptadecane, 6,12-diethyl-9,9-dimethyl-3,6,12,15-tetraaza-9-silaheptadecane, 4,7,7,10-tetramethyl-1,4,10,13-tetraaza-7-silatridecane, 4,10-diethyl-7,7-dimethyl-1,4,10,13-tetraaza-7-silatridecane, and others. These compounds can be obtained by the above mentioned manufacturing method disclosed in Japanese Patent That is, it can be synthesized by an addition reaction of bis(,-unsaturated)silane derivatives and amine using alkali metal compound as a catalyst. This reaction is desirably carried out in the presence of alkali metal compound, and the preparing method of this alkali metal catalyst is strictly restricted. It can be obtained by a reaction between amine to be used and a specific organic alkali metal. As an organic alkali metal to be used, bulky lithiumamide, sodiumamide and potassiumamide represented by lithiumdiisopropylamide, alkyl and allyl lithium such as buthyllithium or diphenyllithium and aralkyllithium can be mentioned. Further, lithium hydride, sodium hydride and potassium hydride can be used. Molar ratio of alkali metal compound to amine is possible to be from 1/100 to 100/1, and desirable region is from 1/10 to 3/1. This reaction can be carried out in the presence of inert solvent. As a solvent, liquid which does not react with alkali metal amide catalyst under the reaction conditions can be used. Concretely, ethers such as diethylether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane or diglyme, aliphatic hydrocarbon such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane or octane, dimethyl sulfoxide, aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene or toluene, non-proton polar solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide or hexamethylphosphorictriamide can be mentioned. In these solvents, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and aliphatic hydrocarbon such as hexane are preferably used. Volume of solvent to be used in this invention is desirably to be from {fraction (1/10)} to 50 times to the volume of bis(,-unsaturated)silane derivatives and more desirably from to 20 times. In general, when quantity of solvent relatively increases, reaction velocity becomes slow. Reaction temperature is not restricted, however, a desirable temperature region is from 78C. to 150 C. and more desirable region is 0C. to 80 C. And also reacting period is not restricted, however, a desirable reaction period is from 1 minute to 1000 hours, and more desirably from 10 minutes to 100 hours. The ring or chain silamine compound (hereafter shortened to silamine compound) is mixed together with Adriamycin, and the mixture is evaluated as an antitumor agent. The mixing ratio of silamine compound is desirably from 0.01 to 500 parts to 1 part of Adriamycin by weight, and more desirably from 0.1 to 50 parts by weight. At the mixing procedure of a silamine compound and Adriamycin, it is possible to use a solvent. As a solvent to be used, a buffer solution such as phosphoric acid buffer or HEPES buffer can be used as well as water. Further, for the improvement of dissolving feature of silamine compounds, it is possible to add ethanol to the solution. Solvent can be added by voluntary quantity, however, preferable quantity is from 0.1 to 500 parts to 1 part of silamine by weight. An aqueous solution of mixture of silamine/Adriamycin is sterilized, then administered to tumor. As a sterilization method, any known method can be used, however, a sterilization by an autoclave or a filtration by 0.22 m syringe filter is recommendable because of its easy handling. A dosage of medicine is respectively altered according to the size of tumor. Desirable dosage of Adriamycin is from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg and for silamine compound is from 0.1 to 1000 mg/kg, further, the most desirable dosage for Adriamycin is from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg and for silamine compound is from 1 to 200 mg/kg. The mixture can be administered by a hypodermic injection, an abdominal injection, an intravenous injection or an artery injection, or by an oral dosage form.

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to an agent for preventing and curing fatty liver and to a method for curing thereof. BACKGROUND ART Fatty liver is a diseased state of the liver wherein lipids, mainly neutral fats (triglycerides, TG) are accumulated excessively in the liver, thus fatty vacuoles are observed in about more than a half number of the liver cells. As to the cause of fatty liver, there are reported various pathogenics such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, alcoholic intake, oxygen deficit, endocrinic disorder, exogenic toxins or medicines, endogenic toxins and the like. Particularly, along the recent trend on increasing of obesity, a number of patients with supervenient fatty liver are also increasing. Said fatty liver is necessarily treated at the early stage, because after all this disease may be migrated to severe hepatopathies, such as hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis and the like, finally such instances are not seldom to court death. However, at the present, an agent effective for curing fatty liver has not been known yet, and dietetic therapy is only known as a general therapy. Thus development of a medicine capable to prevent and cure fatty liver satisfactorily and effectively is earnestly desired. Heretofore, the present inventors have conducted an extensive research work regarding effective ingredient compounds used for pharmaceuticals. Then in the course of research work, previously the inventors have found the fact that a series of carboxylic acid amide derivatives are effective as antiinflammatory agent and calcium antagonistic agent, then invention relating to said derivatives was completed and patent applications were filed (JP-A-61-151199 and EP-A-273444). Further, the present inventors have additionally found the fact that other carboxylic acid amide derivatives relating to the above-mentioned carboxylic acid amide derivatives have excellent activity for lowering lipids, and are excellent in low toxicity regarding side-effects etc., thus the latter carboxylic acid amide derivatives are useful agents for curing hyperlipidemia, and also for preventing and curing various diseases (hyperlipidemia), such as hypercholesteremia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperphospholipidemia, hyper-free fatty acidemia and the like. Then an invention on the basis of such finding was filed as a patent application (Japanese Patent No. 2584336). Additionally, the present inventors have found the facts that, other than the useful activity for curing hyperlipidemia, the above-mentioned carboxylic acid amide derivatives also have activity for inhibiting excretion of proteinurea, thus these derivatives are effective as agents for curing nephritis, then an invention on the basis of such finding was filed as a patent application (Japanese Patent Application Hei 9-93002). DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to develop novel pharmaceutical applications of the above-mentioned carboxylic acid amide derivatives by using their excellent properties such as low toxicities. Particularly the present invention is aimed to provide an agent for preventing and curing fatty liver and method for curing thereof. The present inventors have conducted an extensive research work followed by the above-mentioned object. As the result, regardless of the excellent pharmaceutical applications for curing hyperlipidemia and nephritis performed by the above-mentioned compound, unexpectedly the inventors have found novel knowledges from the above-mentioned pharmacological activities, that the above-mentioned carboxylic acid amide derivatives have activities for lowering neutral fats (triglycerides, TG) and total cholesterols in the liver, also effective for preventing and curing fatty liver. Thus, the present invention was completed on the basis of said novel knowledges. MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM The present invention relates to an agent for preventing and curing fatty liver containing, as the effective ingredient, a carboxylic acid amide derivative represented by the general formula (1), (wherein R is a lower alkyl group; and X is a halogen atom), and to a method for curing thereof by administering said agent. As explained previously, the carboxylic acid amide compound represented by the above-mentioned general formula (1), which is contained as the effective ingredient in the agent for preventing and curing fatty liver and method for curing fatty liver according to the present invention, possesses activity for lowering neutral fats (triglycerides, TG) and cholesterols in the blood. Therefore, said compound is known as effective for curing hyperlipidemia by the present inventors (JP-A-3-68592). However, such activity is understood rather contrary to the activity for inhibiting accumulation of neutral fats in the liver or lowering cholesterols in the liver for preventing and curing fatty liver. In fact, among compounds having activity for lowering neutral fats and cholesterols in the blood and used as agents for curing hyperlipidemia, for example clofibrate, it is known to cause accumulation of neutral fats in the liver as a side-effect and induces hepatomegaly (cf., e.g., JP-A-8-119860). On the basis of such findings, the present invention was completed surprisingly and contrary to the previous knowledge, although the compound represented by the above-mentioned general formula (1) possesses activity for lowering neutral fats and cholesterols in the blood, said compound also possesses activity for inhibiting both accumulation of fats in the liver and activity for lowering cholesterols in the liver, thus the compound performs desired effects for preventing and curing fatty liver.

Among the anti-inflammatory and immuno-suppressive molecules currently available, the glucocorticoids constitute one of the most powerful therapeutic classes. Their use is nevertheless limited due to their numerous side effects, amongst which there can be mentioned: retarding effect on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) intolerance to glucose, which can precipitate the appearance of diabetes muscular fusion retardation of healing atrophy of the skin osteoporosis increased susceptibility to infections neurological disorders hypercholesterolemia. The effects of the glucocorticoids are mediated by nuclear receptors belonging to the family of steroid receptors. These receptors are a ligand-inductible transcription factor which can positively or negatively modulate the transcription of the target genes. (Evans, R. M., 1988 Science, 240, 889-895), (Green, S., Kumar, V., Theulaz, I., Wahli, W., and Chambon, P. 1988 EMBO J., 7, 3037-3044), (Beato, M. 1989. Cell, 56, 335-344), (Jonat, C., Rahmansdorf, H. J., Park, K. K., Cato, A. C., Gebel, S., Ponta, H., Herrlich, P., 1990 Cell, 62, 1189-1204), (Pfahl, M. 1993 Endocrine Reviews, 14, 651-658). The use of the mutants of the glucocorticoid receptors has allowed it to be established that distinct regions of these receptors are involved in the functions of transactivation or transrepression, and therefore, that these two functions are theoretically separable (Heck, S., Kullmann, M., Gast, A., Ponta, H., Rahmansdorf, H. J., Herrlich, P., and Cato, A. C. B. 1994 EMBO J., 13, 4087-4095). The obtaining of ligands of the glucocorticoid receptor acting in vivo as anti-inflammatories, and deprived of transactivation function, would allow better tolerated olecules to be developed. The compounds of general formula (I) have useful pharmacological properties: 1) Glucocorticoid activity The Applicant has, in fact, revealed a new class of glucocorticoids. Different animal models (rats, mice) have allowed the very powerful anti-inflammatory properties of the products of the invention to be revealed. In particular they possess a remarkable glucocorticoid activity by local route. (cf test for ear oedema induced by croton oil in a mouse, in vivo activity equivalent to or greater than prednisolone or dexamethasone). 2) Dissociated activity Furthermore, the products of the invention act via the following action mechanism: in fact these molecules allow the transactivation and transreuression functions of the receptor to be separated. They have a so-called dissociated activity on the transcription of the target genes. The molecules according to the invention have been tested in models of HELA cells transfected with the GRE-tk-CAT plasmid (transactivation), or with the pColl-CAT plasmid (transrepression). (Cf. TEST 1) These molecules like DEXAMETHASONE are capable of inhibiting the transcription of the collagenase promoter; on the other hand, in contrast to DEXAMETHASONE, they do not or hardly activate the transcription of the GRE-tk promoter. As the described products have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities of the same order as PREDNISOLONE, the therapeutic uses are still the uses traditionally described for medicaments made from PREDNISOLONE. They can for example be used for the treatment of allergic, dermatological, digestive, endocrinic, hematological, infectious, neoplastic, nephrological, neurological, ophthalmological, respiratory or rhumatological affections or illnesses. They are particularly useful for organ transplants to prevent rejection of the transplants but also for the treatment of local inflammatory reactions such as for example, oedemas, dermacoses, pruritus, the various forms of eczema, sun erythemas, tendinitis or sprains. They are also quite particularly useful for the treatment of ophthalmic inflammatory disorders. Their dissociated activity makes the compounds of the invention particularly useful in the treatment of the illnesses mentioned above while reducing certain side effects. Therefore a subject of the invention is the products of formula (I) as well as their addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids or bases, as medicaments. A more particular subject of the invention is the products of formula (I), as well as their addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids or bases, as medicaments having a glucocorticoid activity. A quite particular subject of the invention is the products of formula (I), as well as their addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids or bases, as medicaments having a dissociated glucocorticoid activity, this dissociation allowing the side effects to be reduced or to disappear. Among the medicaments of the invention there can be mentioned more particularly: 9-fluoro-11-hydroxy-16-methyl-pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dioxo-21-carbonitrile, 9-fluoro-11-hydroxy-16-methyl-3,20-dioxo-pregn-4-ene-21-carbonitrile, 9-fluoro-11-hydroxy-16-methyl-21-thiomethyl-pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione, methyl 3,20-dioxo-11-hydroxy-16-methyl-21-nor cholane 1,4-diene-24-oate, 21-fluoro-11-hydroxy-16-methyl-pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione.

The useful posology varies according to the affection to be treated and the administration route. It can vary for example from 1 to 1000 mg per day for an adult by oral route. The invention extends to the pharmaceutical compositions containing as active ingredient, at least one of the medicaments as defined above. The compounds of formula (I) are used by digestive, parenteral or local route, for example by percutaneous route. They can be prescribed in the form of plain or sugar-coated tablets, capsules, granules, suppositories, ovules, injectable preparations, ointments, creams, gels, microbeads, implants, patches, which are prepared according to the usual methods. The active ingredient(s) can be incorporated with excipients usually employed in these pharmaceutical compositions, such as talc, gum arabic, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, cocoa butter, aqueous or non-aqueous vehicles, fatty substances of animal or vegetable origin, paraffin derivatives, glycols, the various wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents, preservatives. The useful dose varies, in particular, according to the patient to be treated and the affection in question. It can be comprised, for example, between 1 and 4 applications per day of an ointment containing 0.1 to 5 of product of Example 1. A quite particular subject of the invention is the pharmaceutical compositions which can be administered by local route, containing as medicaments the following compounds as described above.

Product of Example 1 . . . 50 mg Excipient (talc, starch, magnesium stearate) Pharmacological Study of the Products of the Invention I) Study of the regulation of transcription in transfected Hela cells. Hela cells (ATCC ref: CCL-2) are distributed in a 6-well plate, in a nutritive medium with a density of 410 5 cells/ml, 24 hours before the transfection, and are incubated at 37 C. The transitory transfections are produced according to the precipitate method with calcium phosphate. In the case of the study of transactivation, the cells are transfected with 1 g of GRE-tk-CAT clasmid, 1 g of polyII - GAL plasmid and KS Dlasmid (Stratagene), s.q.f. 5 g. In the case of the study of transrepression, the cells are transfected with 3 g of Coll(517/63)CAT plasmid, 250 ng of pSV-cjun plasmid, 1 g of polyII -GAL plasmid and KS plasmid (Stratagene), s.q.f. 5 g. The precipitate is left in contact with the cells for 16 hours. These are then rinsed and covered with the nutritive medium containing different concentrations of Dexamethasone or the products to be studied (10 9 M, 10 8 M, 10 7 M, 10 6 M). 24 hours after the addition of the products, the cells are lysed in 250 l of MOPS-NaCl-Triton X-100 buffer. The CAT is dosed in the cellular extracts using the ELISA Kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The standard glucocorticoids such as Dexamethasone cause an activation of the transcription of the GRE-tk promoter, and an inhibition of the transcription of the collagenase promoter.

The technique used is a modification of the method of Meier and Coll. (Experentia, 1950, 6, 469). Female Wistar rats, weighing 90 to 100 g, receive an implantation of two cotton pellets of 10 mg each under the skin of the thorax. The products are immediately administered by oral route, a the rate of once a day for four days. The animals are then sacrificed. The pellets surrounded by the granuloma tissue formed, are weighed in the fresh state, then after eighteen hours at 60 C. The weight of the granuloma is obtained by deduction of the initial weight of the cotton. The thymuses are also removed and weighed in order to determine the thymolytic activity of the products. Granuloma Thymolysis Product cf Example ED 50 (mg/kg/po) ED 50 (mg/kg/po) Dexamethasone 0.1 0.05 Prednisolone 2.5 1.6 EXAMPLE 1 5 2.5 EXAMPLE 2 7 2.5 Conclusion: The products of Examples 1 and 2 have an anti-inflammatory activity close to that of prednisolone. Ear oedema test induced by croton oil The products have also been tested in the model of the ear cedema of mice using croton oil according to the method described in Tonelli et al. (Endocrinology, 1965, 77, 625-634). An ear cedema is induced in male mice weighing 18 to 22 g, by using croton oil (2% v/v) in a pyridine-water-ether solution 4:1:14.6 (by volume). The animals are sacrificed 6 hours later, the ears are removed and weighed. The difference in weight between the ear treated with croton oil and the contralateral ear (non-treated) allows 100% of the cedema to be determined. The products to be tested are dissolved in the solution of croton oil and applied to the ear. Oedema using craton oil (mouse) Product ct Example ED 50 (g/ear) Dexamethasone 1 Prednisolone 4 EXAMPLE 1 10 EXAMPLE 2 2 Conclusion: In this test the product of Example 2 has an anti-inflammatory activity comprised between that of prednisolone and dexamethasone. 3) Immunosuppressive activity. The immunosuppressive activity was studied according to the retarded hypersensitivity test described in the article by Hambleton et al. (Agents and Actions, 990, 29, 328). Male Wistar rats weighing 150 to 160 g are sensitized on day 0 with a suspension of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis 4 mg/ml in parrafin oil by a sub-cutaneous injection at the base of the tail (0.1 ml/animal). The products are administered by oral route from day 4 to 7. On day 7, one hour after the last administration, the animals receive an injection of the soluble fraction of the antigen triggering the hypersensitivity reaction: 0.4 mg/rat in 0.2 ml by intraplantar route in a rear paw, the other receives the same quantity of solvent. The oedema is measured 24 hours afterwards using an UGO BASIL plethysmometer from APELEX. The activity of the products is evaluated by the percentage reduction in the increase of the injected paw relative to that of the control animals. Retarded hypersensitivity (M.

1 is a linker atom or group; Ar 2 is an optionally substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic group; R 5 is a carboxylic acid (CO 2 H) or a derivative thereof; The compounds are able to inhibit the binding of alpha 4 integrins to their ligands and are of use in the prophylaxis and treatment of immune in inflammatory disorders. This invention relates to a series of benzodiazepines, to compositions containing them, to processes for their preparation, and to their use in medicine. Over the last few years it has become increasingly clear that the physical interaction of inflammatory leukocytes with each other and other cells of the body plays an important role in regulating immune and inflammatory responses Springer, T. A. Nature, 346, 425, (1990); Springer, T. A. Cell 76, 301, (1994). Many of these interactions are mediated by specific cell surface molecules collectively referred to as cell adhesion molecules. The adhesion molecules have been sub-divided into different groups on the basis of their structure. One family of adhesion molecules which is believed to play a particularly important role in regulating immune and inflammatory responses is the integrin family. This family of cell surface glycoproteins has a typical non-covalently linked heterodimer structure. At least 14 different integrin alpha chains and 8 different integrin beta chains have been identified Sonnenberg, A. Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology, 184, 7, (1993). The members of the family are typically named according to their heterodimer composition although trivial nomenclature is widespread in this field. Thus the integrin termed 41 consists of the integrin alpha 4 chain associated with the integrin beta 1 chain, but is also widely referred to as Very Late Antigen 4 or VLA4. Not all of the potential pairings of integrin alpha and beta chains have yet been observed in nature and the integrin family has been subdivided into a number of subgroups based on the pairings that have been recognised Sonnenberg, A. ibid. The importance of cell adhesion molecules in human leukocyte function has been further highlighted by a genetic deficiency disease called Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency (LAD) in which one of the families of leukocyte integrins is not expressed Marlin, S. D. et al J. Exp. Med. 164, 855 (1986). Patients with this disease have a reduced ability to recruit leukocytes to inflammatory sites and suffer recurrent infections which in extreme cases may be fatal. The potential to modify adhesion molecule function in such a way as to beneficially modulate immune and inflammatory responses has been extensively investigated in animal models using specific monoclonal antibodies that block various functions of these molecules e.g. Issekutz, T. B. J. Immunol. 3394, (1992); Li, Z. et al Am. J. Physiol. 263, L723, (1992); Binns, R. M. et al J. Immunol. 157, 4094, (1996). A number of monoclonal antibodies which block adhesion molecule function are currently being investigated for their therapeutic potential in human disease. One particular integrin subgroup of interest involves the 4 chain which can pair with two different beta chains 1 and 7 Sonnenberg, A. ibid. The 41 pairing occurs on many circulating leukocytes (for example lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils) although it is absent or only present at low levels on circulating neutrophils. 41 binds to an adhesion molecule (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 also known as VCAM-1) frequently up-regulated on endothelial cells at sites of inflammation Osborne, L. Cell, 62, 3, (1990). The molecule has also been shown to bind to at least three sites in the matrix molecule fibronectin Humphries, M. J. et al. Ciba Foundation Symposium, 189, 177, (1995). Based on data obtained with monoclonal antibodies in animal models it is believed that the interaction between 41 and ligands on other cells and the extracellular matrix plays an important role in leukocyte migration and activation Yednock, T. A. et al, Nature, 356, 63, (1992); Podolsky, D. K. et al. J. Clin. Invest. 92, 373, (1993); Abraham, W. M. et al. J. Clin. Invest. 93, 776, (1994). The integrin generated by the pairing of 4 and 7 has been termed LPAM-1 Holzmann, B and Weissman, I. EMBO J. 8, 1735, (1989) and like 41, binds to VCAM-1 and fibronectin. In addition, 47 binds to an adhesion molecule believed to be involved in the homing of leukocytes to mucosal tissue termed MAdCAM-1 Berlin, C. et al, Cell, 74, 185, (1993). The interaction between 47 and MAdCAM-1 may also be important at sites of inflammation outside of mucosal tissue Yang, X-D. et al, PNAS, 91, 12604 (1994). Regions of the peptide sequence recognised by 41 and 47 when they bind to their ligands have been identified. 41 seems to recognise LDV, IDA or REDV peptide sequences in fibronectin and a QIDSP sequence in VCAM-1 Humphries, M. J. et al, ibid whilst 47 recognises a LDT sequence in MAdCAM-1 Briskin, M. J. et al, J. Immunol. 156, 719, (1996). There have been several reports of inhibitors of these interactions being designed from modifications of these short peptide sequences Cardarelli, P. M. et al J. Biol. Chem. 269, 18668, (1994); Shroff, H. N. Bioorganic. Med. Chem. Lett. 6, 2495, (1996); Vanderslice, P. J. Immunol. 158, 1710, (1997). It has also been reported that a short peptide sequence derived from the 41 binding site in fibronectin can inhibit a contact hypersensitivity reaction in a trinitrochlorobenzene sensitised mouse Ferguson, T. A. et al, PNAS 88, 8072, (1991). Since the alpha 4 subgroup of integrins are predominantly expressed on leukocytes their inhibition can be expected to be beneficial in a number of immune or inflammatory disease states. However, because of the ubiquitous distribution and wide range of functions performed by other members of the integrin family it is very important to be able to identify selective inhibitors of the alpha 4 subgroup. We have now found a group of compounds which are potent and selective inhibitors of 4 integrins. Members of the group are able to inhibit 4 integrins such as 41 and/or 47 at concentrations at which they generally have no or minimal inhibitory action on integrins of other subgroups. The compounds are thus of use in medicine, for example in the prophylaxis and treatment of immune or inflammatory disorders as described hereinafter.

In general, however, daily dosages may range from around 100 ng/kg to 100 mg/kg e.g. around 0.01 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg body weight for oral or buccal administration, from around 10 ng/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight for parenteral administration and around 0.05 mg to around 1000 mg e.g. around 0.5 mg to around 1000 mg for nasal administration or administration by inhalation or insufflation. The compounds of the invention may be prepared by a number of processes as generally described below and more specifically in the Examples hereinafter. In the following process description, the symbols R 1 -R 5 , L 1 , Alk 1 , Alk 2 , r, s, Ar 1 and Ar 2 when used in the formulae depicted are to be understood to represent those groups described above in relation to formula (1) unless otherwise indicated. In the reactions described below, it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice see, for example, Green, T. W. in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 1991. In some instances, deprotection may be the final step in the synthesis of a compound of formula (1) and the processes according to the invention described hereinafter are to be understood to extend to such removal of protecting groups. For convenience the processes described below all refer to a preparation of a compound of formula (1) but clearly the description applies equally to the preparation of compounds of formula (2). Thus according to a further aspect of the invention, a compound of formula (1) in which R 5 is a CO 2 H group may be obtained by hydrolysis of an ester of formula (3): where R a is an alkyl group, for example a C 1-6 alkyl group as described above. The hydrolysis may be performed using either an acid or a base depending on the nature of R a , for example an organic acid such as trifluoracetic acid or an inorganic base such as lithium, potassium or sodium hydroxide optionally in an aqueous organic solvent such as an amide, e.g. a substituted amide such as dimethylformamide, an ether, e.g. a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane or an alcohol, e.g. methanol at around ambient temperature. Where desired, mixtures of such solvents may be used. Esters of formula (3) and, in general, esters of formula (1) in which R is a CO 2 Alk 5 group may be prepared by cyclisation of an azide of formula (4): using a reducing agent such as a phosphine, e.g. triphenylphosphine or trimethylphosphine in an inert solvent, e.g. an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene, at an elevated temperature, e.g. the reflux temperature. Azides of formula (4) are particularly useful intermediates and form a further feature of the invention. Azides of formula (4) may be prepared by reaction of an aldehyde of formula (5): with a phosphonate (Alk 6 O) 2 P(O)CH(NHCO(Alk 2 ) s Ar 2 )CO 2 Alk 5 , where Alk 6 is a C 1-6 alkyl group optionally substituted by one or more fluorine atoms, in the presence of a base. Suitable bases include organometallic bases, for example an organolithium compound such as n-butyllithium or lithium diisopropylamide, hydrides such as sodium or potassium hydride, alkoxides, such as sodium alkoxides, e.g. sodium methoxide, and cyclic amines, for example 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene. The reaction may be performed in a suitable solvent, for example a polar aprotic solvent such as an amide, e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide; or a nonpolar solvent such as an ether, e.g. a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran or a halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane. Preferably the reaction is carried out at a low temperature for example from around 78 C. to around ambient temperature. Intermediate phosphonates of formula (Alk 6 O) 2 P(O)CH(NHCO(Alk 2 ) s Ar 2 )CO 2 Alk 5 are either known compounds or may be obtained by reaction of a halide HalCH(NHCO(Alk 2 ) s Ar 2 )CO 2 Alk 5 where Hal is a halogen atom such as a chlorine or bromine atom with a phosphite P(OAlk 6 ) 3 . The halides HalCH(NHCO(Alk 2 ) s Ar 2 )CO 2 Alk 5 are either known compounds or may be prepared by manipulation of known compounds by the standard substitution, oxidation, reduction and/or cleavage reactions described hereinafter. In general the reaction with the phosphite P(OAlk 6 ) 3 may be carried out at any stage in the synthesis of the desired phosphonate (Alk 6 O) 2 P(O)CH(NHCO(Alk 2 ) s Ar 2 )CO 2 Alk 5 . Intermediate aldehydes of formula (5) may be obtained by oxidation of the corresponding alcohols of formula (6): using an oxidising agent such as manganese (IV) oxide in a solvent such as dichloromethane. The alcohols of formula (6) may be prepared by treatment of the corresponding amines of formula (7): with a nitrite, e.g. sodium nitrite, in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric acid at a low temperature e.g. around 5 C.; followed by reaction with an azide, e.g. sodium azide. Where necessary, the intermediates of formulae (5), (6) and (7) may be obtained from simpler aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds by one or more standard synthetic methods employing substitution, oxidation, reduction or cleavage reactions. Particular substitution approaches include conventional alkylation, arylation, heteroarylation, acylation, thioacylation, halogenation, sulphonylation, nitration, formylation and coupling procedures. It will be appreciated that these methods may also be used to modify the compounds of formula (1) and the esters (3) where appropriate functional groups exist in these compounds and to generate suitable phosphonates (Alk 6 0) 2 P(O)CH(NHCO(Alk 2 ) s Ar 2 )CO 2 Alk 5 for example to obtain desired groups CH(NHCO(Alk 2 ) s Ar 2 )CO 2 Alk 5 therein. Thus compounds of the invention and intermediates thereto may be prepared by alkylation, arylation or heteroarylation. For example, compounds containing a L 1 H, L 2 H, or L 3 H group (where L 1 , L 2 and L 3 (is each a linker atom or group) may be treated with an alkylating agent: R 6 L 3 Alk 3 X 2 or R 6a X 2 respectively in which X 2 is a leaving atom or group such as a halogen atom, e.g. a fluorine, bromine, iodine or chlorine atom or a sulphonyloxy group such as an alkylsulphonyloxy, e.g. trifluoromethylsulphonyloxy or arylsulphonyloxy, e.g. p-toluenesulphonyloxy group and R 6a is an alkyl group. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a base such as a carbonate, e.g. caesium or potassium carbonate, an alkoxide, e.g. potassium t-butoxide, or a hydride, e.g. sodium hydride, in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as an amide, e.g. a substituted amide such as dimethylformamide or an ether, e.g. a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran. In another example, compounds containing a L 1 H, L 2 H orL 3 H group as defined above may be functionalised by acylation or thioacylation, for example by reaction with one of the alkylating agents just described but in which X 2 is replaced by a C(O)X 3 , C(S)X 3 , N(R 7 )COX 3 or N(R 7 )C(S)X 3 group in which X 3 is a leaving atom or group as described for X 2 . The reaction may be performed in the presence of a base, such as a hydride, e.g. sodium hydride or an amine, e.g. triethylamine or N-methylmorpholine, in a solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane or carbon tetrachloride or an amide, e.g. dimethylformamide, at for example ambient temperature. Alternatively, the acylation or thioacylation may be carried out under the same conditions with an acid or thioacid (for example one of the alkylating agents described above in which X 2 is replaced by a CO 2 H or COSH group) in the presence of a condensing agent, for example a diimide such as 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide or N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, advantageously in the presence of a catalyst such as a N-hydroxy compound e.g. a N-hydroxytriazole such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Alternatively the acid may be reacted with a chloroformate, for example ethylchloroformate, prior to the desired acylation reaction In a further example compounds may be obtained by sulphonylation of a compound containing an OH group by reaction with one of the above alkylating agents but in which X 2 is replaced by a S(O)Hal or SO 2 Hal group in which Hal is a halogen atom such as chlorine atom in the presence of a base, for example an inorganic base such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as an amide, e.g. a substituted amide such as dimethylformamide at for example ambient temperature. In another example, compounds containing a L 1 H, L 2 H or L 3 H group as defined above may be coupled with one of the alkylation agents just described but in which X is preplaced by an OH group in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a phosphine, e.g. triphenylphosphine and an activator such as diethyl, diisopropyl- or dimethylazodicarboxylate. In a further example, ester groups CO 2 R 7 or CO 2 Alk 5 in the compounds may be converted to the corresponding acid CO 2 H by acid- or base-catalysed hydrolysis depending on the nature of the groups R 7 or Alk 5 . Acid- or base-catalysed hydrolysis may be achieved for example by treatment with an organic or inorganic acid, e.g. trifluoroacetic acid in an aqueous solvent or a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid in a solvent such as dioxan or an alkali metal hydroxide, e.g. lithium hydroxide in an aqueous alcohol, e.g. aqueous methanol. In a second example, OR 7 or OR 13 groups where R 7 or R 13 each represents an alkyl grou p such as methyl group in compounds of formula (1) may be cleaved to the corresp o n ding alcohol OH by reaction with boron tribromide in a solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane at a low temperature, e.g. around 78 C. Alcohol OH groups may also be obtained by hydrogenation of a corresponding OCH 2 R 13 group (where R 13 is an aryl group) using a metal catalyst, for example palladium on a support such as carbon in a solvent such as ethanol in the presence of ammonium formate, cyclohexadiene or hydrogen, from around ambient to the reflux temperature. In another example, OH groups may be gene rated from the corresponding ester CO 2 Alk 5 or CO 2 R 7 or aldehyde CHO by reduction, using for example a complex metal hydride such as lithium aluminium hydride o r sodium borohydride in a solvent such as methanol. In another example, alcohol OH groups in the compounds may be converted to a corresponding OR 7 group by coupl ing with a reagent R 7 OH in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a phosphine, e.g. triphenylphosphine and an activator such as diethyl-, diisopropyl-, or dimethylazodicarboxylate. Aminosulphonylamino NHSO 2 NH 2 groups in the compounds may be obtained, in another example, by reaction of a corresponding amine NH 2 with sulphamide in the presence of an organic base such as pyridine at an elevated temperature, e.g. the reflux temperature. In a further example amine (NH 2 ) groups may be alkylated using a reductive alkylation process employing an aldehyde and a borohydride, for example sodium triacetoxyborohyride or sodium cyanoborohydride, in a solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane, a ketone such as acetone, or an alcohol, e.g. ethanol, where necessary in the presence of an acid such as acetic aci d at arou nd ambient temperature. In a further example, amine NH 2 groups in compounds of formula (1) may be obtained by hydrolysis from a corresponding imide by reaction with hydrazine in a solvent such as an alcohol, e.g. ethanol at ambient temperature. In another example, a nitro NO 2 group may be reduced to an amine NH 2 , for example by catalytic hydrogenation using for example hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst, for example palladium on a support such as carbon in a solvent such as an ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or an alcohol e.g. methanol, or by chemical reduction using for example a metal, such as tin e.g. tin II chloride or iron, in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric acid. Aromatic halogen substituents in the compounds may be subjected to halogen-metal exchange with a base, for example a lithium base such as n-butyl or t-butyl lithium, optionally at a low temperature, e.g. around 78 C., in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and then quenched with an electrophile to introduce a desired substituent. Thus, for example, a formyl group may be introduced by using dimethylformamide as the electrophile; a thiomethyl group may be introduced by using dimethyidisulphide as the electrophile. In another example, sulphur atoms in the compounds, for example when present in a linker group L 1 , L 2 or L 3 may be oxidised to the corresponding sulphoxide or sulphone using an oxidising agent such as a peroxy acid, e.g. 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, in an inert solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane, at around ambient temperature. N-oxides of compounds of formula (1) may be prepared for example by oxidation of the corresponding nitrogen base using an oxidising agent such as hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid, at an elevated temperature, for example around 70 C. to 80 C., or alternatively by reaction with a peracid such as peracetic acid in a solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, at ambient temperature. Salts of compounds of formula (1) may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula (1) with an appropriate base in a suitable solvent or mixture of solvents e.g. an organic solvent such as an ether e.g. diethylether, or an alcohol, e.g. ethanol using conventional procedures.

Aggregation was monitored following addition of 2.5 M ADP (Sigma) in the presence or absence of inhibitors. In the above assays the preferred compounds of the invention generally have IC 50 values in the 4 1 and 4 7 assays of 1 M and below.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/307,135 filed May 7, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,184,216, which is a divisional of application Ser. No. 08/857,760 filed May 15, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,955,617, which application claims the benefit of provisional application Ser. No. 60/017,697, filed May 21, 1996, under 35 USC 119(e)(i). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides novel compounds and a novel method for treating: non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM); impaired glucose tolerance; and obesity. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, or NIDDM, and Type II diabetes are synonymous. NIDDM patients have an abnormally high blood glucose concentration when fasting and delayed cellular uptake of glucose following meals or after a diagnostic test known as the glucose tolerance test. NIDDM is diagnosed based on recognized criteria (American Diabetes Association, Physicians Guide to Insulin-Dependent (Type I) Diabetes, 1988; American Diabetes Association, Physicians Guide to Non-Insulin-Dependent (Type II) Diabetes, 1988). Impaired glucose tolerance occurs when the rate of metabolic clearance of glucose from the blood is less than that commonly occurring in the general population after a standard dose of glucose has been orally or parenterally administered (American Diabetes Association, Physicians Guide to Non-Insulin-Dependent (Type II) Diabetes, 1988). Impaired glucose tolerance can occur in NIDDM, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, middle age onset diabetes mellitus of the young, gestational diabetes and obesity. Impaired glucose tolerance can also occur in individuals not meeting the diagnostic criteria for these disease states. Impaired glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals is a predisposing factor for the development of NIDDM. Obesity is a condition in which there is an increase in body fat content resulting in excess body weight above the accepted norms for age, gender, height, and body build (Bray, Obesity, An Endocrine Perspective, p. 2303, Multihormonal Systems and Disorders (1989)). Accepted norms have been determined by life insurance mortality experience and by incidence of morbidity in relation to body composition. The excess mortality that occurs in obese individuals results from diseases that are predisposed by this condition. They include cancer, cardiovascular disease, digestive disease, respiratory disease and diabetes mellitus. In patients with chronic hyperglycemia such as occurs in non-insulin dependent diabetes, glucose-dependent protein crosslinking occurs at a rate in excess of the norm (Bunn, American Journal of Medicine, Vol. 70, p. 325, 1981) resulting in altered tertiary protein structure (Brownlee, Chapter 18, Diabetes Mellitus, p. 279, 1990). Excessive non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins contributes to diabetic complications and complications of aging in non-diabetic humans, such as neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, hypertension, and atherosclerosis (Brownlee, 1990, supra). Hyperglycemia is defined as blood glucose concentration in excess of the accepted norm for the general population (American Diabetes Association, Physicians Guide to Non-Insulin-Dependent (Type II) Diabetes, 1988). Reducing the abnormally high blood glucose level of diabetic subjects benefits the patient by reducing the discomfort of glycosuria and the excessively high mortality and morbidity associated with diabetes mellitus (Kahn, Diabetes Mellitus Theory and Practice, 4th ed., Chapter 26, p. 450, 1990). Weight loss by patients with diabetes mellitus who are obese results in a long-term reduction of the excessively high blood glucose level (Wing, Archives of Internal Medicine, Vol. 147, p. 1749, 1987; Kahn, Diabetes Mellitus Theory and Practice, 4th ed., Chapter 26, p. 450, 1990). As a result of this beneficial effect of weight loss on diabetes mellitus, weight reduction is the treatment of choice for obese patients with diabetes (Karam, Chapter 33, Diabetes Mellitus and Obesity, p. 298, 1982). While the relationship between diabetes mellitus and obesity is known, it would be an advantage to have a drug which can treat or prevent both of them.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention particularly provides: (1) A compound of the formulae I-VIII: or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, wherein G is (CH 2 ) n ; wherein G is (CH 2 ) m ; wherein G is (CH 2 ) p ; wherein R is H or NH 2 ; wherein n is an integer from 1-5; wherein m is an integer from 0-4; wherein p is an integer from 0-3; with the proviso that in formulae II, at least one R group must be NH 2 , and when G is (CH 2 ) 1 , formula II excludes the structure represented by formula XI with the proviso that in formula I, when G is (CH 2 ) 1 at least one R group must be NH 2 ; with the proviso that in formula VIII, when G is (CH 2 ) 2 at least one R group must be NH 2 . (2) a method for treating or preventing non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or obesity in a patient susceptible to or experiencing said NIDDM or obesity comprising the systemic administration of an amount effective to treat or prevent NIDDM or obesity of a compound of the formulae IX-XI. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include: acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, oxalate, palmoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate, and undecanoate. The dose of compounds of formula I-VIII to be used is between 0.1 and 100 mg/kg body weight daily. The preferred dose is 1-50 mg/kg/day. Administration may be by oral, parenteral, intranasal, buccal, sublingual, intrarectal, or transdermal routes. The oral route is preferred. Novel compounds of the invention are given by the generic formulae I-VIII. Known compounds claimed for use in the treatment of NIDDM are represented by formula IX-XI. Of the compounds of this invention, represented by generic formulae I-VIII, the compounds listed in Table 1 are especially preferred and their preferred utility is in the treatment of NIDDM and its complications. Procedures for their preparation are given in Section 4. Table 2 contains a list of compound specifically claimed by this invention. Thus, the present invention provides novel and known compounds having surprising and unexpected antidiabetic properties. Administration of the compounds of this invention to KKAy mice at a dose of approximately 100-500 mg/kg/day results in the partial or complete amelioration of hyperglycemia in this rodent model of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Specific compounds are listed in Tables 1 and 2; see Chang, Wyse, Copeland, Peterson, and Ledbetter, Diabetes 1985, p. 466, 1986). KKAy mice are insulin resistant (Chang, et al, supra) and the finding that the non-fasting blood glucose level is reduced in these animals indicates that insulin resistance is most probably less after treatment with the claimed compounds. KKAy mice are obese compared to normal, outbred mice (Chang, et al, supra) and administration of compounds of the invention results in weight loss. Administration of 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride, the most preferred compound in this series, to diabetic KKAy mice for 3 days decreased the non-fasting blood glucose level of the animals (see Table 3). A dose of 125 mg/kg/day produced a decrease in the blood glucose level that was approximately equal to the effect of 3-Guanidinopropionic acid at 700 mg/kg/day. A higher dose of 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride produced an even greater reduction in the blood glucose concentration. Administration of 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride to obese KKAy mice for 3 days decreased the body weight of the animals (see Table 3). A dose of 125 mg/kg/day produced a 1.90% decrease in the body weight compared to the control mice. A higher dose of 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride produced an even greater reduction in the body weight of obese mice. Administration of a variety of related structural analogs of 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride to diabetic, obese KKAy mice for 3 days resulted in a reduction in the abnormally elevated blood glucose of these mice or a decrease in the excessive body weight of the animals (Table 4). 4-Imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride and a mixture of 1,2,4-triazine-3,6-dione, tetrahydro-, 3-hydrazone, monohydrochloride and 2,4-imidazolidinedione, 3-amino-, 2-hydrazone, monohydrochloride caused both the blood glucose and body weight to decrease. 1,2,4-triazin-5(2H)-one, 3-amino-1,6-dihydro-, monohydrochloride and 1,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)-dione, dihydro-, 3-hydrazone, monohydrochloride caused a reduction in body weight. The blood glucose level did not decrease with these compounds during the 3 day experiment. Since the mean blood glucose level in obese diabetic humans decreases when body weight is reduced for 12, 36, or 64 weeks (Wing, Archives of Internal Medicine, Vol. 147, p. 1749, 1987), the weight reduction with 1,2,4-triazin-5(2H)-one, 3-amino-1,6-dihydro-, monohydrochloride and 1,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)-dione, dihydro-, 3-hydrazone, monohydrochloride should cause improvement in the hyperglycemic state with longer term administration. In patients with diabetes mellitus, there are several metabolic disorders that would be of therapeutic benefit to correct: the abnormally elevated blood level of glucose in the fed and fasted states, the delayed clearance of glucose from the blood stream (American Diabetes Association, Physicians Guide to Insulin-Dependent (Type I) Diabetes, 1988; American Diabetes Association, Physicians Guide to Non-Insulin-Dependent (Type II) Diabetes, 1988), and the excessive glycosylation of proteins which contributes to the development of diabetic complications (Brownlee, supra). Furthermore, obesity is frequently associated with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and aggravates the disordered glucose metabolism in these patients (Horton and Jeanrenaud, Chapter 27, Obesity and Diabetes Mellitus, 1990). The optimal treatment for non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus would correct all of these disorders, but in particular would correct obesity (Karam, Chapter 33, Diabetes Mellitus and Obesity, p. 298, 1982; Kahn, Diabetes Mellitus Theory and Practice, 4th ed., Chapter 26, p. 450, 1990). Excessive glycosylation of proteins, such as can occur in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, can be prevented by reducing the abnormal elevation of blood glucose concentration in the diabetic state (Holman and Turner, Diabetic Medicine, 5:582-588, 1988; Benjamin and Sacks, Clin Chem., 4015:683-687, 1994). It is the ability of the claimed compounds to positively affect multiple metabolic defects comprising diabetes mellitus and to prevent metabolic defects by more than one mechanism that clearly distinguishes their pharmacologic actions from other guanidine compounds that have previously been claimed as treatments for diabetes mellitus. The claimed compounds are unexpectedly superior to aminoguanidine, diaminoguanidine, 3-guanidinopropionic acid, and metformin in the treatment of NIDDM because they offer a more complete spectrum of desirable activities or are effective in lower doses. The claimed compounds offer unexpected advantages in the treatment of diabetes mellitus compared to diaminoguanidine and aminoguanidine since the claimed compounds act metabolically to reduce excessive blood glucose concentration. The claimed compounds are unexpectedly superior to aminoguanidine and diaminoguanidine in the treatment of impaired glucose tolerance or obesity since aminoguanidine and diaminoguanidine lack efficacy in this regard. Aminoguanidine and diaminoguanidine inhibit non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins in vitro and the formation of advanced glycosylation endproducts in vivo (Kumari, Umar, Bansal, and Sahib, Diabetes, 40:1079-1084, 1991). Based on its inhibition of non-enzymatic protein glycosylation, aminoguanidine has been suggested to have utility in the treatment of diabetes (Brownlee, supra). Aminoguanidine has no effect on the blood glucose level of normal rodents or rats made diabetic by injection of alloxan or streptozotocin (Kumari, Umar, Bansal, Sahib, supra; Yagihashi, Kamijo, Baba, Yagihashi, and Nagai, Diabetes, 41:47-52, 1992; Edelstein and Brownlee, Diabetologia, 35:96-97, 1992; Oxlund and Andreassen, Diabeterologia, 35:19-25, 1992). Diaminoguanidine has no effect on the blood glucose level of normal or alloxan-diabetic rats (Kumari, Umar, Bansal, Sahib, supra). Aminoguanidine has no effect on the body weight of normal or diabetic rats (Kumari, Umar, Bansal, Sahib, supra; Yagihashi, Kamijo, Baba, Yagihashi, and Nagai, supra; Oxlund and Andreassen, Diabetologia, 35:19-25, 1992) or results in an increase in body weight of human and rats (Baylin, Horakova, and Beaven, Experientia, 31:562, 1975). Diaminoguanidine does not affect the body weight of normal or alloxan-diabetic rats (Kumari, Umar, Bansal, Sahib, supra). An effect by aminoguanidine or diaminoguanidine on glucose tolerance has yet to be demonstrated. The claimed compounds are unexpectedly superior to 3-guanidinopropionic acid in the treatment of diabetes mellitus since the latter is less potent in the control of hyperglycemia. 3-Guanidinopropionic acid has previously been shown to reduce hyperglycemia and excess body weight and to improve glucose tolerance in diabetic rodents (Meglasson, Wilson, Yu, Robinson, Wyse, and de Souza, J. Pharm. and Exp. Therapeutics, 266:1454-1462, 1993). The most preferred compound in this claim, 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride, is more potent than 3-guanidinopropionic acid in reducing the abnormally elevated blood glucose level of KKAy mice. To reduced the blood glucose level of KKAy mice by 35% required 700 mg/kg/day of the latter compound. A similar reduction in the blood glucose level could be achieved with a dose of 125 mg/kg/day of 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride. The claimed compounds are unexpectedly superior to metformin in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, glucose intolerance, and obesity since the latter is less potent when tested in the same animal model as the claimed compounds. Also, with respect to its efficacy in reducing body weight, the disclosed data for metformin are contradictory and do not reveal a consistent result. Metformin has previously been shown to reduce hyperglycemia in non-insulin dependent diabetic patients when administered at 1000-3000 mg/day and to increase the rate of glucose clearance in such patients when administered at 1500-2500 mg/day (Bailey, Diabetes Care, 15:755-772, 1992). Rodents are less sensitive to metformin than humans and therefore higher doses (based on body weight) are required to demonstrate glycemic effects (Bailey, Flatt, Wilcock, and Day, Frontiers in Diabetes Research, pp. 277-282, 1990; Penicaud, Hitier, Ferre, and Girard, Biochem. J. 262:881-885, 1989). Chronic oral administration of metformin reduces hyperglycemia when administered to neonatal streptozotocin-diabetic rats at 100 mg/kg/day (Rossetti, DeFronzo, Gherzi, Stein, et al, Metabolism, 39:425-435, 1990), to DBM mice at 400 mg/kg/day (Bailey, Flatt, Wilcock, and Day, supra), to Zucker fa/fa rats at 350 mg/kg/day (Penicaud, Hitier, Ferre, and Girard, supra), and to KKAy mice at 300 mg/kg/day or more (Meglasson, Wilson, Yu, Robinson, de Souza, supra). Chronic oral administration of metformin did not affect the blood glucose concentration in normal mice receiving 250 mg/kg/day, in streptozotocin-diabetic mice receiving 250 mg/kg/day (Bailey, Flatt, Wilcock, and Day, supra), or diabetic ob/ob mice receiving 250 mg/kg/day (Bailey, Flatt, and Ewan, Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn., 282:233-239, 1986). Acute administration of 264 mg/kg metformin or its analog buformin at 132 mg/kg did not affect the blood glucose level of rats (Tutwiler and Bridi, Diabetes, 27:868-876, 1978). When the most preferred compound in this claim, 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride, was tested in KKAy mice it was more potent than metformin in reducing the abnormally elevated blood glucose level in this model. To reduce the blood glucose level of KKAy mice by 25% required 300 mg/kg/day of metformin (Meglasson, Wilson, Yu, Robinson, Wyse, and de Souza, supra). A similar reduction in the blood glucose level could be achieved with a dose of 70-125 mg/kg/day of 4-imidazolidinone, 1,3-diamino-2-imino-, monohydrochloride. With respect to increasing glucose tolerance metformin has been reported to not affect glucose tolerance in normal rats when given at a dose of 750 mg/kg (Tutwiler and Bridi, supra) or in normal mice when given at 50 mg/kg (Bailey, Flatt, Wilcock, and Day, supra). When given to normal mice or streptozotocin-diabetic rats at 250 mg/kg oral glucose tolerance was increased (Bailey, Flatt, Wilcock, and Day, supra). With respect to reducing body weight, metformin has been reported to cause weight loss in non-insulin dependent diabetic patients treated for one year (Bailey, supra) or to have no significant effect on the body weight of obese non-insulin dependent diabetic patients treated for a similar length of time (Multi-centre Study, Diabetologia, 24:404-411, 1983). Metformin did not cause weight loss in diabetic ob/ob mice when administered at 240 mg/kg/day or streptozotocin-diabetic mice when administered at 60 mg/kg/day (Lord, Atkins, and Bailey, Diabetologia 25:108-113, 1983). Metformin caused statistically significant weight loss in KKAy mice treated with 1700 mg/kg/day of the compound, but not when lower doses were given (Meglasson, Wilson, Yu, Robinson, Wyse, and de Souza, supra). By comparison, when N-(dihydrazinomethylene)-glycine was administered to KKAy mice at 100 mg/kg/day it was approximately as effective as 1700 mg/kg/day of metformin in producing weight loss in this obese mouse strain (Meglasson, Wilson, Yu, Robinson, Wyse, and de Souza, supra).

EXAMPLE 3 1,2,4-Triazine-3,6-dione, tetrahydro-, 3-hydrazone, monohydrochloride (Compound 9). A soln of 8 (3.00 g, 20.4 mmol) in 1.0 M aq HCl (45 mL) was left standing at room temp for 24 h (NMR analysis of an aliquot indicated a 1:1 mixture of new products with no starting material remaining). The soln was then diluted to a total volume of 500 mL with THF. An oil separated. The mixture was chilled in an ice bucket for 1 h, whereupon some crystals appeared in the separated oil. Filtration of the mixture gave a white crystalline solid (0.86 g). NMR analysis indicated the solid was a 6:1 mixture of products 9:10 (major one having the upfield NMR signal). The oil in the filtrate continued to deposit crystals. After another hour, a second crop (0.55 g) was collected by filtration which was an 8:1 mixture of the same products. The second crop was dissolved in water (10 mL) and then diluted with THF (125 mL). The soln was left at 0 C. for 24 hrs, sonicated, and left at 0 C. for another 24 h.

Biological Testing Compounds of the present invention were tested for their ability to reduce blood glucose and body weight as follows: KKAy mice are rodent models of NIDDM and obesity (Chang, Wyse, Copeland, Peterson, and Ledbetter, 1986). A pre-treatment blood sample was obtained from the retro-orbital sinus and the mice arranged in groups of 5-6 so that the mean pre-treatment blood glucose level was the same on average in all groups. Test compounds were admixed in the chow at a concentration of 0.05-0.5% and the mice were allowed to consume the diet ad libitum. Control mice received unsupplemented chow. On Day 0, the mice were weighed and provided control chow or chow supplemented with test compounds. After 3 days of consuming control chow or chow supplemented with test compounds, a blood sample was obtained for determination of the glucose concentration and the animals were weighed for determination of weight loss. Food consumption was measured by weighing the food provided at the beginning of the study and the food residue at the end of the study. Food consumption was calculated by subtracting the weight of the residue from the weight of the food provided. Drug intake was calculated by multiplying food consumption by the concentration of drug in the diet. Using this method drug intake was determined to be approximately 62-444 mg of the free base form per kg per day. Blood glucose data are expressed as the average blood glucose concentration in the test group divided by the average blood glucose level in the control group (treatment/control or T/C). Compounds resulting in T/C values equal to or less than 0.90 are considered to be active anti-hyperglycemic agents. Weight loss data are expressed as percent change in body weight. Compounds resulting in a decrease of 0.22% or more less than control in body weight over three days are considered to be active anti-obesity agents. In a typical obese human subject (for example, a male, 68 inches in height and body mass index of 30) the loss of 0.22%/3 days would be equivalent to 1 pound per week (Bray, Endocrinology, 3rd edition, Chap. 143, p. 2627, 1995). A widely used clinical standard for satisfactory weight loss by obese humans is 1-2 pounds per week (Horton, Diabetes Mellitus Theory and Practice, 4th edition, Chapter 27, p. 461, 1990). Hence a drug that causes weight to be lost at the rate of 0.22%/3 days would be of benefit.

FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, a method of stimulating the release of growth hormone from the pituitary, a method for increasing the rate and extent of growth of animals to increase their milk and wool production, or for the treatment of ailments, and to use of the compounds for the preparation of medicaments. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Growth hormone is a hormone which stimulates growth of all tissues capable of growing. In addition, growth hormone is known to have a number of effects on metabolic processes, e.g., stimulation of protein synthesis and free fatty acid mobilization and to cause a switch in energy metabolism from carbohydrate to fatty acd metabolism. Deficiency in growth hormone can result in a number of severe medical disorders, e.g., dwarfism. Growth hormone is released from the pituitary. The release is under tight control of a number of hormones and neurotransmitters either directly or indirectly. Growth hormone release can be stimulated by growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) and inhibited by somatostatin. In both cases the hormones are released from the hypothalamus but their action is mediated primarily via specific receptors located in the pituitary. Other compounds which stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary have also been described. For example arginine, L-3,4dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa), glucagon, vasopressin, PACAP (pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide), muscarinic receptor agonists and a synthethic hexapeptide, GHRP (growth hormone releasing peptide release endogenous growth hormone either by a direct effect on the pituitary or by affecting the release of GHRH and/or somatostatin from the hypothalamus. In disorders or conditions where increased levels of growth hormone is desired, the protein nature of growth hormone makes anything but parenteral administration nonviable. Furthermore, other directly acting natural secretagogues, e.g., GHRH and PACAP, are longer polypeptides for which reason oral administration of them is not viable. The use of certain compounds for increasing the levels of growth hormone in mammals has previously been proposed, e.g. in EP 18 072, EP 83 864, WO 89107110, WO 8910171 1, WO 89/10933, WO 88/9780, WO 83/02272, WO 91/18016, WO 92/01711, WO 93/04081, WO 95117422, WO 95/17423, WO 95114666, WO 96/15148 and WO 96/10040. The composition of growth hormone releasing compounds is important for their growth hormone releasing potency as well as their bioavailability. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide novel compounds with growth hormone releasing properties.

It is believed that compounds of formula I exhibit an improved resistance to proteolytic degradation by enzymes compared to that of the peptides suggested in the prior literature, due to the lack of natural peptide bonds. The increased resistance to proteolytic degradation combined with the reduced size of the compounds of the invention in comparison with known growth hormone releasing peptides is expected to improve their bioavailability compared to that of the peptides suggested in the prior literature. In the above structural formulas and throughout the present specification, the following terms have the indicated meanings: The C 1-6 -alkyl groups specified above are intended to include those alkyl groups of the designated length in either a linear or branched or cyclic configuration. Examples of linear alkyl are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, and hexyl. Examples of branched alkyl are isopropyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, isopentyl, and isohexyl.

The term halogen is intended to include Cl, F, Br and I. The compounds of the present invention may have one or more asymmetric centres and it is intended that stereoisomers, as separated, pure or partially purified stereoisomers or racemic mixtures thereof are included in the scope of the invention. The compounds of the present invention may optionally be on a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form such as the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of compounds of formula I which include those prepared by reacting the compound of formula I with an inorganic or organic acid such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, acetic, phosphoric, lactic, maleic, phthalic, citric, glutaric, gluconic, methanesulfonic, salicylic, succinic, tartaric, toluenesulfonic, trifluoracetic, sulfamic or fumaric acid. The compounds of formula I may be administered in pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt form or, where appropriate, as a alkali metal or alkaline earth metal or lower alkylammonium salt Such salt forms are believed to exhibit approximately the same order of activity as the free base forms. In another aspect, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an active ingredient, a compound of the general formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound of the present invention may be prepared by conventional techniques, e.g. as described in Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1985. The compositions may appear in conventional forms, for example capsules, tablets, aerosols, solutions, suspensions or topical applications. The pharmaceutical carrier or diluent employed may be a conventional solid or liquid carrier. Examples of solid carriers are lactose, terra alba, sucrose, cyclodextrin, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or lower alkyl ethers of cellulose. Examples of liquid carriers are syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, phospholipids, fatty acids, fatty acid amines, polyoxyethylene or water. Similarly, the carrier or diluent may include any sustained release material known in the art, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, alone or mixed with a wax. If a solid carrier is used for oral administration, the preparation may be tabletted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form or it can be in the form of a troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier will vary widely but will usually be from about 25 mg to about 1 g. If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation may be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule or sterile injectable liquid such as an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspension or solution. A typical tablet which may be prepared by conventional tabletting techniques may contain: Core: Active compound (as free compound or salt thereof) 100 mg Colloidal silicon dioxide (Aerosil) 1.5 mg Cellulose, microcryst. (Avicel) 70 mg Modified cellulose gum (Ac-Di-Sol) 7.5 mg Magnesium stearate Coating: HPMC approx. 9 mg *Mywacett 9-40 T approx. 0.9 mg *Acylated monoglyceride used as plasticizer for film coating. For nasal administration, the preparation may contain a compound of formula I dissolved or suspended in a liquid carrier, in particular an aqueous carrier, for aerosol application. The carrier may contain additives such as solubilizing agents, e.g. propylene glycol, surfactants, absorption enhancers such as lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) or cyclodextrin, or preservatives such as parabenes. Generally, the compounds of the present invention are dispensed in unit dosage form comprising 50-200 mg of active ingredient together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrer per unit dosage. The dosage of the compounds according to this invention is suitably 0.1-500 mgIday, e.g. from about 5 to about 50 mg, such as about 10 mg per dose, when administered to patients, e.g. humans, as a drug. It has been demonstrated that compounds of the general formula I possess the ability to release endogenous growth hormone in vivo. The compounds may therefore be used in the treatment of conditions which require increased plasma growth hormone levels such as in growth hormone deficient humans or in elderly patients or livestock. Thus, in a particular aspect, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for stimulating the release of growth hormone from the pituitary, the composition comprising, as an active ingredient, a compound of the general formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a method of stimulating the release of growth hormone from the pituitary, the method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of the general formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In a still further aspect, the present invention relates to the use of a compound of the general formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the preparation of a medicament for stimulating the release of growth hormone from the pituitary. To those skilled in the art, it is well known that the current and potential uses of growth hormone in humans are varied and multitudinous. Thus, compounds of formula I can be administered for purposes stimulating release of growth hormone from the pituitary and would then have similar effects or uses as growth hormone itself. The uses of growth hormone may be summarized as follows: stimulation of growth hormone release in the elderly; prevention of catabolic side effects of glucocorticoids, prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, treatment of NIDDM, stimulation of the immune system, acceleration of wound healing, accelerating bone fracture repair, treatment of growth retardation, treating renal failure or insufficiency resulting from growth retardation, treatment of physiological short stature including growth hormone deficient children and short stature associated with chronic illness, treatment of obesity and growth retardation associated with obesity, treatment of anorexia, treating growth retardation associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome and Turners syndrome; accelerating the recovery and reducing hospitalization of bum patients; treatment of intrauterine growth retardation, skeletal dysplasia, hypercortisolism and Cushings syndrome; induction of pulsatile growth hormone release; replacement of growth hormone in stressed patients, treatment of osteochondrodysplasias, Noonans syndrome, schizophrenia, depressions, Alzheimers disease, delayed wound healing and psychosocial deprivation, treatment of pulmonary dysfunction and ventilator dependency, attenuation of protein catabolic responses after major surgery, reducing cachexia and protein loss due to chronic illness such as cancer or AIDS; treatment of hyperinsulinemia including nesidioblastosis, adjuvant treatment for ovulation induction; to stimulate thymic development and prevent the age-related decline of thymic function, treatment of immunosuppressed patients, improvement in muscle strength, mobility, maintenance of skin thickness, metabolic homeostasis, renal homeostasis in the frail elderly, stimulation of osteoblasts, bone remodelling and cartilage growth, stimulation of the immune system in companion animals and treatment of disorder of aging in companion animals, growth promoter in livestock and stimulation of wool growth in sheep. For the above indications the dosage will vary depending on the compound of formula I employed, on the mode of administration and on the therapy desired. However, generally dosage levels between 0.0001 and 100 mg/kg body weight daily are administered to patients and animals to obtain effective release of endogenous growth hormone. Usually, dosage forms suitable for oral, nasal, pulmonal or transdermal administration comprise from about 0.0001 mg to about 100 mg, preferably from about 0.001 mg to about 50 mg of the compounds of formula I admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent Optionally, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may comprise a compound of formula I combined with one or more compounds exhibiting a different activity, e.g., an antibiotic or other pharmacologically active material. The route of administration may be any route which effectively transports the active compound to the appropriate or desired site of action, such as oral, nasal, pulmonary, transdermal or parenteral, the oral route being preferred. Apart from the pharmaceutical use of the compounds of formula I, they may be useful in vitro tools for investigating the regulation of growth hormone release. Compounds of formula I may also be useful in vivo tools for evaluating the growth hormone releasing capability of the pituitary. For example, serum samples taken before and after administration of these compounds to humans can be assayed for growth hormone. Comparison of the growth hormone in each serum sample would directly determine the ability of the patients pituitary to release growth hormone. Compounds of formula I may be administered to commercially important animals, such as cows, sheeps, pigs, goats, etc. to increase their rate and extent of growth, and to increase milk production. A further use of growth hormone secretagogue compounds of formula I is in combination with other secretagogues such as GHRP (2 or 6), GHRH and its analogues, growth hormone and its analogues or somatomedins including IGF-1 and IGF-2. Pharmacological Methods Compounds of formula I may be evaluated in vitro for their efficacy and potency to release growth hormone in rat pituitary primary cultures. The isolation of rat pituitary cells is a modification of O. Sartor et al., Endocrinology 116, 1985, pp. 952-957. Male albino Sprague-Dawley rats (250 /25 grams) were purchased from Mllegaard, Lille Skensved, Denmark. The rats were housed in group cages (four animals/cage) and placed in rooms with 12 hour light cycle. The room temperature varied from 19-24 C. and the humidity from 30-60%. The rats were decapitated and the pituitaries dissected. The neurointermediate lobes were removed and the remaining tissue was immediately placed in icecold isolation buffer (Geys medium (Gibco 041-04030) supplemented with 0.25% DGlucose, 2% non-essential amino acids (Gibco 043-01140) and 1% bovine serum albumine (BSA) (Sigma A4503)). The tissue was cut into small pieces and transferred to isolation buffer supplemented with 3.8 mg/ml of trypsin (Worthington 3707 TRL-3) and 330 mg/ml of DNase (Sigma D-4527). This mixture was incubated at 70 rotations/min for 35 min at 37 C. in a 95/5% atmosphere of O 2 /CO 2 . The tissue was then washed three times in the above buffer. Using a standard pasteur pipette, the tissue was then aspirated into single cells. After dispersion, cells were filtered through a nylon filter (160 mm) to remove undigested issue. The cell suspension was washed 3 times with isolation buffer supplemented with trypsin inhibitor (0.75 mg/ml, Worthington 2829) and finally resuspended in culture medium; DMEM (Gibco 041-01965) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES (Sigma H-3375), 4 mM glutamine (Gibco 043-05030H), 0.075% sodium bicarbonate (Sigma S-8875), 0.1% non-essential amino acid, 2.5% fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco 011-06290), 3% horse serum (Gibco 034-06050), 10% fresh rat serum, 1 nM T 3 (Sigma T-2752) and 40 mg/L dexamethasone (Sigma D-4902) pH 7.3, to a density of 210 5 cells/ml. The cells were seeded into microtiter plates (Nunc, Denmark), 200 ml/well, and cultured for 3 days at 37 C. and 8% CO 2 . Compound Testing After culturing, the cells were washed twice with stimulation buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco 041-04020) supplemented with 1% BSA (Sigma A4503), 0.25% D-glucose (Sigma G-5250) and 25 mM HEPES (Sigma H-3375) pH 7.3) and preincubated for 1 hour at 37 C. The buffer was exchanged with 90 ml stimulation buffer (37 C.). Ten ml test compound solution was added and the plates were incubated for 15 min at 37 C. and 5% CO 2 . The medium was decanted and analyzed for GH content in an rGH SPA test system. All compounds were tested in doses ranging from 10 pM to 100 mM. A dose-response relation was constructed using the Hill equation (Fig P. Biosoft). The efficacy (maximal GH released, E max ) was expressed in % of the E max of GHRP-6. The potency (EC 50 ) was determined as the concentration inducing half maximal stimulation of the GH release. Compounds of formula I may be evaluated for their metabolic stability. Compounds were dissolved at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in water. 25 ml of this solution is added to 175 ml of the respective enzyme-solution (resulting in an enzyme:substrate ratio (w/w) of approximately 1:5). The solution is left at 37 C. overnight. 10 ml of the various degradation solutions is analyzed against a corresponding zero-sample using flow injection electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) with selected ion monitoring of the molecular ion. If the signal has decreased more than 20% compared to the zero-sample, the remainder of the solution is analyzed by HPLC and mass spectrometry in order to identify the extent and site(s) of degradation precisely. Several standard peptides (ACTH-4-10, Angiotensin 1-14 and Glucagon) have been included in the stability tests in order to verify the ability of the various solutions to degrade peptides. Standard peptides (angiotensin 1-14, ACTH 4-10 and glucagon) were purchased from Sigma, Mo., USA) Enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase aminopeptidase M and carboxypeptidase Y and B) were all purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany) Pancreatic enzyme mix: trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase in 100 mM ammoniumbicarbonate pH 8.0 (all concentrations 0.025 mg/ml). Carboxypeptidase mix: carboxypeptidase Y and B in 50 mM ammoniumacetate pH 4.5 (all concentrations 0.025 mg/ml). Aminopeptdase M solution: aminopeptidase M (0.025 mg/ml) in 100 mM ammoniumbicarbonate pH 8.0 Mass spectrometric analysis was performed using two different mass spectrometers. A Sciex API III triple quadrupole LC-MS instrument (Sciex instruments, Thornhill, Ontario) equipped with an electrospray ion-source and a Bio-Ion 20 time-of-flight Plasma Desorption instrument (Bio-Ion Nordic AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Quantification of the compounds (before and after degradation) was done on the API III instrument using single ion monitoring of the molecular ion in question with flow injection of the analyte. The liquid flow (MeOH:water 1:1) of 100 ml/min was controlled by an ABI 140B HPLC unit (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems Divisions, Foster City, Calif.). The instrument parameters were set to standard operation conditions, and SIM monitoring was performed using the most intense molecular ion (in most cases this corresponded to the doubly charged molecular ion). Identification of degradation products furthermore involved the use of plasma desorption mass spectrometry (PDMS) with sample application on nitrocellulose coated targets and standard instrumental settings. The accuracy of the hereby determined masses is generally better than 0.1%. Separation and isolation of degradation products was done using a HY-TACH C-18 reverse phase 4.6105 mm HPLC column (Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, Calif.) with a standard acetonitril: TFA separation gradient The HPLC system used was HP1090M (Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, Calif.).

Also disclosed are potassium channel opening compositions and a method of opening potassium channels in a mammal. TECHNICAL FIELD Novel tricyclic dihydropyrimidine compounds and their derivatives can open potassium channels and are useful for treating a variety of medical conditions. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Potassium channels play an important role in regulating cell membrane excitability. When the potassium channels open, changes in the electrical potential across the cell membrane occur and result in a more polarized state. A number of diseases or conditions may be treated with therapeutic agents that open potassium channels; see (K. Lawson, Pharmacol. Ther., v. 70, pp. 39-63 (1996)); (D. R. Gehlert et al., Prog. Neuro-Psychopharmacol Biol. Psychiat., v. 18, pp. 1093-1102 (1994)); (M. Gopalakrishnan et al., Drug Development Research, v. 28, pp. 95-127 (1993)); (J. E. Freedman et al., The Neuroscientist, v. 2, pp. 145-152 (1996)); (D. E. Nurse et al., Br. J. Urol., v. 68 pp. 27-31 (1991)); (B. B. Howe et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., v. 274 pp. 884-890 (1995)); and (D. Spanswick et al., Nature, v. 390 pp. 521-25 (Dec. 4, 1997)). Such diseases or conditions include asthma, epilepsy, hypertension, male sexual dysfimction, female sexual dysfunction, migraine, pain, urinary incontinence, stroke, Raynauds Syndrome, eating disorders, finctional bowel disorders, and neurodegeneration. Potassium channel openers also act as smooth muscle relaxants. Because urinary incontinence can result from the spontaneous, uncontrolled contractions of the smooth muscle of the bladder, the ability of potassium channel openers to hyperpolarize bladder cells and relax bladder smooth muscle provides a method to ameliorate or prevent urinary incontinence. U.S. Pat. No. 4,918,074, EP 183848 B1, EP 217142, EP 328700, JP 63060985, JP 63243029, JP 61227584, and Atwal, K.S., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett (1991) 1, 291-294 disclose bicyclic 4,7-dihydropyrazolo1,5-apyrimidines. The compounds of the present invention are novel, hyperpolarize cell membranes, open potassium channels, relax smooth muscle cells, inhibit bladder contractions, and are useful for treating diseases that can be ameliorated by opening potassium channels.

Determination of Potassium Channel Opening Activity Membrane Hyperpolarization Assays Compounds were evaluated for potassium channel opening activity using primary cultured quinea-pig urinary bladder (GPB) cells. For the preparation of urinary bladder smooth muscle cells, urinary bladders were removed from male quinea-pigs (Hartley, Charles River, Wilmington, Mass.) weighing 300-400 g and placed in ice-cold Ca 2 -free Krebs solution (Composition, mM: KCl, 2.7; KH 2 PO 4 , 1.5; NaCl, 75; Na 2 HPO 4 , 9.6; Na 2 HPO 4 .7H 2 O, 8; MgSO 4 , 2; glucose, 5; HEPES, 10; pH 7.4). Cells were isolated by enzymatic dissociation as previously described with minor modifications in (Klockner, U. and Isenberg, G., Pflugers Arch. 1985, 405, 329-339), hereby incorporated by reference. The bladder was cut into small sections and incubated in 5 mL of the Krebs solution containing 1 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and 0.2 mg/mL pronase (Calbiochem, La Jolla, Calif.) with continuous stirring in a cell incubator for 30 minutes. The mixture was then centrifuged at 1300g for 5 minutes, and the pellet resuspended in Dulbeccos PBS (GIBCO, Gaithersburg, Md.) and recentrifuged to remove residual enzyme. The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 mL growth media (composition: Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/niL penicillin, 100 units/mL streptomycin and 0.25 mg/mL amphotericin B) and further dissociated by pipetting the suspension through a flame-polished Pasteur pipette and passing it through a polypropylene mesh membrane (Spectrum, Houston, Tex.). The cell density was adjusted to 100,000 cells/mL by resuspension in growth media. Cells were plated in clear-bottomed black 96-well plates (Packard) for membrane potential studies at a density of 20,000 cells/well and maintained in a cell incubator with 90% air: 10% CO 2 until confluent. Cells were confirmed to be of smooth muscle type by cytoskeletal staining using a monoclonal mouse anti human--smooth muscle actin (Biomeda, Foster City, Calif.). Functional activity at potassium channels was measured by evaluating changes in membrane potential using the bis-oxonol dye DiBAC(4) 3 (Molecular Probes) in a 96-well cell-based kinetic assay system, Fluorescent Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR) (K. S. Schroeder et al., J. Biomed. Screen., v. 1 pp. 75-81 (1996)), hereby incorporated by reference. DiBAC(4) 3 is an anionic potentiometric probe which partitions between cells and extracellular solution in a membrane potential-dependent manner. With increasing membrane potential (for example, K depolarization), the probe further partitions into the cell; this is measured as an increase in fluorescence due to dye interaction with intracellular lipids and proteins. Conversely, decreasing membrane potential (hyperpolarization by potassium channel openers) evokes a decrease in fluorescence. Confluent quinea-pig urinary bladder cells cultured in black clear-bottomed 96-well plates were rinsed twice with 200 mL assay buffer (composition, mM: HEPES, 20; NaCl, 120; KCl, 2; CaCl 2 , 2; MgCl 2 , 1; glucose, 5; pH 7.4 at 25 C.) containing 5 M DiBAC(4) 3 and incubated with 180 mL of the buffer in a cell incubator for 30 minutes at 37 C. to ensure dye distribution across the membrane. After recording the baseline fluorescence for 5 minutes, the reference or test compounds, prepared at 10 times the concentration in the assay buffer, were added directly to the wells. Changes in fluorescence were monitored for an additional 25 minutes. Hyperpolarization responses were corrected for any background noise and were normalized to the response observed with 10 M of the reference compound P1075, N-cyano-N-(tert-pentyl)-N-(3-pyridinyl)quanidine, which was assigned as 100%. P1075 is a potent opener of smooth muscle K ATP channels (Quast et al., Mol. Pharmacol., v. 43 pp. 474-481 (1993)) and was prepared using the procedures described in (Manley, J. Med. Chem. (1992) 35, 2327-2340), hereby incorporated by reference. Routinely, five concentrations of P1075 or test compounds (log or half-log dilutions) were evaluated and the maximal steady-state hyperpolarization values (expressed as % relative to P1075) plotted as a function of concentration. The EC 50 (concentration that elicites 50% of the maximal response for the test sample) values were calculated by non-linear regression analysis using a four parameter sigmoidal equation. The maximal response of each compound (expressed as % relative to P1075) is reported. Stock solutions of compounds were prepared in 100% DMSO and further dilutions were carried out in the assay buffer and added to a 96-well plate. The maximal steady-state hyperpolarization values (expressed as % relative to P1075) and the EC 50 values for representative compounds of the present invention are shown in Table 1.

Landrace pig bladders were obtained from female Landrace pigs of 9-30 kg. Landrace pigs wer eutanized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital solution, Somlethal, J. A. Webster Inc., Sterling Mass. The entire bladder was removed and immediately placed into Krebs Ringer bicarbonate solution (composition, mM: NaCl, 120; NaHCO 3 , 20; dextrose, 11; KCl, 4.7; CaCl 2 , 2.5; MgSO 4 , 1.5; KH 2 PO 4 , 1.2; K 2 EDTA, 0.01, equilibrated with 5% CO 2 /95% O 2 pH 7.4 at 37 C.). Propranolol (0.004 mM) was included in all of the assays to block -adrenoceptors. The trigonal and dome portions were discarded. Strips 3-5 mm wide and 20 mm long were prepared from the remaining tissue cut in a circular fashion. The mucosal layer was removed. One end was fixed to a stationary glass rod and the other to a Grass FT03 transducer at a basal preload of 1.0 gram. Two parallel platinum electrodes were included in the stationary glass rod to provide field stimulation of 0.05 Hz, 0.5 milli-seconds at 20 volts. This low frequency stimulation produced a stable twitch response of 100-500 centigrams. Tissues were allowed to equilibrate for at least 60 minutes and primed with 80 mM KCl. A control concentration response curve (cumulative) was generated for each tissue using the potassium channel opener P1075 as the control agonist. P1075 completely eliminated the stimulated twitch in a dose dependent fashion over a concentration range of 10 9 to 10 5 M dissolved in DMSO using log increments. After a 60 minute rinsing period, a concentration response curve (cumulative) was generated for the test agonist in the same fashion as that used for the control agonist P1075. The maximal efficacy of each compounds (expressed as % relative to P1075) is reported. The amount of agent necessary to cause 50% of the agents maximal response (ED 50 ) was calculated using ALLFIT (DeLean et al., Am. J. Physiol., 235, E97 (1980)), hereby incorporated by reference, and agonist potencies were expressed as pD 2 (the negative logarithm). Agonist potencies were also expressed as an index relative to P1075. The index was calculated by dividing the ED 50 for P1075 by the ED 50 for the test agonist in a given tissue. Each tissue was used for only one test agonist, and the indices obtained from each tissue were averaged to provide an average index of potency. These data are shown in Table 2.

Compounds of the present invention may exist as stereoisomers wherein, asymmetric or chiral centers are present. These stereoisomers are R or S depending on the confiquration of substituents around the chiral carbon atom. The terms R and S used herein are confiqurations as defined in IUPAC 1974 Recommendations for Section E, Fundamental Stereochemistry, Pure Appl. Chem., 1976, 45: 13-30. In particular, the stereochemistry at the point of attachment of R 1 , as shown in formula I-IV, may independently be either (R) or (S), unless specifically noted otherwise. The present invention contemplates various stereoisomers and mixtures thereof and are specifically included within the scope of this invention. Stereoisomers include enantiomers and diastereomers, and mixtures of enantiomers or diastereomers. Individual stereoisomers of compounds of the present invention may be prepared synthetically from commercially available starting materials which contain asymmetric or chiral centers or by preparation of racemic mixtures followed by resolution well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These methods of resolution are exemplified by (1) attachment of a mixture of enantiomers to a chiral auxiliary, separation of the resulting mixture of diastereomers by recrystallization or chromatography and liberation of the optically pure product from the auxiliary or (2) direct separation of the mixture of optical enantiomers on chiral chromatographic columns. The term pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, as used herein, means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringers solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator. The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise compounds of the present invention formulated together with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated for oral administration in solid or liquid form, for parenteral injection or for rectal administration. Further included within the scope of the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more of the compounds of formula I-IV prepared and formulated in combination with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable compositions. The pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated for oral administration in solid or liquid form, for parenteral injection or for rectal administration. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other mammals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments or drops), bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. The term parenterally, as used herein, refers to modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous, intraarticular injection and infusion. Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservative agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by various antibacterial and antifingal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents, as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, tragacanth, and mixtures thereof. If desired, and for more effective distribution, the compounds of the present invention can be incorporated into slow-release or targeted-delivery systems such as polymer matrices, liposomes, and microspheres. They may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter or by incorporation of sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions, which may be dissolved in sterile water or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound can be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose, or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of such composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsulated matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides) Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic, parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringers solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid; b) binders such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia; c) humectants such as glycerol; d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin; f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; g) wetting agents such as cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate;) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay; and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfiiryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active compound of this invention, excipients such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof. Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to the compounds of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons. Compounds of the present invention may also be administered in the form of liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes may be used. The present compositions in liposome form may contain, in addition to the compounds of the present invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients, and the like. The preferred lipids are the natural and synthetic phospholipids and phosphatidylcholines (lecithins) used separately or together. Methods to form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example, Prescott, Ed., Methods in Cell Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.Y., (1976), p 33 et seq.

Examples of acids which can be employed to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include such inorganic acids as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid and such organic acids as oxalic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid and citric acid. Basic addition salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of compounds of this invention by reacting a carboxylic acid-containing moiety with a suitable base such as the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation or with ammonia or an organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, cations based on alkali metals or alkaline earth metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and aluminum salts and the like and nontoxic quaternary ammonia and amine cations including ammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, diethylamine, ethylamine and the like.

The term pharmaceutically acceptable ester, as used herein, refers to esters of compounds of the present invention which hydrolyze in vivo and include those that break down readily in the human body to leave the parent compound or a salt thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, non-toxic esters of the present invention include C 1 -to-C 6 alkyl esters and C 5 -to-C 7 cycloalkyl esters, although C 1 -to-C 4 alkyl esters are preferred. Esters of the compounds of formula I-IV may be prepared according to conventional methods. For example, 9-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-(4-carboxyphenyl)-5,6,7,9-tetrahydropyrazolo5,1-bquinazolin-8(4H)-one can be treated with an acid, such as HCl, in an alcoholic solvent, such as methanol, to provide the ester 9-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-(4- methoxycarbonylphenyl)-5,6,7,9-tetrahydropyrazolo5,1-bquinazolin-8(4H)-one. The term pharmaceutically acceptable amide, as used herein, refers to non-toxic amides of the present invention derived from ammonia, primary C 1 -to-C 6 alkyl amines and secondary C 1 -to-C 6 dialkyl amines. In the case of secondary amines, the amine may also be in the form of a 5- or 6-membered heterocycle containing one nitrogen atom. Amides derived from ammonia, C 1 -to-C 3 alkyl primary amides and C 1 -to-C 2 dialkyl secondary amides are preferred. Amides of the compounds of formula I-IV may be prepared according to conventional methods. For example, 9-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-(4-carboxyphenyl)-5,6,7,9-tetrahydropyrazolo5,1-bquinazolin-8(4H)-one can be treated with a chloroformate, such as isobutylchloroformate, in an organic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran or methylene chloride at a temperature of about 0 C. to ambient temperature, to provide an intermediate anhydride which can then be treated with an amine, such as dimethylamine, to provide 9-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-(4-dimethylaminocarbonylphenyl)-5,6,7,9-tetrahydropyrazolo5,1-bquinazolin-8(4H)-one. It is further intended that amides of the present invention include amino acid and peptide derivatives of the compounds of formula I, as well.

Prodrugs of the present invention may be rapidly transformed in vivo to the parent compound of the above formula, for example, by hydrolysis in blood. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Hiquchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, V. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press (1987), hereby incorporated by reference. Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound of this invention include powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound is mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives, buffers or propellants which can be required. Opthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Actual dosage levels of active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active compound(s) which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, compositions and mode of administration. The selected dosage level will depend upon the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the severity of the condition being treated and the condition and prior medical history of the patient being treated. However, it is within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required for to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. The present invention contemplates pharmaceutically active compounds either chemically synthesized or formed by in vivo biotransformation to compounds of formula I-IV. The compounds of the invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples, possess potassium channel opening activity in mammals (especially humans). As potassium channel openers, the compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment and prevention of diseases such as asthma, epilepsy, hypertension, Raynauds syndrome, male sexual dysfunction, female sexual dysfimction, migraine, pain, eating disorders, urinary incontinence, functional bowel disorders, neurodegeneration and stroke. The ability of the compounds of the invention to treat asthma, epilepsy, hypertension, Raynauds syndrome, male sexual dysfunction, female sexual dysfunction, migraine, pain, eating disorders, urinary incontinence, functional bowel disorders, neurodegeneration and stroke can be demonstrated according to the methods described in (D. E. Nurse et al., Br. J. Urol., v. 68 pp. 27-31 (1991); B. B. Howe et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., v. 274 pp. 884-890 (1995); K. Lawson, Pharmacol. Ther., v. 70 pp. 39-63 (1996); D. R. Gehlert, et al., Neuro-Psychopharmacol Biol. Psychiat., v. 18 pp. 1093-1102 (1994); M. Gopalakrishnan et al., Drug Development Research, v. 28 pp. 95-127 (1993); J. E. Freedman et al., The Neuroscientist, v. 2 pp. 145-152 (1996); D. Spanswick et al., Nature, v. 390 pp. 521-25 (Dec. 4, 1997)). Aqueous liquid compositions of the present invention are particularly useful for the treatment and prevention of asthma, epilepsy, hypertension, Raynauds syndrome, male sexual dysfunction, female sexual dysfunction, migraine, pain, eating disorders, urinary incontinence, functional bowel disorders, neurodegeneration and stroke. When used in the above or other treatments, a therapeutically effective amount of one of the compounds of the present invention can be employed in pure form or, where such forms exist, in pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, amide or prodrug form. Alternatively, the compound can be administered as a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound of interest in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The phrase therapeutically effective amount of the compound of the invention means a sufficient amount of the compound to treat disorders, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgement. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. The total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a human or lower animal may range from about 0.003 to about 10 mg/kg/day. For purposes of oral administration, more preferable doses can be in the range of from about 0.01 to about 5 mg/kg/day. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration; consequently, single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose.

It has been shown that the compounds have a good affinity to the NK-1 receptor and may therefore used for the treatment of diseases related to this receptor. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Substance P is a naturally occurring undecapeptide belonging to the tachykinin family of peptides, the latter being so-named because of their prompt contractile action on extravascular smooth muscle tissue. The receptor for substance P is a member of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. The neuropeptide receptors for substance P (NK-1) are widely distributed throughout the mammalian nervous system (especially brain and spinal ganglia), the circulatory system and peripheral tissues (especially the duodenum and jejunum) and are involved in regulating a number of diverse biological processes. The central and peripheral actions of the mammalian tachykinin substance P have been associated with numerous inflammatory conditions including migraine, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease as well as mediation of the emetic reflex and the modulation of central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Parkinsons disease (Neurosci. Res., 1996, 7, 187-214), anxiety (Can. J. Phys., 1997, 75, 612-621) and depression (Science, 1998, 281, 1640-1645). Evidence for the usefulness of tachykinin receptor antagonists in pain, headache, especially migraine, Alzheimers disease, multiple sclerosis, attenuation of morphine withdrawal, cardiovascular changes, oedema, such as oedema caused by thermal injury, chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma/bronchial hyperreactivity and other respiratory diseases including allergic rhinitis, inflammatory diseases of the gut including ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease, ocular injury and ocular inflammatory diseases, is reviewed in Tachykinin Receptor and Tachykinin Receptor Antagonists, J. Auton. Pharmacol., 13, 23-93, 1993. Furthermore, Neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists are being developed for the treatment of a number of physiological disorders associated with an excess or imbalance of tachykinin, in particular substance P. Examples of conditions in which substance P has been implicated include disorders of the central nervous system such as anxiety, depression and psychosis (WO 95/16679, WO 95/18124 and WO 95/23798). The neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists are further useful for the treatment of motion sickness and for treatment induced vomiting. In addition, in The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 340, No. 3 190-195, 1999 has been described the reduction of cisplatin-induced emesis by a selective neurokinin-1-receptor antagonist.

It has been found that the compounds of the present invention are antagonists of the Neurokinin 1 (NK-1, substance P) receptor. The compounds were investigated in accordance with the tests given hereinafter. The affinity of test compounds for the NK 1 receptor was evaluated at human NK 1 receptors in CHO cells infected with the human NK 1 receptor (using the Semliki virus expression system) and radiolabelled with 3 Hsubstance P (final concentration 0.6 nM). Binding assays were performed in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing BSA (0.04 %) leupeptin (8 g/ml), MnCl 2 (3 mM) and phosphoramidon (2 M). Binding assays consisted of 250 l of membrane suspension (1.2510 5 cells/assay tube), 0.125 l of buffer of displacing agent and 125 l of 3 Hsubstance P. Displacement curves were determined with at least seven concentrations of the compound. The assay tubes were incubated for 60 min at room temperature after which time the tube contents were rapidly filtered under vacuum through GF/C filters presoaked for 60 min with PEI (0.3%) with 22 ml washed of HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). The radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by scintillation counting. All assays were performed in triplicate in at least 2 separate experiments. The affinity to the NK-1 receptor, given as pKi, is in the scope of 8.00-9.20 for the preferred compounds. Examples of such compounds are 4-(2-Chloro-phenyl)-2-(2-dimethylamino-ethoxy)-pyrimidine-5- 8.45 carboxylic acid(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-benzyl)-methyl-amide 4-(2-Chloro-phenyl)-2-(3-dimethylamino-ethoxy)-pyrimidine-5- 8.11 carboxylic acid(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-benzyl)-methyl-amide 4-(2-Chloro-phenyl)-2-(3-dimethylamino-propoxy)-pyrimidine- 8.76 5-carboxylic acid(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-benzyl)-methyl-amide 4-(4-Fluor-2-methyl-phenyl)-2-piperazin-1-yl-pyrimidine-5- 9.14 carboxylic acid(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-benzyl)-methyl-amide 2-(4-Methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-4-naphthalen-1-yl-pyrimidine-5- 8.54 carboxylic acid(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-benzyl)-methyl-amide The compounds of formula I as well as their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations.

They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances. The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral administration a daily dosage of about 10 to 1000 mg per person of a compound of formula I should be appropriate, although the above upper limit can also be exceeded when necessary.

No. 08/004,822, filed Jan. 15, 1993, now abandoned. This invention is in the field of antiinflammatory pharmaceutical agents and relates to compounds, compositions and methods for treating inflammation and inflammation-associated disorders, such as arthritis. This invention specifically relates to 3,4-diaryl substituted thiophene, furan and pyrrole derivatives and analogs thereof. More particularly, this invention relates to selected effective and safe compounds having antiinflammatory and/or analgesic activity without erosion of the stomach. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Prostaglandins play a major role in the inflammation process, and the inhibition of prostaglandin production, especially production of PGG 2 , PGH 2 and PGE 2 , has been a common target of antiinflammatory drug discovery. However, common non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that are active in reducing the prostaglandin-induced pain and swelling associated with the inflammation process, are also active in affecting other prostaglandin-regulated processes not associated with the inflammation process. Thus, use of high doses of most common NSAIDs can produce severe side effects, including life-threatening ulcers, that limit their therapeutic potential. An alternative to NSAIDs is the use of corticosteroids, which have even more drastic side effects, especially when long-term therapy is involved. Previous NSAIDs have been found to prevent the production of prostaglandins by inhibiting enzymes in the human arachidonic acid/prostaglandin pathway, including the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Recently, the sequence of another heretofore unknown enzyme in the human arachidonic acid/prostaglandin pathway has been reported by T. Hia and K. Nielson, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA , 89, 7384 (1992) and named cyclooxygenase II (COX II) or prostaglandin G/H synthase II. The discovery of an inducible enzyme associated with inflammation provides a viable target of inhibition which more effectively reduces inflammation and produces fewer and less drastic side effects. Cyclooxygenase II is inducible by cytokines or endotoxins and such induction is inhibited by glucocortoids (J. Masferrer, et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA , 89, 3917 (1992)). The 6-methoxy-2-napthylacetic acid metabolite of nabumetone has been found by E. Meade et al to selectively inhibit the COX II enzyme ( J. Biol. Chem. , 268, 6610 (1993)). In addition, Futaki et al ( Gen. Pharmac. , 24, 105 (1993)) has reported that N-(2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl)methanesulfonamide is antiinflammatory and lacks gastric side effects. The substituted thiophene compounds disclosed herein selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase II over cyclooxygenase I and relieve the effects of inflammation. These compounds, in addition, do not display substantial inhibition of cyclooxygenase I and produce a reduced amount of side effects. Selected symmetrical 3,4-bis(phenyl, napthyl or substituted phenyl) thiophenes are known. Preparation of a wide-variety of asymmetric biaryl compounds including substituted thiophene, furan and pyrrol heterocyles is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,990,647 having a suggested utility as precursors for brighteners, pharmaceuticals, plant protection active compounds and liquid crystal materials. U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,084 describes to Biftu analogs of 2,5-diaryl tetrahydrothiophenes having activity as PAF-antagonists which are said to be linked to physiological processes associated with a large group of diseases including inflammatory disease. U.S. Pat. No. 5,196,532 to Wuest et al, describes 2,4-diaryl substituted thiophenes for cosmetics and the treatment of dermatological disorders. U.S. Pat. No. 4,427,693 to Haber, describes antiinflammatory 4,5-diarylthiophene-2-methanamines. U.S. Pat. No. 4,432,974 to Haber, describes antiinflammatory and analgesic 2,3-diaryl-5-silylthiophenes. U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,461 to Cherkofsky, describes antiinflammatory 2,3-diarylthiophenes substituted with various alkyl sulfur radicals at position 5. U.S. Pat. No. 4,381,311 to Haber, describes antiinflammatory 4,5-diarylthiophene-2-methanols. 2,3-Diaryl-5-halo thiophenes are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,590,205 to Haber, as analgesic or antiinflammatory agents. 4-Fluorophenyl and 4-methylsulfonylphenyl are among the various substituted phenyl groups that define the diary groups. U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,827 to Haber, describes 2,3-diaryl-5-bromo thiophenes, and specifically 5-bromo-2-(4-methylthiophenyl)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)thiophene, as having antiinflammatory and prostaglandin synthetase inhibitory activity for use in the treatment of inflammation and dysmenorrhea. Japanese publication 4,335,767 describes photosensitive 3,4-bis(diazosubstitutedphenyl)thiophene pigments for use in photocopiers or facsimile receivers. U.S. Pat. No. 3,743,656 to Brown et al, a CIP of U.S. Pat. No. 3,644,399, describes thiophene and furan derivatives having antiinflammatory activity, including ethyl 3,4-diphenylthiophene-2-propionate. The above documents describing antiinflammatory activity show continuing efforts to find a safe and effective antiinflammatory agent. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A class of compounds useful in treating inflammation-related disorders is defined by Formula I: wherein Y is selected from S, O, and NR 1 ; wherein R 1 is selected from hydrido and C 1 -C 6 alkyl; wherein X is one or more substituents selected from a) hydrido, halo, cyano, nitro, hydroxy, acyl, lower alkyl substituted at a substitutable position with a substituent selected from halo, hydroxyl, amino, acylamino, lower alkylamino, lower alkyl(acyl)amino, acyl, aryl optionally substituted with hydroxyl, a heterocyclic group, hydroxyimino and lower alkoxyimino, lower alkenyl optionally substituted at a substitutable position with cyano, amino optionally substituted at a substitutable position with a radical selected from acyl and lower alkylsulfonyl, sulfo, sulfamoyl optionally substituted with a substituent selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl, halo(lower)alkyl, aryl, hydroxyl, lower alkylamino(lower)alkyl, a heterocycllic group and (esterified carboxyl)lower alkyl, N-containing heterocyclicsulfonyl, a heterocyclic group optionally substituted at a substitutable position with a substituent selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, oxo, amino and lower alkylamino, b) S(O) n R 5 , wherein R 5 is C 1 -C 6 alkyl optionally substituted as a substitutable position with fluoro, and n is 0, 1 or 2, c) C(R 6 )(OR 8 )(R 7 ) wherein R 6 and R 7 independently are selected from CF 3 , CF 2 H, CFCl 2 , CF 2 Cl, CClFH, CCl 2 F, CF 3 CF 2 and C 1 -C 2 alkyl, and wherein R 8 is selected from hydrido, C 1 -C 4 alkyl, (C 1 -C 3 alkyl)C(O) and CO 2 R 9, wherein R 9 is C 1 -C 4 alkyl, d) C(O)ZR 4 , wherein Z is O, N, or S, and R4 is selected from hydrido, C 1 -C 6 alkyl and aryl, and when Z is N then R 4 is independently taken twice, e) C(R 9 )(NHR 11 )(R 10 ), wherein R 9 and R 10 are independently selected from CF 3 , CF 2 H, CFCl 2 , CF 2 Cl, CClFH and CCl 2 H, and R 11 is selected from hydrido and C 1 -C 3 alkyl, and wherein R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from aryl or heteroaryl, wherein the aryl or heteroaryl radical is optionally substituted at a substitutable position with a radical selected from halo, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkylthio, lower alkylsulfinyl, lower alkylsulfonyl, nitro, amide, amino, lower alkylamino, sulfamyl and lower alkylsulfonylamino; provided that at least one of R 2 or R 3 is substituted with lower alkylsulfonyl or sulfamyl; or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof. Compounds of Formula I would be useful for the treatment of inflammation in a subject, and for treatment of other inflammation-associated disorders, for example, as an analgesic in the treatment of pain and headaches, or as an antipyretic for the treatment of fever. For example, compounds of Formula I would be useful to treat arthritis, including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthopathies, gouty arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, osteoarthritis and juvenile arthritis. Such compounds of Formula I would be useful in the treatment of asthma, bronchitis, menstrual cramps, tendinitis, bursitis, and skin related conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, burns and dermatitis. Compounds of Formula I also would be useful to treat gastrointestinal conditions such as inflammatory bowel syndrome, Crohns disease, gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome and ulcerative colitis. Compounds of Formula I would be useful in treating inflammation in such diseases as vascular diseases, migraine headaches, periarteritis nodosa, thyroiditis, aplastic anemia, Hodgkins disease, sclerodoma, rheumatic fever, type I diabetes, myasthenia gravis, sarcoidosis, nephrotic syndrome, Behcets syndrome, polymyositis, hypersensitivity, conjunctivitis, gingivitis, swelling occurring after injury, myocardial ischemia, and the like. The compounds are useful as antiinflammatory agents, such as for the treatment of arthritis, with the additional benefit of having significantly less harmful side effects. The present invention also includes compounds which selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase II over cyclooxygenase I and do not significantly inhibit one or more other arachidonic pathway steps, such as thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2 )production. Importantly, thromboxanes cause blood platelet aggregation and have vasoconstriction properties. Thus a lack of effect in the regulation of non-inflammation related thromboxane production is further evidence of the beneficial selectivity of the present compounds. Preferably, the compounds of the present invention have a thromboxane B 2 inhibition IC 50 of greater than about 1.5 M, as determined by a whole cell assay and preferably over 10 M. The inhibition of the production of TXB 2 by a whole cell assay is a better indicator of potential in vivo behavior as the assay also incorporates such factors as cell transport. More preferably, the compounds also have a selectivity ratio of cyclooxygenase II inhibition over cyclooxygenase I inhibition of at least 50 and preferably of at least 100. Such preferred selectivity may indicate an ability to reduce the incidence of common NSAID-induced side effects, such as ulcers. The above mentioned aspects of the current invention exclude compounds such as 5-bromo-2-(4-methylthiophenyl)-3-(4-fluorophenyl)thiophene and N-(2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl)methanesulfonamide. A preferred class of compounds consists of those compounds of Formula I wherein X is one or two substituents selected from hydrido, halo, cyano, nitro, hydroxyl, acyl, lower alkyl substituted at a substitutable position with a substituent selected from halo, hydroxyl, amino, acylamino, lower alkylamino, lower alkyl(acyl)amino, acyl, aryl optionally substituted with hydroxyl, a heterocyclic group, hydroxyimino and lower alkoxyimino, lower alkenyl optionally substituted at a substitutable position with cyano, amino optionally substituted at a substitutable position with a radical selected from acyl and lower alkylsulfonyl, sulfo, sulfamoyl optionally substituted with a substituent selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl, halo(lower)alkyl, aryl, hydroxyl, lower alkylamino(lower)alkyl, a heterocyclic group and (esterified carboxy)lower alkyl, N-containing heterocyclicsulfonyl, a heterocyclic group optionally substituted at a substitutable position with a substituent selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, oxo, amino and lower alkylamino; and wherein R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from aryl and heteroaryl, wherein the aryl or heteroaryl radical is optionally substituted at a substitutable position with a radical selected from halo, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkylthio, lower alkylsulfinyl, lower alkylsulfonyl, nitro, amino, amide, lower alkylamino, sulfamyl and lower alkylsulfonylamino; or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, provided that at least one of R 2 or R 3 is substituted with lower alkylsulfonyl or sulfamyl. A more preferred class of compounds consists of those compounds of Formula I wherein Y is S or O; wherein X is one or two substituents selected from hydrido, halo, cyano, nitro, hydroxyl, carboxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl, lower alkyl substituted at a substitutable position with a substituent selected from halo, hydroxyl, amino, acylamino, lower alkylamino, lower alkyl(acyl)amino, lower alkoxycarbonyl, carboxy, a heterocyclic group, hydroxyimino and lower alkoxyimino, lower alkenyl optionally substituted at a substitutable position with cyano, amino optionally substituted at a substitutable position with a radical selected from acyl and lower alkylsulfonyl, sulfo, sulfamoyl optionally substituted with a substituent selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl, halo(lower)alkyl, aryl, hydroxyl, lower alkylamino(lower)alkyl, a heterocyclic group and (alkoxycarbonyl)lower alkyl, N-containing heterocyclicsulfonyl, a heterocyclic group optionally substituted at a substitutable position with a substituent selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, oxo, amino and lower alkylamino; and wherein R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from aryl and heteroaryl, wherein the aryl or heteroaryl radical is optionally substituted at a substitutable position with a radical selected from halo, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkylthio, lower alkylsulfinyl, lower alkylsulfonyl, nitro, amino, amide, lower alkylamino, sulfamyl and lower alkylsulfonylamino; or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, provided that at least one of R 2 or R 3 is substituted with lower alkylsulfonyl or sulfamyl.

All of these salts may be prepared by conventional means from the corresponding compound of Formula I by reacting, for example, the appropriate acid or base with the compound of Formula I. GENERAL SYNTHETIC PROCEDURES The compounds of the invention can be synthesized according to the following procedures of Schemes I-XIII, wherein the R 1 -R 3 substituents are as defined for Formula I, above, except where further noted. Synthetic Scheme I shows the preparation of dialkylester 2 from starting ester 1 or diacid 3 where R is lower alkyl. The dialkylester 2 can be prepared by the condensation of alkyl chloroacetate 1 with sodium sulfide nonahydrate, where Y is sulfur. Alternatively, dialkylester 2 can be formed by alcohol esterification of diacid 3. Synthetic Scheme II shows the preparation of diones 7 in three steps from commercially available aldehydes. In Step 1, treatment with trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) provides the trimethylsiloxy nitrile 5. In Step 2, the nitrile 5 is treated with a Grignard reagent to form the hydroxy ketone 6. In Step 3, the hydroxy ketone 6 is oxidized to give the desired diketone 7. Synthetic Scheme III shows the preparation of half ester 8, monoester 9, diacid 10 and 3,4-substituted heterocycles 11 of the present invention. In Step 1, the half ester 8 is formed by the Hinsberg condensation of dialkyl ester 2 and diketone 7, prepared in Synthetic Schemes I-II, respectively, by treatment with base, such as sodium methoxide or potassium tert-butoxide, in solvents, such as THF or alcohols. The half ester 8 can be isolated, or saponified in Step 2 to the yield diacid 10. See D. J. Chadwick et al. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I, 2079 (1972). Alternatively, a procedure analogous to that described in Overberger et al, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 72, 4958 (1950), can be used to prepare the diacid 10. In step 3, the diacid 10 is decarboxylated through the addition of copper powder, quinoline and heat to form the antiinflammatory 3,4-substituted heterocycle 11 in a process essentially analogous to that described in D. J. Chadwick et al, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I, 2079 (1972). Alternatively, the half ester 8 can be monodecarboxylated to the ester 9 by a method similar to that described in Step 3, above. Synthetic Scheme IV shows the five step preparation of 3,4-substituted furans 17 from the nitrile 12. In step 1, reaction of the nitrile 12 with an alkyl lithium, such as methyl lithium, at 78 C., is followed by acidification to give the ketone 13. In step 2, the ketone 13 is brominated to yield the bromoketone 14. In step 3, bromoketone 14 is coupled with an acid to produce the ester 15. In step 4, cyclization of the ester 15 by reflux with p-toluenesulfonic acid and triethylamine produces the furanone 16. In step 5, furanone 16 is reduced with borane/dimethylsulfide complex to give the antiinflammatory furans 17 of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention wherein X is bromo or chloro, are prepared by treating the decarboxylation product heterocycle 11 or 17, prepared in Synthetic Scheme III or IV, with Br 2 or Cl 2 , respectively. In other words Cl 2 or Br 2 may be used to yield monohalo or dihalo heterocycle 18 as in the above Scheme V. The compounds of Formula I, wherein Y is NR 1 and X is chloro or bromo, may be treated with silver fluoride or potassium fluoride to obtain compound 20 of Formula I wherein Y is NR 1 and X is fluoro. This preparation shown in Scheme VI is analogous to that described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,652,582. Compound 21 of Formula I, wherein Y is S and X is H, may be treated in two steps, first with alkyllithium and then with perchloroyl fluoride, to obtain compound 22 of Formula I, wherein X is fluoro, in the manner set forth in the Scheme VII using methods analogous to those set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,590,205. Alternatively, compounds of Formula I, wherein Y is O or S and X is hydrogen, may be treated with N-fluoropyridinium triflate as set forth in the Scheme VIII using methods analogous to those described in Tetrahedron Letters, 27, 4465 (1986). Alternatively, heterocycle 11 may be substituted at the 2 and 5 position by methods outlined for each of these substituents in their respective patent application and/or Patents, i.e. PCT Publication WO 91/19708, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,590,205, 4,302,461, 4,427,693 and 4,432,974. Compounds of Formula I wherein R 3 is alkylthiophenyl, may be treated with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA) to obtain other compounds of Formula I, wherein R 3 is alkylsulfonylphenyl, in the manner set forth in Scheme IX. Compounds of Formula I wherein R 3 is alkylsulfonylphenyl, may be treated in three steps to obtain other compounds of Formula I, wherein R 3 is benzenesulfonamide, in the manner set forth in Scheme X. In Step 1, the alkylsulfone is treated at 70 C. with n-butyllithium. In step 2, tri-n-butyl borane in THF is added and refluxed overnight. After cooling to room temperature, water, sodium acetate and hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid are added to form the sulfonamide. Synthetic Scheme XI shows the two step preparation of 3,4-disubstituted heterocyclic antiinflammatory agents 11 from 1,2-dibromo-thiophene 29 and the available bromides 28 and 31. In step one, halogen-metal interchange of 28 with n-butyllithium in THF at 78 C. gives the 3-lithiocompounds which subsequently react with zinc chloride to give the corresponding zinc reagents. Negishi coupling Negishi et al, J. Org. Chem., 42, 1821 (1977) of the zinc reagents with 29 gives the monocoupled thiophene bromides 30. In step two, this process is repeated with bromides 31 to yield the 3,4-disubstituted heterocyclic antiinflammatory agents 11. Synthetic Scheme XII shows the two step procedure for the preparation of 3,4-disubstituted heterocyclic antiinflammatory agents 11 from monocoupled thiophene bromides 30 (prepared in Synthetic Scheme XI) and substituted boronic acids 33 using a sequential coupling procedure which is similar to the coupling procedure developed by Suzuki, et al., Syn. Commun., 11, 513 (1981). In step one, haloggen-metal interchange of the bromides 31 in THF at 78 C. generates the corresponding organolithium reagents which are reacted with trimethyl borate. Hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid provides the substituted boronic acids 33. In step two, the monocoupled bromides 30 (prepared in Synthetic Scheme XI) are coupled in toluene at reflux in the presence of Pd catalyst, e.g., tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0), and 2M sodium carbonate, with 33 to give the 3,4-disubstituted heterocyclic antiinflammatory agents 11 of this invention. Alternatively, the heterocycles of the present invention, where Y is sulfur and R 3 is 4-methylsulfonyl, nay be prepared essentially as the McMurray synthesis, as shown in Scheme XIII. In Step 1, thioanisole 34 is acetylated with chloroacetyl 35 in the presence of AlCl 3 to form the haloacetophenone 36. In Step 2, the thioacetylketone 38 is prepared by the treatment of ketone 37 with potassium thioacetate in ethanol. In Step 3, intermediates 36 and 38 are coupled to form the dione 39 in the presence of ammonium hydroxide. In Step 4, diol 40 is formed through the treatment of dione 39 with TiCl 4 and zinc dust. Thiophene 41 is formed in Step 5 by refluxing diol 40 with p-toluenesulfonic acid in toluene. The antiinflammatory (4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophenes 42 of the invention are formed through the oxidation of the alkylthiophenyl thiophene 41 with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in dichloromethane. An alternate procedure utilized in the present invention is essentially analagous to that outlined by H. Wynberg and H. J. Kooreman, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 87, 1739 (1985).

Approximately 5 ml of the 4-bromo-1-fluorobenzene solution was added to the reaction flask, and an immediate exotherm of 2 C. was observed. The remaining 4-bromo-1-fluorobenzene solution was added over ca. 0.75 hour. During the addition, the exotherm produced warmed the reaction to reflux. Upon complete addition, the reaction was stirred without temperature control for ca. 0.75 hour then cooled to 11 C. The addition funnel was charged with 1-(4-thiomethylphenyl)-1-(trimethylsiloxy-acetophenone (61.05 G, 0.242 mol) dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (200 ml).

BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION Rat Carrageenan Foot Pad Edema Test The carrageenan foot edema test was performed with materials, reagents and procedures essentially as described by Winter, et al., ( Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med ., 111, 544 (1962) Male Sprague-Dawlev rats were selected in each group so that the average body weight was as close as possible. Rats were fasted with free access to water for over sixteen hours prior to the test. The rats were dosed orally (1 mL) with compounds suspended in vehicle containing 0.5% methylcellulose and 0.025% surfactant, or with vehicle alone. one hour later a subplantar injection of 0.1 mL of 1% solution of carrageenan/sterile 0.9% saline was administered and the volume of the injected foot was measured with a displacement plethysmometer connected to a pressure transducer with a digital indicator. Three hours after the injection of the carrageenan, the volume of the foot was again measured. The average foot swelling in a group of drug-treated animals was compared with that of a group of placebo-treated animals and the percentage inhibition of edema was determined (Otterness and Bliven, Laboratory Models for Testing NSAIDs, in Non - steroidal Anti - Inflammatory Drugs , (J. Lombardino, ed. 1985)). Results are shown in Table I. Rat Carrageenan-induced Analgesia Test The analgesia test using rat carrageenan was performed with materials, reagents and procedures essentially as described by Hargreaves, et al., ( Pain , 32, 77 (1988)). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated as previously described, for the Carrageenan Foot Pad Edema test. Three hours after the injection of the carrageenan, the rats were placed in a special plexiglass container with a transparent floor having a high intensity lamp as a radiant heat source, positionable under the floor. After an initial twenty minute period, thermal stimulation was begun on either the injected foot or on the contralateral uninjected foot. A. photoelectric cell turned off the lamp and timer when light was interrupted by paw withdrawal. The time until the rat withdraws its foot was then measured. The withdrawal latency in seconds was determined for the control and drug-treated groups, and percent inhibition of the hyperalgesic foot withdrawal determined. Results are shown in Table I.

Preparation of recombinant COX baculoviruses A 2.0 kb fragment containing the coding region of either human or murine COX-I or human or murine COX-II was cloned into a BamH 1 site of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 to generate the baculovirus transfer vector. Recombinant baculoviruses were isolated by transfecting 4 g of baculovirus transfer vector DNA into SF9 cells (210e8) along with 200 ng of linearized baculovirus plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate method. Recombinant viruses were purified by three rounds of plaque purification and high titer (10E7-10E8 pfu/ml) stocks of virus were prepared. For large scale production, SF9 insect cells were infected in 10 liter fermentors (Bioprocess group) 0.510 6 /ml) with the recombinant baculovirus stock such that the multiplicity of infection was 0.1. After 72 hours the cells were centrifuged and the cell pellet homogenized in Tris/Sucrose (50 mM: 25%, pH 8.0) containing 1% CHAPS. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000G for 30 minutes, and the resultant supernatant was stored at 80 C. before being assayed for COX activity. b. Assay for COX I and COX II activity: COX activity was assayed as PGE 2 formed/g protein/time using an ELISA to detect the prostaglandin released.

These agents can be administered by any conventional means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals, either as individual therapeutic agents or in a combination of therapeutic agents. The agents can be administered alone, but are generally administered with a pharmaceutical carrier select on the basis of the chosen route of administration, preferably oral, and standard pharmaceutical practice. The amount of therapeutically active compound that is administered and the dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with the compounds and/or compositions of this invention depends on a variety of factors, including the age, weight, sex and medical condition of the subject, the severity of the disease, the route and frequency of administration, and the particular compound employed, and thus may vary widely. The pharmaceutical compositions may contain active ingredient in the range of about 0.1 to 2000 mg, preferably in the range of about 0.5 to 500 mg and most preferably between about 1 and 100 mg. A daily dose of about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg body weight, preferably between about 0.1 and about 50 mg/kg body weight and most preferably from about 1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, may be appropriate. The daily dose can be administered in one to four doses per day. The compounds of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, rectally, or topically in dosage unit formulations containing conventional nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles as desired. Topical administration may also involve the use of transdermal administration such as transdermal patches or iontophoresis devices. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection, or infusion techniques. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or setting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringers solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. Solid dosage forms for oral administration may include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids, cellulose alkyl esters, talc, stearic acid, magnesium oxide, sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulfuric acids, gelatin, acacia gum, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or polyvinyl alcohol, and then tableted or encapsulated for convenient administration. Such capsules or tablets may contain a controlled-release formulation as may be provided in a dispersion of active compound in hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as in normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration may include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Such compositions may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers encompass all the foregoing and the like. While the compounds of the invention can be administered as the sole active pharmaceutical agent, they can also be used in combination with one or more immunomodulators, antiviral agents or other antiinfective agents. For example, the compounds of the invention can be administered in combination with antihistamines or with other such agents known heretofore to be effective in combination with antiinflammatory agents. When administered as a combination, the therapeutic agents can be formulated as separate compositions which are given at the same time or different times, or the therapeutic agents can be given as a single composition. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of, for example, a tablet, capsule, suspension or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active ingredient. Examples of such dosage units are tablets or capsules.

The present invention also provides a process for preparing compounds of formula (I) which process comprises: (a) reacting a compound of formula (II): wherein R 1 and q are as hereinbefore defined; with a compound of formula (III): wherein R 2 and X are as hereinbefore defined; (b) reaction of a compound of formula (IV): wherein R 1 and R 2 are as hereinbefore defined; with a compound of formula (V): XCOLFormula (V) wherein X is as hereinbefore defined and L is a halogen atom or the residue of an activated ester; (c) to prepare a compound of formula (I) wherein R 1 is Ar 3 Z and Z is a bond, reacting a compound of formula (VI): wherein R 1a represents a group W wherein W is a halogen atom or a trifluoromethylsulphonyloxy group, or W is a group M selected from a boron derivative e.g. a boronic acid function B(OH) 2 or a metal function such as trialkylstannyl e.g. SnBu 3 , zinc halide or magnesium halide; with a compound Ar 3 W 1 , wherein W 1 is a halogen atom or a trifluoromethylsulphonyloxy group when W is a group M or W 1 is a group M when W is a halogen atom or a trifluoromethylsulphonyloxy group; (d) to prepare a compound of formula (I) wherein R 1 is Ar 3 Z and Z is O or S, reacting a compound of formula (VII): wherein R 1b represents a group ZH; with a reagent serving to introduce the group Ar 3 ; (e) to prepare a compound of formula (I) where X represents the group ArYAr 1 and Y is a bond, reaction of a compound of formula (VIII): wherein R 1 , R 2 , Ar and W are as hereinbefore defined, with a compound Ar 1 W 1 , wherein W 1 is a halogen atom or a trifluoromethylsulphonyloxy group when W is a group M, or W 1 is a group M when W is a halogen atom or a trifluoromethylsulphonyloxy group. (f) interconversion of one compound of formula (I) to a different compound of formula (I) e.g. (i) alkylation of a compound (I) wherein R 2 represents hydrogen, (ii) conversion of one R 1 from alkoxy (e.g.methoxy) to hydroxy, or (iii) conversion of R 1 from hydroxy to sulphonyloxy, eg alkylsulphonyloxy or trifluoromethanesulphonyloxy; (iv) conversion of a compound wherein Y represents S to a compound wherein Y is SO 2 or (v) conversion of Y from CO to CH 2 ; and optionally thereafter forming a salt of formula (I). Process (a) requires the presence of a reducing agent. Suitable reducing agents which may be employed include sodium borohydride, cyanoborohydride or triacetoxyborohydride under acidic conditions, or catalytic hydrogenation. The reaction may conveniently be effected in a solvent such as ethanol or dichloroethane. Process (b) may be effected by methods well known in the art for formation of an amide bond. Reaction of a compound of formula (VI) with Ar 3 W 1 , according to process (c) or a compound of formula (VIII) with Ar 1 W 1 according to process (e) may be effected in the presence of a transition metal eg palladium catalyst such as bis-triphenylphosphinepalladium dichloride or tetrakis-triphenylphosphinepalladium (0). When M represents a boronic acid function such as B(OH) 2 the reaction may be carried out under basic conditions, for example using aqueous sodium carbonate in a suitable solvent such as dioxane. When M is trialkylstannyl the reaction may be carried out in an inert solvent, such as xylene or dioxane optionally in the presence of LiCl. When M is a zinc or magnesium halide the reaction may be effected in an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. The substituent W is preferably a halogen atom such as bromine, or a sulphonyloxy group such as trifluoromethylsulphonyloxy; and W 1 is preferably a group M, such as trialkylstannyl or B(OH) 2 . In process (d) the reagent serving to introduce the group Ar 3 is preferably a compound of formula Ar 3 Hal, wherein Hal is a halogen atom. The reaction may be effected in the presence of a base, such as potassium carbonate, in a solvent such as dimethylformamide. Interconversion reactions according to process (f) may be effected using methods well known in the art. Compounds of formula (II) may be prepared by methods known in the art. Compounds of formula (III) are known or may be prepared using standard procedures. A compound of formula (IV) may be prepared by alkylation of a compound (II) by standard methods. Thus, for example a compound of formula (II) may be reacted with N-(4-bromobutylphthalimide) followed by removal of the phthalimide group to give a compound of formula (IV) where R 2 is hydrogen. Compounds where R 2 is alkyl may be prepared by subsequent reaction with the appropriate aldehyde using conditions analogous to process (a) above. Compounds of formula (VI), (VII) or (VIII) may be prepared by processes analogous to (a) or (b) described above. Compounds Ar 1 W 1 , Ar 3 W 1 and Ar 3 Hal are commercially available or may be prepared by standard methods. Compounds of formula (I) have been found to exhibit affinity for dopamine receptors, in particular the D 3 receptor, and are expected to be useful in the treatment of disease states which require modulation of such receptors, such as psychotic conditions. Compounds of formula (I) have also been found to have greater affinity for dopamine D 3 than for D 2 receptors. The therapeutic effect of currently available antipsychotic agents (neuroleptics) is generally believed to be exerted via blockade of D 2 receptors; however this mechanism is also thought to be responsible for undesirable extrapyramidal side effects (eps) associated with many neuroleptic agents. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it has been suggested that blockade of the recently characterised dopamine D 3 receptor may give rise to beneficial antipsychotic activity without significant eps. (see for example Sokoloff et al, Nature, 1990; 347: 146-151; and Schwartz et al, Clinical Neuropharmacology, Vol 16, No. 4, 295-314, 1993). Preferred compounds of the present invention are therefore those which have higher affinity for dopamine D 3 than dopamine D 2 receptors (such affinity can be measured using standard methodology for example using cloned dopamine receptors). Said compounds may advantageously be used as selective modulators of D 3 receptors. We have found that certain compounds of formula (I) are dopamine D 3 receptor antagonists, others may be agonists and partial agonists. The functional activity of compounds of the invention (i.e. whether they are antagonists, agonists or partial agonists) can be readily determined using the test method described hereinafter, which does not require undue experimentation. D 3 antagonists are of potential use as antipsychotic agents for example in the treatment of schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorders, psychotic depression, mania, paranoid and delusional disorders. Conditions which may be treated by dopamine D 3 receptor agonists include dyskinetic disorders such as Parkinsons disease, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesias; depression; anxiety, memory disorders, sexual dysfunction and drug (eg. cocaine) dependency. In a further aspect therefore the present invention provides a method of treating conditions which require modulation of dopamine D 3 receptors, for example psychoses such as schizophrenia, which comprises administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof. The invention also provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of conditions which require modulation of dopamine D 3 receptors, for example psychoses such as schizophrenia. A preferred use for D 3 antagonists according to the present invention is in the treatment of psychoses such as schizophrenia. A preferred use for D 3 agonists according to the present invention is in the treatment of dyskinetic disorders such as Parkinsons disease. For use in medicine, the compounds of the present invention are usually administered as a standard pharmaceutical composition. The present invention therefore provides in a further aspect pharmaceutical compositions comprising a novel compound of formula (I) or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof and a physiologically acceptable carrier. The compounds of formula (I) may be administered by any convenient method, for example by oral, parenteral, buccal, sublingual, nasal, rectal or transdermal administration and the pharmaceutical compositions adapted accordingly. The compounds of formula (I) and their physiologically acceptable salts which are active when given orally can be formulated as liquids or solids, for example syrups, suspensions or emulsions, tablets, capsules and lozenges. A liquid formulation will generally consist of a suspension or solution of the compound or physiologically acceptable salt in a suitable liquid carrier(s) for example an aqueous solvent such as water, ethanol or glycerine, or a non-aqueous solvent, such as polyethylene glycol or an oil. The formulation may also contain a suspending agent, preservative, flavouring or colouring agent. A composition in the form of a tablet can be prepared using any suitable pharmaceutical carrier(s) routinely used for preparing solid formulations. Examples of such carriers include magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, sucrose and cellulose. A composition in the form of a capsule can be prepared using routine encapsulation procedures. For example, pellets containing the active ingredient can be prepared using standard carriers and then filled into a hard gelatin capsule; alternatively, a dispersion or suspension can be prepared using any suitable pharmaceutical carrier(s), for example aqueous gums, celluloses, silicates or oils and the dispersion or suspension then filled into a soft gelatin capsule. Typical parenteral compositions consist of a solution or suspension of the compound or physiologically acceptable salt in a sterile aqueous carrier or parenterally acceptable oil, for example polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, lecithin, arachis oil or sesame oil. Alternatively, the solution can be lyophilised and then reconstituted with a suitable solvent just prior to administration. Compositions for nasal administration may conveniently be formulated as aerosols, drops, gels and powders. Aerosol formulations typically comprise a solution or fine suspension of the active substance in a physiologically acceptable aqueous or non-aqueous solvent and are usually presented in single or multidose quantities in sterile form in a sealed container, which can take the form of a cartridge or refill for use with an atomising device. Alternatively the sealed container may be a unitary dispensing device such as a single dose nasal inhaler or an aerosol dispenser fitted with a metering valve which is intended for disposal once the contents of the container have been exhausted. Where the dosage form comprises an aerosol dispenser, it will contain a propellant which can be a compressed gas such as compressed air or an organic propellant such as a fluoro-chlorohydrocarbon. The aerosol dosage forms can also take the form of a pump-atomiser. Compositions suitable for buccal or sublingual administration include tablets, lozenges and pastilles, wherein the active ingredient is formulated with a carrier such as sugar and acacia, tragacanth, or gelatin and glycerin. Compositions for rectal administration are conveniently in the form of suppositories containing a conventional suppository base such as cocoa butter. Compositions suitable for transdermal administration include ointments, gels and patches. Preferably the composition is in unit dose form such as a tablet, capsule or ampoule. Each dosage unit for oral administration contains preferably from 1 to 250 mg (and for parenteral administration contains preferably from 0.1 to 25 mg) of a compound of the formula (I) or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof calculated as the free base. The physiologically acceptable compounds of the invention will normally be administered in a daily dosage regimen (for an adult patient) of, for example, an oral dose of between 1 mg and 500 mg, preferably between 10 mg and 400 mg,e .g. between 10 and 250 mg or an intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular dose of between 0.1 mg and 100 mg, preferably between 0.1 mg and 50 mg, e.g. between 1 and 25 mg of the compound of the formula (I) or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof calculated as the free base, the compound being administered 1 to 4 times per day. Suitably the compounds will be administered for a period of continuous therapy, for example for a week or more. Biological Test Methods The ability of the compounds to bind selectively to human D 3 dopamine receptors can be demonstrated by measuring their binding to cloned receptors. The inhibition constants (K i ) of test compounds for displacement of 125 I iodosulpride binding to human D 3 dopamine receptors expressed in CHO cells were determined as follows. The cell lines were shown to be free from bacterial, fungal and mycoplasmal contaminants, and stocks of each were stored frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cultures were grown as monolayers or in suspension in standard cell culture media. Cells were recovered by scraping (from monolayers) or by centrifugation (from suspension cultures), and were washed two or three times by suspension in phosphate buffered saline followed by collection by centrifugation. Cell pellets were stored frozen at 40 C. Crude cell membranes were prepared by homogenisation followed by high-speed centrifugation, and characterisation of cloned receptors achieved by radioligand binding. Preparation of CHO Cell Membranes Cell pellets were gently thawed at room temperature, and resuspended in about 20 volumes of ice-cold 50 mM Tris salts (pH 7.4 37 C.), 20 mM EDTA, 0.2 M sucrose. The suspension was homogenised using an Ultra-Turrax at full speed for 15 sec. The homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000 r.p.m for 20 min at 4 C. in a Sorvall RC5C centrifuge. The membrane pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 50 mM Tris salts (pH 7.4 37 C.), using an Ultra-Turrax, and recentrifuged at 18,000 r.p.m for 15 min at 4 C. in a Sorvall RC5C. The membranes were washed two more times with ice-cold 50 mM Tris salts (pH 7.4 37 C.). The final pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris salts (pH 7.4 37 C.), and the protein content determined using bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bradford, M. M. (1976) Anal. Biochem. 72, 248-254). Binding Experiments on Cloned Dopamine Receptors Crude cell membranes were incubated with 0.1 nM 125 I iodosulpride (2000 Ci/mmol; Amersham, U. K.), and the test compound in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris salts (pH 7.4 37 C.), 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, in a total volume of 1 ml for 30 min at 37 C. Following incubation, samples were filtered using a Brandel Cell Harvester, and washed three times with ice-cold 50 mM Tris salts (pH 7.4 37 C.), 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 . The radioactivity on the filters was measured using a Cobra gamma counter (Canberra Packard). Non-specific binding was defined as the radioligand binding remaining after incubation in the presence of 100 M iodosulpride. For competition curves, 14 concentrations (half-log dilutions) of competing cold drug were used. Competition curves were analysed simultaneously whenever possible using non-linear least-squares fitting procedures, capable of fitting one, two or three site models. Compounds of Examples tested according to this method had pKi values in the range 7.0-8.5 at the human cloned dopamine D 3 receptor. Functional Activity at Cloned Dopamine Receptors The functional activity of compounds at human D2 and human D3 receptors (ie agonism or antagonism) may be determined using a Cytosensor Microphysiometer (McConnell HM et al Science 1992 257 1906-1912) In Microphysiometer experiments, cells (hD 2_CHO or hD 3_CHO) were seeded into 12 mm Transwell inserts (Costar) at 300000 cells/cup in foetal calf serum (FCS)-containing medium. The cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 C. in 5%CO 2 , before changing to FCS-free medium. After a further 16-18 h, cups were loaded into the sensor chambers of the Cytosensor Microphysiometer (Molecular Devices) and the chambers perfused with running medium (bicarbonate-free Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium containing 2 mM glutamine and 44 mM NaCl) at a flow rate of 100 ul/min. Each pump cycle lasted 90s. The pump was on for the first 60s and the acidification rate determined between 68 and 88s, using the Cytosoft programme. Agonists and antagonists were diluted in running medium. In experiments to determine agonist activity, cells were exposed (4.5 min for hD2, 7.5 min for hD3) to increasing concentrations of putative agonist at half hour intervals. Seven concentrations of agonist were used. Peak acidification rate to each agonist concentration was determined and concentration-response curves fitted using Robofit Tilford, N. S., Bowen, W. P. Baxter, G. S. Br. J. Pharmacol. (1995) in press. In experiments to determine antagonist potency, cells were treated at 30 min intervals with five pulses of a submaximal concentration of quinpirole (100 nM for hD2 cells, 30 nM for hD3 cells), before exposure to the lowest concentration of putative antagonist. At the end of the next 30 min interval, cells were pulsed again with quinpirole (in the continued presence of the antagonist) before exposure to the next highest antagonist concentration. In all, five concentrations of antagonist were used in each experiment. Peak acidification rate to each agonist concentration was determined and concentration-inhibition curves fitted using Robofit.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising benzoquinoline derivatives and methods for using benzoquinoline derivatives as antibacterial agents. The invention also relates to novel benzoquinoline derivatives, their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to methods of using them to alleviate bacterial infections. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION New classes of antibacterial agents are needed to address both the growing resistance of bacteria to present therapies and the general lack of efficacy of existing antibiotics against slow-growing organisms. Although bacterial infections were once considered well controlled, the threat posed by the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms is now well accepted. Desirable characteristics for new antibacterial products include activity against drug resistant organisms, reduced propensity for resistance development, greater biological half-life in humans, reduced liability for allergic reactions, and broad spectrum antibacterial activity.

Useful compounds may be identified by their ability to bind to and/or inhibit the enzymatic activity of, RNA polymerase from any microbial source, preferably bacterial. Compounds that exhibit RNA polymerase inhibitory activity in vitro can then be tested for in vivo antimicrobial activity. Alternatively, the antimicrobial activity of a compound may be tested directly. A general procedure for the preparation of N-substituted benzogquinolin-4-amines of structure (4) is described herein. Substituted 2,3-dihydrobenzogquinolin 4 (1H)-ones (1) (Bekhli and Kozyreva Khim. Geteotsikl. Soedin 1996, 296) are first oxidized to the corresponding benzogquinolin-4-ols (2). It is preferred that the oxidant be chosen from a group consisting of 2,3 dichloro-5,6 dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ) or manganese (IV) oxide. The resultant phenols are then converted into their corresponding 4-halobenzogquinolines (3a,3b) utilizing reagents chosen from a group consisting of phosphorous pentabromide, phosphorous tribromide, and phosphorous oxychloride in the presence of a base chosen from a group consisting of tertiary amine bases, preferably N,N-dimethyl aniline and alkali bases preferably potassium carbonate. Alternatively, substituted 4-triflouromethanesulfonylbenzogquinolines (3c) can be synthesized from their corresponding phenols utilizing triflouromethane sulfonic anhydride in the presence of a tertiary amine base, preferably pyridine. Substituted 4-halobenzogquinolines (3a,3b) (Wagaw and Buchwald J. Org. Chem. 1996, 7240. Wolfe, Wagaw and Buchwald J Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 7215. Louie, Hartwig Tetrahedron Lett. 1995, 3609. Driver, Hartwig J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996, 7217. Wolfe, Rennels, and Buchwaid Tetrahedron 1996, 7525. Wolfe and Buchwald J.Am. Chem.

Chem. 1997, 1264) may be agitated at the 4-position with a group consisting of primary and secondary amines in the presence of a metal complex catalyst, where the metal species is chosen from a group consisting of nickel, palladium, and platinum, to afford the desired N-substituted benzogquinolin-4-amines (4). DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS The following is a chemical process for the efficient production of substituted benzogquinolin-4-amines (4) which are useful as antibacterial agents. A. Production of Benzogquinolin-4-ols (2) From the Oxidation of 2.3 Dihydrobenzogquinolin-4-(1H)-ones (1). 2,3 dihydrobenzogquinolin-4-(1H)-one (5) is dissolved in an aromatic solvent, preferably toluene, under a nitrogen atmosphere. To this solution is added DDQ (at least 1 equivalent but preferably 1.3 equivalents). The reaction mixture is then heated to reflux for a period of approximately 1-3 hr, after which time the mixture is cooled to room temperature and concentrated to a residue in vacuo. The residue is then applied directly to a silica gel column using methanol/methylene chloride preferably in a 1:9 ratio as eluent, to afford crude benzogquinolin-4-ol which was used without further purification. Alternatively, the oxidation may be carried out in the following manner: 2,3-dihydrobenzogquinolin-4-(1H)-one (1) is dissolved in an ethereal solvent, preferably tetrahydrofuran, under a nitrogen atmosphere. To this solution is then added manganese (IV) oxide (between 1 and 10 equivalents but preferably 8 equivalents). The reaction mixture is then heated for a period of approximately 1-3 hr, after which time the reaction mixture is filtered through diatomaceous earth and the filter cake washed with methanol/methylene chloride preferably in a 5:95 ratio. The filtrates were then reduced in vacuo to afford crude benzog-quinolin-4-ol (6) which was used without further purification. B. Production of 4-Bromo (7a), Chloro (7b), Triflouromethanesulfonic (7c)-BenzogQuinolines from BenzogQuinolin-4-ol (6). 4-Bromination and 4-chlorination of benzogquinolin-4-ol (6) may be accomplished in the following manner. Crude benzogquinolin-4-ol (6) was dissolved in acetonitrile and cooled to a temperature of approximately 0 C. under a nitrogen atmosphere. A tertiary amine base, preferably N,N-dimethylaniline (between 1-5 equivalents but preferably 5 equivalents) is then added to the solution. Alternatively an alkali base, preferably potassium carbonate (between 1-5 equivalents but preferably 5 equivalents) may be employed. In either case, the halogenation agent is chosen from a group consisting of phosphorous oxychloride, phosphorous tribromide, phosphorous pentabromide (between 1-2 equivalents but preferably 1.5 equivalents) is added to the cooled solution. The solution is then heated to reflux for a period of 2-6 hr, the mixtures then cooled to room temperature , slowly poured onto an ice water slurry and extracted with methylene chloride three times. The organic layers are combined, washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to a residue. The residue is then applied to a silica gel column and eluted with hexane/ethyl acetate (9:1 then 8:2 then 7:3) to afford 4-halobenzogquinoline (7a, 7b). Alternatively, 4-triflouromethanesulfonic benzogquinolines (7c) may be synthesized and used in an equivalent fashion to the 4-halobenzogquinoline derivatives in the ultimate step in the synthesis. Benzogquinolin4-ol (6) is dissolved in methylene chloride under a nitrogen atmosphere and cooled to a temperature of less than 0 C. To this is added a tertiary amine base, preferably triethyl amine (between 1 and 2 equivalents but preferably 1.5 equivalents) followed by the addition of triflouromethanesulfonic anhydride (between 1 and 2 equivalents but preferably 1.2 equivalents). The mixture is then stirred and allowed to warm to room temperature and allowed to stir for 1-4 hr. The reaction mixture is then quenched with water and the organic phase removed and the aqueous phase washed with two portions of methylene chloride. The combined organic layers are washed with water, saturated sodium bicarbonate, water, and finally brine. The organic phase is then dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo and used crude immediately in the next step. C. Coupling of 4-Halo (7a,7b) and 4-Triflourosulfonic (7c) BenzogQuinoline Derivatives and Primary and Secondary Amines Utilizing Metal Complex Catalyst. From a group consisting of substituted 4-bromo (7a), 4-chloro (7b), and 4-triflouromethanesulfonic (7c) benzogquinoline and a selected primary, secondary amine (at least 1.0 equivalents but preferably 1.2 equivalents) is dissolved in an aromatic solvent, preferably toluene. To this is added a metal complex catalyst with the metal chosen from a group consisting of nickel, palladium, and platinum in this instance tris (dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium (Pd 2 (dbba) 3 ) (at least a catalytic amount 0.02 equivalent) and bis (diphenylphosphino)-ferrocene (DPPF) (at least a catalytic amount 0.04 equivalent) and an alkali alkoxide preferably sodium t-butoxide (at least 1.0 equivalent but preferably 1.4 equivalent). The mixture is then refluxed under a nitrogen atmosphere for a period of 1-3 hr. After which time the mixture is cooled to room temperature and concentrated in vacuo to a residue and applied to a silica gel column using hexane/EtOAc/TEA as eluent (50:50:2 then 60:40:2) to afford N-substituted benzogquinolin 4-amines (4). The following syntheses are for exemplary compounds of the invention: EXAMPLE 1 For the preparation of N-4-(1-piperidinyl)phenylbenzogquinolin-4-amine (8) from the aryl bromide 7a. Step 1. To 1 g of 2,3-Dihydrobenzogquinolin-4(1H)-one (5) (5.07 mmol) in 20 mL of toluene (0.25 M) under a nitrogen atmosphere was added 1.5 g of 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ, 1.3 equivalents). The reaction mixture was heated to reflux and monitored by TLC until completion (approximately 2 h). After cooling to rt, the mixture was concentrated in vacuo then filtered through a silica plug using 10% methanol in methylene chloride to afford crude phenol (6). Subsequently, the crude phenol was directly subjected to the halogenation conditions of step 2. Step 2.

Upon cooling to rt, the mixture was slowly poured onto ice water and extracted with methylene chloride three times. The organic layers were combined, washed with brine, dried with magnesium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo. Flash chromatography (gradient: 9:1 to 8:2 to 7:3 hexanes:EtOAc) afforded 736 mg of clean 4-bromobenzogquinoline (7a) in 55% yield for the 2 steps.

To 500 mg of 2,3-Dihydrobenzogquinolin-4(IH)-one (1, 2.53 mmol) in 25 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (0.25 M) under a nitrogen atmosphere was added 1.76 g manganese(IV) oxide (8 equivalents). The reaction mixture was heated to reflux and monitored by TLC until completion. The crude reaction mixture was filtered through a celite plug using 5% methanol in methylene chloride to afford 445 mg of relatively clean benzogquinolin-4-ol (6) in 90% yield. Subsequently, the phenol was directly subjected to the halogenation conditions without further purification. Step 2. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, benzogquinolin-4-ol (6) (100 mg, 0.51 mmol) was refluxed in 2 ml of phosphorus oxychloride (0.25 M) in the presence of N,N-dimethylaniline (0.25 mL, 3.8 equivalents) until deemed complete by TLC. Removal of the excess phosphorus oxycloride in vacuo and flash chromatography (gradient: 9:1 to 8:2 to 7:3 hexanes:EtOAc) afforded 108 mg of clean 4-chlorobenzogquinoline (7b) in quantitative yield. Step 3. 4-Chlorobenzogquinoline (7b) (50 mg, 0.23 mmol), 4-(1-piperidino) aniline (50 mg, 1.2 equivalents), bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel(O) (Ni(COD) 2 1.5 mg, 0.02 equivalents), 1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (DPPF, 5 mg, 0.04 equivalents) and sodium t-butoxide (31 mg, 1.4 equiv) in 2.5 mL of dry toluene were refluxed under a 5 nitrogen atmosphere until observed complete by TLC.

The mixture was stirred while allowing to warm to rt and continued until complete by TLC (about 1.5 hr). The reaction mixture was quenched with water and extracted twice with methylene chloride. The combined organic layers were washed with water, saturated sodium bicarbonate, water, then brine.

Identification of RNA polymerase inhibitors The compounds useful for inclusion in the pharmaceutical formulations of the invention can be identified by their ability to bind to, and/or inhibit the activity of, one or more bacterial RNA polymerases. RNA polymerase as used herein refers to DNA-dependent RNA polymerase holoenzyme, which is a complex consisting of five protein subunits: two copies of the a subunit and one copy each of the , , and subunits. The , and subunits are invariant in a given bacterial species and together form core RNA polymerase. a. Binding assays The ability of a candidate antimicrobial compound to bind to RNA polymerase can be measured using any method known in the art. Typically, purified RNA polymerase holoenzyme, or individual subunits thereof, are contacted with a plurality of compounds, and binding is monitored. Useful methods for measuring binding include without limitation those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,585,277 and 5,679,582. b. Functional assays RNA polymerase inhibition activity of a compound can be detected by including the compound in an in vitro transcription reaction and comparing the level of transcription that occurs in the presence and absence of the compound. A typical transcription reaction (50 l) contains transcription buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT and 1.5 M BSA); 1 g of DNA template; 4 M UTP containing 5 Ci of - 32 P UTP; 400 M each of ATP, GTP, and CTP; and RNA polymerase. After incubation for 60 minutes at 25 C., the reaction is terminated with 100 l 10% TCA, which also precipitates the newly transcribed RNA, and incorporation of radioactivity into RNA is quantified. The IC 50 (expressed in g/ml) is the concentration of a compound that inhibits RNA polymerase activity by 50%. Candidate antimicrobial compounds are identified as those that cause a detectable inhibition of RNA polymerase activity (i.e., exhibit an IC 50 of less than about 16 g/ml). Measurement of Antimicrobial Activity The antimicrobial activity of a compound or formulation according to the invention is determined by exposing a culture comprising a bacterial species to different concentrations of the compound or formulation and monitoring the effects on growth relative to a control culture not exposed to the compound. Any method known in the art may be used to assess bacterial growth. Antimicrobial effects are expressed as Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC). a. MIC The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) is defined as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that completely inhibits growth of the organism in the microliter plate. The MIC is expressed as a range between the concentration at which no growth is observed and the concentration of the dilution which immediately follows. Typically, MIC is measured using a broth microdilution assay as follows. Dilution of candidate antimicrobial compounds in culture medium is performed in a sterile, covered 96-well microtiter plate with flat bottom wells (Costar 9017). The final concentrations of the compounds are typically 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.12, 1.56, 0.78, 0.39, 0.20, 0.10, and 0.05 g/mL, respectively. Culture medium only (containing no bacteria) is also included as a negative control for each plate. Ampicillin and rifamnpin are used as positive controls against all bacterial strains in every experiment. The overnight culture of a single colony is diluted in sterile medium so that, after inoculation, each well contains approximately 510 5 CFU/mL. Within 15 minutes of preparation, 50 mL of the adjusted inoculum suspension is added to the microliter plate. Each well is diluted with an equal volume of the antimicrobial compounds or control solution. The inoculated microtiter plate is typically incubated at 35 C. for 16-20 hours. The turbidity of each well is determined by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm using a BioRad Model 3550-UV microplate reader. Antimicrobial compounds are those that exhibit an MIC of less than 16 g/mL. b. MBC The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) is defined as the concentration of antimicrobial agent from which no colonies grow on petri plates or in the medium. In practice, the MBC is arbitrarily defmed as the concentration at which a 1000-fold reduction in colony forming units is observed with respect to the original inoculum (survival of 0.1%). Typically, the wells from a MIC microliter plate using a 96-well inoculation grid into a fresh microliter plate containing 100 L Mueller-Hinton broth per well. The MBC plates are incubated at 37 C. for 16-20 hrs and the MBC values are determined. Antimicrobial compounds are those that exhibit an MBC of less than 16 g/mL Specificity determinations It will be understood that useful antimicrobial compositions and formulations act selectively on microbial pathogens. In vitro and/or in vivo criteria may be used to determine specificity. That is, the inhibitory activity of a particular compound towards an animal RNA polymerase may be measured in parallel with a bacterial RNA polymerase. Preferably, antimicrobial compounds exhibit an IC 50 for mammalian, e.g., human, RNA Polymerase II that is at least ten-fold higher (i.e., less effective) than that for a bacterial RNA polymerase. Furthermore, the effect of the compositions on animal cells is measured. Cytotoxicity (TD 50 ) is expressed as the concentration at which 50% of the cells are dead. Preferably, antimicrobial compounds according to the invention exhibit a TD 50 of less than about 5. Methods for Preventing and Treating Microbial Infections The present invention provides methods for inhibiting the replication of microorganisms, which comprise contacting a microorganism with an amount of an benzoquinoline derivative sufficient to inhibit its growth. The invention also provides methods for preventing or treating microbial infection in an animal, which comprise administering to an animal in need of antimicrobial treatment an antimicrobial-effective amount of a composition or formulation comprising a benzoquinoline derivative disclosed herein. As used herein, the term treatment with regard to a microbial infection includes preventing, retarding, and/or reducing a disease, pathological condition or one or more symptoms thereof, in animals, particularly mammals, and most particularly humans. An antimicrobial effective amount is an amount that results in any improvement in one or more clinical or histological symptoms or diagnostic markers observed by a medical practitioner or determined by quantitative or semiquantitative techniques. Non-limiting examples of appropriate techniques include without limitation analysis of blood and urine. Any suitable assay may be used for determining antimicrobial effective amounts without undue experimentation, taking into account the route of administration and the age, sex, weight, species and condition of the particular patient. Usually, a daily dosage of active ingredient can be from about 0.5 to about 100 mg per kg of body weight, preferably from about 5 to about 50 mg per kg per day and most preferably from about 10 to about 25 mg per kg per day. The total dosage may be administered in multiple doses or in a sustained release form. The dosages may be increased when treating severe or life-threatening infections. In practicing the methods of the invention, benzoquinoline derivatives can be administered by any means that produces contact of the active agent with bacteria in the body of an animal, including. They can be administered by any conventional means, including without limitation oral, mucosal, intranasal, parenteral, topical, subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, and intravenous routes. The compounds and formulations of the present invention may be used for prevention and treatment of a wide variety of bacterial infections, including without limitation diseases of the skin, e.g., endocarditis, acne and skin ulcers; gastroenteritis; colitis; meningitis; keratinitis; conjunctivitis; diseases of the urinary and genital tracts, e.g., syphillis and gonorrhea; breast disease (mastitis); osteomyelitis; otitis; as well as diseases of the lungs, e.g. pneumonia and tuberculosis. The compounds are generally active in treating diseases caused by Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, the compounds are valuable for sterilizing the gut in the course of surgery. Pharmaceutical Formulations The present invention provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising the benzoquinoline derivatives disclosed herein in conjunction with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The formulations of the present invention can be solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups, elixirs, capsules, tablets, and the like. The compositions may contain a suitable carrier, diluent, or excipient, such as sterile water, physiological saline, glucose, or the like. Moreover, the formulations can also be lyophilized, and/or may contain auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, adjuvants, gelling or viscosity enhancing additives, preservatives, flavoring agents, colors, and the like, depending upon the route of administration and the preparation desired Standard texts, such as Remingtons Pharmaceutical Science, 17th Ed., 1985, incorporated herein by reference, may be consulted to prepare suitable preparations, without undue experimentation. The formulations can include powdered carriers, such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol, starch, cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like. Further, tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of hours. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric coated for selective disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract. The formulations can also contain coloring and flavoring to enhance patient acceptance. In general, water, a suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose (glucose), and related sugar solutions and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions. Solutions for parenteral administration contain preferably a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing agents, and, if necessary, buffer substances. Antioxidants such as, for example, sodium bisulfate, sodium sulfite, citric acid and its salts, sodium EDTA, ascorbic acid, and the like can be used either alone or in combination with other suitable antioxidants or stabilizing agents typically employed in the pharmaceutical compositions. In addition, parenteral solutions can contain preservatives, such as, for example, benzalkonium chloride, methyl- or propyl-paraben, chlorobutanol and the like. The formulations can also include any of disintegrants, lubricants, plasticizers, colorants, and dosing vehicles. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, A. Osol, a standard reference text in this field. In order for a composition to be administered to an animal or human, and for any particular method of administration, it is preferred to determine the toxicity, such as by determining the MIC and MBC (see above) in a suitable animal model, e.g., a mouse; the dosage of the composition(s), and the concentration of components in the composition; and the timing of administration in order to maximize the antimicrobial response. Such factors can be determined without undue experimentation by such methods as titrations and analysis of sera for antibodies or antigens, e.g., by ELISA and/or EFFIT analysis. Such determinations do not require undue experimentation from the knowledge of the skilled artisan, the present disclosure and the documents cited herein. Suitable formulations typically contain from about 1 to about 1000 mg of active ingredient per dosage unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions, the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.5 to about 95%, by weight, based on the total weight of the composition. EXAMPLE 4 Biological Activity of Benzoquinolines The following experiments were performed to evaluate the biological activity of the benzoquinoline compounds disclosed herein. a. In vitro: The compounds of the invention were included at a range of concentrations in in vitro transcription reactions containing purified RNA polymerase derived from either S. aureus, E. coli, or human, and template DNA comprising a pTaq promoter. The reaction conditions and analytical method are described above. The concentration of each compound that inhibited RNA polymerase activity by 50%, i.e., the IC 50 ,is shown in Table 1. The results indicated that each of the compounds selectively inhibited bacterial RNA polymerase relative to human RNA polymerase; in all cases, S. aureus RNA polymerase was the most sensitive to the inhibitory effects of the compounds. Compound N-4-(1-piperidinyl)phenylbenzogquinolin-4-amine exhibited the highest degree of selectivity for bacterial RNA polymerases. b. In vivo: The antimicrobial activities of the compounds of the invention, expressed as MIC and MBC, were determined as described above, using as tester strains wild-type S. aureus, rifampicin-resistant S. aureus, wild-type E. coli, and E. coli cells that had been permeabilized. Compound N-4-(1-piperidinyl)phenylbenzogquinolin-4-amine exhibited the most potent antimicrobial activity against s. aureus but was less effective against E. coli.

FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to novel compounds which are useful, for example, in the prevention of cerebral insufficiency, to enhance receptor functioning in synapses in those brain networks responsible for higher order behaviors, and the like. In a particular aspect, the invention relates to methods for the use of the compounds disclosed herein, and to methods for the preparation thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Excitatory synaptic currents at many (probably most) sites in telencephalon (cortex, limbic system, striatum; about 90% of human brain) and cerebellum occur when the transmitter glutamate is released by input axons onto what are usually referred to as the -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA), or AMPA/quisqualate, receptors. Drugs that enhance these receptor currents will facilitate communication in brain networks responsible for perceptual-motor integration and higher order behaviors. It is also known from the literature (see Arai and Lynch in Brain Research, in press) that such drugs will promote the formation of long-term potentiation, a physiological effect widely held to encode memory. For example, Ito et al., J. Physiol. Vol. 424:533-543 (1990), discovered that aniracetam, N-anisoyl-2-pyrrolidinone, enhances AMPA receptor mediated currents without affecting currents generated by other classes of receptors. Unfortunately, however, the drug is effective only at high concentrations (1.0 mM) applied directly to the brain. The low potency, limited solubility, and peripheral metabolism of aniracetam limit its utility as an experimental tool and its potential value as a therapeutic. There is a need, therefore, for the design and synthesis of new drugs that are more potent, more soluble and less readily metabolized than aniracetam. Such compounds would provide new tools for manipulating the properties of the AMPA receptor and would be a major step towards a drug that could enhance AMPA receptor function in the brain after peripheral administration. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION We have discovered novel compounds that are several times more potent than aniracetam in enhancing synaptic responses (i.e, they produce larger effects than aniracetam at lower concentrations). The invention compounds increase the strength of long-term potentiation and increase synaptic responses in the brain following peripheral administration. Invention compounds can be used, for example, to facilitate behaviors dependent upon AMPA receptor, as therapeutics in conditions in which receptors or synapses utilizing them are reduced in numbers, and the like. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES FIG. 1 shows that Invention Compound I (1-(1,4-benzodioxan-5-ylcarbonyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; alternatively referred to as N-(3,4-ethylenedioxy)benzoyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) increases the amplitude and duration (measured as half-width) of synaptic responses in the field CA1 in in vitro slices prepared from rat hippocampus. These responses are known to be mediated by AMPA receptors Muller et al., Science Vol. 242: 1694-1697 (1988). Note that Invention Compound I at 750 M has a much larger effect than does aniracetam at twice the concentration (1500 M). Note also that the effects occur quickly after infusion (horizontal bar) and reverse upon washout. FIG. 2 compares the effects of three invention compounds; i.e., Invention Compound I (i.e., 1-(1,4-benzodioxan-5-ylcarbonyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), Invention Compound II (i.e., 1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylcarbonyl)-piperidine); alternatively referred to as (N-(3,4-methylenedioxybenzoyl)piperidine, and Invention Compound III (i.e., 1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylcarbonyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; alternatively referred to as N-(3,4-methylenedioxybenzoyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) with aniracetam across a range of dosages on two response size measures. The invention compounds are seen to be more potent than aniracetam; e.g., at 750 M, Invention Compound I produces a nine-fold greater increase in the response area than does aniracetam. FIG. 3 shows that Invention Compound I increases the magnitude of long-term potentiation (induced by a standard physiological induction paradigm) over that obtained in the absence of the compound. FIG. 4 shows that Invention Compound I slows the decay rate of synaptic responses (a measure of the response duration) recorded in the hippocampal field CA1 of intact rats following peripheral administration of the compound. Data for eight rats injected intraperitoneally with Invention Compound I are compared with results from seven rats injected with the carrier vehicle. FIG. 5 shows the distribution measured by PET scan of 11 C-labelled Invention Compound II in an appropriate carrier in a 200 gram rat after ip injection. Brain uptake is observed to plateau in 5-10 minutes at a distribution approximately one-quarter that of liver, two-thirds that of heart, and approximately equal to that of the head excluding the cranial cavity. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Release of glutamate at synapses at many sites in mammalian forebrain stimulates two classes of postsynaptic receptors usually referred to as AMPA/quisqualate and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. The first of these mediates a voltage independent fast excitatory post-synaptic current (the fast epsc) while the NMDA receptor generates a voltage dependent, slow excitatory current. Studies carried out in slices of hippocampus or cortex indicate that the AMPA receptor-mediated fast epsc is by far the dominant component at most glutaminergic synapses under most circumstances. AMPA receptors are not evenly distributed across the brain but instead are largely restricted to telencephalon and cerebellum. They are found in high concentrations in the superficial layers of neocortex, in each of the major synaptic zones of hippocampus, and in the striatal complex see, for example, Monaghan et al., in Brain Research 324:160-164 (1984). Studies in animals and humans indicate that these structures organize complex perceptual-motor processes and provide the substrates for higher-order behaviors. Thus, AMPA receptors mediate transmission in those brain networks responsible for a host of cognitive activities. For the reasons set forth above, drugs that enhance the functioning of the AMPA receptor could have significant benefits for intellectual performance. Such drugs should also facilitate memory encoding. Experimental studies see, for example, Arai and Lynch, Brain Research, in press indicate that increasing the size of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic response(s) enhances the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP is a stable increase in the strength of synaptic contacts that follows repetitive physiological activity of a type known to occur in the brain during learning. There is a considerable body of evidence showing that LTP is the substrate of memory; for example, compounds that block LTP interfere with memory formation in animals, and certain drugs that disrupt learning in humans antagonize the stabilization of LTP see, for example, del Cerro and Lynch, Neuroscience 49:1-6 (1992). Recently, Ito et al. (1990) supra, uncovered a possible prototype for a compound that selectively facilitates the AMPA receptor. These authors found that the nootropic drug aniracetam (N-anisoyl-2-pyrrolidinone) increases currents mediated by brain AMPA receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes without affecting responses by y-amino-butyric acid (GABA), kainic acid (KA), or NMDA receptors. Infusion of aniracetam into slices of hippocampus was also shown to substantially increase the size of fast synaptic potentials without altering resting membrane properties. It has since been confirmed that aniracetam enhances synaptic responses at several sites in hippocampus, and that it has no effects on NMDA-receptor mediated potentials see, for example, Staubli et al., in Psychobiology 18:377-381 (1990) and Xiao et al., in Hippocampus 1:373-380 (1991). Aniracetam has also been found to have an extremely rapid onset and washout, and can be applied repeatedly with no apparent lasting effects; these are valuable traits for behaviorally-relevant drugs. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory of action, it is presently believed to be likely that the major effect of aniracetam is to slow the unusually rapid rate at which AMPA receptors desensitize. The compound also greatly prolongs synaptic responses. This would be expected if it increased the mean open time of AMPA receptor channels by delaying desensitization. Indeed, it has been found that aniracetam prolongs the open time of AMPA receptor responses and blocks their desensitization in membrane patches excised from hippocampal neurons in culture; the magnitude of the effect corresponds closely to the increase in the duration of synaptic responses (recorded in culture or slices) produced by the drug Tang et al., Science 254: 288-290 (1991). Aniracetam may also produce other changes in receptor properties; it causes a small but reliable decrease in the binding of agonists (but not antagonists) to the receptor Xiao et al., 1991, supra and may also slightly enhance the conductance of the receptor channel Tang et al. supra. Aniracetam is classified as a nootropic drug. Nootropics are proposed to be cognitive enhancers see Frstl and Maitre, Pharmacopsychiatry Vol. 22:54-100 (Supplement) (1989) but their efficacy in this regard is highly controversial. Several nootropics have been tested in slices see, for example, Olpe et al., Life Sci. Vol. 31:1947-1953 (1982); Olpe et al., Europ. J. Pharmacol. Vol. 80:415-419 (1982); Xiao et al., 1991, supra and only aniracetam and its near relative (R)-1-p-anisoyl-3-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone (AHP) facilitate AMPA receptor mediated responses. Hence, whatever effects the nootropics might have are not mediated by facilitation of fast epsc. It is also the case that peripheral administration of aniracetam is not likely to influence brain receptors. The drug works only at high concentrations (1.0 mM) and about 80% of it is converted to anisoyl-GABA following peripheral administration in humans Guenzi and Zanetti, J. Chromatogr. Vol. 530:397-406 (1990). The metabolite, anisoyl-GABA, has been found to have no aniracetam-like effects. The conversion of aniracetam to anisoyl-GABA involves a break in the pyrrolidinone ring between the nitrogen and the adjacent carbonyl group, as illustrated below: In order to overcome the stability problems with aniracetam, and in efforts to provide compounds with improved physiological activity, we have developed a number of compounds having such improved properties. Therefore, in accordance with the present invention, there are provided novel compounds having the structure: wherein: Y is selected from: wherein y is 3, 4, or 5; or when J is selected from: or (CR 2 ) x , wherein x is 4, 5, or 6, C x R (2x-2) , when J is: R is hydrogen or a straight chain or branched chain alkyl group having 1-6 carbon atoms; each M is independently selected from: C(H), or C(Z), wherein Z is selected from: R or OR; wherein M can optionally be linked to Y by a linking moiety selected from C n H 2n , C n H (2n-1) , O or NR, wherein n is 0 or 1; each Y is independently selected from: O, NR or N; and Z is selected from: (CR 2 ) z , wherein z is 1, 2, or 3, or C z ,R (2z-1) , wherein z is 1 or 2, when one Y is N, or C 2 R 2 when both Y are N or both Y are O; with the proviso that when each M is C(H), each Y is O, and Z is CH 2 , then Y is not (CH 2 ) 4,5 ; or wherein: Y, and M are as defined above, or wherein: Y, and M are as defined above.

EC 50 data for this and a number of other compounds described herein have been determined and are presented in the Examples. Additional preferred compounds of the invention include Invention Compound V (i.e., (R,S)-1-(2-methyl-1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylcarbonyl)-piperidine, Invention Compound XIV (i.e., 1-(quinoxalin-6-ylcarbonyl)-piperidine, Invention Compound XV (i.e., N-(4-dimethylamino)benzoyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, and the like. In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods for the preparation of the above-described compounds. One such method comprises: (a) contacting a benzoic acid derivative under conditions suitable to activate the carboxy group thereof for the formation of an amide therefrom.

Soc. 82:4596 (1960)), a chlorinating agent (such as thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride), or the like, under conditions suitable to produce an activated acid, such as the corresponding benzoyl chloride derivative. See, for example, March, Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure, McGraw-Hill, Inc. 1968. Suitable reaction conditions used to carry out the step (b) condensation are well known to those of skill in the art. The artisan also recognizes that care is generally taken to carry out such reactions under substantially anhydrous conditions. Another method for the preparation of the compounds of the present invention comprises: (a) contacting a benzoic acid derivative (as described above) with at least two equivalents of a suitable base in suitable solvent, then contacting the resulting ionized benzoic acid derivative with pivaloyl chloride or a reactive carboxylic acid anhydride under conditions suitable to produce a mixed anhydride containing said benzoic acid; and (b) contacting said mixed anhydride produced in step (a) with a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound (as described above), wherein said contacting is carried out under conditions suitable to produce the desired imides or amides (i.e., aniracetam-like compounds).

Suitable solvents contemplated for use in the practice of the present invention include inert solvents such as CH 2 Cl 2 , alcohol-free CHCl 3 , and the like. Reactive carboxylic acid anhydrides contemplated for use in the practice of the present invention include trifluoroacetic anhydride, trichloroacetic anhydride, and the like. Suitable reaction conditions used to carry out the above-described reaction are well known to those of skill in the art. The artisan also recognizes that care is generally taken to carry out such reactions under substantially anhydrous conditions. Yet another suitable method for the preparation of the compounds of the present invention comprises: (a) contacting 3,4-(alkylenedihetero)-benzaldehyde with ammonia under conditions suitable to form an imine derivative thereof, (b) contacting the imine produced in step (a) with: under conditions suitable to form a benzyloxycarbonyl (BOC) imine, (c) contacting the product of step (b) with a simple conjugated diene such as butadiene under cycloaddition reaction conditions; and (d) contacting the reaction product of step (c) with a Lewis acid under conditions suitable for Friedel-Crafts acylation to occur. 3,4-(alkylenedihetero)benzaldehydes contemplated for use in the practice of the present invention include 3,4-(methylenedioxy)benzaldehyde, 3,4-(ethylenedioxy)-benzaldehyde, 3,4-(propylenedioxy)benzaldehyde, 3,4-(ethylidenedioxy)benzaldehyde, 3,4-(propylenedithio)-benzaldehyde, 3,4-(ethylidenethioxy)benzaldehyde, 4-benzimidazolecarboxaldehyde,4-quinoxalinecarboxaldehyde, and the like.

Still another suitable method for the preparation of the compounds of the present invention comprises: (a) contacting 2,3-dihydroxy naphthalene with 1,2-dibromoethane in the presence of base under conditions suitable to produce an ethylenedioxy derivative of naphthalene, (b) contacting the ethylenedioxy derivative of naphthalene produced in step (a) with a suitable oxidizing agent under conditions suitable to produce 4,5-ethylenedioxyphthaldehydic acid, (c) contacting the product of step (b) with anhydrous ammonia under conditions suitable to form an imine, which is then treated with a suitable carbonyl-activating agent (e.g., a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) under cyclization conditions suitable to form an acyl imine, and (d) contacting the product of step (c) with a simple conjugated diene under conditions suitable for cycloaddition to occur. Suitable oxidizing agents contemplated for use in the practice of the present invention include potassium permanganate, and the like. Oxidizing conditions suitable to produce 4,5-ethylenedioxyphthaldehydic acid are described, for example, in Organic Synthesis, Collective Volume 2, at page 523 (1943). Treatment of 4,5-ethylenedioxyphthaldehydic acid with anhydrous ammonia initially forms an imine, which is then treated with a suitable carbonyl-activating agent which, under appropriate reaction conditions, promotes cyclization of the intermediate imine to produce an acyl imine. Suitable reaction conditions used to carry out the above-described reactions are well known to those of skill in the art. The artisan also recognizes that care is generally taken to carry out such reactions under substantially anhydrous conditions. In accordance with yet another embodiment of the present invention, there are provided methods for enhancing synaptic responses mediated by AMPA receptors. The method comprises administering to a subject an effective amount of a compound having the structure: wherein: Y is selected from: wherein y is 3, 4, or 5; or when J is selected from: (CR 2 ) x , wherein x is 4, 5, or 6, C x R (2x-2) , when J is: R is hydrogen or a straight chain or branched chain alkyl group having 1-6 carbon atoms; each M is independently selected from: C(H), or C(Z), wherein Z is selected from: R, or OR; wherein M can optionally be linked to Y by a linking moiety selected from C n H 2n , C n H (2n-1) , O or NR, wherein n is 0 or 1; each Y is independently selected from: O, NR or N; and Z is selected from: (CR 2 ) z , wherein z is 1, 2, or 3, or C z ,R (2z-1) , wherein z is 1 or 2, when one Y is N, or C 2 R 2 when both Y are N or both Y are O; or wherein: Y and M as defined above, or wherein: Y and M are as defined above. Invention compounds are demonstrated in the examples which follow to be substantially more potent than aniracetam in increasing AMPA receptor function in slices of hippocampus. For example, Invention Compound I is shown to facilitate induction of maximal long-term potentiation in vitro, and to reversibly prolong synaptic responses in the hippocampus following peripheral (i.e., intraperitoneal) injections in anesthetized rats. The above-described compounds can be incorporated into a variety of formulations (e.g., capsule, tablet, syrup, suppository, injectable form, etc.) for administration to a subject. Similarly, various modes of delivery (e.g., oral, rectal, parenteral, intraperitoneal, etc.) can be employed. Dose levels employed can vary widely, and can readily be determined by those of skill in the art. Typically, amounts in the milligram up to gram quantities are employed. Subjects contemplated for treatment with the invention compounds include humans, domesticated animals, laboratory animals, and the like. Invention compounds can be used, for example, as a research tool for studying the biophysical and biochemical properties of the AMPA receptor and the consequences of selectively enhancing excitatory transmission on the operation of neuronal circuitry. Since invention compounds reach central synapses, they will allow for testing of the behavioral effects of enhancing AMPA receptor currents. Metabolically stable variants of aniracetam have many potential applications in humans. For example, increasing the strength of excitatory synapses could compensate for losses of synapses or receptors associated with aging and brain disease (e.g., Alzheimers). Enhancing AMPA receptors could cause more rapid processing by multisynaptic circuitries found in higher brain regions and thus could produce an increase in perceptual-motor and intellectual performance. As another example, since increasing AMPA receptor-mediated responses facilitates synaptic changes of the type believed to encode memory, metabolically stable variants of aniracetam are expected to be functional as memory enhancers. Additional applications contemplated for the compounds of the present invention include improving the performance of subjects with sensory-motor problems dependent upon brain networks utilizing AMPA receptors; improving the performance of subjects impaired in cognitive tasks dependent upon brain networks utilizing AMPA receptors; improving the performance of subjects with memory deficiencies; and the like. Accordingly, invention compounds, in suitable formulations, can be employed for decreasing the amount of time needed to learn a cognitive, motor or perceptual task. Alternatively, invention compounds, in suitable formulations, can be employed for increasing the time for which cognitive, motor or perceptual tasks are retained. As another alternative, invention compounds, in suitable formulations, can be employed for decreasing the quantity and/or severity of errors made in recalling a cognitive, motor or perceptual task. Such treatment may prove especially advantageous in individuals who have suffered injury to the nervous system, or who have endured disease of the nervous system, especially injury or disease which affects the number of AMPA receptors in the nervous system. Invention compounds are administered to the affected individual, and thereafter, the individual is presented with a cognitive, motor or perceptual task. The invention will now be described in greater detail by reference to the following non-limiting examples. EXAMPLES Example I Preparation of (R,S)-1-(2-methyl-1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylcarbonyl)-piperidine (V) The synthesis of 2-methyl-1,3-benzodioxole is conducted by the procedure of Nichols and Kostuba (J. Med. Chem 22:1264 (1979)). A solution of 10.3 g (76 mmol) of 2-methyl-1,3-benzodioxole and 21 ml of acetic anhydride is treated with 3.5 ml BF 3 etherate at 0 C. for 24 hr and at 20 C. for three days. The reaction solution is poured into 250 ml 1M Na 2 CO 3 and extracted with ether. The ether is dried over Na 2 SO 4 , then removed under reduced pressure. Purification and distillation under reduced pressure yields the ketone, 5-acetyl-2-methyl-1,3-benzodioxole. The above-described ketone is oxidized to the acid by dissolution in aqueous dioxane/NaOH and treatment with Br 2 and iodoform reagent (KI/I 2 in aqueous NaOH). Excess halogen is destroyed with Na 2 SO 3 and the aqueous solution extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 , then ether. Acidification of the aqueous solution with conc. HCl yields 2-methyl-1,3-benzo-dioxol-5-ylcarboxylic acid, which can be crystallized from CHCl 3 /CCl 4 /petroleum ether. 1 H NMR 1.71 (d, 3, J5 Hz), 6.36 (q, 1, J5 Hz), 6.81 (d, 1, J8.2 Hz), 7.46 (d, 1, J1.6 Hz), and 7.71 ppm (dd, 1, J1.6, 8.2 Hz). The above-described acid is coupled to piperidine by first activating the acid with a suitable reagent. Specifically, the acid is suspended in CH 2 Cl 2 and stirred with one equivalent carbonyl diimidazole (CDI). After 30 min, 10% excess piperidine is added. After the reaction is complete (usually less than 1 hr), the solution is extracted with aqueous HCl, water, and aqueous NaHCO 3 . The organic solution is dried over Na 2 SO 4 and CH 2 Cl 2 removed under reduced pressure. Crystallization of the resulting oil by methods known in the art gives (R,S)-1-(2-methyl-1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylcarbonyl)-piperidine (V) as a white solid. 1 H NMR 1.5-1.7 (br m, 6), 1.68 (d, 3, J5.0 Hz), 6.29 (q, 1, J4.9 Hz), 6.75 (d, 1, J7.9 Hz), 6.84 (d, 1, J0.93 Hz), and 6.88 (dd, 1, J8.0, 1.0 Hz). Example II Alternate Synthesis of (R,S)-1-(2-methyl-1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylcarbonyl)-piperidine (V) Catechol (11.0 g; 0.100 mol) is dissolved in 50 ml of ether and 29 g of freshly-prepared dioxane dibromide (Yanovskaya, Terentev and Belsnkii), J. Gen. Chem. Vol. 22:1594 (1952)) is added slowly as a solution in 50 ml of ether. The organic solution is washed with water (3 times) and dried over MgSO 4 . The solvent is removed under reduced pressure to yield 4-bromocatechol as a red-brown oil. 1 H NMR 5.52 (s, 1), 5.70 (s, 1), 6.74 (d, 1, J8.74 Hz), 6.92 (dd, 1, J8.3, 2.3 Hz), and 7.01 ppm (d, 1, J2.6 Hz). 4-Bromocatechol (18.9 g, 0.100 mol) is dissolved in 200 ml dry toluene and 20 ml vinyl acetate is added at once, followed by 0.20 g mercuric oxide and 0.4 ml BF 3 etherate. After standing for 10 hr, the solution is extracted with 0.5 M NaOH until the aqueous layer is strongly basic (pH12). The organic solution is dried over K 2 CO 3 and filtered to remove the drying agent. Removal of the toluene under reduced pressure and treatment of the resulting oil with silica gel in petroleum ether (low boiling) gives 18 g of (R,S)-5-bromo-2-methyl-1,3-benzodioxole as a yellow oil, 1 H NMR 1.67 (d, 1, J4.78 Hz), 6.27 (q, 1, J4.72 Hz), 6.63 (d, 1, J8.11 Hz), and 6.88-6.93 ppm (m, 2). Conversion of the bromoaromatic derivative to the substituted benzoic acid is accomplished by the well-known Grignard reaction (or other suitable method known in the art). Specifically, the bromoderivative is dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran and combined with magnesium. The resulting Grignard reagent is treated with gaseous carbon dioxide. The reaction solution is quenched with aqueous HCl and the product acid is extracted into ether. The ether solution is extracted with aqueous bicarbonate and the bicarbonate solution is then washed with ether or other suitable organic solvent. The bicarbonate solution is neutralized with conc. HCl to yield 2-methyl-1,3-benzo-dioxol-5-ylcarboxylic acid, which can be crystallized from CHCl 3 /CCl 4 /petroleum ether, as described above. The acid is then coupled to piperidine as described above, to produce the desired product. Example III Synthesis of 1-(1,4-benzodioxan-5-ylcarbonyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (I) 1,4-benzodioxan-6-carboxylic acid (also known as 3,4-ethylenedioxybenzoic acid) was synthesized by the oxidation of commercially available 3,4-ethylene-dioxybenzaldehyde with potassium permanganate, as described in Org. Syn. 2:538 (1943). 1,4-benzodioxan-6-carboxylic acid (3.0 g; 16.7 mmol) was suspended in 40 mL of dichloromethane. The acid dissolved upon addition of 3.7 g (2.2 equivalents) of triethylamine. Addition of 2.0 g of pivaloyl chloride was exothermic, and produced a dense precipitate. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for about 20 minutes, then 1.52 g of 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine was slowly added. Product was purified by diluting the reaction mixture with an equal volume of diethyl ether, followed by sequential extractions with 1) 1 M HCl, 2) aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and 3) aqueous sodium carbonate. The organic solution was dried over sodium sulfate and potassium carbonate. Removal of solvent on a rotary evaporator gave 4.07 g of a pale yellow, viscous oil. Electron impact mass spectroscopy (EIMS) showed the parent ion at an m/z value of 245, and a base peak at 163 for the acylium ion. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) at 500 MHz revealed resonances at 6.97 (1H, d, J1.81); 6.93 (1H, dd, J8.23, 1.86); 6.87 (1H, d, J8.23); 5.5-5.9 (2H, m); 4.27 (4H, s); 3.4-4.3 (4H, m); and 2.2 ppm (2H, br s), relative to TMS.

Example XIV In Vitro Physiological Testing The physiological effects of invention compounds can be tested in vitro with slices of rat hippocampus as follows. Excitatory responses (field EPSPs) are measured in hippocampal slices which are maintained in a recording chamber continuously perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). During the 15 minute interval indicated by the horizontal bar in FIG. 1 , the perfusion medium is switched to one containing either 1.5 mM aniracetam (left panel) or 750 M of Invention Compound I (right panel). Responses collected immediately before (1) and at the end of drug perfusion (2) are shown as superimposed inserts in FIG. 1 (calibration bars: horizontal 10 milliseconds, vertical 0.5 mV). The y-axis of the main graph shows the area of the response before, during and after drug perfusion, expressed as percent of the baseline value; and each data point represents a single response. To conduct these tests, the hippocampus was removed from anesthetized, 2 month old Sprague-Dawley rats and in vitro slices (400 micrometers thick) were prepared and maintained in an interface chamber at 35 C. using conventional techniques see, for example, Dunwiddie and Lynch, J. Physiol. Vol. 276: 353-367 (1978). The chamber was constantly perfused at 0.5 ml/min with ACSF containing (in mM): NaCl 124, KCl 3, KH 2 PO 4 1.25, MgSO 4 2.5, CaCl 2 3.4, NaHCO 3 26, glucose 10 and L-ascorbate 2. A bipolar nichrome stimulating electrode was positioned in the dendritic layer (stratum radiatum) of the hippocampal subfield CA1 close to the border of subfield CA3. Current pulses (0.1 msec) through the stimulating electrode activate a population of the Schaffer-commissural (SC) fibers which arise from neurons in the subdivision CA3 and terminate in synapses on the dendrites of CA1 neurons. Activation of these synapses causes them to release the transmitter glutamate. Glutamate binds to the post-synaptic AMPA receptors which then transiently open an associated ion channel and permit a sodium current to enter the postsynaptic cell. This current results in a voltage in the extracellular space (the field excitatory post-synaptic potential or field EPSP ) which is recorded by a high impedance recording electrode positioned in the middle of the stratum radiatum of CA1. For the experiments summarized in FIG. 1 , the intensity of the stimulation current was adjusted to produce half-maximal EPSPs (typically about 1.5-2.0 mV). Paired stimulation pulses were given every 40 sec with an interpulse interval of 200 msec (see below). The field EPSPs of the second response were digitized and analyzed to determine amplitude, half-width, and response area. If the responses were stable for 15-30 minutes (baseline), test compounds were added to the perfusion lines for a period of about 15 minutes. The perfusion was then changed back to regular ACSF. Paired-pulse stimulation was used since stimulation of the SC fibers, in part, activates interneurons which generate an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) in the pyramidal cells of CA1. This feed forward IPSP typically sets in after the EPSP reaches its peak. It accelerates the repolarization and shortens the decay phase of the EPSP, and thus could partially mask the effects of the test compounds. One of the relevant features of the feed-forward IPSP is that it can not be reactivated for several hundred milliseconds following a stimulation pulse. This phenomenon can be employed to advantage to eliminate IPSP by delivering paired pulses separated by 200 milliseconds and using the second (primed) response for data analysis. The field EPSP recorded in field CA1 after stimulation of CA3 axons is known to be mediated by AMPA receptors: the receptors are present in the synapses Kessler et al., Brain Res. Vol. 560: 337-341 (1991) and drugs that selectively block the receptor selectively block the field EPSP Muller et al., Science, supra. Aniracetam increases the mean open time of the AMPA receptor channel and as expected from this increases the amplitude of the synaptic current and prolongs its duration Tang et al. Science, supra. These effects are mirrored in the field EPSP, as reported in the literature see, for example, Staubli et al., Psychobiology supra; Xiao et al., Hippocampus supra; Staubli et al., Hippocampus Vol. 2: 49-58 (1992). The same can be seen in the superimposed EPSP traces of FIG. 1 (left hand panel) which were collected before (1) and immediately after (2) the infusion of 1.5 mM aniracetam. The drug augmented the amplitude of the response and extended the duration of the response. The latter effect is responsible for most of the increase in the area (net current) of the response which is plotted in the main graph as a function of time before, during, and after drug infusion. In these tests, as in the published literature, aniracetam has a rapid onset following infusion, and reverses quickly upon washout. The right hand panel of FIG. 1 summarizes a typical experiment with Invention Compound I used at 750 M (i.e., one half the concentration of aniracetam). The invention compound produced the same qualitative effects as aniracetam as shown in field EPSPs collected immediately before and immediately after a 15 minute infusion. As is evident upon inspection of the data in FIG. 1 , the magnitude of the effects was much greater even though the concentration of invention compound used was only 50% of that of aniracetam. The same can be seen in the main graph ( FIG. 1 , right hand panel), which shows the effects of Invention Compound I on the area of the field EPSPs as a function of time. Invention compound is similar to aniracetam in that it effected a rapid onset of action and was fully reversible upon washout. Comparison of the two panels. in FIG. 1 illustrates the extent to which 750 M of Invention Compound I was more potent than 1.5 mM aniracetam. Example XV Generation of Dose-Response Curves and Derived EC 50 Values for Invention Compounds and Aniracetam Invention Compounds I ((1-(1,4-benzodioxan-5-ylcarbonyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), II (1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylcarbonyl)-piperidine), III (1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylcarbonyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), and aniracetam were assayed in the physiological test system described for the generation of data presented in FIG. 1 . The left panel of FIG. 2 shows the effect of each test compound on the amplitude, while the right panel shows the effect of each test compound on the area of synaptic responses. Each point is the mean of 2-10 independent determinations. The regression lines were calculated assuming a standard hyperbolic saturation function. The invention compounds produced dose-dependent increases in both measures (i.e., in maximum amplitude and response area) and were effective at concentrations as low as 100 M. Invention Compound I at this dose enhanced the area of the field EPSP by 4616% (mean and S.D. of 4 experiments). As readily seen upon inspection of FIG. 2 , each of the three invention compounds was significantly more potent than aniracetam at all dosages tested. For example, Invention Compound I (tested at dosages in the range of 750 M to 1.5 mM) produced a 6-9 times greater effect on response area than did aniracetam at the same concentrations. The percent increase in field EPSP amplitude was determined for a variety of Invention Compounds, and aniracetam, as described above, and used to construct log dose/response curves in order to estimate EC 50 values for each compound. EC 50 values are presented in the following table. Where maximal responses could not be obtained due to limited solubility of some of the compounds, a maximal response corresponding to an increase of 85% was assumed. The variables set forth in the table refer to the following generic structure: Compound * Y Y J a b c d R EC 50 (mM) aniracetam O NC(O) 3 6 1 2 H 5 I O O N 5 8 2 3 H 0.5 II O O N 5 10 1 1 H 1.5 III O O N 5 8 1 1 H 0.8 IV O O CHC(O) 3 6 1 1 H 0.9 V O O N 5 10 1 1 CH 3 1.1 VI O O N 4 8 1 1 H 1.2 VII O O N 6 12 1 1 H 4 VIII O O N 4 6 2 3 H 3 IX O N N 5 8 1 0 H 4 X O N N 5 10 1 0 H 1.3 XI N O N 5 8 1 0 H 3 XII N NH N 5 8 1 0 H 5 XIII N N N 5 8 2 1 H 0.05 XIV N N N 5 10 2 1 H 0.3 XV N(CH 3 ) 2 N 5 8 1.7 XVI O O NC(O) 3 6 1 1 H 2 *Compounds I, III-V and VII-XIV were prepared as described above. Compound II (1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylcarbonyl)-piperidine) and Compound VI (1-(1,3-Benzodioxol-5-ylcarbonyl)-pyrrolidine) are known compounds Example XVI Promotion of Long-Term Potentiation by Invention Compounds Long-term potentiation (LTP; a stable increase in the EPSP size of single responses after brief periods of high frequency stimulation) was elicited in the CA1 field of hippocampal slices in the absence (see FIG. 3 , stippled bars, N6) and in the presence of 1.5 mM of Invention Compound I (see FIG. 3 , striped bars, N5). In the latter case, the amount of potentiation was determined after washing out the test compound and comparing the response size with that before test compound infusion. Data presented in FIG. 3 show the percent increase in the EPSP amplitude (mean and S.D.) at 40, 60, and 90 minutes after LTP induction. For these studies, field EPSPs in slices of hippocampus were elicited by single stimulation pulses and recorded by extracellular electrodes as described in Example II. After collecting responses every 40 seconds for 20-30 minutes to establish a baseline, LTP was induced with ten short bursts of pulses delivered to the CA3 axons; each burst consisted of four pulses separated by 10 milliseconds; the interval between the bursts was 200 milliseconds. This pattern of axon stimulation mimics a discharge rhythm observed in the hippocampus of animals engaged in learning and is referred to as the theta burst stimulation paradigm see, for example, Larson and Lynch in Science Vol. 232: 985-988 (1986). Testing with single pulses (one every 40 seconds) is then carried out for an additional 60-90 minutes to determine the amount of stable potentiation in the EPSP amplitude. As shown in FIG. 3 , the two second long period of burst stimulation (i.e., 10 bursts separated by 200 milliseconds) increased the size of the field EPSPs in control slices (stippled bars) by about 25%. The increase in the EPSP size was stable for the duration of the recording (90 min in the experiments shown in FIG. 3 ). Equivalent experiments in rats with chronically implanted electrodes have shown that the increase in EPSP size lasts for as long as stable recordings can be maintained, typically on the order of weeks (see Staubli and Lynch, in Brain Research 435: 227-234 (1987)). This phenomenon is referred to in the literature as long-term potentiation (LTP). To determine the effect of test compound on the induction of LTP, 1.5 mM of Invention Compound I was infused for 15 minutes prior to application of theta burst stimulation. Test compound was then washed out until the EPSP half-width (which is changed by test compound, but not by LTP) had returned to its pre-treatment level. The amplitude of the field EPSPs was then compared to that observed before infusion of test compound and burst stimulation to determine the amount of LTP. The striped bars in FIG. 3 summarize the results (mean and S.D.) of five experiments. As is evident upon inspection of FIG. 3 , the degree of stable long-term potentiation produced by burst stimulation applied in the presence of Invention Compound I was nearly twice as large as that induced by the same stimulation administered in the absence of the drug (p0.02). There is much evidence linking long-term potentiation to memory encoding. Therefore, the data summarized in FIG. 3 provide grounds for predicting that Invention Compound I will be effective in intact animals as a memory enhancer. Example XVII Effect of Intraperitoneally Injected Invention Compound I on Monosynaptic EPSP Responses in the Rat Hippocampus Stimulating and recording electrodes were placed in the hippocampus of anesthetized rats so as to activate and monitor the same synaptic responses as in the slice studies described in Example XV. FIG. 4 shows the size of the normalized decay time constant of the response (mean S.E.M.) before and after a single intraperitoneal injection (arrow) of Invention Compound I (circles, n8) or cyclodextrin/saline vehicle (diamonds, n7). The time constant for the decay of the EPSP is a measure for the duration of the response. In these experiments, male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with urethane (1.7 g/kg) and body temperature was maintained at 37 C. with the use of a heat lamp. A stimulation electrode (two twisted stainless steel wires, 150 m diameter, insulated with teflon) was placed stereotaxically in the trajectory of the Schaffer collateral (SC) pathway from CA3 to CA1 of the hippocampus (coordinates relative to Bregma: 3.5 mm P., 3.5 mm L., and 3.0-3.7 mm V). A recording electrode (stainless steel, 150 m diameter, insulated with teflon) was placed in the ipsilateral CA1 field (coordinates relative to Bregma: 3.8 mm P., 2.9 mm L., and 2.2-2.8 mm V.), 100-200 m ventral to the electrophysiologically-identified CA1 stratum pyramidale (i.e., in the stratum radiatum). Negative field potentials reflecting dendritic EPSPs evoked by SC stimulation (0.1 ms pulses, 10-100 A) with paired pulses (inter-pulse interval of 200 msec; see methodology described in Example XV) were amplified 500 times and digitized by computer at 20 sec intervals throughout each experiment. Test compound (120-180 mg/kg of Invention Compound I in 20% w/v 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin in 50% saline vehicle) or vehicle (1.5-2.1 g/kg) injections were made i.p. Stable synaptic responses for 10-60 min before and 60-180 min after injection were obtained in all animals used for the analysis shown in FIG. 4 . The time course of the decay time constant was plotted since the prolongation of EPSP was the most prominent effect of Invention Compound I in hippocampal slices. Decay time constants were determined by single exponential fits to the decay phase of the synaptic response and expressed as a percent of the value obtained during the pre-injection control period. As is evident from inspection of FIG. 4 , the test compound produced a rapid increase in the duration of the synaptic response, and this effect reversed within 60-120 minutes of the injection. The effect of Invention Compound I was somewhat larger for the second (primed) response of the paired stimulation. The effect on response duration is typical for this group of compounds (cf. responses 1 and 2 in the right panel of FIG. 1 ). Other manipulations which have been used in slices to modulate synaptic responses in general had little effect on the decay time constant see, for example, Xiao et al. (1991) supra. These results indicate that sufficient amounts of the test compound cross the blood-brain barrier to augment AMPA receptor functioning in situ, and that test compound influences the response in much the same way as low doses of Invention Compound I directly applied to hippocampal slices. The on-going hippocampal electroencephalogram was continuously monitored in these experiments and in no case did injections of Invention Compound I produce electrographic seizures. Example XVIII Distribution of Invention Compound II after Intraperitoneal Injection To be effective, nootrophic drugs, or their active metabolites, must pass the blood brain barrier or be introduced directly through the blood brain barrier. To test the ability of invention compounds to pass the blood-brain barrier, Invention Compound II was labelled with carbon-11. Radiolabelled Invention Compound II (see the table above) is synthesized by the following scheme (wherein the numbers in parenthesis refer to the quantity of reagent used, in millimoles): wherein Ar is aryl (such as methylenedioxybenzene), Im is imidazole (thus, ImHCl is imidazole hydrochloride), and R is an alkyl or alkylene radical (so that R 2 NH is, for example, piperidine). 11 C-labelled CO 2 is produced by cyclotron irradiation and subsequently used in the above-described synthetic scheme. The time to complete the synthesis is about 22 min (2 times the half-life of carbon-11). After purification of 11 CII on C 18 Sep Pak, 260 Ci was diluted with 20 mg of nonradioactive II as carrier in a 1-ml solution of 23% propylene glycol and 10% ethanol in physiologically-buffered saline in order to simulate the dosage of 100 mg/Kg that was used in behavioral studies. The final 1 ml of solution was administered to a 200 g rat under halothane anesthesia (1.4-1.7% in oxygen) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Biodistribution of the radiotracer in the body of the rat was monitored by a positron camera (Scanditronix PC2048-15B) and the time-activity curves were constructed using a Vax 3500 (Digital Equipment Corporation) and shown in FIG. 5 . Four regions of interest were selected: a) liver, upper curve (); b) heart, second curve from top (); c) soft or muscle tissue, third curve from top at 30 min (); d) brain, bottom curve The results presented in FIG. 5 indicate that uptake in liver peaked about 3 minutes after injection, uptake in heart and brain peaked about 5 minutes after injection and uptake in soft tissues peaked about 17 minutes after injection. Levels in the liver declined markedly for the first 5 minutes after peaking and then more gradually. Levels in the other three tissues declined very gradually after peaking. Not surprisingly, liver showed the maximum uptake, followed by heart. Of particular importance is the fact that uptake in the brain was nearly as effective as uptake in the heart, and as much as a quarter that of liver. This demonstrates that Invention Compound II passes freely through the blood-brain barrier. Further, entry of Invention Compound II into its target tissue was relatively rapid and stayed in the brain for an extended period. These properties indicate that invention compounds may be administered shortly before they are needed, and that frequent readministration may not be necessary. The invention has been described in detail with reference to particular embodiments thereof.

group consisting of pyrrolidine, hexamethyleneamino, and piperidino; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of solvate thereof. This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/293,790 filed Aug. 22, 1994 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,828. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy for treatment of malignancies are almost invariably faced with moderate or severe side effects due to their therapy. One of the common side effects faced by cancer patients is the induction of ulcerative mucositis of the mucosal membranes. This mucositis is especially prominent in the oral cavity. This side effect, although not as life threatening as other side effects such as anemia or immunosuppression, nonetheless often becomes the dose limiting factor in the continuation of therapy in many cancer patients. Ulcerative mucositis is marked by the formation of slowly healing open ulcers in the oral cavity causing a great deal of pain and discomfort to the patient. Eating, drinking, and swallowing become difficult and painful and additionally, the salivary glands are often effected compounding the discomfort. The presence of open ulcers in the mouth often lead to opportunistic infections of bacterial, viral, and fungal origin in these patients, who are often immunologically suppressed due to their therapy. These oral infections must be carefully monitored to avoid their spreading to life-threatening, systemic infections. As yet, there is no treatment for such mucositis except either cessation of the therapy or palliative and supportive interventions. Some of the palliative treatments in current use include the use of antibiotics to reduce the chance of infection, the use of anti-histamines and anti-inflammatory drugs, and the use of pain reducing medications. All of these treatments are either unacceptable, as with the case of cessation of cancer therapy or partially successful in relieving the suffering from the mucositis. For a more detailed description of radio- and chemotherapy induced mucositis, its treatment, management, and causes see Holland, J. F. et al.; Cancer Medicine, Third Ed., Lea Febiger, Philadelphia Pa., 1993; Vol.2, Section XL, pp. 2382-2385 and references therein. The current understanding of the mechanism which causes ulcerative mucositis in cancer patients undergoing radio- or chemotherapy is that both normal mucosal cells and malignant cancer cells share one common property, i.e., these are cells which are rapidly growing or cycling. Normally the mucosal lining turns over at a very rapid rate compared to most other tissue compartments in the body. This rapid mucosal turnover is also shared by several other normal tissues such as cellular blood elements, hair, skin, etc. It is not surprising to find that these tissues are also targets of various cancer therapies, because the governing strategy for the treatment of cancer has been aimed at targeting rapidly proliferated cancer cells by a variety of cellular mechanisms. Thus, cancer drugs which are most effective at interrupting the growth of cancer cells are often the most damaging agents to the normal, proliferating cells in the body, such as the mucosal lining. Other tissue compartments of the body whose cells are not as rapidly cycling, such as muscle and nerve cells, are not as prone to the rapid and deleterious effects of such cancer therapies. Recently there has been a report in the literature, suggesting that Transforming Growth Factor-B 3 (TGF-B 3) may be useful in treating patients suffering from ulcerative mucositis induced by cancer therapy. The authors hypothesis is that TGF-3 slows the rate of turnover of epithelial cells (epithelial cells are the predominant cell type in the mucosal lining) and thus these cells might be spared the effects of the cancer therapy. The authors give experimental data both in cell culture and in animal models which support their hypothesis. (Sonis, et al., Prevention Of Chemotherapy-Induced Ulcerative Mucositis by Transforming Growth Factor-3., Abst., NIH Symposia on TGF-s, Bethesda Md., May 3, 1994). TGF- is a peptide growth factor which refers to a generic family of peptides, often called isoforms meaning that members of the family either share amino acid homology and/or have similar physiological actions. Of particular interest to the subject of wound healing are: TGF-s 1, 2, and 3. For further discussion of the TGF- family of peptides, the subject is reviewed in: Roberts et al., The transforming growth factor-s. In: Sporn and Roberts, eds. Peptide growth factors and their receptors I. Berlin: Springer Verlag, 1990: 419-472. It would seem reasonable that an agent which might slow the rapid rate of turnover of the mucosal lining may be useful in protecting that tissue from the effects of the commonly used cancer therapies. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention provides methods of inhibiting ulcerative mucositis comprising administering to a human in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula I wherein R 1 and R 3 are independently hydrogen, wherein Ar is optionally substituted phenyl; R 2 is selected from the group consisting of pyrrolidino, hexamethyleneimino, and piperidino; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The current invention concerns the discovery that a select group of 2-phenyl-3-aroylbenzothiophenes (benzothiophenes), those of formula I, are useful for inhibiting ulcerative mucositis, particularly induced by chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The therapeutic and prophylactic treatments provided by this invention are practiced by administering to a human in need thereof a dose of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, that is effective to inhibit ulcerative mucositis. The term inhibit includes its generally accepted meaning which includes prohibiting, preventing, restraining, and slowing, stopping or reversing progression, severity or a resultant symptom. As such, the present method includes both medical therapeutic and/or prophylactic administration, as appropriate. Raloxifene is a preferred compound of this invention and it is the hydrochloride salt of a compound of formula 1 wherein R 1 and R 3 are hydrogen and R 2 is 1-piperidinyl. Raloxifene is a nuclear regulating compound, and has been shown to bind to the estrogen receptor, and was originally thought to be a molecule whose function and pharmacology was that of an anti-estrogen in that it blocked the ability of estrogen to activate uterine tissue and estrogen dependent breast cancers. Indeed, raloxifene does block the action of estrogen in some cells; however, in other cell types, raloxifene activates the same genes as estrogen does and displays the same pharmacology, e.g., osteoporosis, hyperlipidemia, etc. As a result, raloxifene has been referred to as an anti-estrogen with mixed agonist-antagonist properties. The unique profile which raloxifene displays and differs from that of estrogen is now thought to be due to the unique activation and/or suppression of various gene functions by the raloxifene-estrogen receptor complex as opposed to the activation and/or suppression of genes by the estrogen-estrogen receptor complex. Therefore, although raloxifene and estrogen utilize and compete for the same receptor, the pharmacological outcome from gene regulation of the two is not easily predicted and is unique to each. It has been reported in the literature that part of the pharmacologic action displayed by Raloxifene is due to its ability to induce TGF-3. Raloxifene shares this ability with estrogen; however, it appears that raloxifene induces this factor to a greater extent than estrogen. The compound of formula I would be a useful agent in the inhibition of ulcerative mucositis. This invention is not limited to only the mucositis seen in the oral cavity but also includes other mucosal lining such as found in the intestinal, uro-genital, and nasal tracts. Generally, at least one compound of formula I is formulated with common excipients, diluents or carriers, and compressed into tablets, or formulated as elixirs or solutions for convenient oral administration, or administered by the intramuscular or intravenous routes. The compounds can be administered transdermally, and may be formulated as sustained release dosage forms and the like. The compounds used in the methods of the current invention can be made according to established procedures, such as those detailed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,133,814, 4,418,068, and 4,380,635 all of which are incorporated by reference herein. In general, the process starts with a benzo b thiophene having a 6-hydroxyl group and a 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) group. The starting compound is protected, acylated, and deprotected to form the formula I compounds. Examples of the preparation of such compounds are provided in the U.S. patents discussed above. The term optionally substituted phenyl includes phenyl and phenyl substituted once or twice with C 1 -C 6 alkyl, C 1 -C 4 alkoxy, hydroxy, nitro, chloro, fluoro, or tri(chloro or fluoro)methyl. The compounds used in the methods of this invention form pharmaceutically acceptable acid and base addition salts with a wide variety of organic and inorganic acids and bases and include the physiologically acceptable salts which are often used in pharmaceutical chemistry. Such salts are also part of this invention. Typical inorganic acids used to form such salts include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric, sulfuric, phosphoric, hypophosphoric and the like. Salts derived from organic acids, such as aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxyalkanoic and hydroxyalkandioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, may also be used. Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus include acetate, phenylacetate, trifluoroacetate, acrylate, ascorbate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, methylbenzoate, o-acetoxybenzoate, naphthalene-2-benzoate, bromide, isobutyrate, phenylbutyrate, B-hydroxybutyrate, butyne-1,4-dioate, hexyne-1,4-dioate, caprate, caprylate, chloride, cinnamate, citrate, formate, fumarate, glycollate, heptanoate, hippurate, lactate, malate, maleate, hydroxymaleate, malonate, mandelate, mesylate, nicotinate, isonicotinate, nitrate, oxalate, phthalate, teraphthalate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, propiolate, propionate, phenylpropionate, salicylate, sebacate, succinate, suberate, sulfate, bisulfate, pyrosulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, sulfonate, benzene-sulfonate, p-bromophenylsulfonate, chlorobenzenesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, methanesulfonate, naphthalene-1-sulfonate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, xylenesulfonate, tartarate, and the like. A preferred salt is the hydrochloride salt. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are typically formed by reacting a compound of formula I with an equimolar or excess amount of acid. The reactants are generally combined in a mutual solvent such as diethyl ether or benzene. The salt normally precipitates out of solution within about one hour to 10 days and can be isolated by filtration or the solvent can be stripped off by conventional means. Bases commonly used for formation of salts include ammonium hydroxide and alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates, as well as aliphatic and primary, secondary and tertiary amines, aliphatic diamines. Bases especially useful in the preparation of addition salts include ammonium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, methylamine, diethylamine, ethylene diamine and cyclohexylamine. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts generally have enhanced solubility characteristics compared to the compound from which they are derived, and thus are often more amenable to formulation as liquids or emulsions. Pharmaceutical formulations can be prepared by procedures known in the art. For example, the compounds can be formulated with common excipients, diluents, or carriers, and formed into tablets, capsules, sprays, mouth washes, lozenges, suspensions, powders, and the like. Examples of excipients, diluents, and carriers that are suitable for such formulations include the following: fillers and extenders such as starch, sugars, mannitol, and silicic derivatives; binding agents such as carboxymethyl cellulose and other cellulose derivatives, alginates, gelatin, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone; moisturizing agents such as glycerol; disintegrating agents such as calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate; agents for retarding dissolution such as paraffin; resorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; surface active agents such as cetyl alcohol, glycerol monostearate; adsorptive carriers such as kaolin and bentonite; and lubricants such as talc, calcium and magnesium stearate, and solid polyethyl glycols. The compounds can also be formulated as elixirs or solutions for convenient oral administration or as solutions appropriate for parenteral administration, for instance by intramuscular, subcutaneous or intravenous routes. Additionally, the compounds are well suited to formulation as sustained release dosage forms and the like. The formulations can be so constituted that they release the active ingredient only or preferably in a particular part of the intestinal tract, possibly over a period of time. The coatings, envelopes, and protective matrices may be made, for example, from polymeric substances or waxes. Lozenges, troches or pastilles are discoid-shaped solids containing the medicinal agent in a suitably flavored base. The base may be a hard sugar candy, glycerinated gelatin, or the combination of sugar with sufficient mucilage to give it form. Troches are placed in the mouth where they slowly dissolve, liberating the active ingredient. The drug involved can be an antiseptic, local anesthetic, antibiotic, anthihistaminic, antitussive, analgesic, or a decongestant. Troches maybe prepared extemporaneously by the pharmacist. The mass is formed by adding water slowly to a mixture of the powdered drug, powdered sugar, and a gum until a pliable mass is formed. Powdered acacia in 7% concentration gives sufficient adhesiveness to the mass. The mass is rolled out and the troche pieces cut out using a cutter, or else the mass is rolled into a cylinder and divided. Each piece is shaped and allowed to dry before dispensing. If the active ingredient is heat stable, it may be prepared in a hard candy base. Syrup is concentrated to the point where it becomes a pliable mass, the active ingredient is added, and the mixture is kneaded while warm to form a homogeneous mass. The mass is gradually worked into a pipe form having the diameter desired for the candy piece and the lozenges cut from the pipe and allowed to cool. This is an entirely mechanical operation with equipment designed for this purpose. If the active ingredient is heat labile, it may be made into a lozenge preparation by compression. The granulation is prepared in a manner similar to that used for any compressed tablet. The lozenge is made using heavy compression equipment to give a tablet which is harder than usual as it is desirable for the troche to dissolve or disintegrate slowly in the mouth. In the formulation of the lozenge the ingredients are chosen which will promote its slow-dissolving characteristics. Compression is gaining in popularity as a means of making troches and candy pieces because of the increased speeds of compression equipment. In cases where holes are to be placed in troches or candy pieces, core-rod tooling is used. Core-rod tooling includes a rod centered on the lower punch around which the troche is compressed in the die cavity. The upper punch has an opening in its center for the core rod to enter during compression. It is evident that maximum accuracy is needed to provide alignment as the narrow punches are inserted into the die. The particular dosage of a compound of formula I required to inhibit ulcerative mucositis or its symptoms, according to this invention, will depend upon the severity of the condition, the route of administration, and related factors that will be decided by the attending physician. Generally, accepted and effective oral daily doses will be from about 0.1 to about 1000 mg/day, and more typically from about 50 to about 200 mg/day. Such dosages will be administered to a subject in need thereof from once to about three times each day, or more often as needed, and for a sufficient duration, to effectively inhibit ulcerative mucositis. It is usually preferred to administer a compound of formula I in the form of an acid addition salt, as is customary in the administration of pharmaceuticals bearing a basic group, such as the piperidino ring. For such purposes the following oral dosage forms are available. Formulations In the formulations which follow, Active ingredient means a compound of formula I.

The granules so produced are dried at 50-60 C. and passed through a No. 18 mesh U.S. sieve. The sodium carboxymethyl starch, magnesium stearate, and talc, previously passed through a No. 60 U.S. sieve, are then added to the granules which, after mixing, are compressed on a tablet machine to yield tablets. Suspensions each containing 0.1-1000 mg of Active ingredient per 5 mL dose are made as follows: Formulation 8: Suspensions Ingredient Quantity (mg/5 ml) Active ingredient 0.1-1000 mg Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose 50 mg Syrup 1.25 mg Benzoic acid solution 0.10 mL Flavor q.v. Color q.v. Purified water to 5 mL The Active ingredient is passed through a No. 45 mesh U.S. sieve and mixed with the sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and syrup to form a smooth paste. The benzoic acid solution, flavor, and color are diluted with some of the water and added, with stirring. Sufficient water is then added to produce the required volume. Formulation 9: Nasal Solution Ingredient Quantity (mg/5 ml) Active ingredient 0.1-1000 mg Chlorobutanol 0.5 g Sodium Chloride 0.5 g Water to 100 ml Formulation 10: Sublingual or Buccal Tablets Sublingula or buccal tablets, each containing 10 mg of active ingredient, may be prepared as follows: Ingredient Quantity Per Tablet Active ingredient 0.1-1000 mg Glycerol 210.5 mg Water 143.0 mg Sodium Citrate 4.5 mg Polyvinyl Alcohol 26.5 mg Polyvinylpyrrolidone 15.5 mg The glycerol, water, sodium citrate, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvinylpyrrolidone are admixed together by continuous stirring and maintaining the temperature at about 90 C. When the polymers have gone into solution, the solution is cooled to about 50-55 C. and the medicament is slowly admixed. The homogenous mixture is poured into forms made of an inert material to produce a drug-containing diffusion matrix having a thickness of about 2-4mm. This diffusion matrix is then cut to form individual tablets having the appropriate size. ASSAYS Assay 1 Five to fifty golden Syrian hamsters are begun on a daily oral dosage regimen of a compound of formula I one week before administering chemotherapy. The oral dosage regiman is continued during the 2 week chemotherapy and two weeks beyond. Positive results against mucositis include reduction of the course and/or severity of the mucositis, as measured by the epithelial BrdU labeling index, the PCNA-positive epithelial cell fraction weights, and/or survival rates. Assay 2 Five to fifty patients are selected for the clinical study. The patients are currently undergoing either chemo or radiotherapy which has induced ulcerative mucositis. Because of the idiosyncratic and subjective nature of these disorders, the study has a placebo control group, i.e., the patients are divided into two groups, one of which receives a compound of formula 1 as the active agent and the other receives a placebo. Patients in the test group receive between 50-200 mg of the drug per day by the oral route. They continue this therapy for the duration of the therapy and 2 months beyond. Accurate records are kept as to the number and severity of the symptoms in both groups and at the end of the study these results are compared. The results are compared both between members of each group and also the results for each patient are compared to the symptoms reported by each patient before the study began. Assay 3 Five to fifty patients are selected for the clinical study. The patients are set to undergo either chemo or radiotherapy which will induce ulcerative mucositis. Because of the idiosyncratic and subjective nature of these disorders, the study has a placebo control group, i.e., the patients are divided into two groups, one of which receives a compound of formula 1 as the active agent and the other receives a placebo. Patients in the test group receive between 50-200 mg of the drug per day by the oral route, being two weeks prior to chemo or radiotherapy. They continue this therapy for the duration of the therapy and 2 months beyond. Accurate records are kept as to the number and severity of the symptoms in both groups and at the end of the study these results are compared. The results are compared both between members of each group and also the results for each patient are compared to the symptoms reported by each patient before the study began. Utility of the compounds of formula I is illustrated by the positive impact they have in at least one of the assays described above. I claim: 1. A method of inhibiting radiotherapy or chemotherapy induced ulcerative mucositis comprising prophylactically administering to a human in need thereof an effective amount of a compound having the formula wherein R 1 and R 3 are independently hydrogen, wherein Ar is optionally substituted phenyl; R 2 is selected from the group consisting of pyrrolidine, hexamethylenemino, and piperidino; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of solvate thereof. 2. The method of claim 1 wherein said compound is the hydrochloride salt thereof. 3. The method of claim 1 wherein said compound is or its hydrochloride salt. 4. The method of claim 1 wherein said ulcerative mucositis is oral. 5. The method of claim 1 wherein said ulcerative mucositis is induced by cancer therapy.", "related_docs": [], "pct_data": [], "external_files": [{"file": "US06274601-20010814-C00001.CDX", "format":

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, methods for preparing the compounds and their use as medicaments. More specifically, compounds of the invention can be utilized in the treatment of conditions mediated by nuclear receptors, in particular the Retinoid X Receptor (RXR) and the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) families. The compounds of the invention can also be used in combination with ligands for other nuclear receptors which are known to form dimeric complexes with RXR receptors, for example the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) family. 2. Description of the Related Art Non-insulin dependant diabetes mellitus (NIDDM, Type II diabetes) is a condition characterized by abnormal and ineffective insulin action and secretion. The entry of glucose from the blood into the cells of liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue is promoted by insulin action. In the diabetic, tissues dependant on insulin are unable to assimilate glucose normally (insulin resistance), the result being an accumulation of glucose within the blood (hyperglycemia). Type II diabetes typically afflicts people over 40, and obesity is often a contributing factor. Regulation of diet and exercise can reduce to some extent the problems associated with NIDDM, but commonly insulin therapy or other oral hypoglycemic agents are the treatments of choice. In addition to the range of insulin formulations, the most widely used hypoglycemic agents to date are sulphonylureas but in respective cases potentially fatal hyperinsulinemia or hypoglycemia can develop, and additional problems involving the cardiovascular, renal, neural and visual systems can also ensue. More recently, a class of compounds termed thiazolidinediones (e.g., ciglitazone, pioglitazone, englitazone, troglitazone and BRL 49653) have been shown to reduce hyperglycemia by promoting insulin action without additional insulin secretion, and without causing undesirable hypoglycemia, even at elevated doses. Their effect is proposed to be a result of agonism at the PPAR receptor. Even more recently, it has been reported that RXR agonists such as LGD 1069 and LG 100268 activate RXR/PPAR heterodimers, causing reduction in glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels in ob/ob and db/db mice (Mukherjee et al., Nature 1997, 386, 407410, Heyman and Mukherjee WO 97/10819). This effect is due to activation at the RXR part of the heterodimer. In turn these RXR/PPAR heterodimers can also be activated by PPAR agonists (e.g., thiazolidinediones) to give a similar effect, and it has been shown that at submaximal levels of either the RXR or PPAR agonist, addition of the complimentary agonist provides an additive and possibly synergistic response, and results in enhanced transcription and subsequently additional lowering of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia. It has therefore been proposed that compounds acting as agonists at both the RXR and PPAR receptors can be used as insulin sensitizers for the treatment of Type II diabetes and related symptoms. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the major cause of death in Type 2 diabetic and metabolic syndrome patients (i.e., patients that fall within the deadly quartet category of impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia and/or obesity). The hypolipidemic fibrates and antidiabetic thiazolidinediones separately display moderately effective triglyceride-lowering activities although they are neither potent nor efficacious enough to be a single therapy of choice for the dyslipidemia often observed in Type 2 diabetic or metabolic syndrome patients. The thiazolidinediones also potently lower circulating glucose levels of Type 2 diabetic animal models and humans. However, the fibrate class of compounds are without beneficial effects on glycemia. Studies on the molecular actions of these compounds indicate that thiazolidinediones and fibrates exert their action by activating distinct transcription factors of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) family, resulting in increased and decreased expression of specific enzymes and apolipoproteins respectively, both key players in regulation of plasma triglyceride content. Fibrates, on the one hand, are PPAR activators, acting primarily in the liver. Thiazolidinediones, on the other hand, are high affinity ligands for PPAR acting primarily on adipose tissue. Adipose tissue plays a central role in lipid homeostasis and the maintenance of energy balance in vertebrates. Adipocytes store energy in the form of triglycerides during periods of nutritional affluence and release it in the form of free fatty acids at times of nutritional deprivation. The development of white adipose tissue is the result of a continuous differentiation process throughout life. Much evidence points to the central role of PPAR activation in initiating and regulating this cell differentiation. Several highly specialized proteins are induced during adipocyte differentiation, most of them being involved in lipid storage and metabolism. The exact link from activation of PPAR to changes in glucose metabolism, most notably a decrease in insulin resistance in muscle, has not yet been clarified. A possible link is via free fatty acids such that activation of PPAR induces Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL), Fatty Acid Transport Protein (FATP) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase (ACS) in adipose tissue but not in muscle tissue. This, in turn, reduces the concentration of free fatty acids in plasma dramatically, and due to substrate competition at the cellular level, skeletal muscle and other tissues with high metabolic rates eventually switch from fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation with decreased insulin resistance as a consequence. PPAR is involved in stimulating -oxidation of fatty acids. In rodents, a PPAR-mediated change in the expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism lies at the basis of the phenomenon of peroxisome proliferation, a pleiotropic cellular response, mainly limited to liver and kidney and which can lead to hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents. The phenomenon of peroxisome proliferation is not seen in man. In addition to its role in peroxisome proliferation in rodents, PPAR is also involved in the control of HDL cholesterol levels in rodents and humans. This effect is, at least partially, based on a PPAR-mediated transcriptional regulation of the major HDL apolipoproteins, apo A-I and apo A-II. The hypotriglyceridemic action of fibrates and fatty acids also involves PPAR and can be summarized as follows: (I) an increased lipolysis and clearance of remnant particles, due to changes in lipoprotein lipase and apo C-III levels, (II) a stimulation of cellular fatty acid uptake and their subsequent conversion to acyl-CoA derivatives by the induction of fatty acid binding protein and acyl-CoA synthase, (III) an induction of fatty acid-oxidation pathways, (IV) a reduction in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis, and finally (V) a decrease in VLDL production. Hence, both enhanced catabolism of triglyceride-rich particles as well as reduced secretion of VLDL particles constitutes mechanisms that contribute to the hypolipidemic effect of fibrates. A number of compounds have been reported to be useful in the treatment of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia (U.S. Pat. No. 5,306,726, PCT Publications nos.

In accordance with the present invention a compound of formula I can be prepared in the following ways: By alkylating Ia under Friedel Craft condition with a suitable acid chloride containing linker L to give II The intermediate II can then directly (e.g., via chloride) or after conversion of L, to contain an appropriate leaving group (e.g., reduction of carbonyl group to a hydroxy and then to phosphor under Mitsunobu conditions), be reacted with III to give IV R can be either carboxaldehyde (CHO) or R is as defined in formula I and IV is then I. b) When R is carboxaldehyde on either III or on IV, R can be reacted with the appropriate nucleopholic reagent (e.g., alkoxy-acetic acid ester-Wittig reagent to give the alkoxy-acrylic acid esters; or 2,4-thiazolidinedione to give benzylidene-thiazolidinediones) to give V The double bond can then be reduced to give I or the intermediate III (which can be coupled to II). The intermediate III can also be a tyrosine derivative obtained by reacting tyrosine ester with the appropriate R 3 -reagent (e.g., 2-benzoylcyclohexanone or alkylhalogenide). Alcohols can be prepared by reduction of carboxylic acids and derivatives (for example, esters, acid chlorides) with metal hydrides. Aldehydes can be prepared by oxidation of alcohols (for example, with tetrapropyammonium perruthenate or dimethylsulphoxideloxalyl chloride) or reduction of carboxylic acid esters (for example, with diisobutyl aluminium hydride). Ketones can be prepared by reaction of carboxylic acid derivatives such as N-methyl-N-methoxy amides with Grignard reagents (Weinreb Tet. Lett. 1981, 22, 3815-3819). Ethers can be prepared from alcohols under standard Williamson conditions. Carboxylic acids can be prepared by oxidation of alcohols or aldehydes using mild oxidizing agents (for example, pyridinium dichromate in dimethylformamide). In cases where a reaction may be inhibited by a reactive functional group contained in the molecule, for example alcohols, aldehydes, ketones or acids, the corresponding silyl ethers, acetals, ketals or esters can be prepared and later removed using standard protection/deprotection protocols known in the art. (Kocienski, Protecting Groups, Thieme 1994). In the case of R 5 being an amino group, protection as an amide by reaction with an activated acyl group is possible, alternatively it is possible to prepare the amino group at a later stage from the corresponding aryl halide by reactions known in the art. Pharmacological Methods In vitro PPAR alpha and PPAR Gamma Activation Activity Principle The PPAR gene transcription activation assays were based on transient transfection into human HEK293 cells of two plasmids encoding a chimeric test protein and a reporter protein respectively. The chimeric test protein was a fusion of the DNA binding domain (DBD) from the yeast GAL4 transcription factor to the ligand binding domain (LB D) of the human PPAR proteins. The PPAR LBD harbored in addition to the ligand binding pocket also the native activation domain (activating function 2AF2) allowing the fusion protein to function as a PPAR ligand dependent transcription factor. The GAL4 DBD will force the fusion protein to bind only to Gal4 enhancers (of which none existed in HEK293 cells). The reporter plasmid contained a Gal4 enhancer driving the expression of the firefly luciferase protein. After transfection, HEK293 cells expressed the GAL4-DBD-PPAR-LBD fusion protein. The fusion protein will in turn bind to the Gal4 enhancer controlling the luciferase expression, and do nothing in the absence of ligand. Upon addition to the cells of a PPAR ligand, luciferase protein will be produced in amounts corresponding to the activation of the PPAR protein. The amount of luciferase protein is measured by light emission after addition of the appropriate substrate. Methods Cell culture and transfection: HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM10% FCS, 1% PS. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates the day before transfection to give a confluency of 80 % at transfection. 0.8 g DNA per well was transfected using FuGene transfection reagent according to the manufacturers instructions (Boehringer-Mannheim). Cells were allowed to express protein for 48 h followed by addition of compound. Plasmids: Human PPAR and was obtained by PCR amplification using cDNA templates from liver, intestine and adipose tissue respectively. Amplified cDNAs were cloned into pCR2.1 and sequenced. The LBD from each isoform PPAR was generated by PCR (PPAR: aa 167-C-term; PPAR: aa 165-C-term) and fused to GAL4-DBD by subcloning fragments in frame into the vector pM1 generating the plasmids pM1LBD and pM1LBD. Ensuing fusions were verified by sequencing. The reporter was constructed by inserting an oligonucleotide encoding five repeats of the Gal4 recognition sequence into the pGL2 vector (Promega). Compounds: All compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted 1:1000 upon addition to the cells. Cells were treated with compound (1:1000 in 200 l growth medium including delipidated serum) for 24 h followed by luciferase assay. Luciferase assay: Medium including test compound was aspirated and 100 l PBS incl. 1 mM Mg and Ca was added to each well. The luciferase assay was performed using the LucLite kit according to the manufacturers instructions (Packard Instruments). Light emission was quantified by counting SPC mode on a Packard Instruments top-counter. Molecular Biology Characterization of RXR Activating Compounds Competitive Binding Assay: The method involves direct interaction between ligand and RXR and was analyzed by displacement of RXR bound 3 H 9-cis RA (retinoic acid) in a competition assay essentially as described (Levin et al. Nature 1992, 355, 359-361 and Heyman et al. Cell 1992, 68, 397-406). Briefly, extracts of infected baculovirus cells expressing recombinant RXRa is used as source of binding activity. The compound of interest is incubated in the presence of 3 H 9-cis RA with RXRa containing extract. Bound probe is separated from unbound through sephadex G50 chromatography. The amount of remaining bound 3 H 9-cis RA was quantitated by scintillation counting. RXR Transcriptional Activation: The activation potential of a given compound was studied in a transient trans-activation assay, essentially as described (Heyman et al. Cell 1992, 68, 397406 and Tate et al. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1994, 14, 2323-2330). Expression plasmids encoding RXRa and a DR5 (direct repeat N 5 ) driven luciferase reporter plasmid was cotransfected into eucaryotic cells. Transfections also contained a plasmid constitutively expressing b-galactosidase (pCMVbgal) and carrier DNA (pGEM). 48 h after transfection cells were washed in PBS and re-fed medium containing ligand or vehicle (DMSO or Ethanol). Following overnight incubation cells were lysed and assayed for luciferse activity. Activation is expressed as the relative amount of luciferase activity (normalized to b-galactosidase activity) in treated versus untreated samples. To determine the specificity of the ligands all were assayed on several nuclear receptors, most notably on RAR. For example, 9-cis retinoic acid (RA) activates both RXR and RAR whereas all-trans RA displays selectivity for RAR, (Heyman et al. Cell 1992, 68, 397406).

The formulations may also include wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, preserving agents, sweetening agents or flavoring agents. The formulations of the invention may be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained, or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures well known in the art. The pharmaceutical compositions can be sterilized and mixed, if desired, with auxiliary agents, emulsifiers, salt for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers and/or coloring substances and the like, which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds. The route of administration may be any route, which effectively transports the active compound to the appropriate or desired site of action, such as oral, nasal, pulmonary, transdermal or parenteral, e.g., rectal, depot, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraurethral, intramuscular, intranasal, ophthalmic solution or an ointment, the oral route being preferred. If a solid carrier is used for oral administration, the preparation may be tabletted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form or it can be in the form of a troche or lozenge. If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation may be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule or sterile injectable liquid such as an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspension or solution. For nasal administration, the preparation may contain a compound of formula I dissolved or suspended in a liquid carrier, in particular an aqueous carrier, for aerosol application. The carrier may contain additives such as solubilizing agents, e.g., propylene glycol, surfactants, absorption enhancers such as lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) or cyclodextrin, or preservatives such as parabens. For parenteral application, particularly suitable are injectable solutions or suspensions, preferably aqueous solutions with the active compound dissolved in polyhydroxylated castor oil. Tablets, dragees, or capsules having talc and/or a carbohydrate carrier or binder or the like are particularly suitable for oral application. Preferable carriers for tablets, dragees, or capsules include lactose, corn starch, and/or potato starch. A syrup or elixir can be used in cases where a sweetened vehicle can be employed.

The abovementioned general or preferred definitions of radicals or illustrations can be combined with each other as desired, that is to say combinations between the respective ranges and preferred ranges are also possible. The definitions apply to the end products and, correspondingly, to the precursors and intermediates. Preference according to the invention is given to compounds of the formula (I) which contain a combination of the definitions given above as being preferred (preferably). Particular preference according to the invention is given to compounds of the formula (I) which contain a combination of the definitions given above as being particularly preferred. Very particular preference according to the invention is given to compounds of the formula (I) which contain a combination of the definitions given above as being very particularly preferred. Saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon radicals such as alkyl or alkenyl may bealso in connection with hetero atoms such as, for example, in alkoxyin each case straight-chain or branched as far as this is possible. Optionally substituted radicals may be mono- or polysubstituted, the substituents in the case of polysubstitution being identical or different. If several radicals have identical indices, such as, for example, m radicals R 5 in the case m1, these radicals may be identical or different. If, for example, 1-(4-ethyl-2-methyl-phenyl)-5-(2-methylbenzoyl)-1-pentyl-ammonium trifluoroacetate is employed as starting material, the course of the reaction of process (A) according to the invention may be illustrated by the following scheme: If, for example, 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-cyclopentanone O-methanesulphonyloxime and 2-tolylmagnesium bromide are employed as starting materials, the course of the reaction of process (B) according to the invention may be illustrated by the following scheme: If, for example, 2-(2-methylphenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole and 4-cyanomethoxyphenylboronic acid are employed as starting materials, the course of the reaction of process (C) according to the invention may be illustrated by the following scheme: If, for example, 2-(2-bromo-4-fluoro-6-methyl-phenyl)-5-(3-chloro-4-hydroxybiphenyl-4-yl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole and methyl -bromovalerate are employed as starting materials, the course of the reaction of process (D) according to the invention may be illustrated by the following scheme: If, for example, 6-(4-cyclopropylcarbonylmethoxy-3-trifluoromethoxy-biphenyl-4-yl)-(2-methyl phenyl)-3,4,5,6,-tetrahydropyridine and o-methylhydroxylamine are employed as starting materials, the course of tile reaction of process (E) according to the invention may be illustrated by the following scheme The aminoketones required for carrying out process (A) according to the invention are defined in a general way by the formula (II). In this formula, Ar 1 , Ar 2 and n each preferably have those meanings already mentioned in connection with the description of the cyclic imines of the formula (I) as preferred. The aminoketones of the formula (II) are novel. Aminoketones of the formula (II) can be prepared, for example, by detaching the BOC (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protecting group of the aminoketone derivatives of the formula (VIII) which are also new in a process (A.a) according to the scheme below: The reaction can be carried out, if appropriate, in the presence of a solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane by means of conventional methods for detaching a tert-butyloxycarbonyl amino protecting group, preferably by acidolysis using tri-fluoroacetic acid (cf. for example T. W. Greene, P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Ed., John Wiley Sons, New York 1991). Here, the aminoketones of the formula (II) are preferably isolated as salts of an organic or inorganic Bronstedt acid, such as, for example, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, methanesulphonic acid, trifluoromethanesulphonic acid or toluenesulphonic acid. Aminoketone derivatives of the formula (VIII) can be prepared for example by reacting BOC-protected lactams of the formula (IX) with metalated aromatics of the formula (X) at temperatures between 0 C. and 80 C. according to the following scheme: In the formula (X), Met represents a monovalent metal radical such as Li, MgI, MgBr or MgCl. Some of the metalated aromatics of the formula (X) are known, or they can be prepared by known methods such as, for example, lithiation or Grignard reaction, from the corresponding aromatics or halogenoaromatics. Protected lactams of the formula (IX) are obtained, for example, by BOC-protecting lactams of the formula (XI) by conventional methods such as, for example, metalation with butyllithium and reaction with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (cf. for example T. W. Greene, P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Ed., John Wiley Sons, New York 1991). Lactams of the formula (XI) can be prepared, for example, starting from -alkoxylactams of the formula (XII) by two methods. They can be reacted with aromatics of the formula (XIII) in the presence of an acid catalyst, such as, for example, sulphuric acid, acetic acid or aluminum chloride, and optionally in the presence of a diluent, such as, for example, dichloromethane or acetonitrile, according to the following scheme: Alternatively, they can be reacted with aryl Grignard compounds of the formula (XIV) in the presence of a diluent, such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran, according to the following scheme cf. Org. Prep. Proced. Int. 25, 255 (1993): In the formula (XII) R 28 represents methyl or ethyl. In the formula (XIV), Hal represents chlorine, bromine or iodine. The -alkoxylactams of the formula (XII) are known and some of them are commercially available. They can be prepared for example from the corresponding unsubstituted imides by cathodic or sodium boranate reduction or from the unsubstituted lactams by anodic oxidation, in each case in the presence of methanol or ethanol (cf. for example J. Org. Chem. 56, 1822 (1991); Synthesis 1980, 315). The aromatics of the formula (XIII) are benzene derivatives which are generally known or which can be prepared by employing, a wide variety of generally known methods of organic chemistry. The aryl Grignard compounds of the formula (XIV) can be prepared in a conventional manner from the corresponding aryl halides and magnesium. Aryl halides are generally known compounds of organic chemistry. Lactams of the formula (XI) can also be prepared for example by cyclizing substituted -benzoylcarboxylic acids of the formula (XV) with a reagent prepared from ammonium carbonate and formic acid at boiling point according to the following scheme cf. Recl. Trav. Chim. Bays-Bas 81, 788 (1962): The -benzoylcarboxylic acids of the formula (XV) required here can be prepared for example by reacting the dicarboxylic anhydrides of the formula (XVI) with aromatics of the formula (XIII) in the presence of a Lewis acid such as, for example, aluminum chloride and, if appropriate, in the presence of a diluent such as, for example, benzene, according to the following scheme cf. Recl. Trav. Chim. Bays-Bas 81, 788 (1962): The anhydrides required here are (succinic and glutaric anhydride) or were (adipic anhydride) commercially available for the preparation of adipic anhydride cf. for example Chem. Ber. 120, 285 (1987). If Ar 2 in the active compound of the formula (I) according to the invention represents an optionally substituted biphenylyl such as in the formula (I-b) shown further above, the corresponding biphenyllactams of the formula (XI-a) can be prepared in an advantageous variant of the process described here by reacting, by the method of the process (C), described above and further below, certain phenyllactams of the formula (XVII) with boronic acids of the formula (VI) according to the following scheme: The phenyllactams of the formula (XVII) in which X 1 represents bromine or iodine are a subset of the compounds of the formula (XI) whose preparation is described above. The phenyllactams of the formula (XVII) in which X 1 represents trifluoromethanesulphonyl can be prepared by the method of process (C) from the corresponding compounds of the formula (XI) in which Ar 2 is substituted by R 4 hydroxyl. The novel aminoketones of the formula (II) can also be prepared, for example, by reducing the nitro group of the nitroketones of the formula (XVIII) which are also novel in a process (A.b) according to the following scheme: The reduction can be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation or other generally known methods for reducing nitro groups (cf. for example Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, Volume 11/1, 394-409 and Volume 4/1c, 490-506). Preference is given to the methods where the reaction is carried out in acid medium, since the aminoketones of the formula (II) are preferably isolated as salts. Nitroketones of the formula (XVIII) can be prepared for example by condensing -chloroalkylphenylketones of the formula (XXI) in the presence of a diluent such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, another lower aliphatic alcohol or tetrahydrofuran and in the presence of an acid binding agent such as, for example, sodium hydride or an alkali metal alkoxide, preferably of the corresponding alcohol employed as diluent, according to the scheme below: The -chloroalkylphenylketones of the formula (XXI) are commercially available, known or can be prepared by employing known methods, for example by Friedel-Crafts-acylation of corresponding benzene derivatives of the formula (XXII) (see below) with 3-chloropropionyl chloride, 4-chlorobutyryl chloride or 5-chloropentanoic acid chloride. The nitromethylbenzenes of the formula (XIX) are known or can be prepared in a known manner, such as, for example, by nitration of the corresponding toluenes in the side chain or reaction of the corresponding benzyl halides with silver nitrite cf. for example J. Am. Chem. Soc. 77, 6269 (1955); J. Am. Chem. Soc. 86, 2681 (1964); Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, Volume 10/1, 46-57 (halogen substitution), Volume E16, 145-154 (both methods). The toluenes or benzyl halides required are generally known compounds of organic chemistry. The nitroketones of the formula (XVIII) in which n equals 1 (XVIII-a) can be prepared for example by Michael addition of nitromethylbenzenes of the formula (XIX) to phenyl vinyl ketones of the formula (XX) in the presence of a diluent such as, for example, methanol, ethanol or another lower aliphatic alcohol and in the presence of an acid binder such as, for example, preferably an alkali metal alkoxide of the corresponding alcohol employed as diluent, according to the scheme below (cf. for example J. Prakt. Chem., Series 4, 1, 57 (1955); Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, Volume 10/1, 199-206): The phenyl vinyl ketones of the formula (XX) can be prepared for example by eliminating hydrogen chloride from -chloropropiophenones of the formula (XXI-a) which are obtainable for example by Friedel-Crafts acylation of the corresponding benzene derivatives of the formula (XXII) with 3-chloropropionyl chloride, in the presence of an acid binder such as, for example, potassium acetate and in the presence of a diluent such as, for example, methanol, according to the following scheme cf. for example J. Prakt. Chem., Series 4, 1, 57 (1955): Some of the benzene derivatives of the formula (XXII) are commercially available or known, or they can be prepared by generally known methods of the chemistry of aromatics. The phenyl vinyl ketones of the formula (XX) can also be prepared by reacting O-methyl methylbenzohydroxamates of the formula (XXIII) with vinyl magnesium bromide according to the following scheme: Some of the O-methyl methylbenzohydroxamates of the formula (XXIII) are known (Weinreb amides), or they can be prepared by known methods, for example from the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives cf. for example Tetrahedron Lett. 22, 3815 (1981). Since some of the phenyl vinyl ketones of the formula (XX) are unstable they are, in a preferred variant for preparing the nitroketones of the formula (XVIII-a), directly reacted with nitromethylbenzenes of the formula (XIX). Nitroketones of the formula (XVIII-a) can also be prepared by adding enamines of methyl phenyl ketones of the formula (XXVI) to -nitrostyrenes of the formula (XXVII) and hydrolyzing the reaction product under acidic conditions according to the following scheme: In the formulae (XXIV), (XXV) and (XXVI), R 29 and R 30 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached represent a cyclic amino radical such as, for example, 1-pyrrolidino, 1-piperidino or 4-morpholino. In most instances, the addition proceeds in a 42-cycloaddition to afford 1,2-oxazine N-oxide derivatives of the formula (XXV) which can be isolated, and the reaction is, if appropriate, carried out in the presence of an a polar diluent such as, for example, diethyl ether, at, for example, 80 to 20 C. The hydrolysis is carried out using for example aqueous mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, if appropriate in the presence of methanol or ethanol cf. for example Helv. Chim. Acta 68, 162 (1985); Tetrahedron 45, 2099 (1989). In many instances it is advantageous first to open the ring to afford compounds of the formula (XXIV) by simple dissolution of the 1,2-oxazine N-oxide derivative in methanol or ethanol, since the undesirable Nef reaction which yields the corresponding diketo compound will otherwise take place as a competing reaction cf. for example Tetrahedron 45, 2099 (1989). Some of the enamines of the formula (XXVI) are known, or they can be prepared for example from appropriately substituted acetophenones and cyclic amines by standard procedures (for example Org. Syntheses Vol. 58, 56, John Wiley Sons, New York). Some of the acetophenones required are commercially available or known, or they can be prepared by known methods of the chemistry of aromatics. Some of the nitrostyrenes of the formula (XXVII) are known, or they can be prepared for example by formulation of the nitromethylbenzenes of the formula (XIX) given above (cf. for example Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, Volume E16, 215). The novel aminoketones of the formula (II) can also be prepared for example by hydrolyzing imines of the formula (XXVIII) in a process (A.c) according to the following scheme: The hydrolysis can be carried out by generally known methods for example using aqueous hydrochloric acid. Here, the aminoketones of the formula (II) are also preferably isolated as their salts, for example as hydrochlorides, as described further above. The imines of the formula (XXVIII) in which n equals 1 (XXVIII-a) can be prepared for example by carrying, out Michael additions of N-diphenylmethylenebenzylamines of the formula (XXIX) to phenyl vinyl ketones of the formula (XX) according to the following scheme: The addition is carried out in the presence of an acid binder and in the presence of a diluent such as, for example, acetonitrile or dichloromethane and, if appropriate, in the presence of a reaction auxiliary, for example at room temperature. A preferred acid binder is aqueous alkali such as 50% strength aqueous sodium hydroxide solution in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst such as, for example, triethylbenzylammonium chloride as reaction auxiliary cf. for example Synth. Commun. 17, 211 (1987). The preparation of the phenyl vinyl ketones of the formula (XX) is described further above. The N-dimethylmethylenebenzylamines of the formula (XXIX) are obtained for example by reacting the corresponding benzylamines with benzophenone (cf. for example Tetrahedron Lett. 1978, 2641). The benzylamines required for this purpose are known, or they can be prepared by known methods such as, for example, aminolysis of the corresponding benzyl halides (see above). The cyclic O-methanesulphonyl oximes required for carrying out process (B) according to the invention are defined in a general way by the formula (III). In this formula Ar 2 and n both preferably have those meanings already mentioned in connection with the description of cyclic amines of the formula (I) as preferred. The O-methanesulphonyl oximes of the formula (III) are novel. The O-methylsulphonyl oximes of the formula (III) can be prepared for example by first converting cyclic -aryl ketones of the formula (XXXI) by generally known methods into their oximes of the formula (XXX) and then reacting these with methanesulphonyl chloride by the method of the mesylation of alcohols according to the following scheme: Cyclic -aryl ketones of the formula (XXXI) can be prepared for example by epoxidizing 1-arylcycloalkenes of the formula (XXXIII) by conventional methods, for example using m-chloroperbenzoic acid, to give oxiranes of the formula (XXXII), and then isomerizing these by acid work-up according to the following scheme cf. for example Tetrahedron 30, 2027 (1974): Of course it is also possible to isomerize oxiranes of the formula (XXXII) obtained by different routes to cyclic -aryl ketones of the formula (XXXI), for example by shaking a solution in chloroform with 20% strength sulphuric acid. 1-arylcycloalkenes of the formula (XXXIII) can be prepared for example by reacting the aryl Grignard compounds of the formula (XIV) described further above with ketones of the formula (XXXV) under usual Grignard conditions and dehydrating the cyclic benzyl alcohols of the formula (XXXIV), for example obtained in this manner, according to the following scheme: The dehydration can be carried out for example by dissolving the alcohol in a little of a polar solvent such as hexane and stirring with half-concentrated sulphuric acid, for example at 0 to 20 C. cf. for example Tetrahedron 30, 2027 (1974).

Industrial materials are to be understood as meaning, in the present context, non-live materials, such as, preferably, synthetic materials, glues, sizes, paper and board, leather, wood and timber products, and paint. The materials to be very particularly preferably protected against attack by insects are wood and timber products. Wood and timber products which can be protected by the composition according to the invention or mixtures comprising such a composition are to be understood as meaning, for example, construction timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, jetties, wooden vehicles, boxes, pallets, containers, telephone poles, wood lagging, windows and doors made of wood, plywood, particle board, joiners articles, or wood products which, quite generally, are used in the construction of houses or in joinery. The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or generally customary formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes. This formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersant and/or binder or fixative, water repellent, if appropriate desiccants and UV stabilizers and, if appropriate, colorants and pigments and other processing auxiliaries. The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for the protection of wood and wooden materials comprise the active compound according to the invention at a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight. The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the species and the occurrence of the insects and on the medium. The optimum rate of application can be determined upon use in each case by test series. However, in general, it suffices to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be protected. The solvent and/or diluent used is an organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an oily or oil-type organochemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water and, if appropriate, an emulsifier and/or wetting agent. Organochemical solvents which are preferably employed are oily or oil-like solvents having an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30 C., preferably above 45 C. Substances which are used as such oily and oil-like solvents which have low volatility and are insoluble in water are suitable mineral oils or their aromatic fractions, or mineral-oil-containing solvent mixtures, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene. Substances which are advantageously used are mineral oils with a boiling range of 170 to 220 C., white spirit with a boiling range of 170 to 220 C., spindle oil with a boiling range of 250 to 350 C., petroleum or aromatics of boiling, range 160 to 280 C., essence of turpentine and the like. In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 180 to 210 C. or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with a boiling range of 180 to 220 C. and/or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene, preferably -monochloronaphthalene, are used. The organic oily or oil-like solvents of low volatility and having an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30 C., preferably above 45 C., can be partially replaced by organochemical solvents of high or medium volatility, with the proviso that the solvent mixture also has an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30 C., preferably above 45 C., and that the insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture. In a preferred embodiment, part of the organochemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced by an aliphatic polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture. Substances which are preferably used are aliphatic organochemical solvents having hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups, such as, for example, glycol ether, esters and the like. The organochemical binders used within the scope of the present invention are the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se and can be diluted with water and/or are soluble or dispersible or emulsifiable in the organochemical solvents employed, in particular binders composed of, or comprising, an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenol resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene/coumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin. The artificial resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Up to 10% by weight of bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binder. In addition, colorants, pigments, water repellents, odour-masking substances and inhibitors or anticorrosives known per se and the like can also be employed. The composition or the concentrate preferably comprises, in accordance with the invention, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil as the organochemical binder. Preferably used according to the invention are alkyd resins with an oil content of over 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight. All or some of the abovementioned binder can be replaced by a fixative (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent volatilization of the active compounds and crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of binder employed). The plasticizers are from the chemical classes of the phthalic esters, such as dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthialate or benzylbutyl phthalate, the phosphoric esters, such as tributyl phosphate, the adipic esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, the stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, the oleates, such as butyl oleate, the glycerol ethers or relatively high-molecular-weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic esters. Fixatives are chemically based on polyvinyl alkyl ethers, such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl ether, or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylenebenzophenone. Particularly suitable as a solvent or diluent is also water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or more of the abovementioned organochemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersants. Particularly effective protection of wood is achieved by large-scale industrial impregnation processes, for example vacuum, double-vacuum or pressure processes. If appropriate, the ready-to-use compositions can additionally comprise other insecticides and, if appropriate, additionally one or more fungicides. Suitable additional components which may be admixed are, preferably, the insecticides and fungicides mentioned in WO 94/29 268.

Rice seedlings ( Oryzae sativa ) are treated by being dipped into the preparation of the active compound of the desired concentration and are infested with larvae of the green rice leaf hopper ( Nephotettix cincticeps ) while the seedlings are still moist. After the desired period of time, the destruction in % is determined. 100% means that all the leaf hoppers have been killed; 0% means that none of the leaf hoppers have been killed. In this test, for example the compound of Preparation Example I-1 exhibited a degree of destruction of 100% after 6 days at an exemplary active compound concentration of 0.1%. Example D Mvzus Test Solvent: 7 parts by weight of dimethylformamide Emulsifier: 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent and the stated amount of emulsifier, and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration. Cabbage leaves ( Brassica oleracea ) which are severely infested with the (green peach aphid ( Myzus persicae ) are treated by being dipped into the preparation of the active compound of the desired concentration. After the desired period of time, the destruction % is determined. 100% means that all the aphids have been killed; 0% means that none of the aphids have been killed. In this test, for example the following compounds exhibited good activity: TABLE D Active compound Degree of Active compound concentration in % destruction after 6 days 0.1 90 Example I-1 0.1 100 Example I-2 Example E Tetranychus test (OP resistant/dip treatment) Solvent: 3 parts by weight of dimethylformamide Emulsifier: 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether To prepare a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent and the stated amount of emulsifier, and the concentrate is diluted with emulsifier-containing water to the desired concentration. Beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris ) which are strongly infested by all stages of the common spider mite ( Tetranychus urticae ) are dipped into an active compound preparation of the desired concentration. After the desired time, the activity in % is determined. 100% means that all spider mites have been killed; 0% means that none of the spider mites have been killed. In this test, for example the compound of Preparation Example I-2 exhibited a degree of destruction of 100% after 7 days at an exemplary active compound concentration of 0.001%. Example F Blow fly larvae test/development-inhibitory action Test animals: All larval stages of Lucilia cuprina (OP resistant) Pupae and adults (without contact with the active compound) Solvent: 35 parts by weight of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether 35 parts by weight of nonylphenol polyglycol ether To prepare a suitable formulation, 3 parts by weight of active compound are mixed with 7 parts by weight of the abovementioned solvent-emulsifier mixture, and the resulting emulsion concentrate is diluted with water to the concentration desired in each case. For each concentration, 30 to 50 larvae are transferred to horse meat (1 cm 3 ) located in glass tubes, and 500 l of the test dilution are pipetted onto the meat. The glass tubes are placed into plastic beakers whose bottom is covered with sea sand and kept in a controlled-environment cabinet (26 C.1.5 C., 70% relative humidity 10%). The activity is checked after 24 hours and 48 hours (larvicidal action). After the larvae have left (about 72 h), the glass tubes are removed and perforated plastic lids are placed on the beakers. After 1 times the development period (hatching of the control flies), the hatched flies and the pupae/puparia are counted. The criterion for the action is death in the treated larvae after 48 h (larvicidal effect), or inhibition of adults hatching from the pupae or inhibition of pupation. The criterion for the in-vitro action of a substance is the inhibition of fly development or a standstill of development prior to the adult stage. 100% larvicidal activity means that all the larvae have died after 48 hours. 100% development-inhibitory activity means that no adult flies have hatched. In this test, for example the compound of Preparation Example I-1 exhibited an activity of 100% at an exemplary active compound concentration of 1000 ppm. Example G Ecdysis test on polyphargus tick nymphs Test animals: Amblyomma variegatium , ticks which have sucked themselves full Solvent: 35 parts by weight of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether 35 parts by weight of nonylphenol polyglycol ether To prepare a suitable formulation, 3 parts by weight of active compound are mixed with 7 parts of the abovementioned solvent-emulsifier mixture, and the resulting emulsion concentrate is diluted with water to the concentration desired in each case. 10 Nymphs which have sucked themselves full are immersed for 1 minute into the preparation of active compound to be tested. The animals are transferred to Petri dishes (09.5 cm) equipped with filter paper discs and covered. After the nymphs have remained in a controlled-environment cabinet for 4 weeks, the ecdysis rate is determined. 100% means that all the animals have undergone normal ecdysis; 0% means that none of the animals have undergone normal ecdysis. In this test, for example the compounds of Preparation Examples I-1 and I-2 showed an activity of in each case 100% at an exemplary active compound concentration of 1000 ppm. What is claimed is: 1.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention concerns methods for inhibiting pathological conditions which are susceptible or partially susceptible to inhibition by an estrogen, antiestrogen or estrogen agonist. Such conditions include uterine cancer, adjuvant breast cancer, breast disorder, male breast cancer, migraine, incontinence, vaginal atrophy, bladder infection, senile gynecomastia, diabetes, hypoglycemia, failure of would healing, melanoma, impotence, inflammatory bowel disease, CNS and GI disorders caused by an excess of tackykinins, decreased libido, immune system disorders, decreased fertility, pulmonary hypertensive disease, acne, seborrhea, autoimmune disease, Tumers syndrome, hirsutism, disorders related to an excess of neurokinin and obsessive-compulsive disorders including smoking and alcohol abuse. Changes in the appearance and texture of the skin with increasing age has been proverbial and well documented both quantitatively and qualitatively. It is a subject which is highly subjective in its evaluation and its ultimate effect on the individual. By in large the effect of the general atrophy of skin with age is cosmetic, but can have pathological consequences, many of which are psychological in nature, i.e., the feeling of getting old, depression, loss of sexual attractiveness, etc. In some cases, the atrophy of the skin in older people can have direct pathologies associated with it, e.g., the ability of the skin to repair in wound healing. In general, the atrophy of the skin is considered a normal and progressive consequence of the aging process-and taken with good grace. Despite the normal acceptance of aging, there is a particular time in a womans life, i.e., the menopause, when the progressive aging pattern is greatly accelerated, especially with regard to atrophy of the vagina and skin. It is often this rapid acceleration and suddenness of change which can be contributory to pathological and psychological distress. Additionally, vaginal atrophy can lead to discomfort, e.g., itching, dryness, and painful intercourse, which can lead to a loss of sexual enjoyment and conjugal harmony and in some cases be causal in social sequelae such as divorce. As mentioned before, the atrophy or aging of the skin can have both qualitative and quantitative aspects. The qualitative aspects are: the change of smoothness and texture, thus causing a roughness in look and feel on the outer surface of the skin, the change of elasticity of the skin, thus effecting the mechanical properties of the skin, and the changes in skin pigmentation. These qualitative changes result in the commonly described condition of atrophied skin as: wrinkled, rough, withered, and spotty. Quantitatively, skin aging in post-menopausal women can be measured as: a decrease in the mitotic rate of keratinocytes, changes in dermal thickness, decrease in glycosaminoglycans and soluble collagen which are linked to the moisture content-of the skin, and the decrease in the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline, a measure of decrease collagen turnover. The qualitative changes in the skin, i.e., sightlessness and mechanical properties, are the result of the quantitative changes, i.e., loss or change of the extra-cellular matrix components. Therefore, it is possible to evaluate a beneficial effect of a therapy for post-menopausal skin atrophy without totally relying on subjective analysis, even though a subjective improvement may be the ultimate desired effect. In the case of vaginal atrophy, the quantitative aspect is the amount of vaginal moisture which is controlled by the amount of secretion from glands in the dermis, the qualitative result is subjective comfort. Currently, there are two major therapies available for the treatment of skin and vaginal atrophy in post-menopausal women. The first therapy is strictly a cosmetic approach, e.g., the use of make-up, skin moisturizers, night cremes, vaginal lubricants, etc. Although this cosmetic therapy does not affect the underlying physiological cause of the atrophy, often it does achieve some subjective benefit for the individual. The second type of therapy involves the treatment of the underlying physiological causes with active, medicinal agents, most notably Vitamin A and estrogens: Vitamin A is used, its effectiveness is controversial, and it is known to have substantial, undesirable side-effects which limit its use. At the time of menopause, the levels of estrogen produced by the ovaries rapidly decrease. This decrease in estrogen has pronounced effects on the skin and vagina causing a rapid acceleration in the natural process of atrophy. Estrogen replacement therapy is often beneficial in treating skin and vaginal atrophy. However, estrogen replacement therapy has undesired side-effects, most serious of which is the potential for the development of the threat of cancer. The inclusion of progestinal agents leads to undesirable psychological effects. The use of estrogen replacement therapy for the sole purpose of treating skin and vaginal atrophy is not common because of the negative side-effects. Clearly, an effective and safe agent which positively effects the underlying physiology and thus improves the qualitative aspects of skin and vaginal properties in post-menopausal women would be useful. Due to the advancements in medical science, along with education, the quality and length of life have both been increased. As a result, the population, as a whole, is living longer. As such, situations which have been present but not in great numbers are becoming more numerous and recognized. One of those situations which has been present but possibly not given enough weight is sexuality in old age. While there has always been some thought that old people are incapable of engaging in sexual activities, which is somewhat supported by a definite decline in sexuality for both sexes as they get older, sexual activity among the elderly cannot be ignored. Therefore, problems associated with such activity also cannot be ignored. While the male, from the early and middle years, has a relatively steady decline in sexual capacity and activity, the same cannot be as convincingly said about women. There are reports that the sexual capacity of the female does not change much until late in life. (Kinsey, A. C., et al., Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, Saunders, Pa., pg. 353 (1953)). In particular, libido decreases substantially in a considerable percentage of cases after the menopause (Lauritzen et al., Estrogen Therapy the Benefits and Risks, 3rd International Workshop on Estrogen Therapy in Geneva, Oct. 20-21, 1977, Frontiers of Hormone Research, Vol. 5, pg. 10 (1978)). This belief is supported by Pfeiffer, E., et al., Terminus of Sexual Behavior in Middle and Old Age, Journal of the American Geriatric Society, pg. 2151-2158 (1972), and Pfeiffer et al., Sexual Behavior in Middle Life, American Journal of Psychiatry, 128, 1262-1267 (1972). In the Pfeiffer studies, a much greater decline in both sexual activity and interest among women between the ages of 45 and 71 was found as compared to men the same age, and the most dramatic change took place between 50-60 years of age, which is, of course, generally the period during which women experience menopause or are post-menopausal. In the age group of 66-71, 50% of women said they had no or little sexual interest compared with 10% of men in the same age group. While there has been no direct link between declining estrogen levels and declining sexuality, it has been stated that hormonal changes following a natural menopause, and certainly following surgical menopause, may contribute to the sexual decline in a portion of women. Exactly how menopause contributes to the loss of libido is not understood, yet seems fairly evident. (Bancroft, Human Sexuality and Its Problems, 2nd ed., pg. 292-293, (1989)). Therefore, it would be of use to find compounds which increase libido in post-menopausal women. Contraceptive methods involving the administration of chemical substances are widely practiced among women who desire to limit pregnancies. Such methods control fertility through various biological mechanisms. Among the presently used chemical methods of fertility control, the most important are those which act by means of the following: (a) suppression of ovulation through inhibition of gonadotropin release; (b) alteration of the female reproductive tract to prevent migration of sperm to the site of fertilization or, if fertilization occurs, to block implantation of the zygote (nidation); (c) spermicidal action or (d) an abortifacient. The oral contraceptives are the most prominent chemical contraceptive agents. Two types of agents are (a) estrogen combined with a progestin, and (b) a progestin alone. The contraceptives of the combined type act primarily by suppressing ovulation by negative feedback to prevent gonadotropin (LH and FSH) release by the hypothalamus, but alterations in the reproductive tract may also contribute to the antifertility effect. Such alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm migration) and in the endometrium (which decrease the likelihood of nidation). The action of a progestin alone in a very low oral dose (mini-pill) appears to involve primarily alterations in the female reproductive tract, but ovulation suppression may also occur. Although the oral contraceptives are highly effective, their use is associated with unpleasant side effects (such as nausea, depression, weight gain, and headache) and an increased long-time risk of severe disease (such as thromboembolism, stroke, myocardial infarction, hepatic adenoma, gall bladder disease, and hypertension). Bleeding irregularities (such as break-through bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea) are also frequent. A progestin, when administered alone, causes an Increased incidence of changes in menstrual patterns, especially a marked increase in the amount and duration of menstrual bleeding. Other chemical methods of contraception include the post coital administration of estrogens (e.g. diethylstilbestrol, antiprogestins, or ethynylestradiol) to prevent nidation or of prostaglandins which act as abortifacients. Both of these methods, at present, are limited to emergency situations. Still in the very early stages of development are immunological methods (vaccination) and methods involving the direct control of LHRH secretion from the pituitary by LHRH agonists or antagonists. Another group of chemical contraceptive agents are the local spermatocides, such as nonoxynol or octoxynol, which are placed into the vagina immediately prior to coitus in the form of creams, foams, jellies, or suppositories. The spermicidal action takes place either in the vagina or elsewhere In the reproductive tract. For the latter to occur, the spermicidal agent is either absorbed on sperm membranes or is transported into the uterus under the influence of uterine contractions. The spermicidal methods are not completely reliable in preventing pregnancy and are inconvenient to use. From the foregoing, it is evident that the presently available methods of contraception are inadequate for various reasons. Although many women practice contraception in spite of these inadequacies, a need exists in medicine for new methods. Pulmonary hypertension represents a serious, life threatening spectrum of diseases of multiple etiology. These include congenital abnormalities of the lung, thorax and diaphragm, congenital or acquired valvular or myocardial disease, obstructive lung disease, and can be a complication of autoimmune diseases, vasculitis and collagen based diseases (Rubin, Chest. 104: 236, 1993). Patients with pulmonary hypertension frequently present with symptoms including dyspnea, fatigue, syncope, and chest pain, and have increased pulmonary artery pressure and demonstrate prominence of the main pulmonary artery, hilar vessel enlargement and decreased peripheral vessels on chest radiographs (Rich. Ann. Internal. Med., 107: 216, 1987). While pulmonary hypertension has multiple etiologies, primary pulmonary hypertension appears to involve an autoimmune component and has been reported as a complication in patients with mixed connective tissue disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogrens syndrome, systemic sclerosis and lupus (Sato, Hum. Path, 24: 199, 1993). Primary pulmonary hypertension occurs in females 1.7 times more frequently than males with the greatest predominance between the third and fourth decades of life (Rich, Ann. Internal. Med., 107: 216, 1987). The increased incidence of primary pulmonary hypertension in women of child bearing age as well as the clinical observations that the disease can be exacerbated by pregnancy and oral contraceptives (Miller, Ann. Rheum. Dis. 46: 159, 1987; and cited in Farhat et al., J. PET., 261: 686, 1992) suggests a role for estrogen in the disease process. To this extent, Farhat et al. have demonstrated that estradiol potentiates the vasopressor response to a thromboxane mimetic in perfused rat lungs (J. PET, 261: 686, 1992). However, the role of estrogen in pulmonary hypertension is complex and may be dependent on the etiology of the disease process. In a rat model of pulmonary hypertension induced by injection of monocrotaline pyrrole (Reindel, Tax. Appl. Pharm. , 106: 179, 1990) progressive pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy and interstitial edema around the large airways and blood vessels becomes apparent, similar to the pathology observed in man. Estradiol treatment decreased right ventricular hypertrophy and prevented interstitial edema in this model (Farhat et al., Br. J. Pharm., 110: 719, 1993) as well as attenuating the hypoxic vasoconstrictive response in isolated sheep lungs (Gordon et al., J. Appl. Physiol., 61: 2116, 1986). Current therapy for pulmonary hypertension is inadequate and is largely dependent on the use of vasodilators, diuretics, and anticoagulants (Rubin, Drugs, 43: 37, 1992; Palevsky, JAMA, 265: 1014, 1991). Vasodilators are effective in only a small subpopulation of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and is complicated by systemic hypotensive responses. Prostacyclin infusion and high dose calcium channel blockers are also being used with limited efficacy. Heart-lung and single lung transplantation have been used on patients which do not respond to vasodilator therapy, however, due to surgical morbidity and mortality, this approach is usually limited to those patients who continue to deteriorate despite aggressive therapy at centers experienced in management of this disease. Patents frequently die of right heart failure and those individuals which have signs of right heart failure have a mean survival of 6-12 months (Rubin, Drugs, 43: 37, 1992). Therefore, pulmonary hypertensive diseases are characterized by inadequate therapies, necessity of organ transplantation and poor prognosis, and a need exits for new therapies. Acne and seborrhea are two general classes of skin diseases which are marked by an abnormal function (usually hyperactivity) of the sebaceous glands in the skin. The subject of this invention is the use of compounds to inhibit acne and seborrhea. Acne vulgaris is a disease of the pilosebaceous unit in the skin and is chronic and inflammatory in nature. It is characterized by comedos (blackheads), papules, pustules, cysts, and nodules. The areas of the body most commonly affected by the disease are those which have the most sebaceous glands, i.e., the face, neck, back, and chest. Acne is a very common disease in both men and women and usually appears at the beginning of puberty. Although the disease is usually mild and resolves itself by the time most people reach their midtwenties, it can in many instances be disfiguring and a source of great physiological distress. In some extreme cases, acne can be the source of severe infection and even life-threatening. The etiology and pathogenesis of the disease begins with cohesive hyperkeratosis in which cornified cells adhere and block the follicular canal between the sebaceous gland and the surface of the skin. The sebaceous gland under hormonal control. (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) are stimulated to enlarge and produce increasing amounts of sebaceous secretions (principally in the form of triacylglycerols). These sebaceous secretions are trapped in the blocked, follicular canal and build up to form a closed comedo. At this stage, common, indigenous skin bacteria (principally, Propionibacterum Acnes) begin to metabolize the triacylglycerols to free fatty acids. These liberated fatty acids are inflammatory and results in the formation of a papule. This papule is often raised and is typical of an inflammatory lesion, i.e., red, edematous, and painful. The papule may continue to expand and rupture the follicle wall, thus forming a pustule or cyst. The pustule stage is very painful and unsightly and is often a site for secondary infection by opportunistic bacteria such as Staphofius. The pustules and cysts often lead to the scarring and disfigurement seen in severe cases of acne. There are several drugs available for the treatment of acne. For mild cases, benzoyl peroxide is used and is often moderately effective. Benzoyl peroxide is thought to work by inhibiting cohesive hyperkeratosis and by suppressing P. Aches although benzoyl peroxide is effective in mild cases of acne, it suffers from several drawbacks: first, it must be applied topically and does not always penetrate to the pilosebaceous unit where the acne lesion initiates, second, it can cause skin irritation which can exacerbate the disease. Another moderately effective drug is vitamin A (retenoic acid, Retin A) which is used topically. Vitamin A inhibits cohesive hyperkeratosis; however, being a topical preparation it suffers from some of the same drawbacks as benzoyl peroxide and in addition it can cause a deterioration of the protective stratum corneum if used extensively. Yet another group of commonly used drugs for the treatment of acne are antibiotics. These can be used either topically or systemically. The most commonly used antibiotics are tetracyclines and erythromycin and to a lesser extent minocycline, ampicillin, clindamycin, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole. These antibiotics inhibit P. Aches and other secondary bacterial infections. There are two major drawbacks to the prolonged use of antibiotics for acne; first, the continued long exposure to antibiotics often lead to formation of resistant bacterial strains both in the skin and systemically, and second continued use of antibiotics may lead to sensitization of the patient to the antibiotic. A newer drug used for acne is Isotretinoin (Accutane, 13-cis-retenoic acid). This drug works like vitamin A; however, it can be used systemically. The side-effects of isotretinoin are often: cheilitis, a rise in serum triglycerides, elevated sedimentation rates, and most importantly, isotretinoin is a teratogen in humans and therefore cannot be used if there is a question of pregnancy during treatment. All of the above drugs have some positive effect in the treatment of acne, but each has its limiting side-effects. Hormonal therapy is also effective for the treatment of acne in women. In many cases, the administration of estrogens has a positive effect in treating acne. Estrogens counteract the effect of endogenous androgens and therefore, decrease sebaceous excretion. However, since the use of unopposed estrogen administration in women with a uterus poses the potential for the development of endometrial cancer, a cyclic therapy of estrogen and a progestin are used for the treatment of acne. Typically, women are prescribed the normal birth control protocols for acne treatment. Although, these protocols are often effective for acne, in many cases these regiments contain progestins which have significant androgenic activity. This androgenic activity exacerbates the disease. Additionally, it is well known that progestinal agents are the cause of many negative, psychological side-effects. Clearly, a better hormonal agent would be beneficial. Seborrhea or seborrheic dermatitis is another group of skin diseases thought to be associated with abnormal function of the sebaceous glands. It occurs in areas where there are large numbers of sebaceous glands and is characterized by flasking of the skin and red, mildly inflammatory patches. Seborrhea is most common in the hair (a form of dandruff), scalp margins, eyebrows, naso-labial folds, external ear canals, postier auricular fold, and presternal area. Generally, mild seborrhea is controlled by topical medication such as glucocorticoids and LDH in Nivea oil. However, more severe cases are more difficult to control. There are several conditions in which the ovaries do not develop and in consequence puberty does not occur. Gonadal dysgenesis results in a severe disease state known as Tumers Syndrome resulting from the absence of a second sex chromosome (X chromosome monosomy). The syndrome is associated with the female phenotype, shortness of stature, sexual infantilism, and various somatic abnormalities. Several typical features are observed in these patients including distinct facial features, square chest, and short broad neck with webbing. Additional anomalies include cubitus valgus, congenital lymphedema of the feet and hands, renal abnormalities, high arched palate, skeletal anomalies, pigmented nevi, keloid formation, abnormal nails, and recurrent otitis media. Cardiovascular abnormalities include bicuspid aortic valves, partial anomalous venous drainage, and hypoplastic left-sided heart syndrome (Miller, M. J., et al. J. Pedriatr., 102: 47-50, (1983), Mazzanti, I. et al. Helv. Paediatr. Acta, 43: 25-31, (1988), Van Egmond, H. et al. Br. Heart J., 60: 69-71, (1988)). Renal abnormalities include rotation of the kidney, horseshoe kidney, duplication of renal pelvis and ureter, and hydronephrosis secondary to ureteropelvic obstruction. Skeletal maturation is normal or slightly delayed in childhood but lags in adolescence as a result of gonadal steroid deficiency. Typically, fishnet appearance caused by localized rarefications occurs. Bone mineral content reduction occurs as early as 8 years of age as well as later in puberty. Changes of the spine, vertebral hypoplasia, and scoliosis are also common. Abnormalities of the carpal, wrist, knee and pelvis are also noted. The shortness of stature, including uterine growth retardation, is not evident until after the first 3 years of life after which growth velocity decelerates appreciably (Park, E., et al. Pediatr. Res. 17: 1-7, (1983), Lyon, A. J. et al. Arch. Dis. Child., 60: 932-935, (1985)). In general, the patients suffer from sexual infantilism with genital ducts and external genitalia being immature. As a result, ovarian development is retarded. Current therapy is directed towards correcting stature, somatic anomalies and inducing secondary sexual characteristics. Recent data indicated growth hormone is a viable therapy for stature improvement (Rosenfeld, R. G., et al. J. Pediatr., 113: 393 (1988)). Patients not treated with estrogen often develop a severe form of osteoporosis similar to that experienced by females after menopause. Fractures and vertebral collapse are common. Steroid hormone therapy is normally deferred until after 15 years of age as it is believed treatment at an earlier age may result in premature maturation of the skeleton and thus a decrease in height. In fact, pharmacological doses of estrogen can accelerate bone maturation and resulting in epiphyseal fusion at an early age without concomitant increases in height. Other studies have shown low-dose estrogen allows patients to develop breasts without causing any changes in height (Alexander, R. L. et al., Clin. Res. 26: 597 174A (1978)). However, studies indicate a number of cases of endometrial cancer in patients with gonadal dysgenesis as a result of estrogen therapy (Levine, L. S., Pediatrics, 62: 1178-1183 (1979)). Given the adverse side effects of estrogen in Tumers Syndrome patients, a need exists for a bone sparing agent which does not possess significant uterotrophic consequences. In the United States, one in every four women require medical attention for breast symptomatology. While much rarer, males also encounter breast disorders. Such disorders include galactorrhea, gynecomastia, hypertrophy, polythelia, mastodynia/mastalgia, hyperprolactinermia, and generally non-fibrocystic, non-cancerous mascopathias. Breast pain is common and estimated to be present in 50% of women. Normally the etiology is unclear. The discomfort generally is classified as (1) cyclic mastalgia or mastodynia occurring immediately prior to the menses; (2) changes in the breast such as duct ectasia and sclerosing adenosis, or (3) referred pain such as costochondritis. Gynecomastia is enlargement of the glandular breast tissue in male humans (the female counterpart is hypertrophy). This enlargement is localized to the aureoles and can be unilateral or more commonly bilateral. The condition is usually benign in nature; however, it can be the source of severe psychological disturbance to the patient. Gynecomastia is most commonly found in males at the time of puberty, but can occur at any age. Gynecomastia can have many underlying causes, e.g., Klinefelters syndrome (XXY chromosomal abnormality), liver disorders, estrogen therapy for prostatic carcinoma, tumors of various endocrine organs, and certain drugs (digitalis and Dilantin). The common relationship between all these causes and the resulting gynecomastia is the production of abnormal amounts of estrogens. Currently, treatment of this disease is limited to three therapies: 1) Determination and treatment of the underlying cause; 2) Surgical removal of the breast tissue; and 3) Treatment with diethylstilbestrol and radiation. Determination and treatment of the underlying cause of gynecomastia is not always possible. Surgery and treatment with diethylstilbestrol and radiation is not always successful and entails great expense and risk. Clearly, a more effective and safer therapy would be useful. Galactorrhea is the production of breast milk in the male or female when not immediately associated with pregnancy. The highly inappropriate and rare response in the male breast is accompanied by severe psychological discomfort to the male patient. It is thought to be caused by an overproduction of estrogen and prolactin excess. Surgical treatment is usually the therapy of choice if the underlying cause can not be determined or treated. A safer and less costly therapy would be useful. Diabetes mellitus is a systemic disease characterized by disorders in the actions of insulin and other regulatory hormones in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins, and in the structure and function of blood vessels. The primary symptom of diabetes is hyperglycemia, often accompanied by glucosuria, the presence in urine of large amounts of glucose, and polyuria, the excretion of large volumes of urine. Additional symptoms arise in chronic or long standing diabetes. These symptoms include degeneration of the walls of blood vessels. Although many different organs are affected by these vascular changes, the nerves, eyes and kidneys appear to be the most susceptible. As such, long-standing diabetes mellitus, even when treated with insulin, is a leading cause of blindness. There are two recognized types of diabetes. Type I diabetes is of juvenile onset, ketosis-prone, develops early in life with much more severe symptoms and has a near-certain prospect of later vascular involvement. Control of this type of diabetes is difficult and requires exogenous insulin administration. Type II diabetes mellitus is of adult onset, ketosis-resistent, develops later in life, is milder and has a more gradual onset. One of the most significant advancements in the history of medical science came in 1922 when Banting and Best demonstrated the therapeutic effects of insulin in diabetic dogs. However, even today, a clear picture of the basic biochemical defects of the disease is not known, and diabetes remains a serious health problem. It is believed that two percent of the United States population is afflicted with some form of diabetes. The introduction of orally effective hypoglycemic agents was an important development in the treatment of hyperglycemia. Oral hypoglycemic agents are normally used in the treatment of adult onset diabetes. Observations in animal models on glucose metabolism for type II diabetes and in humans suggest that sex steroids play a permissive role in the phenotypic expression of hyperglycemia. These observations have prompted studies on the effects of androgens and estrogens on blood glucose levels. Testosterone administration to intact or ovariectomized female rats resulted in marked insulin resistance which correlated to morphological changes in muscle, Holmang, et al., Am. J. Physiol., 259, E555-560 (1990); Holmang, et al., Am. J. Physiol., 262, E851-855 (1992). In streptozotocin diabetic rats, implanted testosterone antagonized the ability of residual insulin to maintain glycemic control, Le et al., Endocrinology, 116, 2450-2455 (1985). In contrast, glucosuria disappeared in castrated diabetic KK mice and reappeared when androgens were replaced in these mice, Nonaka, et al., Jpn. J. Vet. Sci., 50, 1121-1123 (1988): Higuichi, et al., Exp. Anim., 38, 25-29 (1989). Results from estrogen administrations also support the hypothesis that the balance between androgens and estrogens is critical to the development of hyperglycemia. Daily estradiol administrations to diabetic KK mice normalized the blood glucose levels and eliminated glucosuria, Toshiro, et al., Jpn. J. Vet. Sci., 51, 823-826 (1989). Estradiol also lowered the blood glucose levels of C57BL/6J-ob/ob mice, Dubuc, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med., 180, 468-473 (1985) and C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice, Garris, Anatomical Record, 225, 310-317 (1989). In climacteric women, anxiety, depression, tension and irritability begin during the perimenopause and can be correlated to reduce estrogen levels and estrogen replacement therapy has been recommended for the treatment of these symptoms (Malleson J., Lancet, 2: 158, (1953); Wilson et. al., J. Am. Geriatric Soc., 11: 347 (1963)). The mechanism for protective effects of estrogen in this case in unknown, but may be related to potential effects of estrogen on biogenic amines such as serotonin (Aylward M., Int. Res. Communications System Med. Sci., 1: 30 (1973)). To this regard circulating serotonin is reduced in post-menopausal women (Gonzales G., et. al., Maturitas 17: 23-29 (1993)), and serotonin (as well as several other biogenic amines) have a putative role in behavioral depression. Phillips and Sherwin (Psychoneuroendocrinology, 17: 485-495 (1992)) reported that in surgically menopausal women given estrogen, scores in immediate and delayed recall tests are greater than in similar women not given estrogen. Two potential hypotheses might explain this effect. There is some evidence that partial estrogen agonists (or anti-estrogens) such as tamoxifen interact with the muscarinic receptor (Ben-Baruch G., et. al., Molec. Pharmacol. 21: 287-293 (1982)), and muscarinic agonists (M 2 ) are known to produce positive effects in a number of memory associated tasks and may have clinical relevance in Alzheimers Disease. Another interesting possibility may be linked to neurokinins such as Substance P, which are known to have neurotrophic as well as memory-promoting effects (Thoenen H., Trends in Neuroscience, 14: 165-170 (1991); Huston J. et. al., Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 13: 171-180 (1989)), thus, through an effect either at a neurotransmitter receptor in the CNS or at a neuropeptide receptor, a tissue selective estrogen agonist/antagonist could produce memory and cognitive enhancing effects. Such an activity would most relevantly be assessed in man, but a variety of animal models (i.e. maze learning, extinction etc.) are available for preclinical testing. Perhaps the most frequent CNS related problem in climacteric women is the occurrence of hot flushes. While this undoubtedly is a somatic effect mediated by effects on the microvasculature, current evidence points strongly in the direction of CNS initiated effect (Lomax P., et. al., Pharmac. Ther. 57: 347-358 (1993)). Therefore, a tissue selective estrogen agonist/antagonist might offer the ideal therapy providing the desired effect in the absence of untoward side effects on reproductive tissue. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is one of the rarer psychiatric illnesses, although minor obsessional symptoms probably occur in one-sixth of the population ( Encyclopedia of Medicine , American Medical Association; Current Diagnosis , W. B. Saunders Company, 1985). It is characterized by one or both of two symptoms. The first comprises recurrent, intrusive ruminative thoughts that the patient may realize are senseless but of which he cannot stop thinking. The most common of these are thoughts of violence, contamination, doubt, or personal illness. Normally, the patient does not believe these thoughts are true reflections of reality. However, some patients become convinced that their obsessive ruminations are true, and suffer from psychotic delusions. The second comprises repetitive, ritualistic behaviors that the patient recognizes are needless but that he cannot keep himself from performing. Hand washing, counting, checking rituals, and touching rituals are examples of such rituals. The carrying out of the ritual is not constant, but fluctuates and mirrors anxiety levels. There normally are intense feelings of panic and anxiety if the patient is prevented from completing a ritual. While appearing depressed, a review of the history of obsessive-compulsive patients normally reveals that obsessions and compulsions precede the onset of dysphoric mood states and that depressed feelings are related to the impact the obsessive-compulsive behavior has on life. In severe cases, the patient will be incapacitated, completely overtaken by the distraction of constant obsessive ruminations or the demand to complete endless compulsive rituals. Consumptive disorders include those disorders in which the intake, normally oral, of the amount of a substance is outside a normal range, often to an extent where health is impaired. Examples of such are eating or appetite disorders (obesity, bulimia, pica, anorexia nervosa, and psychogenic rumination) and substance abuse or overuse (smoking, nicotine dependence, alcoholism, alcohol abuse)., It is well known that the chronic administration of nicotine results in tolerance and, eventually, dependence. The use of tobacco has become extremely widespread in all countries, despite the well known adverse effects of the use of tobacco in all its forms. Thus, it is clear that tobacco use is extremely habit-forming, if not addictive, and that its use provides sensations to the user which are pleasant and welcome, even though the user is fully aware of the drastic long term ill effects of its use. Cigarette smoking is the most dominant cause of preventable morbidity and early demise in developed countries. On average, smokers die several years earlier than nonsmokers and have an increased risk of fatal heart disease, lung cancer, cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, pancreas, kidney, bladder, and cervix, peptic ulcers and of fractures of the hip, wrist, and vertebrae. Olfaction and taste are impaired in smokers, and facial wrinkles are increased. Diabetic patients who smoke may have an increased risk of proteinuria. Smoking cessation provides benefits, even late in life, such as reducing the risk of death or myocardial infarction in persons with coronary artery disease, reducing the progression of carotid atherosclerosis, and with reversal of chronic bronchitis. Children of persons who smoke have lower birth weights, more frequent respiratory infections, less efficient pulmonary function, and a higher incidence of chronic ear infections than children of non-smokers and are more likely to become smokers themselves. Exposure to passive smoke has been shown to increase the risk of cervical cancer, lung cancer, and heart disease and to promote endothelial damage and platelet aggregation. Recently, vigorous campaigns against the use of tobacco have taken place, and it is now common knowledge that the cessation of smoking brings with it numerous unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, which include irritability, anxiety, restlessness, lack of concentration, lightheadedness, insomnia, tremor, increased hunger and weight gain, and, of course, a craving for tobacco. Alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence (i.e., alcoholism) are serious public health problems of modem society. In the United States alone, an estimated 13 million adults exhibit symptoms of alcohol dependence due to excessive alcohol intake, and an additional 7 million abuse alcohol without showing symptoms of dependence according to U.S. government projections from studies conducted in the mid-1980s. Alcohol dependence and abuse are very expensive as it is estimated that it cost the U.S. well over $200 billion in 1991 with no prospect of falling or leveling off. The social and psychological damages inflicted on individuals as a consequence of alcohol abuse, e.g., children born with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and victims of alcohol-related accidental death, homicide, suicide, etc., are immense. While it is generally accepted that alcoholism and alcohol abuse are affiliations with staggering international economic, social, medical, and psychological repercussions, success in preventing or otherwise ameliorating the consequences of these problems has been an elusive goal. Only very recently the public view that alcoholism and alcohol abuse are remedial solely by moral imperatives has been changed to include an awareness of alcoholism and alcohol abuse as physiological aberrations whose etiology may be understood and for which therapy may be found through scientific pursuits. Both alcohol abuse and dependence arise as a result of different, complex, and as yet incompletely understood processes. At present, alcohol research is in the mainstream of scientific efforts. This invention provides methods for inhibiting obsessive-compulsive and consumptive disorders. Hirsutism (hypertrichosis) is characterized by excessive growth of hair. In women, hirsutism refers specifically to excessive growth of hair in a male pattern and distribution. Clinically, hirsutism in women is seen as a growth of terminal hair on the face (particularly on the upper lip), the chin, chest, back, and lower abdomen (escutcheon). This growth of hair is often seen as unsightly and can be the cause of embarrassment and psychological distress. Hirsutism is a common occurrence at the menopause, but can occur any time after puberty. The etiology of the condition has been linked to over production of androgens by either the ovaries or adrenal glands or both. Hirsutism in women can be treated in a variety of ways. Cosmetic treatment of the condition, including shaving, plucking of hairs, and bleaching, while effective in improving the appearance of the patient, are only palliative and must be constantly re-applied. Glucocorticoid steroids are often effective; however, they have the potential of serious side-effects such as Cushings Syndrome. Oral contraceptives can be effective; however, care must be taken because certain progestins used in common oral contraceptive regiments may actually contribute hirsutism because of their androgenic side-effects. Climetidine and Spironolactone have shown some effectiveness in the treatment of hirsutism; however, each of these can have unwanted side-effects. Clearly, a more effective and better tolerated agent would be useful. Alopecia (hair loss) can occur in women for a variety of reasons, and includes female pattern alopecia. Female pattern alopecia is characterized by chronic and progressive hair loss often beginning around thirty years of age and accelerating at menopause. The hair loss is usually confined to the central scalp in a diffuse pattern. This loss of hair is cosmetically damaging and often psychologically disturbing to the patient. The etiology of the condition has been linked to an elevated level of androgens and the subsequent response of androgen sensitive hair follicles. Treatment of the condition is primarily cosmetic in nature, e.g., wigs, hair styles which cover the effected area, etc. The drug, Spironolactone, has been used, but does have side-effects. Clearly, an effective treatment for this condition would be useful. Macrophages play a central role in host defense through a variety of effector mechanisms involving both membrane related and secretory events (Gordon et. al., Curr. Opin. Immunol., 4, 25, 1992; Fuller, Brit. Med. J., 48, 65, 1992). Phagocytosis, chemotaxis and antigen presentation are membrane related processes involved in immunologic defense mechanisms necessary for host survival. The importance of macrophages in defense against microbes, immune surveillance, destruction of tumor cells, and in the clearing of senescent erythrocytes has been documented in man and in animal models characterized by the selective elimination of macrophages (Claassen et. al., J. Immunol Meth., 134, 153, 1990). Macrophages also contribute to host defense through secretion of bacteriostatic and bactericidal proteins, cytokines and lipid mediators, as well as oxygen and nitrogen reactive intermediates. The secretory capacity of the macrophage is central to its function as these cells secrete over 100 distinct mediators and are located in every organ (Nathan, J. Clin. Invest., 79, 319, 1987). While aberrant activation of macrophage functions is associated with autoimmune diseases as well as both chronic and acute inflammatory processes, the reciprocal condition, suppression of macrophage effector functions, is associated with reoccurring infections of both opportunistic and non-opportunistic pathogens and contributes to increased morbidity and mortality. Populations associated with an immunocompromised state include burn patients, transplants, HIV infected individuals, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and surgical patients, notably those with a higher risk of infection as observed in thoracoabdominal patients. Current therapeutic approaches to these patients includes the use of intravenous infusion of macrophage derived cytokines notably the colony stimulating factors G-CSF, GM-CSF, and M-CSF (Nemunaitis, Transfusion 33: 70,1993). Supportive therapy with antibiotics and fluids is also used, however, the limitations of these approaches are demonstrated by the continued problems of infection in immunocompromised patients and the emergence of more deadly strains of antibiotics resistant organisms. Furthermore, infections of immunocompromised patients with opportunistic pathogens including Pneumocystis and Cryptococcal infections remain significant and result in complications despite various antibiotic protocols. Clearly, novel therapeutics which can selectively enhance macrophage effector functions to augment host defense would play a central role in the clinical management of these patients. Estrogen has been reported to increase select macrophage effector functions including Fc mediated phagocytosis, class II antigen expression, and IL-1 secretion. These observations coupled with the known propensity of women to be more resistent to a variety of infections (Ahmed et al., Am. J. Path., 121, 531, 1985) suggests that estrogen-like compounds may enhance macrophage effector functions and thus be beneficial in disease states associated with depressed host defense such as bladder infections or depressed wound healing. The term inhibit is defined to include its generally accepted meaning which includes prophylactically treating a subject to prevent the occurrence of one or more of these disease states, holding in check the symptoms of such a disease state, and/or treating such symptoms. Thus, the present methods include both medical therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment, as appropriate. The methods of this invention are practiced by administering to an individual in need of treatment an effective amount of a compound formula I.

The active ingredient may be usually administered once to four times a day with a unit dosage of 0.1 mg to 50 mg in human patients, but the above dosage may be properly varied depending on the age, body weight and medical condition of the patient and the type of administration. A preferred dose is 0.25 mg to 25 mg in human patients. One dose per day is preferred. Compounds used in the methods invention are readily prepared by the reactions illustrated in the schemes below. Certain compounds of formula I are conveniently prepared from an unsaturated intermediate by hydrogenation with a noble metal catalyst in a reaction inert solvent. Pressure and temperatures are not critical and hydrogenation is normally accomplished in a few hours at room temperatures at 20-80 psi hydrogen pressure. The hydrogenated product is isolated, purified if desired, and the ether group is cleaved with an acidic catalyst in a reaction inert solvent at a temperature between 0 C. to 100 C. depending on the acidic catalyst used. Hydrogen bromide at elevated temperatures, boron tribromide and aluminum chloride at 0 C. to ambient temperature have been found to be effective for this reaction. The product, Formula I is isolated and purified by standard procedures. Intermediates of Formula II where A is CH 2 , and B, D and E are CH are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,274,213; J. Med. Chem 10, 78 (1967); J. Med. Chem 10, 138 (1967); and J. Med. Chem. 12, 881 (1969), the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. They can also be prepared by procedures described below. The preparation of the compounds of Formula I where e1, ACH 2 , Z 1 OCH 2 CH 2 , Gcycloalkylamine, BCH is shown in Scheme 1. Compounds 1-2, where D and E are CH are made by alkylation of 4-bromophenol with the corresponding N-chloroethylamine using potassium carbonate as base in a polar aprotic solvent like dimethylformamide at elevated temperatures. A preferred temperature is 100 C. Compounds 1-2 where D or E or both are N are synthesized using a nucleophilic displacement reaction performed on dibromides (1-1) using hydroxy ethyl cycloalkylamines under phase transfer conditions to afford bromo amines (1-2). Synthesis, 77, 573 (1980). Following halogen metal exchange using n-butyllithium or magnesium metal, bromo amines (1-2) yield the corresponding lithium or magnesium reagents which are allowed to react at low temperature in the presence of cesium chloride preferably (without cesium chloride the reaction also proceeds) with 6-methoxy-1-tetralone to afford either carbinols (1-3) or styrenes (1-4) after acidic workup. Treatment of either carbinols (1-3) or styrenes (1-4) with a brominating agent such as pyridinium bromide perbromide affords bromo styrenes (1-5). Aryl or heteroaryl zinc chlorides or aryl or heteroaryl boronic acids react with bromides (1-5) in the presence of a palladium metal catalyst like tetrakis triphenyl phosphine palladium (0) to yield diaryl styrenes (1-6). Pure Applied Chem. 63, 419,(1991) and Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 61, 3008-3010, (1988) To prepare the preferred compounds the substituted phenyl zinc chlorides or substituted phenylboronic acids are used in this reaction. The aryl zinc chlorides are prepared by quench of the corresponding lithium reagent with anhydrous zinc chloride. The aryl boronic acids, that are not commercially available, are prepared by quenching the corresponding aryl lithium reagent with trialkyl borate, preferably the trimethyl or triisopropyl borate, followed by aqueous acid workup. Acta Chemica Scan. 47, 221-230 (1993). The lithium reagents that are not commercially available are prepared by halogen metal exchange of the corresponding bromide or halide with n-butyl or t-butyllithium. Alternately, the lithium reagent is prepared by heteroatom facilitated lithiations as described in Organic Reactions, Volume 27, Chapter 1. Catalytic hydrogenation of 1-6 in the presence of palladium hydroxide on charcoal, for example, affords the corresponding dihydro methoxy intermediates which were subsequently demethylated using boron tribromide at 0 C. in methylene chloride or 48% hydrogen bromide in acetic acid at 80-100 C. to afford target structures (1-7). These compounds are racemic and can be resolved into the enantiomers via high pressure liquid chromatography using a column with a chiral stationary phase like the Chiralcel OD columns. Alternately optical resolution can be carried out by recrystallization of the diastereomeric salts formed with optically pure acids like 1,1-binapthyl-2,2diyl hydrogen phosphate (see Example 8). The cis compounds (1-7) can be isomerized to the trans compounds on treatment with base (see Example 2). When D and/or E is nitrogen the intermediates (Formula II) and compounds of Formula I may be prepared from the corresponding dihalopyridines or pyrimidines as illustrated in Scheme 1 and as fully described for 6phenyl-5-6-(2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-ethoxy) pyridin-3-yl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol in Example 6. The methyl ether of the compound of Formula I where e1, ACH 2 , ZOCH 2 CH 2 , G pyrrolidine, D,E, BCH, YPh can also be conveniently prepared by a first step of hydrogenation of nafoxidine (Upjohn Co., 700 Portage Road, Kalamazoo, Mich. 49001) in a reaction inert solvent in the presence of a nobel metal catalyst. Pressure and temperature are not critical; the reaction is conveniently run in ethanol at room temperature for approximately 20 hours at 50 psi. The second step is cleavage of the methoxy group which is accomplished conveniently at room temperature with an acidic catalyst such as boron tribromide in a reaction inert solvent or at 80-100 C. with hydrogen bromide in acetic acid. The product is then isolated by conventional methods and converted to an acid salt if desired. Compounds of formula I wherein B is nitrogen are prepared by the procedures illustrated in Scheme 2 and 3 and Examples 3-5 and 10-12. The synthesis of compounds of Formula I where BN is shown in Scheme 2. Aryl acid chlorides (2-1) on treatment with primary amines afford aryl secondary amides (2-2), which are reduced with lithium aluminum hydride in ethereal solvents to yield secondary amines (2-3). Subsequent acylation of (2-3) with aroyl acid chlorides leads to tertiary amides (2-4), which are cyclized in hot phosphorus oxychloride to yield dihydro isoquinolinium salts (2-5). Reduction with sodium borohydride to alkoxytetrahydro isoquinolines; followed by boron tribromide demethylation in chloride affords the target structures. The synthesis of the compounds of Formula I where BN is also described below in Scheme 3. Secondary amines (3-1) on acylation with benzyloxyaroyl chlorides (3-2) afford tertiary amides (3-3) which on cyclization with hot phosphorous oxychloride yield dihydro isoquinoline salts (34). Sodium borohydride reduction of (3-4) followed by debenzylation with aqueous hydrochloric acid affords isoquinolines (3-5), which are alkylated with the appropriately functionalized chlorides and demethylated with boron tribromide to yield the desired target structures. Although the free-base form of formula I compounds can be used in the methods of the present invention, it is preferred to prepare and use a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form. Thus, the compounds used in the methods of this invention form pharmaceutically acceptable acid and base addition salts with a wide variety of inorganic and, preferably, organic acids and include the physiologically acceptable salts which are often used in pharmaceutical chemistry. Such salts are also part of this invention. Typical inorganic acids used to form such salts include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric, sulfuric, phosphoric, hypophosphoric, and the like. Salts derived from organic acids, such as aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxyalkanoic and hydroxyalkandioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, may also be used. Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus include acetate, phenylacetate, trifluoroacetate, acrylate, ascorbate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, methylbenzoate, o-acetoxybenzoate, naphthalene-2-benzoate, bromide, isobutyrate, phenylbutyrate,-hydroxybutyrate, butyne-1,4dioate, hexyne-1,4-dioate, caprate, caprylate, chloride, cinnamate, citrate, formate, fumarate, glycollate, heptanoate, hippurate, lactate, malate, maleate, hydroxymaleate, malonate, mandelate, mesylate, nicotinate, isonicotinate, nitrate, oxalate, phthalate, terephthalate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, propiolate, propionate, phenylpropionate, salicylate, sebacate, succinate, suberate, sulfate, bisulfate, pyrosulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, sulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-bromophenylsulfonate, chlorobenzenesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, methanesulfonate, naphthalene-1-sulfonate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, xylenesulfonate, tartarate, and the like. A preferred salt is the citrate salt. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are typically formed by reacting a compound of formula I with an equimolar or excess amount of acid. The reactants are generally combined in a mutual solvent such as diethyl ether or benzene. The salt normally precipitates out of solution within about one hour to 10 days and can be isolated by filtration or the solvent can be stripped off by conventional means. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of formula I compounds generally have enhanced solubility characteristics compared to the compound from which they are derived, and thus are often more amenable to formulation as liquids or emulsions. Once prepared, the free base or salt form of formula I compounds can be administered to an individual in need of treatment for the methods herein described. The following nonlimiting test examples illustrate the methods of the present invention. For the methods of the present invention, compounds of Formula I are administered continuously, or from 1 to 4 times daily. As used herein, the term effective amount means an amount of compound of the methods of the present invention which is capable of inhibiting the symptoms of the pathological conditions herein described. The specific dose of a compound administered according to this invention will, of course, be determined by the particular circumstances surrounding the case including, for example, the compound administered, the route of administration, the state of being of the patient, and the severity of the pathological condition being treated. A typical daily dose will contain a nontoxic dosage level of from about 0.25 mg to about 100 mg/day of a compound of the present invention. Preferred daily doses generally will be from about 1 mg to about 40 mg/day. The compounds of this invention can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subucutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and intranasal. These compounds preferably are formulated prior to administration, the selection of which will be decided by the attending physician. Typically, a formula I compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient to form a pharmaceutical formulation. The total active ingredients in such formulations comprises from 0.1% to 99.9% by weight of the formulation. By pharmaceutically acceptable it is meant the carrier, diluent, excipients, and/or salt must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation, and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Pharmaceutical formulations containing a compound of formula I can be prepared by procedures known in the art using well known and readily available ingredients. For example, the compounds of formula I can be formulated with common excipients, diluents, or carriers, and formed into tablets, capsules, suspensions, powders, and the like. Examples of excipients, diluents, and carriers that are suitable for such formulations include the following fillers and extenders such as starch, sugars, mannitol, and silicic derivatives binding agents such as carboxymethyl cellulose and other cellulose derivatives, alginates, gelatin, and polyvinyl-pyrrolidone; moisturizing agents such as glycerol; disintegrating agents such as calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate agents for retarding dissolution such as paraffin resorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; surface active agents such as cetyl alcohol, glycerol monostearate; adsorptive carriers such as kaolin and bentonite; and lubricants such as talc, calcium and magnesium stearate, and solid polyethyl glycols. The compounds also can be formulated as elixirs or solutions for convenient oral administration or as solutions appropriate for parenteral administration, for example, by intramuscular, subcutaneous or intravenous routes. Additionally, the compounds are well suited to formulation as sustained release dosage forms and the like. The formulations can be so constituted that they release the active ingredient only or preferably in a particular physiological location, possibly over a period of time. The coatings, envelopes, and protective matrices may be made, for example, from polymeric substances or waxes. Compounds of formula I generally will be administered in a convenient formulation. The following formulation examples only are illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. In the formulations which follow, active ingredient means a compound of formula I, or a salt thereof. Formulation I: Gelatin Capsules Hard gelatin capsules are prepared using the following: Ingredient Quantity (mg/capsule) Active ingredient 0.25-100 Starch, NF 0-650 Starch flowable powder 0-50 Silicone fluid 350 centistokes 0-15 A tablet formulation is prepared using the ingredients below: Formulation 2: Tablets Ingredient Quantity (mg/tablet) Active ingredient 0.25-100 Cellulose, microcrystalline 200-650 Silicon dioxide, fumed 10-650 Stearate acid 5-15 The components are blended and compressed to form tablets.

The granules so produced are dried at 50-60 C. and passed through a No. 18 mesh U.S. 30 sieve. The sodium carboxymethyl starch, magnesium stearate, and talc, previously passed through a No. 60 U.S. sieve, are then added to the granules which, after mixing, are compressed on a tablet machine to yield tablets. Suspensions each containing 0.25-100 mg of medicament per 5 ml dose are made as follows: Formulation 4: Suspensions Ingredient Quantity (mg/5 ml) Active ingredient 0.2-100 mg Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose 50 mg Syrup 1.25 mg Benzoic acid solution 0.10 mL Flavor q.v. Color q.v. Purified Water to 5 mL The medicament is passed through a No. 45 mesh U.S. sieve and mixed with the sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and syrup to form smooth paste. The benzoic acid solution, flavor, and color are diluted with some of the water and added, with stirring. Sufficient water is then added to produce the required volume. An aerosol solution is prepared containing the following ingredients: Formulation 5: Aerosol Ingredient Quantity (% by weight) Active ingredient 0.25 Ethanol 25.75 Propellant 22 (Chlorodifluoromethane) 70.00 The active ingredient is mixed with ethanol and the mixture added to a portion of the propellant 22, cooled to 30 C., and transferred to a filling device. The required amount is then fed to a stainless steel container and diluted with the remaining propellant. The valve units are then fitted to the container. Suppositories are prepared as follows: Formulation 6: Suppositories Ingredient Quantity (mg/suppository) Active ingredient 250 Saturated fatty acid glycerides 2,000 The active ingredient is passed through a No. 60 mesh U.S. sieve and suspended in the saturated fatty acid glycerides previously melted using-the minimal necessary heat.

An intravenous formulation is prepared as follows: Formulation 7: Intravenous Solution Ingredient Quantity Active ingredient 20 mg Isotonic saline 1,000 mL The solution of the above ingredients is intravenously administered to a patient at a rate of about 1 mL per minute. Antiestrogens are compounds that prevent estrogens from expressing their effects on estrogen dependent target tissues consequently antagonizing a variety of estrogen-dependent processes. However, most antiestrogents such as tamoxifen are not pure antagonists, since they exhibit some estrogenicity. The methods below enable the skilled practitioner to determine the estrogen and antiestrogen effect of the compounds of this invention. U.S. Pat. No. 4,859,585, incorporated herein by reference claims two alternative general protocols by which a substance may be characterized as an estrogen agonist and/or estrogen antagonist. Methods to Determine Estrogenic and Antiestrogenic Potential Uterine weight test. Compounds of Formula I are given orally to immature female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (20 days old; 40 g body wt; Charles River Wiga, Sulzfeld, F.R.G.) for 3 consecutive days to test estrogenic activity. In addition to each dose of a compound of formula 1, a standard dose of 1 mg/kg estradiol is administered orally to juvenile SD rats to determine the antiestrogenic effect of the compounds. The compounds are suspended in 0.25% agar for the administration. The animals are killed on day 4, the uteri removed, cleared of any intrauterine fluid and subsequently weighed in a dry condition. Estrogenic activity is estimated by the increase in uterine weight. (uteroptropic effect) initiated by the respective daily doses of compounds of formula 1. The antiestrogenic effect of the compounds is tested by the reduction of the uterine weight (anti uterotropic effect) in the presence of 1 mg/kg estradiol. Estrogen receptor-binding assay. Estrogen receptors (ER) are measured in the cytosol of uterine tissue of female immature white New Zealand rabbits (3 months of age). The uteri are separated from surrounding fatty tissue, rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and immediately transferred into liquid nitrogen. The frozen uterine tissue is put into a capped Teflon cylinder pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen that is vibrated (501 7.) for at least 30 sec. in a microdismembrator (Braun, Melsungen, F.R.G.) in the presence of a tungsten carbide bal 1. The resulting power is mixed with units (1:4/w:v) of Trisbuffer (0.01 M 1 r-is, 0.001 EDTA, pH 7.5), homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 105,000 g for 1 hr. The supernatant (cytosol) is decanted and the protein concentration adjusted to 5 mg protein/ml. The protein concentration is measured according to Lowry et al. 8. Aliquots of cytosol are pipetted into plastic tubes, 2.510 g M 17- 3 Hestradiol, and a range of concentrations of unlabeled estradiol and antiestrogens of formula I are added. The relative binding affinity of the antiestrogens to the estrogen receptor is carried out with the dextran-charcoal method at 2 C. as described by Devleesch ouwer et al. 10. All steps are carried out in triplicate. The relative binding affinity is defined as the ratio of the concentrations of radioinert 17-estradiol to the compound of formula I that is necessary to achieve a 50% inhibition of the specific 173 Hestradiol binding. Bound radioactivity at the highest concentration of 17/3 -estradiol (2,51 7 M) is taken as unspecific binding and subtracted from all values. Procedures for evaluating compounds of this invention for treatment of skin and vaginal atrophy are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,461,064, which is incorporated herein by reference. Skin Atrophy Three to twenty women, who are post-menopausal and in good health, are selected. Additionally, these women are selected on the basis of their presenting several signs of rapid dermal atrophy, such as a rapid increase in the number of facial wrinkles or crows feet, rapid change in the pigmentation of the skin, i.e. age spots, or other complaints of rapid dermal aging. It should be remembered by the attending physician that these criterion may be highly subjective to the patient and that some consideration must be taken into account in patient selection. Also, dermal atrophy may be the result of other factors such as UV damage from the sun or other environmental insults and that such patients who are suffering from these effects would be excluded. The first component of the study is qualitative and subjective one, i.e., an evaluation of improvement in the patients appearance. Such an evaluation requires an initial benchmark for future comparison. Some initial benchmarks might be in the form of a standardized set of questions as to how the patient views her own appearance, photographs of the patient, or a psychological profile of the patients self-image. The second component is quantitative; these include the measurement of urinary excretion of hydroxyproline, moisture content of the skin, glycosaminoglycans in the skin, and changes in resilience and pliability of the skin. Methods for determining these factors are found in The Menopause, Ed. R. J. Beard, University Press, Chapter 7 (1977) and Methods in Skin Research, Ed. Skerrow, D. and Skerrow C. J., John Wiley Sons Ltd., Chp. 22, Analysis of Sebaceous Upids, p. 587-608 (1985), and further references cited therein, all herein incorporated by reference. Again, an initial benchmark of these quantitative factors is obtained. The women, thus selected and initially evaluated, are placed in a clinical protocol of receiving 20-100 mg of a compound of this invention by oral administration either as a single or split dose. Alternatively, these patients are placed in a protocol for topical administration to areas of the skin most effected by the atrophy. This topical protocol includes the use of a suitable formulation containing 5-50% (by weight) of an active compound of this invention applied to the affected area once or twice a day. Either of these protocols continues two to twelve months. Subsequent evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, are made at appropriate intervals,. A positive result is an improvement in the overall qualitative index of the patients appearance and/or an improvement in the quantitative parameters, e.g., an increase in the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline signifying an increase in turnover and synthesis of collagen, an increase in moisture content, glycosaminoglycans, pliability, or resilience of the skin. Vaginal Atrophy Three to twenty women suffering from vaginal atrophy associated with menopause are selected. These women are in general good health. Since the nature of this disorder is highly idiosyncratic and subjective, evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment would necessarily be subjective in nature. These patients are asked to keep a daily log noting such details as vaginal itching and scaling and the degree of comfort in sexual intercourse. These women are placed on a clinical protocol similar to that described above for atrophy of the skin. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of vaginal suppositories containing 5-25% of an active compound of this invention. A positive result is an improvement in the comfort of sexual intercourse and/or a decrease in vaginal itching or scaling. Utility of the compounds described herein is exhibited by the positive results observed in one or both of the above assays. Procedures for evaluating the utility of a compound of this invention for increasing the libido of post-menopausal women are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,439,931, which is incorporated herein by reference. Assay 1 Animals used are ovariectomized or ovariectomized/adrenalectomized Sprague-Dawley rats (Specific Pathogen Free-Anticimex, Stockholm) weighing 250-300 gms. They are housed in a room maintained at a temperature of 24 C. under reversed lighting (10 hours dark). Food and water (or saline) are available ad libitum. A compound of the invention is administered to one group of rats, and the other group is maintained as a control, and behavioral observations are made by placing each female with 2 cage-adapted, sexually experienced males for a 5-minute period during which about 20 mounts occur. The following measures are recorded: 1. Proportion of mounts by the male which elicited a lordosis responseL/M; 2. Lordosis intensity measured on a 3 point scale; 3. Lordosis duration (in seconds); 4. Female acceptance ratioNo. of mounts divided by No. of refused mounting attempts plus mounts, a measure of the females willingness to accept the male when he attempts to mount her. Activity of the compound is shown through positive impact on any one of the 4 observations, as compared to control. Assay 2 Five to fifty women are selected for the clinical study. These women are post-menopausal, i.e., have ceased menstruating for between 6 and 12 months prior to the studys initiation, are in good general health, and suffer from self-described loss of libido especially noted after menopause. Because of the idiosyncratic and subjective nature of this symptom, the study has a placebo control group, i.e., the women are divided into two groups, one of which receive the active agent of this invention and the other receives a placebo. Women in the test group receive between 50-200 mg of the drug per day by the oral route. They continue this therapy for 3-12 months. Accurate records are kept as to the level of libido of the women in both groups and at the end of study these results are compared. Activity of the compounds of the invention is illustrated by positive effects in at least one of the above assays. Test methods for measuring the ability of a compound of this invention to inhibit fertility in women are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,462,949, which is incorporated herein by reference. Assay 1 Between five and fifty young adult virgin female rats weighing 200-300 g. each are separated into groups having the same number of rats. One of the groups serves as the control group and the other groups as experimental groups, each such experimental group receiving raloxifene at a particular dose level. Raloxifene is prepared in corn oil such that the daily administration is in 0.1 ml. of vehicle. The designated quantity of raloxifene in the vehicle is administered to each rat within the defined group subcutaneously (sc) daily. Alternatively, administration may be made via oral gavage or an intramuscular route. The control group receives only the vehicle. Administration of the vehicle or the combination of raloxifene and vehicle is continued on a daily basis for 15 days. On the 5th day of treatment, one or two adult male rats weighing at least 250 g are added to each group, and cohabitation is continued until the 15th day at which time the male rats are withdrawn from the group. Each group of female rats then is maintained for an additional seven days after which the rats are sacrificed and examined for the presence of viable or resorbing fetuses. The number of animals that exhibit evidence of pregnancy over the number of animals in the group multiplied by one hundred is the pregnancy ratio percentage (PRP). A compound is considered active when the PRP is 0 to 20%. A PRP of 40% constitutes marginal activity, and anything higher is inactive. Assay 2 Between five and fifty young adult virgin female rats weighing 200-300 g. each are separated into groups having the same number of female rats, and paired with male rats. One of the groups serves as the control group and the other groups as experimental groups. Vaginal Smears are performed on the females daily until sperm and vaginal plugs are found, which coincides with the day of vaginal estrus and is designated day one of pregnancy. The male rats are removed, and the experimental groups of female rats are administered raloxifene via oral garage, an intramuscular route, or by subcutaneous injection. The administration continues on a daily basis until the twelfth day of pregnancy at which time all the female rats are sacrificed and examined for the presence of implantation sites. A compound is considered active when the PRP, as defined above, is 60% or lower. Utility of the compounds described herein is exhibited by activity in at least one of the above assays. Procedures for determining the effectiveness of compounds of this invention in treatment of pulmonary hypertensive disease are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,447,941, which is incorporated herein by reference. Assay 1 The procedure as set out in Farhat et al., J PET, 261: 686 (1992) (herein incorporated by reference) is carried out. Four to thirty rats are sacrificed. The lungs are exsanguinated by perfusion via the hepatic pulmonary vein. The pulmonary artery is cannulated as is the trachea to maintain ventilation and the pulmonary cannula is connected to the perfusion line and the whole ventilated lung is removed and suspended in a perfusion chamber. The effects of vasoconstrictor substances on perfusion pressure of the isolated perfused lung is measured using a Statham pressure transducer. The increase in perfusion pressure (vasoconstriction) induced by thromboxane mimetics in the presence of estradiol is determined and the ability to block the thromboxane effects with a compound of formula I or the estradiol potentiation of the thromboxane effects will be determined. Activity of compounds of formula I is illustrated by a reduction in pulmonary perfusion pressure increase following thromboxane mimetic stimulation. Assay 2 Between five and fifty rats are administered a single IV dose of monocrotaline pyrrole, (3.5 mg/kg) and pulmonary disease is evaluated by histopathology, accumulation of fluorescein conjugated dextran in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (as a measurement of pulmonary edema), and measurement of artery pressure using a Standtham P23ID pressure transducer (Reindel et al., Tax and Applic. Pharm. 106:179-200 (1990), incorporated herein by reference. A compound of formula I is administered and the effect on the rats are evaluated. Activity of compounds of formula I is illustrated by a reduction in uptake of fluorescein conjugated dextran from bronchial alveolar lavage fluids of animals treated with a compound of formula I, indicating a reduction in pulmonary edema. Rat lungs will also be removed from thorax, perfused with modified Kamovskys fixative and processed for histopathology. A reduction in thickening of the arterial walls in treated rats is evidence for the protective role of compounds of formula I as is a decrease in pulmonary artery pressure. Assay 3 Five to fifty women are selected for the clinical study. The women suffer from a pulmonary hypertensive disease. Because of the idiosyncratic and subjective nature of these disorders, the study has a placebo control group, i.e., the women are divided into two groups, one of which receives a compound of formula I as the active agent and the other receives a placebo. Women in the test group receive between 50-200 mg of the drug per day by the oral route. They continue this therapy for 3-12 months. Accurate records are kept as to the number and severity of the symptoms in both groups and at the end of the study these results are compared. The results are compared both between members of each group and also the results for each patient are compared to the symptoms reported by each patient before the study began. Utility of the compounds of formula I is illustrated by the positive impact they have in at least one of the assays described above. The utility of a compound of this invention for inhibiting acne or seborrhea is tested by the procedures described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,439,923, incorporated herein by reference. Assay 1 Each of from between two and twenty patients selected for the clinical evaluation is placed in a comfortable environment, i.e., comfortable temperature, humidity, lighting, etc. These patients have refrained from strenuous exercise and consumption of spicy foods for the twelve hours prior to the evaluation. An area of the body which contains a large number of sebaceous glands affected by seborrhea or acne, such as the forehead, is wiped with a gauze pad to remove accumulated lipids. A patch of the skin is taped off, forming a rectangle sized 2.5 by 1.8 cm. A pad of cigarette paper or other suitable absorbent material sixed 2.5 by 1.8 cm is placed on the test area of the skin. The absorbent material must have first been defatted with ether prior to the placement on the test area to remove background lipids. The pad is the held in place with a bandage. After fifteen minutes the pad is replaced with a fresh pad (test pad). This procedure removes the background lipids in the skin so the true rate of lipid production by the sebaceous glands may be determined. The test pad is left in place for three to six hours and then removed. The test pad is then extracted with ether to remove the lipids and the ether evaporated. The residual lipids are then weighed. The result is expressed as the number of sebaceous lipids (mg) per 10 cm 2 per hour. The patient then takes either 30-400 mg/day of the active ingredient by the oral route, or applies a topical formulation containing 5-20% by weight of the active ingredient daily, both for three to nine weeks. The above described test pad methodology is repeated several times throughout administration of the active ingredient to monitor progress. This assay may also be performed on animals to verify utility. A positive effect is reflected by a decrease of the rate of sebaceous gland lipid production. Assay 2 Between two and twenty patients are enrolled in this clinical protocol and are initially evaluated by direct observation of the skin and lesions thereon. This is done by choosing one cm 2 sections of affected skin and the number and type of lesion (comedos, seborrheic lesions, etc.) is noted. The areas normally used are the cheeks, scalp or back. The patient then takes either 30-400 mg/day of the active ingredient by the oral route, or applies a topical formulation containing 5-20% by weight of the active ingredient daily, both for three to nine weeks. The areas of the skin being evaluated are checked during the period of administration. Care must be taken to evaluate the same areas and in order to accomplish this, a small mark or marks may be made on the skin by a permanent marker. A positive result is reflected by a reduction in the number and/or severity of the lesions in the monitored areas of the skin. Utility of the compounds described herein is exhibited by the positive results observed in one or both of the above assays. Utility of the compounds of this invention for treating Turners Syndrome is determined by a procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,441,966, incorporated herein by reference. Test Procedure Five to thirty females are selected for the clinical study. The females are between the age of twelve and eighteen and exhibit characteristics of Tumers Syndrome, but are in good general health otherwise. The study has a placebo control group, i.e., the females are divided into two groups, one of which receives the active agent of this invention and the other receives a placebo. Females in the test group receive between 10-100 mg of the active agent per day by the oral route. They continue this therapy for 3-12 months. Accurate records are kept as to the number and severity of the above mentioned symptoms in both groups and at the end of the study these results are compared. The results are compared both between members of each group and also the results for each patient are compared to the symptoms reported by each patient before the study began. Utility of the compounds of the invention is illustrated by the positive impact they have on one or more of the symptoms when used in a study as above. EP 0 659 419 A1 incorporated herein by reference provides methods for evaluating compounds of the present invention for breast disorders. Assay 1 Five to fifty women are selected for the clinical study. The women have a history of a breast disorder as described herein, but are in good general health. Because of the subjective nature of these disorders, the study has a placebo control group, i.e., the women are divided into two groups, one of which receive the active agent of this invention and the other receive a placebo. Women in the test group receive between 50-200 mg of the drug per day by the oral route. They continue this therapy for 3-12 months. Accurate records are kept as to the status of the breast disorders in both groups and at the end of the study these results are compared. The results are compared both between members of each group -and also the results for each patient are compared to the symptoms reported by each patient before the study began. Utility of the compounds of the invention is illustrated by the positive impact-they have on the disorder or a symptom or symptoms thereof when used in a study as above. Assay 2 Between three and twenty male patients suffering from gynecomastia or galactorrhea are selected. Initial measurement of breast size and evidence of lactation is noted. The patients receive 30-100 mg of an active compound of this invention per day as a single or divided dose via the oral route. This treatment is continued for 3-12 months. At appropriate intervals, further measurements of breast size or evidence of lactation are being made. Utility of the compounds of the invention is illustrated by the positive impact on the disorder or its symptoms. A method for determining hypoglycemic activity of the compounds of this invention is set forth in EP 0 635 264 A2, incorporated herein by reference. Five to 6 month old male, inbred viable yellow obese-diabetic mice are used. Male viable yellow mice are obese, hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic and insulin resistant. Mice are housed 6 per plastic cage with bedding and fed water and Purina Formulab Chow 5008 (Purina Mills, St. Louis, Mo.) ad libitum. The temperature of the animal rooms is maintained at 2320 C. Lights in the animal rooms were on from 0600 to 1800 h. Antiestrogens are tested at various doses as admixtures of diets. Each dose of an antiestrogen is tested on 6 mice housed in the same cage. Compounds are mixed in pulverized chow and repelletized. Mice serving as controls are given repelletized diet without any test compound. Blood samples are collected from the tail vein immediately before and weekly after the start of a test. Blood glucose concentrations are determined by the glucose oxidase method with a model 300 Alpkem Rapid Flow Analyzer (Clackamaus, Oreg.). Reduction of blood glucose concentration below the levels of the control is indicative of an effective antiestrogen with utility in treatment of diabetes and hyperglycemia. The effect of compounds of the present invention on central nervous system (CNS) disorders in post-menopausal women may be evaluated by a method described in EP 0 659 413 A2, incorporated herein by reference. Test Procedure Five to fifty women are selected for the clinical study. The women are post-menopausal, i.e., have ceased menstruating for between 6 and 12 months prior to the studys initiation, are in good general health, and suffer from one or more of the above-mentioned CNS disorders. Because of the idiosyncratic and subjective nature of these disorders, the study has a placebo control group, i.e., the women are divided into two groups, one of which receive the active agent of this invention and the other receive a placebo. Women in the test group receive between 50-100 mg of the drug per day by the oral route. They continue this therapy for 3-12 months. Accurate records are kept as to the number and severity of the above mentioned disorders in both groups and at the end of the study these results are compared. The results are compared both between members of each group and also the results for each patient are compared to the disorders reported by each patient before the study began. Utility of the compounds of the invention is illustrated by the positive impact they have on one or more of the CNS symptoms/disorders when used in a study as above. Methods for evaluating the effect of compounds of this invention in treating obsessive-compulsive and consumptive disorders are described in EP 0 659 428 A1, incorporated herein by reference. Assay 1 In order to demonstrate the in vivo effect of the compounds on alcohol consumption, experiments are designed to test the effect on free choice ethanol intake in golden hamsters. Hamsters are chosen based on previous reports that they are receptive to and give preference to high ethanol intake when compared with several other mammalian species. Kulkosky and Cornell ( Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 11: 439-44, 1979) concluded that the species differences in ethanol intake and preferences were correlated with differences in ethanol metabolism. The animals used for the experiments described herein are two to six male adult golden hamsters. Animals are maintained on a light/dark cycle of 14 hours of light per day and for a 6-week acclimation period. Animals have access to food and water ad libitum. For the experiment, the animals are maintained as described above in a single large cage with four 250 ml calibrated drinking bottles. The drinking bottles are fitted with stainless steel straight sipper tubes used to measure fluid consumption to the nearest 5 ml. Spillage from the drinking tubes is caught by 2 oz. jars fitted with glass funnels and positioned under the sipper tubes. Fluid consumption by the hamsters is measured once every 3 days so that the consumption volumes are large enough to obtain reasonably accurate measurements. After a 6-week acclimation period, the body weights of the animals are taken, and water intake is noted. Water in 2 of the 4 drinking bottles is then replaced by a 15% ethanol solution and consumption of water and aqueous ethanol are measured for a period of 2 weeks. Within 2 to 3 days after the beginning of this free choice phase of feeding, the hamsters establish an explicit preference for aqueous ethanol over water and the initial preference ratio (aqueous ethanol intake divided by water intake) is noted. As a control, the animals are then fed with 0.2 ml water twice daily, using a stainless steel animal feeding needle. Water feeding does not seem to have any effect on the animalsdrinking behavior as measured by total fluid intake. After 6 days, the same group of hamsters are fed a compound of formula I via a liquid mixture for a period of 3 to 12 weeks. Activity of the compounds of formula I is illustrated by the preference ratio being lower during administration of said compound of the invention than the initial preference ratio. Assay 2 Five to fifty women are selected for the clinical study. The women are post-menopausal, i.e., have ceased menstruating for between 6 and 12 months prior to the studys initiation, are in good general health, and suffer from either obsessive-compulsive or a consumptive disorder. Because of the idiosyncratic and subjective nature of these disorders, the study has a placebo control group, i.e., the women are divided into two groups, one of which receives raloxifene as the active agent and the other receives a placebo. Women in the test group receive between 50-200 mg of the drug per day by the oral route. They continue this therapy for 3-12 months. Accurate records are kept as to the number and severity of the symptoms in both groups and at the end of the study these results are compared. The results are compared both between members of each group and also the results for each patient are compared to the symptoms reported by each patient before the study began. Utility of the compounds of formula I is illustrated by the positive impact they have on one or more of the disorders/symptoms when used in an assay described above. EP 0 659 414 A2, incorporated herein by reference describes methods for evaluating compounds of the invention for inhibition of hirsutism and alopecia. Hirsutism Three to twenty women suffering from hirsutism are selected. These patients are initially scored for the extent and severity of hirsutism. The clinical evaluation is made by the methods described in the reference Methods of Skin Research, John Wiley and Sons, pp 308-318 (1985), and the references cited therein. The patients receive 10-400 mg of an active compound of this invention per day as a single or split dose by oral administration. Alternatively, they apply a 10%, by weight of active ingredient, creme or lotion once or twice a day to the affected areas. The patient continues this protocol for six months. At appropriate intervals, re-evaluation by one of the methods described above would be made. Alopecia Three to twenty women suffering from female pattern alopecia are selected. These patients are initially scored for the extent and severity of the alopecia. This clinical evaluation is made by the-methods described in Methods of Skin Research, John Wiley and Sons, pp 308-318 (1985) and Habif, T., Clinical Dermatology, C. V. Mosby Co., Chapter 23, pp 493-504 (1985); and references therein, herein incorporated by reference. Especially helpful in these evaluations is the hair pluck procedure and measurement of anagen to telogen ratio. The patients receive 10-400 mg of an active compound of this invention per day as a single or split dose by oral administration. Alternatively, the patients apply a 5-10% (by weight of a compound of this invention) as a creme, lotion, or shampoo to the affected area, once to twice a day. This protocol continues for six months. At appropriate intervals, re-evaluation by one of the methods described in the above references is made. A positive result is exhibited by an increase in the anagen to telogen ratio or an increase in the number of terminal hairs in the affected scalp region. Utility of the compounds of the invention is illustrated by the positive impact they have on one or more of the symptoms when used in a study as above. Assays which show the ability of compounds of the invention to increase macrophage function are described in EP 0 659 425 A1, incorporated herein by reference. Assay 1 The procedure as set out in Friedman et al., J. Clin. Invest., 75, 162-167 (1985) (herein incorporated by reference) is carried out, with certain modifications. Between five and one hundred mice are administered oral doses in the range of 1-10 mg/kg of a compound of formula 1 on a daily basis. Following the administration, macrophages are harvested and changes in both immune (Fc mediated) and non-immune phagocytosis are quantitated by using fluorescein conjugated yeast particles prepared based on Ragsdale, J. Immunol. Meth., 123:259 (1989). For immune mediated phagocytosis, fluorescein conjugated yeast is preincubated with mouse sera to promote opsonization. Increase in fluorescence uptake by macrophages is quantitated by an increase in fluorescent emission using excitation and emission wavelengths of 482 and 520 nm, respectively. This procedure is used with ex vivo or in vitro macrophage cultures and changes in fluorescence units quantitated. An increase in fluorescent units, as compared to control indicates activity of compounds of formula 1. Assay 2 The procedure as set out in Zuckerman et al., Cell immunol, 103:207, (1986); J. Immunol., 140:978 (1988) (herein incorporated by reference) is carried out. The ability to induce class II antigens and consequently promote antigen presentation is determined on ex vivo primary peritoneal macrophages and in vitro with the murine macrophage cell line P388D1. Between five and one hundred mice are dosed with a compound of formula 1 macrophages are harvested and probed with antibodies against class II antigens of the D haplotype. Increased class II antigen expression is determined by flow cytometry using the appropriate secondary antibodies. In vitro studies evaluate the effects of the compounds in increasing the basal level and gamma interferon inducible expression of class 11antigen by flow cytometry. An increase in class II expression reflect an increase in macrophage activation. Assay 3 The procedure as set out in Seow et al., J. Immunol. Meth., 98, 113 (1987) (herein incorporated by reference) is carried out. The assay is used to evaluate increases in macrophage effector functions which uses measurements of 2-deoxyglucose uptake. Macrophages ex vivo and in vivo are plated in 96 well plates at 10 5 cells per well and incubated in phosphate buffered saline in the presence of 0.78 uCi/ml of 3H-deoxyglucose, and a compound of formula 1 is placed in the wells. Reduction in the amount of extracellular glucose reflects the uptake of this non-metabolizable glucose analog and consequently provides an independent assay for the determination of the state of macrophage activation mediated by the compound of formula 1. Increase in deoxyglucose uptake by the compound demonstrates the ability of the compounds to increase the state of macrophage activation. Assay 4 The procedure as set out in Zuckerman, Circ Shock, 29, 279 (1989) (herein incorporated by reference) is carried out to illustrate the ability of the compounds of formula 1 to protect in murine sepsis and endotoxin lethality models. Between five and one hundred mice are dosed orally with 1-10 mg/kg with a compound of formula 1 for 1 week prior to sepsis challenge. Challenge is performed using a bolus IV endotoxin injection under condition in which an LD100 is achieved (200 g lipopolysaccharide). Exogenous glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone at 20 mg/kg serve as a positive control in creasing survival. The effects of the compound of formula 1 is also determined using a sepsis model involving cecal ligation and puncture. Sepsis by both Gram positive and Gram negative organisms results in an LD100 by 48 hours despite the use of antibiotics. An increase in the number of surviving animals or in survival time, as compared to control, demonstrates the activity of the compounds. Assay 5 The ability of the compounds of formula 1 to increase the secretion of cytokines such as TNF is quantitated in vivo by sera measurements using commercially available TNF ELISAs specific for mouse TNF. Between five and one hundred mice are orally dosed with 1-10 mg/kg of a compound of formula 1 for one week prior to injection of a lethal or sublethal dose of lipopolysaccharide (200 and 1 g, respectively). At one hour post LPS injection the mice are bled and the basal and LPS inducible amounts of serum TNF determined. Routinely, TNF levels below 10 pg/ml are observed prior to LPS injection and achieve levels of 5-20 ng/ml following LPS. The ability of the compounds to modulate the basal or inducible levels of TNF is determined. An increase in basal TNF without triggering massive systemic TNF release in compound treated mice demonstrates the activity of the compounds in promoting cytokyne secretion. Finally, ex vivo and in vitro measurements of TNF release from peritoneal macrophages exposed to 1-5 M of a compound in vitro is also performed by ELISA to determine the extent of cytokine increase mediated by a compound of formula 1. Assay 6 Five to fifty women are selected for the clinical study. The women are immunosuppressed. Because of the idiosyncratic and subjective nature of these disorders, the study has a placebo control group, i.e., the women are divided into two groups, one of which receives a compound of formula 1 as the active agent and the other receives a placebo. Women in the test group receive between 50-200 mg of the drug per day. They continue this therapy for 3-12 months. Accurate records are kept as to the number and severity of the symptoms in both groups and at the end of the study these results are compared. The results are compared both between members of each group and also the results for each patient are compared to the symptoms reported by each patient before the study began. Utility of the compounds of formula 1 in increasing macrophage function is illustrated by the positive impact they have in at least one of the assays described above. Such compounds are useful in combating infections and promote wound healing. What is claimed is: 1.

TECHNICAL FILED The present invention relates to novel compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. More particularly, it relates to novel amidino derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which are useful as urokinase inhibitors, to processes for the preparation thereof, to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same, to a use of the same as a medicament and to a method of the therapeutic treatment of diseases in a human being or an animal. Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide novel amidino derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which are useful as urokinase inhibitors. Another object of the present invention is to provide processes for the preparation of novel amidino derivatives and salts thereof. A further object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an active ingredient, said amidino derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Urokinase (urokinase-type Plasminogen Activator, uPA) is a multi-domain serine protease which is able to convert the inactive precursor plasminogen to active plasmine. Among the family of plasminogen activators, tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) is present both in normal and in malignant tissue, whereas uPA has been shown to be produced abundantly by several common malignancies such as melanoma and colon, breast and prostate cancers. Cellular invasiveness initiated by urokinase causes many physiological processes such as angiogenesis, neovascularization, bone restructuring, embryo implantaion in the uterus (embryonic development), infiltration of immune cells into inflammatory sites, ovulation, trophoblast implantation, breast, uterine, and prostatic involution, spermatogenesis, tissue remodeling during wound repair (wound healing) and organ differentiation, fibrosis, local invasion of tumors into adjacent areas (tumor invasion), metastatic spread of tumor cells from primary to secondary sites (tumor metastasis), and tissue destruction in arthritis. Inhibitors of urokinase therefore have mechanism-based anti-angiogenic, anti-arthritic, anti-inflammatory, anti-invasive, anti-metastatic, anti-osteoporotic, anti-retinopathic (for angiogenesis-dependent retinopathies), contraceptive, and tumoristatic activities.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to compounds that inhibit certain integrins, particularly to compounds that inhibit v integrins. 2. Description of the Background Art Integrins are a major family of adhesion receptors. They are produced by most cell types and are a means by which the cell senses its immediate environment and responds to changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) composition. ECM is composed of structural and regulatory molecules, some of which include laminin, collagen, vitronectin and fibronectin, as well as a variety of proteoglycans. These molecules, in cooperation with cell surface receptors, not only provide the basis for structural support, but also contribute to the transmission of biochemical signals from the ECM to the cells interior. Thus, integrins are cell adhesion receptors capable of mediating cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions. Integrins are implicated in the regulation of cellular adhesion, migration, invasion, proliferation, angiogenesis, osteoclast bone resorption, apoptosis and gene expression (P. C. Brooks, DNP, 10(8), 456-61, 1997). The integrin family is composed of 15 and 8 subunits that are contained in over twenty different heterodimeric combinations on cell surfaces. Each heterodimers have distinct cellular and adhesive specificities. Integrins bind to extracellular matrix proteins or cell surface molecules through short peptides sequences present in the ligands. Although some integrins selectively recognize a single extracellular matrix protein ligand, other bind to two or more ligands. Several integrins recognize the tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), whereas others recognize alternative short peptide sequences. Combinations of different integrins on cell surfaces allow cells to recognize and respond to a variety of different extracellular matrix proteins (J. A. Varner and D. A. Cheresh, Curr. Opin. Cell Biol., 8, 724-30, 1996). The v -series integrins are a major subfamily of integrins. As well as classically mediating cell attachment and spreading, v integrins are implicated in cell locomotion, in ligand-receptor internalization, as virus co-receptors, in management of the extracellular protease cascades and as regulators of tumor progression, angiogenesis and apoptosis. The specificities of the five known v -integrins, v 1 , v 3 , v 5 , v 6 and v 8 have been defined and they exclusively recognize ligands via the tripeptide sequence RGD, including vitronectin ( v 1 , v 3 , v 5 ), fibronectin ( v 1 , v 5 , v 6 ), von Willibrand factor ( v 3 ), fibrinogen ( v 3 ) and osteopontin ( v 3 ) (F. Mitjans, J. Cell. Science, 108, 2825-38, 1995). In disease, adhesive function is frequently compromised and results in tissue disorder, aberrant cell migration and dysregulation of signaling pathways. It is well known that alterations in the composition and integrity of the ECM can significantly influence cellular behavior, which in turn may have an impact on a number of pathological processes such as tumor neovascularization, restenosis, arthritis, and tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, inhibiting the function of molecules that regulate these cellular events may have significant therapeutic benefit (P. C. Brooks, DNP, 10(8), 456-61, 1997). There are at least three major classes of reagents currently being developed as integrin antogonists, and these include antibodies (monoclonal, polyclonal and synthetic) and small synthetic peptides (synthetic cyclic RGD peptides), as well as a family of snake venom-derived proteins termed disintegrins. The third major group of antagonists includes non-peptide mimetics and organic-type compounds. Integrin v 3 , the most promiscuous member of the integrin family, mediates cellular adhesion to vitronecin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, laminin, collagen, von Willibrand factor, osteopontin and adenovirus penton base. Expression of this integrin enables a given cell to adhere to, migrate on, or respond to almost any matrix protein it may encounter. Integrins of the v subfamily are implicated in tumor development. Integrin v 3 is minimally, if at all expressed on resting, or normal, blood vessels, but is significantly upregulated on vascular cells within human tumors. In particular, both vertical progression of the primary melanoma and distant metastases are characterized histologically by an increased expression of v 3 integrin (B. Felding-Habermann et al., J. Clin. Invest., 89, 2018-22, 1992). A study involving human malignant melanoma, an increasingly prevalent and aggressive skin cancer, reported the use of monoclonal antibodies to block the v integrin-ligand interaction which resulted in severely disrupting the development of the tumor (F. Mitjans et al., J. Cell Sci., 108, 2825-38, 1995). Another important physiological role played by integrin v 3 in cancer is within the process of angiogenesis. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, allows the cancer to spread and grow. It was shown that blood vessels involved in angiogenesis have enhanced expression of v 3 (P. C. Brooks et al., Science, 264, 569-571, 1994; C. J. Drake et al., J. Cell Sci., 108, 2655-61, 1995). It was also shown that preventing the v 3 integrin from binding to their ligands caused apoptosis (programmed cell death) in the endothelial cells of newly formed blood vessels and inhibited neovascularization (P. C. Brooks et al., Cell, 79, 1157-64, 1994; M. Christofidou-Solomidou et al., Am. J. Pathol., 151(40), 975-83, 1997; J. Luna, Lab. Invest., 75(4), 563-73, 1996). Thus, antagonists of integrin v 3 may provide a powerful therapeutic approach for the treatment of neoplasia or other diseases characterized by angiogenesis. Another pathological process which involves v 3 is coronary restenosis. Surgical trauma and/or injury to blood vessels may lead to the stimulation of smooth muscle cells resulting in an increase migration and proliferation of these cells, which causes an occlusion in the vessel wall and prevents blood flow. Following arterial injury, it was shown that there was early upregulation of integrin v 3 at sites of cell accumulation within the vessel wall and that selective blockade of v 3 was an effective anti-restenotic strategy (S. S. Srivatsa et al., Cardiovascul. Res., 36, 408-28, 1997). v integrins are especially interesting targets since they are implicated in many metabolic processes, such as angiogenesis, bone resorption, and cellular migration and proliferation. Consequently, antagonists of v integrins have great therapeutic potential for diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, eye diseases (diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration), restenosis, neointimal hyperplasia, osteoporosis and more particularly against tumors, since they simultaneously strike at the developing tumor and at its blood supply (U.S. Pat. No. 5843906-WO 9736859/GD Searle Co; EP 854140/Hoechst AG; WO 9733887-WO9637492/Du Pont Merck Pharm Co; WO 9844797-WO 9831359-WO 9818461-WO 9744333-WO 9737655-WO 9532710-WO 9408577). There is thus a constant need to find other antagonists of v integrins in order to provide additional modes of treatments for many diseases that still have no cure. The present invention satisfies this and other need.

The present invention also includes methods of making compounds of formula I or any of the other formulas disclosed herein. Compounds of the present invention can be synthesized using conventional preparative steps and recovery methods known to those skilled in the art of organic chemistry. A synthetic route according to one embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Scheme 1 and described as follows. As used herein, functional groups R1-R5, X, W and B are as previously defined.

According to Scheme 2, 5-(carbonyl)-substituted thiophene or furan derivative 1 (wherein E is selected from the group consisting of N,O,H or halide) is coupled to a suitably protected 3-amino propionic acid using standard peptidic coupling procedures to provide the precursor thiophene 2 which is in turn modified in ways related to the work of Goddard (Goddard, Carl J., 5-Heteroaryl-2-thiophenecarboxylic acids: oxazoles and oxadiazoles., J. Heterocycl. Chem., (1991), 28(1), 17-28) or Kelarev (Kelarev V. I., Koshelev V. N., Morozova G. V., Karakhanov R. A., Remizov A. S., Khim Geterotsikl Soedin KGSSAQ, 1995, (2), 214-223) or Furukawa (Hayashi S., Furukawa M., Fujino Y., Morishita H., Chem Pharm Bull CPBTAL, 1971, 19, 1789) providing a heterobicyclic compound 3 (wherein A1 is an aryl form of A as herein defined). For example, carboxylic acid 2 (wherein E is OH) was coupled with phenyl-bisguanidine using standard peptidic coupling procedure and provided thienotriazine 3. Another synthetic route according to one embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Scheme 3 and described as follows. As used herein, functional groups R1-R5, X, W, Z, A and B are as previously defined 5-Halo-substituted thiophene or furan derivative 1 (wherein G is halogen) was coupled with a suitably functionalized 3-aminopropionic acid to give amide 2. Palladium cross coupling using either the methods developed by Stille (Stille J. K., Angew. Chem., 1986, 98, 504-519) or Suzuki (Miyaura N., Suzuki A., Chem. Rev ., 1995, 95, 2457-2483) or Heck (Heck R. F., Palladium Reagents in Organic Syntheses, 1985, Academic Press) were then carried to link the aryl, alkenyl or alkynyl moiety to the thiophene or furan moiety. For example, reaction of a phenylboronic acid in the presence of a palladium catalyst under basic conditions gave the desired phenyl thiophene 3 in good yield. Where appropriate, the product was then converted into a suitably functionalized derivative. For example, cross coupling of an alkyne with compound 1 gave an alkynyl-thiophene derivative 3 which upon hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst gave an alkenyl or alkyl derivative.

For example, binding agents, such as acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers, such as lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tableting lubricants such as magnesium stearate; disintegrants, such as starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium starch glycollate or microcrystalline cellulose; or pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate. The compounds may be injected parenterally; this being intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, the compound may be used in the form of sterile solutions containing other solutes, for example, sufficient saline or glucose to make the solution isotonic. The amount of active ingredient administered parenterally will be approximately 0.01 to 250 mg/kg/day, preferably about 0.05 to 10 mg/kg/day, more preferably about 0.5 to 30 mg/kg/day, and more most preferably about 1-20 mg/kg/day. The compounds may be administered orally in the form of tablets, capsules, or granules containing suitable excipients such as starch, lactose, white sugar and the like. The compounds may be administered orally in the form of solutions which may contain coloring and/or flavoring agents. The compounds may also be administered sublingually in the form of tracheas or lozenges in which each active ingredient is mixed with sugar or corn syrups, flavoring agents and dyes, and then dehydrated sufficiently to make the mixture suitable for pressing into solid form. The amount of active ingredient administered orally will depend on bioavailability of the specific compound. The solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling, tableting, or the like. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers. Such operations are, of course, conventional in the art. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice, in particular with an enteric coating. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may or may not contain conventional additives. For example suspending agents, such as sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminum stearate gel, or hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, such as sorbitan monooleate or acaci; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), such as almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters selected from the group consisting of glycerine, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, and ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for instance methyl para-hydroxybenzoate, ethyl para-hydroxybenzoate, n-propyl parahydroxybenzoate, or n-butyl parahydroxybenzoate of sorbic acid; and, if desired, conventional flavoring or coloring agents. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms may be prepared by utilizing the compound of the present invention and a sterile vehicle, and, depending on the concentration employed, may be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Once in solution, the compound may be injected and filter sterilized before filling a suitable vial or ampoule and subsequently sealing the carrier or storage package. Adjuvants, such as a local anesthetic, a preservative or a buffering agent, may be dissolved in the vehicle prior to use. Stability of the pharmaceutical composition may be enhanced by freezing the composition after filling the vial and removing the water under vacuum, (e.g., freeze drying the composition). Parenteral suspensions may be prepared in substantially the same manner, except that the peptide should be suspended in the vehicle rather than being dissolved, and, further, sterilization is not achievable by filtration. The compound may be sterilized, however, by exposing it to ethylene oxide before suspending it in the sterile vehicle. A surfactant or wetting solution may be advantageously included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound. The pharmaceutical composition of this invention comprise a compound of formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or adjuvant. Typically, they contain from about 1% to about 99% by weight of active compound, and preferably from about 10% to about 60% by weight depending on which method of administration is employed. Physicians will determine the dosage of the present therapeutic agents which will be most suitable. Dosages may vary with the mode of administration and the particular compound chosen. In addition, the dosage may vary with the particular patient under treatment. The dosage of the compound used in the treatment will vary, depending on disease stage, the weight of the patient, the relative efficacy of the compound and the judgment of the treating physician. Such therapy may extend for several weeks or months, in an intermittent or uninterrupted manner. To further assist in understanding the present invention, the following non-limiting examples are provided.

Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) A) Shell-less Embryo Culture Fertilized white leghorn chicken eggs (SPAFAS Inc., Norwich, Conn.) were received at day 0 and incubated for 3 days at 37 C with constant humidity. On day 3, eggs were rinsed with 70% ethanol and opened into 100 mm 2 tissue culture coated Petri dishes under aseptic conditions. The embryos were then returned to a humidified 38 C incubator for 7-9 additional days. B) Mesh Assay Vitrogen (Collagen Biomaterials, Palo Alto, Calif.) at a final concentration of 0.73 mg/mL and Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, Mass.) at a final concentration of 10 mg/mL was directly pipetted onto Nylon meshes with 250 m 2 openings which were cut into 4 mm4 mm squares and autoclaved. Polymerization of meshes were under aseptic conditions, on bacteriological Petri dishes. The polymerization conditions for each substrate were identical; after mixing with or without 250 g of VPF/VEGF 165 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, N.J.) and/or compounds of interest, 40 L were pipetted onto each mesh in a bacteriological Petri dish. The Petri dish was placed in a humidified 37 C incubator with 5% CO 2 for 30 minutes to allow polymerization followed by an incubation at 4 C. for 2 hours. In a tissue culture enclosure, meshes were placed onto the periphery of the CAM of a day 12-14 embryo, excluding areas containing major vessels. The embryos were then returned to the humidified 38 C. incubator with 3% CO 2 for 24 to 48 additional hours. C) Visualization and Quantification of Vessels Embryos were removed from the incubator and meshes were viewed under a dissecting microscope for gross evaluation. Injection of 400 L FITC dextran, MW 2,000,000 (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) through glass microcapillary tubes by infusion into the umbilical vein was performed at a rate of 200 l per minute. The FITC dextran was allowed to circulate for 5 minutes and 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS was applied directly on each mesh. The embryos were then incubated at 4 C. for 5 minutes and the meshes were dissected off the CAM and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes to overnight. After fixation, meshes were mounted on slides with 90% glycerol in PBS and visualized on an inverted fluorescence microscope. A Nikon Diaphot with a Sony DXC-151A camera attached to the side port was used for capture of images and analysis was with the NIH Image 1.61 software program. For each mesh, 5 random staggered images (approximately 600 m each) were captured. The areas of high intensity were highlighted and measured. Results are expressed as ability to suppress capillary formation after subtraction from negative control. Values were calculated as % inhibition, considering 100% the capillary density achieved by VPF in the presence of vitrogen alone minus the background levels in the absence of VPF. Negative values indicated angiogenic stimulation above the VPF positive control. Results for the cam assay showed significant inhibition values for some of the compounds tested.

The C 6-14 alkyl chain may be in ortho, meta or para, preferably in para. Preferably each of R 2 to R 5 is H. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the formula (I) include salts with inorganic acids, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide and sulfate, salts with organic acids, such as acetate, fumarate, maleate, benzoate, citrate, malate, methanesulfonate and benzenesulfonate salts, and when a carboxy group is present, salts with metals such as sodium, potassium, calcium and aluminium, salts with amines, such as triethylamine and salts with dibasic amino acids, such as lysine. The compounds and salts of the present invention encompass hydrate and solvate forms. When the compounds of formula I have one or more asymmetric centers in the molecule, the present invention is to be understood as embracing the various optical isomers, as well as racemates, diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof are embraced. Particularly preferred compounds of formula I are 2-amino-2-tetradecyl-1,3-propanediol and especially 2-amino-2-2-(4-octylphenyl)ethyl-1,3-propanediol, (hereinafter Compound A) e.g. in hydrochloride form. Compounds of formula I have, on the basis of observed activity, e.g. as described in EP-A1-627,406 been found to be useful e.g. as immunosuppressant, e.g. in the treatment of acute allograft rejection. Organ transplants of liver, kidney, lung and heart are now regularly performed as treatment for endstage organ disease. Allograft as well as xenograft transplants have been performed. However, because of problems with long-term chronic rejection, organ transplantation is not yet a permanent solution to irreversible organ disease. Chronic rejection, which manifests as progressive and irreversible graft dysfunction, is the leading cause of organ transplant loss, in some cases already after the first postoperative year. The clinical problem of chronic rejection is clear from transplantation survival times; about half of kidney allografts are lost within 5 years after transplantation, and a similar value is observed in patients with a heart allograft. Chronic rejection is considered as a multifactorial process in which not only the immune reaction towards the graft but also the response of the blood vessel wall in the grafted organ to injury (response-to-injury reaction) plays a role. The variant of chronic rejection with the worst prognosis is an arteriosclerosis-like alteration, also called transplant vasculopathy graft vessel disease, graft atherosclerosis, transplant coronary disease, etc. This vascular lesion is characterized by migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells under influence of growth factors, that are amongst others synthesized by endothelium. It appears to progress also through repetitive endothelial injury induced amongst others by host antibody or antigen-antibody complexes, through intimal proliferation and thickening, smooth muscle cell hypertrophy repair, and finally to gradual luminal obliteration. Also so-called non-immunological factors like hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia etc. play a role. Chronic rejection appears to be inexorable and uncontrollable because there is no known effective treatment or prevention modality. Thus, there continues to exist a need for a treatment effective in preventing, controlling or reversing manifestations of chronic graft vessel diseases. In accordance with the present invention, it has now surprisingly been found that compounds of formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form inhibit graft vessel disease and are particularly indicated to prevent or treat chronic rejection in a transplanted organ. Furthermore, it has also been found that compounds of formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form suppress xenograft rejection. In accordance with the particular findings of the present invention, there is provided: 1.1. A method of preventing or treating manifestations of chronic rejection, e.g. to avoid, reduce or restrict chronic rejection, in a recipient of organ or tissue allo- or xeno-transplant, e.g. heart, lung, combined heart-lung, liver, kidney or pancreatic transplant, comprising the step of administering to said recipient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form; 1.2. A method of preventing or treating graft vessel diseases, e.g. transplant vasculopathy, arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis, in a recipient of organ or tissue allo- or xeno-transplant, e.g. heart, lung, combined heart-lung, liver, kidney or pancreatic transplants, comprising the step of administering to said recipient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form; In a series of further specific or alternative embodiments, the present invention also provides: 2. A method of preventing or controlling acute rejection in a xenograft transplant recipient, e.g. a patient receiving a heart, lung, combined heart-lung, kidney, liver, bone marrow, pancreatic bowel, skin or corneal xenotransplant, comprising administering to said recipient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form. As alternative to the above the present invention also provides: 3. A compound of formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form for use in any method as defined under 1 or 2 above; or 4. A compound of formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form for use in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for use in any method as defined under 1 or 2 above; or 5. A pharmaceutical composition for use in any method as defined under 1 or 2 above comprising a compound of formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents or carriers therefor. Utility of the compounds of formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form in chronic rejection, as well as utility in treating diseases and conditions as hereinabove specified, may be demonstrated in animal tests for example in accordance with the methods hereinafter described, as well as in clinic where e.g. the transplanted organ or tissue may be submitted to regular biopsy controls and in the case of heart transplant additionally to ultrasound scanning. A. Prevention of Graft Vessel Disease Experimental animals: Inbred rat strains DA (RT1 a , donors) and Lewis (RT1 1 , recipients of allografts), weighing between 200 and 350 grams are used. The animals are allowed unrestricted access to food and water before and after the operation. Carotid artery transplantation: The rats are anaesthetised with isofluorane (Abbott), (4-5% for induction, 1.5-2% for maintenance) and 300 g atropin sulphate is injected subcutaneously following the induction. The left carotid artery is dissected free. The artery is clamped proximally and distally and a segment of about 7-10 mm is removed. The gap is bridged by an allograft which had also been subjected to 45 min cold ischemia. Ethilon 10/o sutures are used. Finally the skin is closed with 4/0 sutures. If needed, an Alzet osmotic minipump (Alza Corp. Palo Alto, Calif.) is then implanted subcutaneously over the back (alternatively the animals are treated orally). The rats are subject to one of the following treatments: A compound of formula I alone at the doses of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, or in combination with Cyclosporin A at the dose of 0.03, 0.3, or 1 mgkg 1 day 1 is administered for 8 weeks either by using Alzet osmotic minipumps implanted subcutaneously or alternatively by oral administration. At 8 weeks the rats are sacrificed, the carotid arteries are perfused for 1 min with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS, pH 7.4) and then for 15 min with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The carotid arteries are then excised and stained in Giemsa solution for histological evaluation. Morphometric analysis includes the measurement of the thickness of the media and intima. A qualitative analysis of the morphological changes includes a scoring on an 0-3 scale for adventitial infiltration of mononuclear cells and necrosis (vacuolar degeneration, hypertrophy of cells), the number of smooth muscle cells (SMC) nuclei in the media (0-10, 100, 100 and 100 nuclei for scores, 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively, SMC necrosis (vacuolar degeneration and hypertrophy of SMC) and the intimal infiltration of mononuclear cells (13). In both experiments, the compounds of formula 1, particularly Compound A in hydrochloride form, significantly inhibit graft infiltration and neointima formation. B. In vivo heart xenotransplantation (hamster-to-rat) The hamster-into-rat xenograft combination is a so-called difficult concordant combination. Rats do not have natural anti-hamster antibody in sufficient amounts to yield immediate hyperacute rejection as observed in concordant combinations; however, rejection in untreated recipients occurs within 3-4 days, by antibodies in combination with complement. This is visualized in histology by destruction of blood vessels, exsudation and extravasation of erythrocytes, and influx by polymorphonuclear granulocytes; often there are signs of hemorrhage and thrombosis. Once this rejection has been overcome by effective inhibition of antibody synthesis or complement inactivation, a cellular rejection can emerge later on. This is visualized in histology by influx of mononuclear cells, including lymphocytes, lymphoblastoid cells, and macro-phages, and destruction of the myocyte parenchyma. The inhibition of cellular rejection requires more immuno- suppression than that of allografts. Congenitally athymic (rnu/rnu) rats lack a competent (thymus-dependent) cellular immune system and generally are unable to reject allografts. Such animals do reject a hamster xenograft within 3-4 days in a similar fashion as euthymic rats, indicative that (at least part of) anti-hamster antibody synthesis in rats occurs following a thymus-independent B-cell response. Such recipients are useful in hamster xenografting to evaluate rejection by thymus-independent antibody-mediated rejection. The heart of a Syrian hamster is heterotopically transplanted in the abdomen of a male Lewis (RT1 1 ) rat with anastomoses between the donor and recipients aorta and the donor right pulmonary artery to the recipients inferior vena cava. The graft is monitored daily by palpation of the abdomen. Rejection is concluded in case of cessation of heart beat. Animals are weighed weekly. In the present series of experiments, the endpoint is set to 28 days. Animals are subjected to autopsy; apart from the graft, weight and histology is assessed for thymus, spleen, liver, seminal vesicles and testes. Blood is taken and processed to serum for the determination of cytolytic anti-hamster erythrocyte antibody and hemolytic complement activity. Compounds are dissolved in water and administered daily orally in a volume of 2 ml/kg body weight. Administration of 5-30 mg/kg/day, of a compound of Formula I, e.g. Compound A in hydrochloride form, results in prolonged graft survival, in both athymic and euthymic recipients. Daily dosages required in practicing the method of the present invention will vary depending upon, for example, the compound of formula I employed, the host, the mode of administration, the severity of the condition to be treated, and the optionally concomitantly used immunosuppressive drug e.g. CysA. A preferred daily dosage range is about from 0.03 to 2.5 mg/kg per day, particularly 0.1 to 2.5 mg/kg per day, e.g. 0.5 to 2.5 mg/kg per day as a single dose or in divided doses. Suitable daily dosages for patients are on the order of from e.g. 1 to 100 mg p.o. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration comprise from ca. 1 to 50 mg, usually 5 to 30 mg active ingredient, e.g. Compound A, e.g. in hydrochloride form, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents or carriers therefor. As an alternative, the compound of formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form may also be administered twice or three times a week, e.g. at a dosage as indicated above. The compounds of formula I may be administered by any conventional route, in particular enterally, e.g. orally, for example in the form of solutions for drinking, tablets or capsules or parenterally, for example in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds of formula I may be manufactured in conventional manner, e.g. as described in EP-A1-627,406. The compounds of formula I may be administered as the sole active ingredient or together with other drugs in immunomodulating regimens or other anti-inflammatory agents. For example, the compounds of formula I may be used in combination with cyclosporins, rapamycins or ascomycins, or their immunosuppressive analogs, e.g. cyclosporin A, cyclosporin G, FK-506, rapamycin, 40-O-(2-hydroxy)ethyl-rapamycin, etc.; corticosteroids; cyclophosphamide; azathioprene; methotrexate; brequinar; leflunomide; mizoribine; mycophenolic acid; mycophenolate mofetil; 15-deoxyspergualine; immuno-suppressive monoclonal antibodies, e.g., monoclonal antibodies to leukocyte receptors, e.g., to MHC, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD7, CD25, CD28, B7, CD40, CD45, or CD58 or to their ligands; or other immunomodulatory compounds, e.g. CTLA4-lg. Where the compounds of formula I are administered in conjunction with other immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy, e.g. for preventing or treating chronic rejection as hereinabove specified, dosages of the co-administered immunosuppressant or immuno-modulatory compound will of course vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, e.g. whether it is a steroid or a cyclosporin, on the specific drug employed, on the condition being treated, and so forth. In accordance with the foregoing the present invention provides in a yet further aspect: 6. A method as defined above comprising co-administration, e.g. concomitantly or in sequence, of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I and a second drug substance, said second drug substance being an immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory drug, e.g. as set forth above. 7. A Wit or package for use in any method as defined under 1 or 2 above, comprising a compound of formula 1, in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, with at least one pharmaceutical composition comprising an immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory drug. The kit or package may comprise instructions for its administration.

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to novel semisynthetic macrolides having antibacterial activity and useful in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections. More particularly, the invention relates to tricyclic erythromycin derivatives, compositions containing such compounds and methods for using the same, as well as processes for making such compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Erythromycins A through D, represented by formula (E), (E) Erythromycin R a R b A OH CH 3 B H CH 3 C OH H D H H are well-known and potent antibacterial agents, used widely to treat and prevent bacterial infection. As with other antibacterials, however, bacterial strains having resistance or insufficient susceptibility to erythromycin have been identified. Also, erythromycin A has only weak activity against Grarn-negative bacteria Therefore, there is a continuing need to identify new erythromycin derivative compounds which possess improved antibacterial activity, which have less potential for developing resistance, which possess the desired Gram-negative activity, or which possess unexpected selectivity against target microorganisms. Consequently, numerous investigators have prepared chemical derivatives of erythromycin in an attempt to obtain analogs having modified or improved profiles of antibiotic activity. Kashimura, et al. have disclosed 6-O-methylerythromycin derivatives having a tricyclic basic nuclear structure in European Application 559896, published Nov. 11, 1991.

Numerous asymmetric centers may exist in the compounds of the present invention. Except where otherwise noted, the present invention contemplates the various stereoisomers and mixtures thereof. Accordingly, whenever a bond is represented by a wavy line, it is intended that a mixture of stereo-orientations or an individual isomer of assigned or unassigned orientation may be present. As used herein, the term pharmaceutically acceptable salt refers to those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/iisk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, S. M. Berge, et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical Sciences , 66: 1-19 (1977), incorporated herein by reference. The salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention, or separately by reacting the free base function with a suitable organic acid. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuc acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, loweralkyl sulfonate and aryl sulfonate. As used herein, the term pharmaceutically acceptable ester refers to esters which hydrolyze in vivo and include those that break down readily in the human body to leave the parent compound or a salt thereof. Suitable ester groups include, for example, those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable aliphatic carboxylic acids, particularly alkanoic, alkenoic, cycloalkanoic and alkanedioic acids, in which each alkyl or alkenyl moiety advantageously has not more than 6 carbon atoms. Examples of particular esters includes formates, acetates, propionates, butyates, acrylates and ethylsuccinates. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. As used herein, the term pharmaceutically acceptable carrier means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil; sesame oil; olive oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringers solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, or as an oral or nasal spray. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubjiig agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringers solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating arL They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like. The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active compound of this invention, excipients such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof. Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to the compounds of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons. Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel. According to the methods of treatment of the present invention, bacterial infections are treated or prevented in a patient such as a human or lower mammal by administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, in such amounts and for such time as is necessary to achieve the desired result. By a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention is meant a sufficient amount of the compound to treat bacterial infections, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts. The total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a human or other mammal in single or in divided doses can be in amounts, for example, from 0.01 to 50 mg/kg body weight or more usually from 0.1 to 25 mg/kg body weight. Single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. In general, treatment regimens according to the present invention comprise administration to a patient in need of such treatment from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg of the compound(s) of this invention per day in single or multiple doses.

Synthetic Methods The compounds and processes of the present invention will be better understood in connection with the following synthetic schemes which illustrate the methods by which the compounds of the invention may be prepared. The groups A, B, D, E, R 1 and R 2 are as defined above unless otherwise noted below. Scheme 1 illustrates a general procedure for preparing the starting material, imidazolylcarbonyloxy macrolide (3), for compounds of Formula (I). The 2- and 4-hydroxyl groups of compound (1) are protected by reacting (1) with suitable hydroxy group protecting reagents (cf. T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis , 2nd ed., John Wiley Son, Inc., 1991) such as acetic anhydride, benzoic anhydride, benzyl chlorofonnate or a trialkylsilyl chloride in an aprotic solvent, as defined above, which does not adversely affect the reaction, preferably dichloromethane, chloroform, DMF, tetrahydrofuran (TIF), N-methyl pyrrolidinone or a mixture thereof. The protected macrolide (2) is reacted under anhydrous conditions with base such as sodium hydride, lithium hydride, potassium carbonate and followed by carbonyldjimidazole to form compound (3) in an aprotic solvent, as defined above, which does not adversely affect the reaction, preferably dichloromethane, chloroform, DMF, tetrahydrofuran (AHF), N-methyl pyrrolidinone or a mixture thereof. The reaction may require cooling or heating, depending on the conditions used. The reaction temperature may be from 20 C. to 70 C., and preferably from 0 C. to room temperature. The reaction may require 0.5 hours to 10 days, and preferably 1-5 days, to complete. Scheme 2 illustrates a general procedure for preparing the starting materials, 12-imidazolylcarbonyloxy macrolide (6), for the preparations of compounds of Formula (II). The cladinose moiety of macrolides of formula (1) is removed either by mild aqueous acid hydrolysis or by enzymatic hydrolysis. In accordance with Scheme 2, a suspension of (1) in a solution of protogenic organic solvent (for example methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or butanol) and water is treated with dilute hydrochloric acid, chloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid for 0.5 to 24 hours. The reaction temperature is preferably -10 to 35 C. to give the des-cladinose compounds (4a). The 2-hydroxy group of (4a) is protected and converted to (4a) by treatment with a suitable hydroxy protecting reagent (cf. T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis , 2nd ed., John Wiley Son, Inc., 1991) such as acetic anhydride, benzoyl anhydride, benzyl chloroformate or trialkylsilyl chloride in an aprotic solvent, as defined above, preferably dichloromethane, chloroform, DMF, tetrahydrofuran (THF), N-nmethyl pyrrolidinone or a mixture thereof. The protected macrolide (4) is reacted under anhydrous conditions with base such as sodium hydride, lithium hydride, potassium carbonate or dimethylaminopyridine and followed by phosgene, diphosgene, triphosgene or benzyl chloroformate in an aprotic solvent, as defined above. The reactive intermediate is then trapped with benzyl alcohol to give compound (5). Compound (5) is reacted under anhydrous conditions with NaH and CDI in an aprotic solvent, preferably THF, DMF or a mixture thereof. The reaction may require cooling of heating, depending upon the conditions used. The reaction temperature may be from 20 C. to 70 C., and preferably from 0 C. to room temperature. The reaction may require 0.5 hours to 10 days, and preferably 1-5 days, to complete. Scheme 3 illustrates two general procedures for the synthesis of 12-imidazolylcarbonyloxy macrolide (8), starting materials for the preparation of compounds of Formula (III). In accordance with scheme 3, the 3-hydroxy group of a 2-protected des-cladinose macrolide (4) is oxidized to the corresponding 3-oxo compound (7) using a modified Swern oxidation procedure. In scheme 3, suitable oxidizing agents are N-chlorosuccimmide-dimethyl sulfide or carbodilmide-dimethylsulfoxide. In a typical example, (4) is added into a preformed N-chlorosuccinimide and dimethyl sulfide complex in a chlorinated solvent such as methylene chloride at 10 to 25 C. After being stirred for 0.5-4 hours, a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or Hunigs base is added to produce the oxidized compound (7). In the first approach in scheme 3, (7) is reacted with sodium hydride or lithium hydride and CDI under anhydrous conditions in an aprotic solvent, as defmed above, which does not adversely affect the reaction, preferably dichloromethane, chloroform, DMF, tetrahydrofuran (THF), N-methyl pyrrolidinone or a mixture thereof. The resulting alkoxide is then reacted with excess carbonyldiimidazole for 0.5 hours to 10 days in the same reaction mixture to produce (8). The preferred temperature is from 10 C. to room temperature. In the second approach in Scheme 3, (7) is converted to (7a) with sodium hydride or lithium hydride and phosgene, diphosgene or triphosgene under anhydrous conditions followed by aqueous work up. Alternatively, (7) is converted to its corresponding 11-mesylate by reacting (7) with methanesulfonic anhydride in pyridine. The 1 I-mesylate is then converted to (7a) with an amino base such as DBU or dimethylarninopyridine in acetone or acetonitrile. (7a) is then reacted with sodium hydride or lithium hydride under anhydrous conditions in an aprotic solvent, as defined above, which does not adversely affect the reaction, preferably dichloromethane, chloroform, DMF, tetrahydrofuran (THF), N-methyl pyrrolidinone or a mixture thereof. The reactive alkoxide is then reacted with carbonyldiimidazole for 0.5 hours to 10 days in the same reaction mixture to produce (8). The preferred temperature is from 10 C. to room temperature. In accordance with Scheme 4, a protected descladinose compound of formula (5) is dissolved in an aprotic solvent such as THF, then reacted with an excess of NaH at from 0 C. to 30 C. under an inert atmosphere, followed by reaction of the intermediate anion with CS 2 , then CH 3 I at 5 to 10 C., to form a 3-O-xanthyl compound. This xanthate intermediate is then reacted with 1.1-1.3 equivalents of Bu3SnH under an inert atmosphere in the presence of a catalytic amount of AIBN in a solvent suitable for a free radical reaction, such as benzene or toluene, for example, at reflux conditions to afford the desired compound (9). Compounds (9) are then reacted with carbonyldiimidazole and NaH under anhydrous conditions in an aprotic solvent, as defined above, which does not adversely affect the reaction, preferably dichlorornethane, chloroform, DMF, tetrahydrofuran (THF), N-methyl pyrrolidinone or a mixture thereof, at a temperature from 0 C. to room temperature for 0.5 hours to 10 days to provide the compounds of formula (10). In accordance with Scheme 5, a starting material compound of formula (3) is reacted with a diamiine compound having substituents A, B, D and E as defined above but with C2 or Cs symmetry or ABH, in a suitable solvent, such as for example, aqueous acetonitrile, DMF or aqueous DMF, to give the bicyclic compound of formula (11). The 2 and 4 hydroxy prote c ting group of compound (1) are then removed by standard methods (cf T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis , 2nd ed., John Wiley Son, Inc., 1991) to give (12). When OR 2 is an ester, for example, such as acetate or benzoate, the compound may be deprotected by treatment with methanol or ethanol. When R 2 is a trialkylsilyl group, the compound may be deprotected by treatment with fluoride in THF or acetonitrile, for example. Compound (12) is then cyclized by treatment with dilute acid, such as acetic acid or HCl, for example, in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol, ethanol or propanol, for example, for a period of from 4 hours to 10 days, from room temperature to reflux, in order to prepare the compound of formula (13). Scheme 6 illustrates an alternative preparation of compounds of Formula (I). Starting material (3) is reacted with a beta-aminoalcohol (YOH) having substituents A, B, D and E, as defined above, in a suitable solvent system such as aqueous acetonitrile, DMF or aqueous DMF at 0-70 C. to give compound (14) where YOH. The azido intermediate, compound (14) YN 3 , is prepared by Mitsunobu reaction by reacting compound (14) YOH with triphenylphosphine and diphenylphosphoryl azide-DEAD in tetrahydrofuran. Compound (14) is then deprotected by standard methods (cf. T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis . 2nd ed., John Wiley Son, Inc., 1991). When OR 2 is an ester, for example, such as acetate or benzoate, the compound may be deprotected by treatment with methanol or ethanol. When R 2 is a trialkylsilyl group, the compound may be deprotected by treatment with fluoride in THF or acetonitrile, for example. The azido intermediate, compound (14) YN 3 , is then reduced to the amino compound (12). Suitable reducing reagents are triphenylphosphine-water, hydrogen with a catalyst, sodium borohydride, or dialkylaluminum hydride. Compound (12) is then cyclized by treatment with dilute acid, such as acetic acid or HCl, for example, in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol, ethanol or propanol, for example, for a period of from 4 hours to 10 days, in order to prepare the compound of formula (13).

EXAMPLE 149 In Vitro Assay of Antibacterial Activity Representative compounds of the present invention were assayed in vitro for antibacterial activity as follows: Twelve petri dishes containing successive aqueous dilutions of the test compound mixed with 10 mL of sterilized Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar (Difco 0418-01-5) were prepared. Each plate was inoculated with 1:100 (or 1:10 for slow-growing strains, such as Micrococcus and Streptococcus) dilutions of up to 32 different microorganisms, using a Steers replicator block. The inoculated plates were incubated at 35-37 C. for 20 to 24 hours. In addition, a control plate, using BHI agar containing no test compound, was prepared and incubated at the beginning and end of each test. An additional plate containing a compound having known susceptibility patterns for the organisms being tested and belonging to the same antibiotic class as the test compound was also prepared and incubated as a further control, as well as to provide test-to-test comparability. Erythromycin A was used for this purpose. After incubation, each plate was visually inspected. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defmed as the lowest concentration of drug yielding no growth, a slight haze, or sparsely isolated colonies on the inoculum spot as compared to the growth control. The results of this assay, shown below in Table 1 demonstrate the antibacterial activity of the compounds of the invention. In a separate assay representative compounds of the invention were assayed in vitro for antibacterial activity against the H. Influenza Dill AMP R strain, according to the protocol described above. The results of this assay, shown below in Table 2 demonstrate the antibacterial activity of the compounds of the invention against the H. Influenza Dill AMP R organism.

RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/975,229 filed Nov. 21, 1997 which is incorporated herein by reference now U.S. Pat. No. 6,114,309. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention is for a combinatorial chemical library of compounds structurally related to the moenomycin class of antibiotics, and methods of preparing the compounds. Members of the library comprise disaccharides and trisaccharides covalently bonded to a lipid or lipid mimetic through a phosphorus linkage. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The moenomycin antibiotics are naturally-occurring phosphoglycolipids, which have been isolated from several strains of Streptomyces. These antibiotics have a wide range of antimicrobial activity, which is believed due to their ability to inhibit the transglycosylase activities of the bi-functional penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). These proteins catalyze the transfer of a disaccharide unit to a growing peptidoglycan chain during the biosynthesis of bacterial cell walls. To date, the moenomycins are the only known inhibitors of this enzyme activity. The structure of the disaccharide substrate is shown hereinbelow: The moenomycins are active against several bacterial strains, including those resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. They are currently marketed under the tradename Flavomycin as an additive in cattle feed, where the efficacy in promoting animal growth is believed due to their antimicrobial activity. The moenomycins are particularly potent against gram-positive bacteria and less potent against gram-negative microbes. The potential for moenomycin antibiotics as human therapeutics has not been studied in detail, but is expected to be limited by poor bioavailability and unfavorable pharmacodynamics. The unique mode of action and wide range of activity of this class of antibiotics makes them attractive for the study of related compounds having more favorable pharmacological properties. At present, moenomycins A, C 1 , C 2 , C 3 , A 12 , and pholipomycin compose the class of moenomycin antibiotics. Of this class, the most studied member is moenomycin Aa pentasaccharide linked to a C 25 lipid group through a phosphate moiety. The structure of moenomycin A is shown hereinbelow. The structural similarity of this compound to the transglycosylase substrate mentioned above is readily apparent and suggests that moenomycin A acts as a competitive inhibitor of transglycosylase activity. In the above structure, it is known that a disaccharide-phospholipid degradation product of moenomycin A is equipotent (100% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 1 g/mL) to the parent natural product EP Publn. No. 130327. In particular, it has been shown that the A, B, C and D units of moenomycin A are unimportant to the inhibition of transglycosylase activity, but that the E, F, G, H, and I groups are essential Welzel, P., et al., (1984), (1987); Moller, U., et al., (1993); Marzian, S., et al., (1994). The lipid moiety I can be fully hydrogenated without substantially affecting its activity. However, a free carboxylic acid function for the glyceric acid unit H appears to be necessary for inhibition. Furtherrnore, the structural requirements within the F-G-H region appear to be rather strict Fehlhaber, H-W., et al., (1990); Moller, U., et al., (1993); Luning, J., et al., (1994); Heuer, M., et al., (1994). The structure of a fully active disaccharide degradation product of moenomycin A is shown hereinbelow: The other moenomycin compounds mentioned above differ structurally from moenomycin A principally by the number of sugar residues in the molecule and by the configuration of groups at the C4 position of the F sugar unit. In particular, only moenomycins A and A 12 have a D sugar residue attached to the E unit. Moenomycins C 3 , C 4 and pholipomycin are tetrasaccharide-phospholipids, which differ from each other by the presence or absence of hydroxyl groups at the C6 positions of the C and E sugar units Hessler-Klintz, M., et al., (1993); Scherkenbeck, J., et al., (1993). Moenomycin C 1 also is a tetrasaccharide and, as with moenomycin A 12 , lacks the branching methyl group and has a change of configuration at the C4 position of the F sugar unit, i.e., the F unit is a galactopyranosiduronamide. In contrast to the other moenomycins, degradation studies of moenomycins C 1 and A 12 reveal that the smallest antibiotically active products for these F unit galactopyranosiduronamide compounds are trisaccharide derivatives, which include the C, E and F sugar units. It has been suggested that the additional saccharide unit (C) is required for these compounds in order to achieve the necessary hydrogen bonding environment within the active site, which is otherwise attained with a disaccharide unit in the 4-C-methyl glucopyranosiduronamide compounds Hessler-Klintz, M., et al., (1993); Donnerstag, A., et al., (1995). In a recent series of papers, Welzel and coworkers describe the synthesis and antibiotic properties of some C-E-F trisaccharide derivatives of moenomycin A 12 Ritzeler, O., et al., (1997a); Ritzeler, O., et al., (1997b); Range, G., et al., (1997). The biosynthesis of moenomycin in an aerobic fermentation process is the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 3,992,263, issued to Dietrich et al. Enzymatic methods for degrading moenomycin to defined end products, i.e., pentasaccharide and phospholipid products, are disclosed by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,206,405, 5,260,206, and 5,506,140, all issued to Aretz et al., which propose that these end products can be used as building blocks in the synthesis of new transglycosylase inhibitors. An enzymatic method of cleaving the phosphate group from the aforementioned phospholipid is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,315,038 and 5,316,929, issued to Aretz et al. A study of the activities of several moenomycin analogs against the Helicobacter pylori bacillus is the subject of EP 655249, issued to Hoechst A G. It is desired to synthesize and study a library of compounds having several of the basic structural features of the moenomycin degradation products discussed above, which retain anti-microbial activity. Of particular interest are compounds having better pharmacological properties yet retaining the broad spectrum of moenomycin activities. Of particular interest are activities against resistant strains of microorganisms. Generally speaking, it is desired to broaden the spectrum of activities and/or enhance the potencies of moenomycin antibiotics, particularly against clinically relevant microbes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is for a combinatorial chemical library of moenomycin analogs, the members of which are represented by the following formula: In the formula, D represents one or more donor saccharide residue(s), as defined hereinafter, and is preferably a mono- or disaccharide. The A group in the formula represents an acceptor saccharide residue, as defined hereinafter, and is a monosaccharide. The P-R group of the formula represents a lipophosphoglycerate mimetic group, as defined hereinafter, and differs from the phospholipid group of moenomycin A and partially or fully saturated forms thereof. Compounds represented by the above formula have a chemical structure analogous to the antibiotically active disaccharide moenomycin fragment discussed hereinabove. Accordingly, compounds represented by this formula are said to belong to a directed chemical library of moenomycin analogs. In a preferred aspect of the invention, the C1 (anomeric) position of donor saccharide residue D is covalently bonded to the C2 position of acceptor saccharide residue A, e.g., through a glycosidic linkage. Also, it is preferred that the C1 (anomeric) position of A is covalently bonded to the lipophosphoglycerate mimetic group P-R through an O atom, which links A to a phosphorus atom of the P-R group. Typically, the P-R group contains a phosphoester, phosphoanhydride, or phosphonate linkage, which joins an oxidized form of phosphorus to a negatively charged functional group, e.g., a carboxyl or sulfate group. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the dianion afforded by the P-R group is attracted to positive charges, e.g., a divalent metal ion, within the active site of the transglycosylase enzyme, thereby inhibiting its activity. An aromatic or aliphatic moiety, sometimes referred to herein as a lipid moiety, can be covalently linked to the aforementioned oxidized form of phosphorus and the negatively charged functional group to provide the lipophosphoglycerate mimetic group. A synthetic or natural lipid moiety can form an integral part of the lipophosphoglycerate mimetic group by constituting part of the backbone joining the oxidized phosphorus to the negatively charged functional group. More typically, however, the lipid moiety is linked to the aforesaid groups through an ether, amide or carboncarbon single bond. Members of a library of the present invention display the greatest diversity of structural features in respect to: (i) substitutions occurring at the C3 position of residue A, (ii) substitutions occurring at the C2 position of the D saccharide, and (iii) the selection of the P-R group. Preferred substituents at the C3 position of A and the C2 position of D are amides, carbamates, ureas, sulfonamides, substituted amines, esters, carbonates, and sulfates, as described herein. Preferred P-R groups are derived from homoserine, glyceric acid, salicylates, mandelic acid compounds, and phthalide phosphoric acids due to their ready availability. Also contemplated is a method of preparing a library of compounds having the formula presented above. The synthesis can be performed in solution or on a support, and is preferably carried out on a solid phase support. A solid phase synthesis of the invention comprises the steps of: (a) covalently linking an acceptor monosaccharide (A) to the support by forming a carboxylate or carboxamido linkage between the C6 carbon of A and the support, with A substituted at its anomeric carbon with a thiophenyl group; (b) covalently linking the anomeric carbon of a donor saccharide (D) through an O-glycosidic linkage to the C2 carbon of the A residue to form a D-A moiety linked to the support; (c) coupling a lipophosphoglycerate mimetic group (P-R) to the anomeric position of the A residue of the D-A moiety to form a D-A-P-R moiety linked to the support; and (d) cleaving the target D-A-P-R compound from the support. The D-A coupling step (b) is preferably performed using a C1-thiophenyl donor saccharide that has been converted to its C1-sulfoxide form by a conventional method prior to reacting it with A. A preferred method of converting Cl-thiophenyl sugars to their C1-sulfoxides is described in U.S. Ser. No. 08/281,167, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Before or after performing step (b), the C3 position of A and/or the C2 position of D can be functionalized. Preferred substituents at these sites are amide, carbamate, urea, sulfonamide, substituted amine, ester, carbonate, and sulfate groups, as described more fully hereinafter. The hydroxyl groups of the A and/or D residues can be orthogonally protected to permit independent functionalization of their hydroxyl groups and it is generally preferred that protecting groups be cleaved from the assembled molecule prior to cleaving it from the support in step (d). Preferably, coupling step (c) is performed by attaching a preformed P-R group to A. However, the P-R group can alternatively be assembled stepwise on A by first attaching a phosphorus-containing group, followed by an organic moiety that is negatively charged or that can be converted to have a negative charge, such that a lipophosphoglycerate mimetic (P-R) is linked to A. A method of screening members of the present library for anti-microbial activity is also contemplated. Such method comprises contacting a member of the library with a culture of microbes, and monitoring the growth rate of the microbes. An observation that the growth rate has ceased or diminished is an indication that the compound has anti-microbial activity. Screening may also be performed by directly assaying for peptidoglycan synthesis in the microbes. A fuller understanding of the present invention can be obtained from a consideration of the figures and detailed description provided hereinbelow.

The acceptor saccharide is a natural or nonnatural hexose oxidized at its C6 position to either a carboxylate or carboxyamido group. In the final moenomycin analog compound, the acceptor residue is covalently linked at its C1 (anomeric) position with a lipophosphoglycerate mimetic group, and is covalently linked at its C2 position with a donor saccharide. The acceptor saccharide can be chemically modified (derivatized) at any of its normal hydroxyl sites (C1-C4 for pyranoses and C1-C3 and C5 for furanoses), with the preferred site for derivatization being the C3 position. Whenever the acceptor is a nonnatural hexose, it is typically an epimer of a naturally occurring monosaccharide. Additionally, C3 amino sugars are preferred acceptor saccharides. Donor saccharideA donor saccharide (D), as used herein, donates a mono- or di-saccharide group to an acceptor saccharide to form a di- or trisaccharide moenomycin analog of the present invention. The donor saccharide is formed from one or two natural or nonnatural hexoses. Whenever two hexoses are employed as the donor saccharide, they are covalently bonded together, e.g., through a (14) or (16) glycosyl linkage. The donor can be chemically modified (derivatized) at any of its normal hydroxyl sites (C1-C4 and C6 for pyranoses and C1-C3 and C5-C6 for furanoses). Typically, whenever a donor is derivatized, it is derivatized at the C2 position of the saccharide residue proximate the acceptor residue in the final molecule. Whenever the donor is a nonnatural hexose, it is typically an epimer of a naturally occurring monosaccharide. EpimersSugar molecules differing in configuration at a single asymmetric center of the saccharide ring. Lipophosphoglycerate mimeticA chemical moiety having formula P-R that is covalently bonded to the C1 (anomeric) position of A through an O atom. The P-R group contains at least two electronegative functionalities separated by a predefined distance. These electronegative functionalities include independent selections from among phosphate, phosphoanhydride, phosphonate, sulfonate, carboxylate, hydroxyl, hydroxylamine, and acylsulfonamido groups. The electronegative functionalities can be an integral component of the backbone of the P-R structure or they can be attached as appendages to the backbone. Exemplary of these structures are integral (divalent) functionalities, such as phosphate and phenolate groups, and appendage (monovalent) functionalities, such as aliphatic hydroxyl and carboxylate. Two of the electronegative functionalities are spaced apart in the P-R group at a distance comparable to that of the phosphate and carboxylate groups (units G and H) of moenomycin A. This simulation of the electronic structure present in moenomycin A gives rise to the description herein of the P-R group as being a mimetic of the corresponding phosphoglycerate moiety of moenomycin A. Under biological conditions of interest, the aforementioned electronegative substituents typically release a proton, thereby leaving behind a negatively charged center. Preferably, a P-R group of the invention contains a phosphate group linked to another electronegative functionality. The phosphate group is bonded to an A residue through an O atom, and is linked to the second electronegative functionality, e.g., through a phosphoester, phosphoanhydride, or phosphonate linkage. The second electronegative functionality is preferably a carboxylic acid group. An aromatic or aliphatic moiety (also referred to herein as a lipid) can be covalently linked to the aforementioned negatively charged functional group of the P-R group, e.g., through an ether, amide or single CC bond, to provide the lipophosphoglycerate mimetic P-R. The aromatic or aliphatic moiety can form all or part of the backbone joining the negatively charged group to the oxidized phosphorus atom. Preferred P-R groups are discussed more fully hereinafter.

More preferably, the D residue has a formula selected from among the following structures: wherein R 2 is XY, where X is O or NH, and Y is H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, C(O)R, C(O)NHR, C(O)OR, or SO 2 R, where R is H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, or heterocycle, or XY combine to form N 3 , or phthalimido; R 3 is XY, where X is O or NH, and Y is H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, C(O)R, C(O)NHR, C(O)OR, or SO 2 R, where R is H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, or heterocycle, or XY combine to form N 3 , phthalimido, or a monosaccharide residue; R 4 is XY, where X is O or NH, and Y is H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, C(O)R, C(O)NHR, C(O)OR, or SO 2 R, where R is H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, or heterocycle, or XY combine to form N 3 , phthalimido, or a monosaccharide residue, or R 3 and R 4 combine to form carbonate; and R 6 is H or XY, where X is O or NH, and Y is H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, C(O)R, C(O)NHR, C(O)OR, or SO 2 R, where R is H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, or heterocycle, or XY combine to form N 3 , phthalimido, or a monosaccharide residue.

At least two of the electronegative functionalities are separated by a distance approximating that between the phosphate and carboxylate groups in moenomycin A, which is about 5.27 angstroms. Thus, a preferred lipophosphoglycerate mimetic (P-R) has a through-space charge separation in the range of 2.5 to 10 angstroms, more preferably 5-6 angstroms. An alternative formulation of this distance is expressed in terms of the number of contiguous chemical bonds separating the functionalities. Under this formulation, from 1 to 8 bonds separate the electronegative functionalities in the P-R group. By this convention, 3 chemical bonds separate the phosphate and carboxylate functionalities in moenomycin A. Particularly preferred members of an instant library have a structural formula for A-P-R represented by one of the following formulas, or a position isomer thereof. In the above formulas for a P-R group of the invention, the following designations have the indicated meanings: W represents O, CH 2 , OCH 2 , or CH 2 CH 2 and is a spacer between the negative charges presented by the oxidized phosphorus atom and the negatively charged functional group of the P-R moiety; X represents a single bond, CH 2 , O, NH, or S, and is an optional spacer between the backbone of the lipophosphoglycerate moiety and an R group, as defined hereinbelow; Y is O, NH, S, or CH and is an atom (with the exception of CH) in an aromatic ring, which affords a lipid moiety of the P-R group; Z is H, halogen, or NO 2 , and represents a non-alkyl or non-aryl substituent on an aromatic ring, which affords a lipid moiety of the P-R group; R is H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, acyl, aryl, benzoyl, aralkyl, or other such group substituted with one or more heteroatom. Preferred aliphatic R groups include (CH 2 ) 2 CH(CH 3 ) 2 , (CH 2 ) 11 CH 3 , and (CH 2 ) 21 CH 3 ; m is an integer of 0, 1, or 2 that indicates the number of methylene groups in the alkyl spacer group, which separates the oxidized phosphorus atom and the negatively charged functional group of the P-R unit; and n is an integer of 0, 1, or 2 that indicates the number of methylene groups separating the negatively charged functional group, e.g., COOH, from an aromatic ring in a P-R unit. Exemplary of the above formulas are mandelic acid derivatives (in which m0, X is absent, and R is aryl), phthalide phosphoric acids (in which WCH 2 , n0, ZH) and salicylic acid derivatives (in which WO, m0, and n0), to name a few. These compounds are available from commercial sources or accessible by well-known methods. Also contemplated within the invention is a phenyl 1-thio saccharide that can be used as an acceptor molecule for constructing moenomycin analogs of the present invention. Preferred acceptor molecules are among the following compounds: wherein R 3 is XY, where X is O or NH, and Y is alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, C(O)R, C(O)NHR, C(O)OR, or SO 2 R, where R is alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, or heterocycle, or XY combine to form N 3 ; R 4 is OX, where X is H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, acyl, benzoyl, aryl or aralkyl; and R 6 is OH, NH 2 , or NHMe. Also contemplated are donor molecules that can be used in assembling the moenomycin analogs of the present invention. The donor molecules are typically prepared first as protected phenyl 1-thio saccharides, and are then converted by previously known methods, such as described in U.S. Ser. Nos. 08/281,167 and 60/013,800, and by the instant methods into their phenylsulfenyl counterparts, as described hereinbelow. Thus, preferred donor molecules have a formula selected from among the following: wherein Z is O or is absent; R 2 is XY, where X is O or NH, and Y is alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, C(O)R, C(O)NHR, C(O)OR, or SO 2 R, where R is alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, or heterocycle, or XY combine to form N 3 or phthalimido; R 3 is XY, where X is O or NH, and Y is alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, C(O)R, C(O)NHR, C(O)OR, or SO 2 R, where R is alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, or heterocycle, or XY combine to form N 3 , phthalimido, or a protected monosaccharide residue; R 4 is XY, where X is O or NH, and Y is alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, C(O)R, C(O)NHR, C(O)OR, or SO 2 R, where R is alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, or heterocycle, or XY combine to form N 3 , phthalimido, or a protected monosaccharide residue, or R 3 and R 4 combine to form carbonato; and R 6 is H or XY, where X is O or NH, and Y is alky, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, C(O)R, C(O)NHR, C(O)OR, or SO 2 R, where R is alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, or heterocycle, or XY combine to form N 3 , phthalimido, or a protected monosaccharide residue. As used herein, a protected monosacccharide is a monosaccharide that has had its hydroxyl and/or amino groups temporarily made non-reactive by masking groups. Another aspect of the invention pertains to a method of synthesizing a combinatorial library of moenomycin analogs according to the principles of the present invention. Such a method involves synthesizing at least one compound having the formula: wherein D, A, and P-R have the meanings described hereinabove. Accordingly, a preferred method of the present invention comprises the steps of: (a) covalently linking an acceptor monosaccharide (A) to a support by forming a carboxylate or carboxyamide linkage between the C6 carbon of A and the support, wherein A is substituted at its anomeric carbon with a thiophenyl group; (b) covalently linking the anomeric carbon of a donor saecharide (D) via an O-glycosidic linkage to the C2 carbon of A to form a D-A moiety linked to the support; (c) coupling a lipophosphoglycerate mimetic group (P-R) to the anomeric position of the A residue of the D-A moiety to form a D-A-P-R moiety linked to the support; and (d) cleaving the D-A-P-R moiety from the support, which thereby affords the target compound. In order to provide a wide range of structural diversity among the various members of an instant moenomycin analog library, hydroxyl groups on the acceptor and/or donor saccharide residues can be converted (derivatized) into other functionalities. For example, a hydroxyl group can be converted to an ester, carbamate, carbonate or sulfate functionality by reacting it with the appropriate compound. Alternatively, an azido group on a saccharide residue can be reduced to an amine, which can then be converted into an amide, carbamate, urea, sulfonamide, or substituted amine functionality. Reactants and reaction conditions for performing these conversions are well-known to those skilled in the art. Preferred methods of performing these functionalizations on a solid phase support have been reported by R. Liang, et al., Science, 274:1520 (1996) and are the subject of U.S. Ser. No. 08/823,328, filed Mar. 21, 1997, as well as U.S. Provisional application Serial No. 60/047946, filed May 29, 1997, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The above-mentioned functionalizations are preferably performed at the C3 position of residue A and/or the C2 position of residue D before or after performing the above step (b), which joins residues A and D via an O-glycosidic linkage. The lipophosphoglycerate mimetic (P-R) group is linked to residue A after the A-D linkage has been made. The P-R group can be attached to A piecewise, that is, by attaching an oxidized phosphorus group first, followed by attaching a negatively charged functionality. However, it is generally preferable to form the P-R group separately prior to performing the above coupling step (c). Various protecting groups, e.g., acetyl, benzoyl, levulinoyl, Nfmoc (N-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl), N-trifluoroacetamido, phthalimido, and the like, are used to direct the desired bond formations, as illustrated herein. These protecting groups will usually have been removed in the final moenomycin analog compound in order to restore the underlying chemical functionality, e.g., a hydroxyl group or an amino group. Generally, the protecting groups will be removed from the assembled D-A-P-R moiety after final assembly of the target molecule. Whenever the assembly is performed on a support, the removal of protecting groups is usually performed prior to cleaving the molecule from the support in step (d). Although the above-described assembly steps can be performed without a support, i.e., in solution phase, use of a support is preferred since it permits the use of excess reactants to drive a reaction to completion and since physical separation of excess reactants and side products from the target compound can be performed through convenient wash steps. Solid phase supports are preferred, such as resins having a photo- or acid-cleavable linker, e.g., Rink amine resins, as well as silica, controlled porosity glass, polystyrene, and grafted polymers. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is another type of support that can be employed. A method of screening an instant library of compounds for anti-microbial activity is also contemplated. Such method comprises contacting a member of the library with a culture of target microbes and monitoring their rate of growth, such as after a predefined incubation period. Alternatively, a direct assay of anti-microbial activity entails determining peptidoglycan synthesis of the microbes is inhibited in the presence of the compound, as is discussed hereinafter. The invention will now be described with reference to certain Schemes (shown in the Figures) and Examples. These Schemes and Examples illustrate but do not limit the invention. The compounds described hereinbelow are assigned numerical designations corresponding to the number of the scheme in which they are depicted and the compound number within that scheme. PART I.

ASSEMBLY OF SACCHARIDES AND LIPOPHOSPHOGLYCERATE MIMETICS INTO MOENOMYClN ANALOGS Solid phase techniques for assembling the above-discussed acceptor, donor and lipid groups with phosphorus-containing groups are discussed hereinbelow and are illustrated in Scheme 21. In Scheme 21, the acceptor saccharide is represented by a phenyl 3,4-di-O-substituted-4-C-methyl-1-thio--D-glucopyranosiduronic acid, the donor molecule is represented by a phenylsulfenyl 3,4,6-tri-O-substituted-,-D-glucopyranoside, having a masked amine group represented by N*, and the lipophosphoglycerate mimetic moiety is represented generally by OP(O)(OH)OR, e.g., where R contains carboxyl and lipid groups. Step 1. Linking Glucopyranosiduronic Acid to Rink Resin A Rink amine resin is swelled in DMF-DCM (1:1 v/v) and washed twice with DMF. The solvent can be removed simply by pumping it out using a fritted glass tube (medium porosity). The Fmoc-protecting group of the resin is removed by treating the resin with 20% piperidineDMF solution. The resin is then washed 4 times with low amine DMF. The glucopyranosiduronic acid (2 equiv.), HATU (2 equiv.) and DIPEA (2-4 equiv.) are individually dissolved in low amine DMF. The reagents are added to the resin in the above order. The resin is stirred with the coupling cocktail until it is negative to ninhydrin color test. The coupling cocktail is removed by vacuum filtration. The glycopyranosiduronic acid can be recovered by extracting the cocktail with EtOAc and dilute hydrochloric acid. The resin is washed 4 times with DMF, 4 times with EtOAc, and 4 times with DCM. Step 2. Solid Phas e Glycosylation ReactionsCouplin of Donor to Acceptor Residues Acceptor-loaded resin is swelled in anhydrous EtOAc. The EtOAc is removed and the resin is equilibrated twice with 20% EtOAc-DCM. The EtOAc-DCM wash solvent is removed. The donor phenylsulfenyl saccharide (4 equiv.) and t Bu 2 Mepy (2 equiv., 4 equiv. can also be used except with 2-NPhth donors) are dissolved in 20% EtOAc-DCM. The donor/base solution is added to the resin. The reaction mixture is stirred under argon at room temperature for 5 minutes. The reaction mixture is cooled to 70 C. Tf 2 O (4 equiv.) is added in a dropwise manner and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm from 50 C. to 30 C. and is kept at that temperature for 3-16 hours. The reaction is then quenched with MeOH (10 equiv.) and DIPEA (10 equiv.) in DCM and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. Solvent is removed and the resin is washed (with 5 minutes of stirring) with DMF for 4 times, EtOAc for 4 times and DCM for 4 times. Step 3. Reduction of Azide Group The resin is swelled in THF-EtOH (1:1 v/v) with 10% v/v water. Trimethylphosphine-THF (4 equiv.) is added and the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 3-4 hours. The reduction of azide can be confirmed with Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS). The resin is washed 4 times with THF, 4 times with DCM, and 2 times with DMF. Step 4. Synthesis of Amides from Aminosaccharide and Carboxylic Acids The amine loaded resin is swelled in DMF, carboxylic acid (4 equiv.), HATU (4 equiv.) and DIPEA (4 equiv.) are added. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature until it is negative to ninhydrin color test. The resin is washed 4 times with DMF, 4 times with EtOAc, and 4 times with DCM. Step 4. Synthesis of Ureas from Aminosaccharide and Isocyanates The amine loaded resin is swelled in DMF. The DMF is removed by pumping it out using a fritted glass tube (medium pore). The resin is treated with a solution containing the isocyanate (5 eq per amine group) and triethylamine (5 eq per amine group) in DMF. The reaction mixture is stirred at RT for 4 hr or until the resin gives a negative Kaiser test. The supernatant is removed by pumping it out using a fritted glass tube (medium pore). The resin is washed twice with DMF, 4 times with EtOAc, and 4 times with CH 2 Cl 2 . (Diisopropylethylamine has also been used as a base, but is not preferred since it is immiscible with DMF.) Step 5. Removal of Acyl (levulinoyl) Protecting Group and Reaction with Isocyanate The resin is swelled in DMF. The DMF is removed with a suction tube, and hydrazine acetate (4 equiv.) is dissolved in DMF with heating. The solution is added to the resin after it is cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight. The resin is washed 4 times with DMF, 4 times with EtOAc, and 4 times with DCM. The resin appears very sticky on glass surface. The resin is swelled in DCM, and isocyanate (4 equiv.) and triethylamine (4 equiv.) are added. The resin will not stick to glass surface after a short time. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 4-6 hours. The resin is washed 4 times with DCM. Step 6. Cleavage of 1-SPh Group Using Mercury Trifluoroacetate The resin is swelled in CH 2 Cl 2 . CH 2 Cl 2 is removed by pumping it out using a fritted glass tube (medium porosity). To 20 mg of resin (0.01 mmol) is added a solution of mercury trifluoroacetate (4 eq) in water-saturated DCM (1 mL), which is prepared by mixing DCM and water in a separatory funnel and shaking for a few minutes. The DCM layer is collected and use as prepared. The reaction mixture is stirred at 40 C. for 1 hour (using a condenser for reflux). The supernatant is removed by pumping it out using a fritted glass tube. The resin is washed 6 times with DMF and 2 times with either THF or DCM. The resin is now ready for the phosphorylation or P-R amidite coupling step. Step 7. Solid-phase Phosphorylation (first step) The resin is swelled in CH 2 Cl 2 . The CH 2 Cl 2 is removed by pumping it out using a fritted glass tube (medium pore).

The reaction mixture is then diluted with CH 2 Cl 2 and the organic layer is washed successively with ice cold 10% NaHCO 3 , H 2 O and saturated NaCl. The organic layer is dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. It is then dried under vacuum using a vacuum pump for a few hours prior to using it as a crude mixture (a yellowish oil is obtained). Step 7b. Synthesis of C12 Lipid Amidite To a C12 lipid, e.g., compound 20.4b (144 mg; 0.5 mmol), in dry DCM (5 mL) under argon at room temperature are added successively DIPEA (0.17 mL; 0.975 mmol; 1.95 eq) and 2-cyanoethyl diisopropylamino phosphorus chloride (0.12 mL; 0.55 mmol; 1.1 eq).

Cleavage of Cyanoethyl, Methyl Ester and Acetyl Groups The resin is swelled in THF. The THF is removed by pumping it out using a fritted glass tube (medium pore). To 20 mg of resin (0.01 mmol) in THF-MeOH (1:1) (2 mL) is added a 0.4M aq LiOH solution (10 eq, 0.25 mL) 2 eq/group to be cleaved. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2-3 hours. After overnight stirring, the supernatant is removed by pumping it out using a fritted glass tube. The resin is washed 3 times with MeOH, 3 times with THF-MeOH (1:1), and 4 times with THF. The resin in now ready for the non-aqueous LiOH deprotection step. Step 9a. Cleavage of Benzoyl Group (final deprotection) The resin is swelled in THF.

The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The resin is filtered off and the supernatant is transferred to a pre-weighed round bottom flask. The resin is washed twice with CH 2 Cl 2 , the filtrate and washes are pooled and concentrated under vacuum, and the residue is taken up in dioxane, isopropanol or 20% DMSO/water and stirred for 30 min with pre-washed H resin. The resin is filtered off and washed a few times with the solvent used for exchange. The filtrate is then concentrated under vacuum on a rotary evaporator. The sample is analyzed by LC-MS after dissolution in methanol. Automated Procedure for Synthesis of Moenomycin Library Analogs This procedure can be carried out simultaneously on two, 48-position Combitec reaction blocks on a TECAN (Switzerland) liquid handling platform. The reaction blocks are assembled as described by TECAN and fitted with 5 mL reaction vessels. One Rink amide-bound disaccharide (pictured below) is illustrated for this particular procedure. Phenyl 2-O-(2-azido-2-deoxy-3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl--D-glucopyranosyl)-(12)-3-amino-3-deoxy-4-methoxy-1-thio--D-glucopyranosiduronic Acid This disaccharide is functionalized with three carboxylic acids and one isocyanate on the acceptor amine, and four different carboxylic acids at the reduced donor azide. In addition, the anomeric position of the sugar is functionalized as either a C5-phospholipid or a phosphosalicylate. Overall, 96 different products and intermediates are isolated using this scheme. Stirring is conducted magnetically using 10 mm stir bars in each reaction flask and a 48-position stir plate. All washes are performed with 5 minutes of stirring between solvent addition and removal. Anhydrous grades of dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethanol (EtOH) and methanol (MeOH) are purchased from Aldrich for use in these syntheses. Low amine content N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) is purchased from PerSeptive Biosystems. Procedure 1.5 g of the resin-bound disaccharide is swelled in 100 mL of 4:1 DCM/THF for 30 minutes. 1.0 mL of this slurry (15 mg, 0.007 mmol, 1) is then robotically dispensed into each position of the 2 reaction blocks. 1 mL of the solvent mixture is then added to wash the resin down into the reaction vessels. Each position is then aspirated, washed with 22 mL THF and purged with argon for 60 seconds. a) 0.5 ml of a 0.057M solution of each carboxylic acid (0.028 mmole, 4, in DMF) is then added. This is followed by the addition of 0.75 ml of 0.037M HATU (0.028 mmole, 4, in DMF) and 0.75 ml of 0.037M diisopropylethylamine (0.028 mmole, 4, in DMF). b) 1 mL of a 1.0M solution of the isocyanate in freshly distilled THF is then added, followed by 1 mL of a 0.5M triethylamine solution in THF. After stirring the reaction mixtures for four hours, each vessel is aspirated and washed with 42 mL THF and 22 mL DMF. After the addition of 1.1 mL of 9:2 EtOH/Water to every vessel, 0.9 mL of 0.032M trimethylphosphine (0.028 mmole, 4, in THF) is added. The reaction mixtures are then stirred for 4 hours before aspiration of the solvent. Each vessel is then washed with 42 ml THF and 22 ml DMF. 0.5 ml of a 0.057M solution of each carboxylic acid (0.028 mmole, 4, in DMF) is then added. This is followed by the addition of 0.75 ml of 0.037M HATU (0.028 mmol, 4, in DMF) and 0.75 ml of 0.037M diisopropylethylamine (0.028 mmol, 4, in DMF). The reaction mixtures were stirred overnight at room temperature before aspiration. Each was then washed with 42 mL DMF and 22 mL DCM. After the addition of 2 mL of 0.014M mercury(II) trifluoroacetate (0.028M, 4) in water saturated DCM to the appropriate wells, the mixtures were stirred at 40 C. for 1 hour. After aspiration, the vessels are washed with 42 mL DMF and 22 mL DCM. Each vessel is then purged with argon for 60 seconds. Procedure for C5 Lipid Attachment 2 mL of a 0.053M isopentyl amidite derived from compound 20.4a (0.105 mmole, 15)/0.25M tetrazole solution in 1:1 THF/acetonitrile is then added to the appropriate vessels. The reaction mixtures are then stirred overnight at 60 C. Each flask is then aspirated and washed with 42 mL THF. 2 mL of iodine solution (12/Pyridine/THF/H 2 O) is then added to the phosphorylated resins and each is stirred for 10 minutes. Each vessel is then aspirated and washed with 42 mL THF. 2.0 mL of 0.035M lithium hydroxide (LiOH) in 4:4:1 THF/MeOH/Water (0.07 mmol, 10) is then added to all of the phosphorylated resins and each is stirred for 2.5 hours at room temperature. After washing with 32 mL 1:1 THF/MeOH and 22 mL THF, 2.0 ml of 0.035M LiOH in 1:1 MeOH/THF (0.07 mmol, 10) is added to all of the vessels and the mixtures are stirred overnight. The mixtures are then aspirated and washed with 32 mL 1:1 THF/MeOH, 42 mL THF and 32 mL anhydrous DCM. Each disaccharide is then cleaved from the resin with 30 minutes of stirring in 2.5 mL of 20% trifluoroacetic acid in DCM. The product solutions are then transferred to polyethylene microtiter plates before solvent evaporation in a Speedvac. After drying, the products are dissolved in 20% aqueous DMSO and passed through a column of Amberlite proton exchange resin. The resulting solutions are analyzed by LC-MS on a Perkin Elmer API100. Procedure for Cyclic Salicylate Attachment 1 mL of 0.175M diisopropylethylamine (0.105 mmol, 15, in DCM) and 1 mL of 0.175M 2-chloro-H-2,1,3-benzodioxaphosphorin-4-one (0.105 mmol, 15, in DCM), available from Aldrich Chemical Co., is then added to the appropriate vessels. The reaction mixtures are then stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. Each flask is then aspirated and washed with 42 ml DCM and 22 ml THF. Each sample is oxidized with 2 mL iodine solution (I 2 /Pyr/THF/H 2 O) for ten minutes. After being washed with 42 mL THF, every vessel is treated with 2.0 mL of 0.035M LiOH in 1:1 MeOH/THF (0.07 mmol, 10). The reactions are stirred overnight. The mixtures are then washed with 32 mL 1:1 THF/MeOH, 42 mL THF and 32 mL anhydrous DCM. Each disaccharide is then cleaved from the resin with 30 minutes of stirring in 2.5 mL of 20% trifluoroacetic acid in DCM. The product solutions are then transferred to polyethylene microtiter plates before solvent evaporation in a Speedvac. After drying, the products are dissolved in 20% aqueous DMSO and passed through a column of Amberlite proton exchange resin. The resulting solutions are analyzed by LC-MS on a Perkin Elmer API100. Mass Specrtra Representative mass spectra (Fab) for moenomycin analogs of the invention, which were constructed as described hereinabove, are shown in FIG. 20 . PART V. SCREENING OF MOENOMYClN ANALOGS FOR ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY The following procedures for conducting an assay of bacterial inhibition by a moenomycin analog of the present invention can be performed. Bacteria. All organisms are grown in a universal rich media to minimize media effects on the inhibition assay. All bacteria are demonstrated to grow in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) media (Difco, Detroit, Mich.) supplemented with 0.1% Casamino Acids (CAA) (Difco). The following organisms are used in primary screening: Enterococcus faecium (ATCC 49624) Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228) Streptococcus pneumonia (ATCC 49150) Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) Acinetobacter anitratus (ATCC 43498) The bacteria are streaked for isolation from frozen glycerol stocks onto BHI/CAA plates containing 1.5% Bacto-agar (Difco). An isolated colony from each strain is used to inoculate 5 mL of BHI/CAA media and allowed to grow overnight at 37 C. with shaking. The exception is with Streptococcus strains, which are grown in a candle jar at 37 C. without shaking. After overnight growth, the organisms are diluted 1:100 and allowed to incubate until they reach early to mid-logarithmic growth (OD 600 0.5). The cells are diluted 100 fold in BHI/CAA containing 0.7% agar maintained at 50 C. to a cell density of approximately 510 colony forming units (CFU) permL. The agar slurry is poured into an 86 mm128 mm assay plate (Nunc), which has the dimensions of a 96-well plate, and allowed to solidify for at least 30 minutes. Streptococcus strains are diluted in BHI/CAA media without agar and 200 l aliquoted to each well of a 96-well assay plate. Test Compounds. The test compounds are solubilized in sterile 20% DMSO/water to a concentration of approximately 1-5 mg/ml, aseptically aliquoted among several sterile daughter plates and frozen at 20 C. Daughter plates are thawed at room temperature or 37 C. just prior to assay. Lawn Assay. A sterilized 96-well replicating device (Boekel) is inserted into the daughter plate and used to deliver the test compound to either a 96-well plate containing Streptococcus, or an agar plate imbedded with bacteria. The replicator pierces the agar and is removed vertically to prevent damage to the agar surface. The appearance of zones of inhibition is monitored after 15 to 24 hr. growth at 37 C. Similarly, Streptococcus inhibition is monitored by no observable turbidity in the wells of the 96-well plate after 24-48 hr. growth. A control plate containing dilutions of antibiotic standards is run at the time of each assay with each organism. The control antibiotics are Ampicillin, Vancomycin and Moenomycin. Control samples are aliquoted in duplicate in a 96-well array. Each antibiotic is tested at eight serial two fold dilutions. Antibiotic concentrations vary from 10 mg/ml to 0.001 mg/ml. MIC Assay. Putative actives in the Lawn assay are further screened to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of each compound for each organism affected. Test compounds are serially diluted in 20% DMSO/water and added to 96-well plates in a volume of 5 l. Each bacterium, grown as described above and diluted in broth without agar, is added to the diluted compound in a volume of 200 l. The range of concentrations used for each compound in the MIC assay is based on the potency implied by the size of the zone of inhibition in the lawn assay. Each compound is tested at five serial dilutions, ranging anywhere from 1:40 up to the maximium dilution necessary to alleviate the antimicrobial effect. The effect of the test compound on bacterial growth is measured after 18 hrs of growth at 37 C. by determining the turbidity of the medium at 600 nm or by visual inspection. The MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of compound necessary to completely inhibit bacterial growth. Peptidoglycan Synthesis Assay. The peptidoglycan polymerization assay is adapted from that described by Mirelman, et al. Biochemistry 15:1781-1790 (1976) and modified by Allen, et al. FEMS Microbiol. Lett . 98:109-116 (1992). E.coli. (ATCC 23226) are permeabilized with ether according to Mirelman, et al.(1976), and Maas and Pelzer Arch. Microbiol ., 130:301-306 (19 ), permitting exogenously added radiolabelled and non-radiolabelled cell wall precursors to penetrate the bacterial cell wall. Screening quantities of UDP muramyl-pentapeptide (UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-Ala-D-glu-meso-diaminopimelyl-D-ala-D-ala) are isolated by boiling from an aqueous extract of B. cereus (ATCC 11778) according to published preparative (Kohlrausch and Holtje, FEMS Microbiol. Lett . 78:253-258 (1991) and analytical HPLC techniques (Kohlrausch, et al., J. Gen. Microbiol . 153:1499-1506 (1989). Bacterial protein is determined by the method of Bradford Anal. Biochem . 72: 248 (1976). Polymerization assays are conducted in 96-well filter-bottom plates (Millipore GF/C-cat. MAFC NOB 10). A Tecan Genesis 150 robot is programmed for all subsequent liquid handling steps. In a final assay volume of 100 L, each well contains: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3); 50 mM NH 4 Cl; 20 mM MgSO 4 .7 H 2 O; 10 mM ATP (disodium salt); 0.5 mM -mercaptoethanol; 0.15 mM D-aspartic acid; 0.001 mM UDP-N-acetyl 14 C--D-glucosamine (DuPont/N.E.N. 265-307 mCi/mmol); 0.05 mM UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, 100 ug/ml tetracycline and 50 ug/well ether-treated bacterial protein. Novel test compounds are solubilized in 10% DMSO/water and screened at a final assay concentration of 10 g/ml. With the exception of radiolabeled and isolated native pentapeptide, all remaining biochemicals are purchased from Sigma Chemical or Fisher Scientific. Assay buffer (10 L), ATP (20 L) , UDP pentapeptide (10 L) and 14 C-UDP-GlcNAc (20 L) are added to all wells, followed by either test compound, reference standard or buffer vehicle (20 L). The reactions are then started by adding 20 L aliquots of bacterial protein prepared in assay buffer into each well. Plates are covered, mixed for 30 sec., then incubated at 37 C. for 120 min. Ice cold 20% TCA (100 L) is added to each well, the plates are gently mixed (60 sec), then refrigerated (4 C.) for 30 min to assure precipitation of all peptidoglycan. The plates are placed under vacuum filtration on a Millipore manifold, flitered, and washed 3-4 times with 200 L/well of 10% TCA. Optiphase scintillation cocktail (30 L/well) is added, then the plates are incubated overnight prior to counting in a Wallac Microbeta. Percent inhibition of incorporation of 14 C-label into peptidoglycan is computed from control (total incorporation) and background (blank) wells containing 300 g/ml of vancomycin or 100 g/ml of moenomycin, which completely inhibit incorporation of radiolabel. All wells are arrayed in duplicates, which usually vary by 20%. Concentration-response curves for reference standards are arrayed on each plate as positive controls (IC50 for inhibition of incorporation: vancomycin2.4/0.2 g/ml; moenomycin0.04/0.005 g/ml). Several preferred aspects of the present invention have been discussed hereinabove for purposes of illustration and clarification. It is readily apparent to one skilled in the art that certain obvious improvements and modifications of the present invention can be practiced without departing from the scope of the appended claims.

A(B) x (I), wherein x is an integer from 1 to 8, A is the radical of a chromophore of the quinacridone, anthraquinone, perylene, indigo, quinophthalone, indanthrone, isoindolinone, isoindoline, dioxazine, azo, phthalocyanine or diketopyrrolopyrrole series that is bonded to x groups B via one or more hetero atoms, those hetero atoms being selected from the group consisting of N, O and S and forming part of the radical A, each group B independently of any other(s) is hydrogen or a group of the formula at least one group B being a group of the formula The compounds according to the invention are used in high-molecular-weight organic materials, thermo-, photo- or chemo-sensitive recording materials, light-sensitive negative or positive resist compositions, ink compositions for ink-jet printing and color tapes for thermal transfer printing. This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/013,659, filed on Jan. 26, 1998, now abandoned. The present Application relates to novel soluble chromophores having removable solubilising oxy-, thio- or amino-alkylene-oxycarbonyl groups. Those compounds have improved properties, especially a surprisingly higher solubility. In dissolved form those chromophores can be incorporated very readily into substrates in high concentrations and can then be converted back into the corresponding insoluble pigments with an especially high degree of conversion. Those groups can also be introduced into chromophores that cannot be reacted, or react only unsatisfactorily, with known groups. EP 648 770 and EP 648 817 disclose soluble, carbamate-group-containing chromophores that can be converted into the corresponding pigments by heating to relatively high temperatures, which results in the removal of the carbamate radicals. Among other numerous combinations, C 1 -C 4 alkylthio-C 1 -C 14 alkylenecarbamate radicals are also possible. Quinophthalone carbonates having limited solubility are known from U.S. Pat. No. 5 243 052 and can be used in heat-sensitive registration systems. It has now been found that soluble chromophores having markedly improved properties are obtained when oxy-, thio- or amino-alkylene-oxycarbonyl groups are used as solubilising groups.

The compounds of formula I can be prepared analogously to methods known per se, as described, for example, in EP 648 770 and EP 648 817, for example by reacting a compound of the formula A(H) x , wherein A and x are as defined above, in the desired molar ratio with a dicarbonate of the formula in an aprotic organic solvent in the presence of a base as catalyst, advantageously at temperatures of from 0 to 120 C., preferably from 10 to 100 C., for from 2 to 80 hours. The molar ratio in each particular case is governed by x, that is to say the number of radicals B to be introduced. The dicarbonate is advantageously used in slight excess. Suitable aprotic organic solvents are, for example, ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, or glycol ethers, such as ethylene glycol methyl ether, ethylene glycol ethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether or diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, and also dipolar aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile, benzonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethyl-acetamide, nitrobenzene, N-methylpyrrolidone, halogenated aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, such as trichloroethane, benzene, or benzene substituted by alkyl, alkoxy or by halogen, such as toluene, xylene, anisole or chlorobenzene, or aromatic N-heterocycles, such as pyridine, picoline or quinoline. Preferred solvents are, for example, tetrahydrofuran, N,N-dimethylformamide and N-methylpyrrolidone. The mentioned solvents can also be used in the form of mixtures. It is advantageous to use from 5 to 20 parts by weight of solvent to 1 part by weight of reactant. Bases suitable as catalyst are, for example, the alkali metals themselves, such as lithium, sodium or potassium and the hydroxides and carbonates thereof, or alkali metal amides, such as lithium, sodium or potassium amide, or alkali metal hydrides, such as lithium, sodium or potassium hydride, or alkaline earth or alkali metal alcoholates that are derived especially from primary, secondary or tertiary aliphatic alcohols having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, such as, for example, lithium, sodium or potassium methanolate, ethanolate, n-propanolate, isopropanolate, n-butanolate, sec-butanolate, tert-butanolate, 2-methyl-2-butanolate, 2-methyl-2-pentanolate, 3-methyl-3-pentanolate, 3-ethyl-3-pentanolate, and also organic aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic N-bases including, for example, diazabicyclooctene, diazabicycloundecene and 4-dimethylaminopyridine, and trialkylamines, for example trimethylamine or triethylamine. It is also possible, however, to use a mixture of the mentioned bases. Preference is given to the organic N-bases, such as, for example, diazabicyclooctane, diazabicycloundecene and especially 4-dimethylaminopyridine. The reaction is carried out especially at temperatures of from 18 to 40 C., that is to say preferably at room temperature, and under atmospheric pressure. The dicarbonates of the formula suitable for the preparation of the compounds of formula I according to the invention can be prepared analogously to generally known methods. Most of the chemicals required for that purpose are known. Many of them are commercially available and all of them can be prepared in accordance with methods known per se. The compounds of formula I according to the invention are excellently suitable as fluorescent dyes for the mass-colouring of high-molecular-weight organic material. Examples of suitable high-molecular-weight organic materials that can be coloured using the compounds of formula I according to the invention are vinyl polymers, e.g. polystyrene, poly--methylstyrene, poly-p-methylstyrene, poly-p-hydroxystyrene, poly-p-hydroxyphenylstyrene, poly(methylacrylate) and poly(acrylamide) and also the corresponding methacrylic compounds, poly(methyl maleate), poly(acrylonitrile), poly(methacrylonitrile), poly(vinyl chloride), poly(vinyl fluoride), poly(vinylidene chloride), poly(vinylidene fluoride), poly(vinyl acetate), poly(methylvinyl ether) and poly(butylvinyl ether); novolaks derived from C 1 -C 6 -aldehydes, e.g. formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, and a dinuclear, preferably mononuclear, phenol that is unsubstituted or substituted by one or two C 1 -C 9 alkyl groups, by one or two halogen atoms or by a phenyl ring, such as, for example, o-, m- or p-cresol, xylene, p-tert-butylphenol, o-, m- or p-nonylphenol, p-chlorophenol or p-phenylphenol, or a compound having more than one phenolic group, e.g. resorcinol, bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane or 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane; polymers derived from maleimide and/or maleic anhydride, e.g. copolymers of maleic anhydride and styrene; poly(vinylpyrrolidone), biopolymers and derivatives thereof, e.g. cellulose, starch, chitin, chitosan, gelatin, zein, ethylcellulose, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate and cellulose butyrate; natural resins and synthetic resins, e.g. rubber, casein, silicone and silicone resins, ABS, urea- and melamine-formaldehyde resins, alkyd resins, phenol resins, polyamides, polyimides, polyamide/imides, polysulfones, polyether sulfones, polyphenylene oxides, polyurethanes, polyureas, polycarbonates, polyarylenes, polyarylene sulfides, polyepoxides, polyolefins and polyalkadienes. Preferred high-molecular-weight organic materials are, for example, cellulose ethers and esters, such as ethylcellulose, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate or cellulose butyrate, natural resins or synthetic resins, such as polymerisation or condensation resins, such as aminoplasts, especially urea- and melamine-formaldehyde resins, alkyd resins, phenoplasts, polycarbonates, polyolefins, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyamides, polyurethanes, polyesters, ABS, polyphenylene oxides, rubber, casein, silicone and silicone resins, individually or in admixture. The mentioned high-molecular-weight organic compounds may be present individually or in mixtures in the form of plastics, melts or in the form of spinning solutions, paints, coating compositions or printing inks. According to the intended use it has proved advantageous to use the compounds of formula I according to the invention as toners or in the form of a preparation. The compounds of formula I according to the invention are especially suitable for the mass-colouring of polyvinyl chloride and especially polyolefins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as of paints and also of powder coating compositions, printing inks and coating compositions. The compounds of formula I according to the invention can be used in an amount of from 0.01 to 30% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 10% by weight, based on the high-molecular-weight organic material to be coloured. The colouring of high-molecular-weight organic substances with the compounds of formula I according to the invention is carried out, for example, by mixing the compound of formula I, optionally in the form of a master batch, into those substrates using roll mills or mixing or grinding apparatus. The coloured material is then brought into the desired final form according to procedures known per se, such as calendering, compression moulding, extrusion moulding, coating, casting or injection-moulding. It is often desirable for the purpose of producing non-rigid mouldings or reducing the brittleness thereof to incorporate so-called plasticisers into the high-molecular-weight compounds before shaping. There may be used as plasticisers, for example, esters of phosphoric acid, phthalic acid or sebacic acid. The plasticisers can be incorporated into the polymers before or after the incorporation of the compounds of formula I according to the invention. In order to obtain different colour shades it is also possible to add to the high-molecular-weight organic substances, in addition to the compound according to the invention, any desired amounts of fillers or other colour-imparting constituents, such as white, coloured or black pigments. For the colouring of paints, coating compositions and printing inks, the high-molecular-weight organic materials and the compounds of formula I according to the invention, optionally together with additives, such as fillers, pigments, siccatives or plasticisers, are finely dispersed or dissolved in a common organic solvent or solvent mixture. It is also possible for the individual components to be dispersed or dissolved separately, or for several components to be dispersed or dissolved together, and only then for all the components to be combined. In colourings, for example of polyvinyl chloride or polyolefins or in printing inks, the compounds of formula I according to the invention are distinguished by good general properties, such as good migration-stability and light- and weather-fastness, but especially by their unexpectedly high fluorescence. Very great importance is attached, however, to the conversion of the soluble chromophores according to the invention that have been incorporated into a substrate into the corresponding pigments of the formula A(H) x . This can be achieved most simply by thermal treatment (heating to temperatures of from 50 to 250 C., preferably from 100 to 200 C., according to the pigment) of the solids, solutions or dispersions comprising the soluble compounds according to the invention in organic or aqueous media, polymer solutions or melts. This allows the colouring of paints, printing inks, plastics, especially also in fibre form, heat-sensitive registration systems, inks for ink-jet printing, colour tapes for thermal transfer printing onto smooth or woven receiver substrates, and very specifically also in light-sensitive compositions, for example negative or positive resist formulations, giving an overall improvement in properties, such as purity, colour strength, brilliance and transparency, and also allows interesting applications in analysis. The invention therefore relates also to high-molecular-weight organic material comprising in its mass a pigment of the formula A(H) x produced in situ by thermal degradation of a soluble compound of formula I, to a thermo-, photo- or chemo-sensitive recording material, and to an ink for ink-jet printing, a colour tape for thermal transfer printing or a light-sensitive negative or positive resist composition, each comprising a soluble compound of formula I. Inks for ink-jet printing, colour tapes for thermal transfer printing, thermo-, photo- and chemo-sensitive recording materials and also light-sensitive negative or positive resist compositions are well known to the person skilled in the art. It has also been found that in the case of certain compounds of formula I the thermal treatment comprising heating to temperatures of from 100 to 200 C., preferably from 105 to 120 C., may result in crystal modification conversions of the corresponding chromophores of the formula A(H) x . If different compounds of formula I are used, it is also possible to prepare mixed crystals. The invention therefore relates also to a process for the preparation of mixed crystals or for the crystal modification conversion of chromophores of formula A(H) x by conversion into compounds of formula I, for example in accordance with the above-mentioned process, and thermal treatment of the resulting compounds of formula I at temperatures of from 100 to 200 C. A very special, surprising advantage of the compounds according to the invention is their extraordinarily high solubility. As a result it is possible to incorporate relatively high concentrations into a substrate, so that a higher colour intensity can be achieved. A further surprising advantage is that the conversion into the pigment is more complete than in the case of known soluble pigments, thereby improving the migration tendency after conversion into the pigment. Another surprising advantage is that soluble chromophores can be prepared from pigments that could not be reacted, or could be reacted only unsatisfactorily, with the solubilising groups known hitherto. As a result of those improved properties, the soluble chromophores of formula I according to the invention can be used especially advantageously in compositions that are used in the preparation of structured colour formers or colour filters. The use of soluble pigment precursors in the preparation of structured colour formers or colour filters is known from EP 654 711. Those compositions comprise, for example, a soluble chromophore of formula I and a positive or negative resist resin. In particular, it is possible for resist formulations comprising soluble pigment precursors to be irradiated and developed in the desired pattern, it being possible for the soluble pigment precursor to be converted into the insoluble pigment during irradiation or development or alternatively only subsequently. The soluble pigment precursor can also be applied in the desired pattern directly to a receiving layer suitable for the purpose by means of ink-jet printing or by thermally induced diffusion.

SPECIFICATION 1. Technical Field The present invention relates to a process for preparing halogenated -lactam compounds containing a halogenated penam derivative or halogenated cephem derivative, which are synthetic intermediates for medicine. As an example of halogenated -lactam compounds obtained by the invention, there is 6,6-dibromopenicillanic acid which is an intermediate for Sulbactam which is a kind of antibacterial agents (JP-A-72115/1980). 2. Background Art A conventional process for preparing halogenated -lactam derivatives of the formula (4) by using -lactam amino compounds of the formula (1), as a starting material, is disclosed in, for example, Volkmann J. Org. Chem. 47, 3344 (1982). A process for preparing halogenated -lactam compounds without employing organic solvent is disclosed in Clayton J. Chem. Soc. C 2123 (1969). In the former process, it is however essential to use a halogenated organic solvent such as methylene chloride or carbon tetrachloride. A large scale use of such a halogenated organic solvent is severely limited in view of safety and environmental pollution problems. The drawbacks of using carbon tetrachloride are its cost and its difficult handling properties. Therefore, a process for preparing halogenated -lactam compounds in the system using no organic solvent, is highly desired. The latter process employing organic solvent is however impractical because of its remarkably low yield, namely, 34%. An object of the present invention is to provide a process with which halogenated -lactam compounds are prepared at high yield and efficiency, in an industrially useful, inexpensive and safe manner, by using water as a reaction solvent, not employing any organic solvent causing many problems in view of safety and environmental pollution. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a process for preparing halogenated -lactam compounds, characterized in that a lactam amino compound of the formula (1) is reacted with nitrous acid or nitrite in a slurry dispersion state in water, under acid condition in the presence of halogen molecules, thereby obtaining a halogenated -lactam compound of the formula (4) wherein n is an integer of 0 to 2; A is the formula (2) or (3); R 1 and R 2 are the same or different and are hydrogen atom, halogen atom, C 1 -C 3 alkyl group, C 2 -C 4 alkenyl group, C 2 -C 4 alkynyl group, nucleophilic group, or CH 2 R 3 ; and R 3 is halogen atom or nucleophilic group wherein A is as defined above; X 1 is hydrogen atom or halogen atom; and X 2 is halogen atom. The present invention was accomplished when it was discovered that halogenated -lactam compounds of the formula (4) could be prepared efficiently on a large scale, by reacting -lactam amino compounds of the formula (1) in a slurry dispersion state in water, after various reaction conditions were considered in order to avoid the use of organic solvents causing many problems in view of safety and environmental pollution, and establish a simple and inexpensive process by using water as a main solvent. Halogen atoms present in substituent R 1 , R 2 or R 3 in the invention are chlorine, bromine and iodine. Examples of C 1 -C 3 alkyl group are methyl, ethyl and propyl. Examples of C 2 -C 4 alkenyl group are vinyl, propenyl, allyl and butenyl. Examples of C 2 C 4 alkynyl group are ethynyl, propargyl and butynyl. As nucleophilic groups represented by substituent R 1 , R 2 or R 3 in the invention, there are, for example, aliphatic acyloxy groups having 2 to 4 carbon atoms, such as acetyloxy group, propionyloxy group, 3-oxobutyryloxy group, 3-carboxypropionyloxy group and 4-carboxybutyryloxy group; aromatic acyloxy groups such as mandelyloxy group and 2-carboxybenzoyloxy group; carbamoyloxy group; hydroxy group; and mercapto group. Alternatively, these nucleophilic groups may be substituted with an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or aliphatic acyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms. Suitable number of substituents is usually 1 or 2. Further to the above examples of nucleophilic groups represented by substituent R 1 , R 2 or R 3 in the invention, there is a heterocycle bonded through S, that is, heterocyclic thio group. Herein, the heterocycle is a five- or six-member ring containing 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from O, S or N. Examples of these heterocycles are pyridyl group, pyridazinyl group, pyrazolyl group, thiazolyl group, thiadiazolyl group, triazolyl group and tetrazolyl group. These heterocycles may have a substituent, such as a lower alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms. Halogen atoms represented by X 1 and X 2 of halogenated -lactam compounds of the formula (4) in the invention are chlorine, bromine and iodine. In the present invention, acid condition is obtained by adding acid. Examples of acid used are sulfuric acid, hydrohalogenic acid and nitric acid. The amount of acid used to the compounds of the formula (1) is usually 1 to 20 equivalents, preferably 1.5 to 6 equivalents. Examples of halogen molecules used in the invention are bromine, iodine and chlorine. The amount of halogen molecules used to the compounds of the formula (1) is usually 1 to 16 equivalents, preferably 2 to 6 equivalents. Suitable nitrites are sodium nitrite and potassium nitrite. The amount of nitrous acid or nitrite used to the compounds of the formula (1) is usually 1 to 12 equivalents, preferably 2 to 6 equivalents. The reaction of the invention is usually conducted at atmospheric pressure, but it may be conducted under increased pressure, if required. The reaction temperature is preferably about 10 to 15 C., most preferably 5 to 6 C. In the present invention, a slurry formed by a compound of the formula (1) and water, or powder of a compound of the formula (1), is preferably added in portions over an adequate time. The reaction time depends on the reaction temperature, substrate concentration and reagent equivalent number, but suitable reaction time is usually about 6 to 36 hours, most desirably 12 to 24 hours. In the present invention, desired high purity -lactam compounds can be obtained efficiently by conducting the reaction within a sealed- or unsealed-type container, and filtering a deposited crystal after the reaction is completed. The crystal can also be purified by a usual purification method, such as recrystallization.

No. 08/951,700 filed on Oct. 16, 1997, which is now U.S. Pat. No. 5,883,254. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a new process for the preparation of pyrimidine derivatives. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The subject process for manufacturing a compound of the formula: R 1 , R 2 , R 3 each independently is hydrogen, C 1-7 -alkyl, or C 1-7 -alkoxy, and A is CN, which comprises reacting a compound of the formula: wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are as above and X is chlorine, with an alkali cyanide in the presence of 1-azabicyclo2,2,2octane or 1,4-diazabicyclo2,2,2octane. Of particular concern is a process for manufacturing 2-cyanopyrimidine, which comprises reacting 2-chloropyrimidine with an alkali cyanide in the presence of 1-azabicyclo-2,2,2octane or 1,4-diazabicyclo2,2,2octane. Another particularly useful process is for manufacturing 4-tertbutyl-N-6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(pyrimidin-2-yl)-pyrimidin-4-yl-benzenesulphonamide, This process comprises manufacturing 2-cyanopyrimidine by reacting 2-chloropyrimidine with an alkali cyanide in the presence of 1-azabicyclo2,2,2octane or 1,4-diazabicyclo2,2,2octane. The 2-cyano pyrimidine is then converted by means of NH 3 /NH 4 Cl in a sodium methanolate/methanol solution into pyrimidin-2-carboxamidine hydrochloride. The pyrimidine-2-caroboxamidine hydrochloride is then converted in the presence of sodium methanolate with diethyl (o-methoxy-phenoxy-malonate) into rac-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-pyrimidin-2-yl-tetrahydro-pyrimidin-4,6-dione. This product is then reacted with N,N-diisopropyl-N-ethylamine and phosphorus pentachloride to give 4,6-dichloro-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2-bipyrimidine. This in turn is reacted with p-tert.butylbenzenesulphonamide to give 4-tert.butyl-N-6-chloro-5-2-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(pyrimidin-2-yl)-pyrimidin-4-yl-benzenesulphonamide which is reacted with sodium ethylene glycolate to give 4-tert.butyl-N-6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(pyrimidin-2-yl)-pyrimidin-4-yl-benzenesulphonamide. Intermediates in the above process include a compound of the formula: wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 each independently is hydrogen, C 1-7 -alkyl, or C 1-7 -alkoxy, and salts thereof; and a compound of the formula: wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 each independently is hydrogen, C 1-7 -alkyl, or C 1-7 -alkoxy, and salts thereof. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The subject invention will now be described in terms of its preferred embodiments. These embodiments are set forth to aid in understanding the invention, but are not to be construed as limiting. In detail, the subject invention relates to a novel process for the manufacture of pyrimidines of formula I: wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 each independently represent hydrogen, C 1-7 -alkyl, or C 1-7 -alkoxy, A signifies CN, a carbanionic R 4 -alkynyl residue, in which R 4 is hydrogen or C 1-7 -alkyl, or a carbanionic residue of the malonic acid derivative of formula III in which B and B independently represent CN, COOR 5 , or C(O)R 5 , wherein R 5 is alkyl or aryl. The process is useful for the preparation of pharmaceutical products, for example, those described in European Patent Application Publ. No. 726,708. A first aspect of the present invention relates to a process which comprises reacting a pyrimidine of the formula: wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 have the above significances and X is chlorine, with a compound yielding the residue A in the presence of 1-azabicyclo2,2,2octane (ABCO) or 1,4-diazabicyclo2,2,2octane (DABCO). A second aspect of this invention relates to intermediates of formulas IV and V or salts thereof: wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 each independently represent hydrogen, C 1-7 -alkyl, or C 1-7 -alkoxy. In more detail, the present invention refers to a process for the manufacture of pyrimidines of the formula I: wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 each independently represent hydrogen, C 1-7 -alkyl, or C 1-7 -alkoxy, A signifies CN, a carbanionic R 4 -alkynyl residue, in which R 4 is hydrogen or C 1-7 -alkyl, or a carbanionic residue of the malonic acid derivative of formula III: in which B and B independently represent CN, COOR 5 , or C(O)R 5 , wherein R 5 is alkyl or aryl. which process comprises reacting a pyrimidine of the formula: wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 have the above significances and X is chlorine, with a compound yielding the residue A in the presence of 1-azabicyclo2,2,2octane or 1,4-diazabicyclo2,2,2octane. The starting compounds, pyrimidine derivatives of formula II, can be prepared from the corresponding 2-pyrimidone (2-hydroxypyrimidine) derivatives (The chemistry of heterocyclic compounds, Ed. E. C. Taylor, Vol. 52, The Pyrimidines, John Wiley Sons, N.Y., 1994). For example, the corresponding 2-pyrimidone (2-hydroxypyrimidine) can be reacted with PCl 5 , POCl 3 or a combination of PCl 5 and POCl 3 . The resulting 2-chloropyrimidine derivative can be used for the process of the present invention. In the present invention the term alkyl signifies a straight-chain or branched alkyl group containing 1 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 3 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, tertbutyl, n-pentyl, iso-pentyl, neopentyl, n-hexyl, isohexyl and isohexyl. The term alkoxy means the group OR wherein R is alkyl as defined above. The term aryl means a monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic ring, preferably phenyl or naphthyl, and most preferably phenyl , which optionally can be substituted in the ortho-, meta- and/or para-position. Substituents which come into consideration are alkyl, alkoxy, hydroxy, nitro, trifluoromethyl as well as halo such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine or also trialkylsilyl. Preferred aryl residues are phenyl, p-tolyl, m-tolyl, m,m-dialkylphenyl, p-chlorophenyl and p-methoxyphenyl. The term carbanionic residue refers to residues resulting from base treatment of alkynyls or malonic acid derivatives, for example, carbanionic R 4 -alkynyl residues wherein R 4 is alkyl or hydrogen. Examples of R 4 -alkynyl residues are acetylene, propyne and 1-butyne, which can be converted by alcoholates and other bases into the carbanionic residue. Further examples of carbanionic residues are carbanionic residues of malonic acid derivatives of formula III in which B and B independently represent CN, COOR 5 , or C(O)R 5 , wherein R 5 is alkyl or aryl. Examples for these carbanionic residues are acetoacetic ester and its higher homologues, which have been converted by for example by a metal hydride into the reactive carbanionic component A. One preferred process includes pyrimidines of general formula II in which R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are each independently hydrogen, C 1-3 -alkyl, or C 1-3 -alkoxy as starting material. In the most preferred embodiment R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are all hydrogen (2-chloropyrimidine). Another preferred category refers to the compounds yielding the residue A. In a preferred embodiment the above pyrimidine compounds of formula II are reacted with a compound yielding the residue A wherein A signifies CN or a carbanionic residue of a malonic acid derivative of formula III in which B and B independently represent CN, COOR 5 , or C(O)R 5 , wherein R 5 is alkyl or aryl. In a more preferred embodiment R 5 is alkyl. In general, the carbanionic residues of formula III can be prepared e.g. from malonic acid esters and malonic acid derivatives using a metal hydride such as sodium hydride, lithium aluminium hydride and the like. In the most preferred embodiment the above pyrimidines of general formula II are reacted with a compound yielding the residue A wherein A is CN. The reagents yielding this cyano group can be, for example, alkali cyanides such as sodium cyanide. As solvents there can be used organic aprotic, non-polar or polar solvents from the group of halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride or chloroform, DMF, DMSO, N-methylpyrrolidine, acetonitrile, sulpholane, esters from the group of methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and propyl acetate or ethers such as tetrahydrofuran either alone in admixture with one another or with water. DMF, DMSO, N-methylpyrrolidine, acetonitrile, sulpholane, methylene chloride, chloroform as well as trifluoromethylbenzene are preferred. Preferably, an alkali cyanide, especially sodium cyanide, is reacted with compounds of formula II, preferably 2-chloropyrimidine. When an alkali cyanide, especially sodium cyanide, is used, the compound of formula II is preferably reacted in an equivalent ratio of 0.1 to 1.4. The aforementioned 1-azabicyclo2,2,2octane or 1,4-diazabicyclo2,2,2octane can be used as catalysts. These compounds are commercially available (Fluka, etc.). 1,4-Diazabicyclo2,2,2octane (DABCO) is especially preferred. The catalyst is used in the process in accordance with the invention in amounts of 0.001 to 1.5, preferably 0.05 to 0.8, mol equivalents based on the compound of formula II. When 1,4-diazabicyclo2,2,2octane is used, the most preferred amount of catalyst is 0.05 to 0.2 molar equivalents based on compound II. The course of the reaction is conveniently monitored by an in-process control in which the ratio of educt (for example chloropyrimidine) to product (for example cyanopyrimidine) is the determining criterion for stopping the reaction. The reaction is stopped when the critical limit has been reached. The working up of the reaction product can be effected using means which are known per se, for example, extraction with solvents. For example, the reaction mixture can be firstly diluted with water and thereupon subsequently extracted several times with TBME and n-hexane. The reaction temperature conveniently amounts to about 20 to 60 C. Using calorimetric investigations it has been established that higher yields can be achieved at temperatures below 40 C. than at higher reaction temperatures. The reaction temperature is therefore preferably 15-35 C. The most preferred process refers to the preparation of 2-cyano-pyrimidine which process comprises reacting 2-chloropyrimidine with an alkali cyanide in the presence of 1-azabicyclo2,2,2octane or 1,4-diazabicyclo2,2,2octane, preferably diazabicyclo2,2,2octane. The process of the present invention is useful for the preparation of valuable intermediates for the synthesis of pyrimidine derivatives. Compounds of formula I in which A is CN can be converted into pharmaceutically active substances useful as inhibitors of endothelin receptors. They can be used for the treatment of disorders which are associated with endothelin activities, especially circulatory disorders such as hypertension, ischaemia, and angina pectoris. Compounds of formula I in which A is CN may be converted in the corresponding carboxamidine, e.g. by NH 3 /NH 4 Cl. This derivative may then be used in the manner described in European Patent Application Publ. No. 726,708 to produce inhibitors of endothelin receptors. For the preparation of the inhibitors according to EP 726,708, a compound of formula I in which A is CN is converted for example by means of NH 3 /NH 4 Cl into the corresponding carboxamidine. This substance may then be converted with a phenoxy-malonate into a pyrimidinyl-tetrahydro-pyrimidine-dione, which is then reacted with phosphorus pentachloride followed by a reaction with a benzenesulphonamide to give the corresponding benzenesulphonamide derivative which may then be converted into a pharmaceutically active substance by reaction with a for example an alkali glycolate corresponding to the desired end product. The process of the present invention is especially useful for the preparation of 4-tert.butyl-N-6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(pyrimidine-2-yl)-pyrimidine-4-yl-benzenesulphonamide (bosentan). For the preparation of this compound 2-cyanopyrimidine is prepared as described above and converted into pyrimidin-2-carboxamidine hydrochloride by means of NH 3 /NH 4 Cl in a sodium methanolate/methanol solution. This compound is converted in the presence of sodium methanolate with diethyl (o-methoxy-phenoxy-malonate) into rac-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-pyrimidin-2-yl-tetrahydro-pyrimidin-4,6-dione. The obtained product is reacted with N,N-diisopropyl-N-ethylamine and phosphorus pentachloride to give 4,6-dichloro-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2-bipyrimidine. This substance is then reacted with p-tert.butylbenzenesulphonamide to give 4-tert.butyl-N-6-chloro-5-2-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(pyrimidin-2-yl)-pyrimidin-4-yl-benzenesulphonamide and further reacted with sodium ethylene glycolate to give 4-tert.butyl-N-6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(pyrimidin-2-yl)-pyrimidin-4-yl-benzenesulphonamide (bosentan). The present invention accordingly includes the use of the process in accordance with the invention for the production of bosentan. It has been found that in the reaction in accordance with the invention the intermediate compounds of the formulas IV and V or salts thereof, preferably chlorides: wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 each independently represent hydrogen, C 1-7 -alkyl, or C 1-7 -alkoxy are obtained by reaction of the catalysts with compounds of formula II. Especially preferred compounds are those wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are each independently hydrogen, C 1-3 -alkyl, or C 1-3 -alkoxy. The most preferred compounds are 1-pyrimidin-2-yl-4-aza-1-azonium-bicyclo2,2,2octane chloride and 1-pyrimidin-2-yl-1-azonium-bicyclo2,2,2octane chloride. These compounds are also an object of the present invention and can be obtained in isolated form conveniently by reacting a compound of formula II with ABCO or DABCO in toluene at room temperature.

Examples of such solvents are linear or cyclic ethers such as dimethylether, diethylether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, monoglyme, diglyme and mixtures of any of these solvents. A preferred solvent is dimethoxyethane. A temperature range of from about 20 C. to the boiling point of the solvent is suitable for the reaction of the present invention. The preferred temperature range is between about 20 C. to about 20 C. preferably from about 0 C. to about 5 C. The above reaction is followed by an oxidative work-up under basic conditions including addition of a base such as NaOH and an oxidising agent, for example perborate or preferably H 2 O 2 . The temperature range for the addition of the base and the oxidising agent is from about 20 C. to the boiling point of the solvent. A preferred temperature range for the addition of the base is from about 0 C. to about 10 C., and most preferably from about 5 C. to about 10 C. The reaction mixture is treated with the oxidising agent preferably at temperatures ranging from about 20 C. to about 60 C., and most preferably from 30-50 C. However, lower or higher temperatures also may be used. According to the above process compounds of formula 1 may be formed as a mixture of stereoisomers, preferably a mixture of diastereomers. It is also possible that only one of the diastereomers is formed by the above process. In a preferred embodiment of the described process, only one of the diastereomers is formed. In a preferred embodiment of the invention (R)-4-(4-benzyloxy-phenyl)-1-(1-phenyl-ethyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridine yields a mixture of (3R,4R)-4-(4-benzyloxy-phenyl)-1-((R)-1-phenyl-ethyl)-piperidin-3-ol and (3S,4S)-4-(4-benzyloxy-phenyl)-1-((R)-1-phenyl-ethyl)-piperidin-3-ol, most preferably the products are formed in a ratio of about 3:1. Optionally, the desired diastereomer can be isolated by methods known in the art such as crystallisation, chromatography or distillation. These methods also include the formation of salts or derivatives of compounds of the formula 1 followed by separation of these salts or derivatives by crystallisation, chromatography, distillation, etc. These methods for the separation of diastereoismers are well known in the art and are for example described in Houben-Weyl, Methods of Organic Chemistry (Thieme 1952). A preferred method of isolation of a particular diastereomer from a -mixture that includes both diasteromers is the crystallisation of the salts of compounds of formula 1. Especially preferred acids which can be used for the formation of salts of compounds of the formula 1 include hydrohalic acids, preferably HCl. Preferred solvents which can be used for the crystallisation of compounds of formula 1, in particular the crystallization of of salts of compounds of formula 1, are protic or aprotic solvents that do not react with compounds of formula 1. Particularly preferred solvents include ethanol, methanol or their mixtures with pentane or hexane. One preferred embodiment of the isolation of the desired stereoisomer according to the invention is the crystallisation of hydrochlorides of compounds of formula 1 in solvents such as ethanol, isopropanol, or preferably methanol. After isolation the desired stereoisomer, preferably diastereomer, can be reacted with hydrogen, preferably in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium on carbon or any other catalyst which is suitable in the hydrogenolytic removal of groups such as benzyl. Preferred solvents for this reaction are, for example, alcohols, water or acetic acid either alone or in combination. Particularly preferred is the mixture of methanol and water. The resulting compound can then be transformed by reaction with di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate, preferably in the presence of a base such as triethylamine. A preferred solvent for this reaction is, for example, methanol. The resulting compound can then be used in the preparation of renin inhibitors as is disclosed in WO 97/09311. In general, the above-resulting compounds may be used in the preparation of renin inhibitors as follows. The selective functionalization of the phenolic function can be performed with alkylation reactions using aliphatic or benzylic chlorides, bromides, iodides, tosylates or mesylates in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate in solvents such as an ether like tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, acetone, methyl-ethyl-ketone, or pyridine at temperatures between 0 C. and 140 C. The alkylating agents used can either contain the whole chain desired to be included or optionally can be suitably protected by functional groups which allow further structural modifications at a later stage of the synthesis. Functionalization at the secondary hydroxy function of the piperidine ring can then be performed in solvents as ethers like tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, or in dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide in the presence of a base like sodium hydride or potassium tert-butoxide and a suitable alkylating agent, preferentially an aryl methyl chloride, bromide, mesylate or tosylate at temperatures between 0 C. and 40 C. Again, the alkylating agents used can either contain the whole substituent desired or optionally can be suitably protected by functional groups which allow further structural modifications at a later stage of the synthesis. Further structural variations can comprise removal of protective functions followed by functionalization of the liberated functional groups, e.g. etherification of a phenolic moiety. Reduction may also be used, such as of a quinoline unit to a tetrahydroquinoline unit by, for example, sodium borohydride or nickel chloride in solvents such as methanol or ethanol. Final removal of the Boc-protective group can be performed in the presence of acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, trifluoroacetic acid in a variety of solvents such as alcohols and alcohol/water mixtures, ethers and chlorinated hydrocarbons. The Boc-protective group can also be removed with anhydrous zinc bromide in inert solvents such as dichloromethane. Compounds of formula 2 can be prepared as follows: Compound 5 is reacted with an acid, e.g. oxalic acid in an inert solvent to form a compound of formula 2. Compound 5 is formed by reacting a compound of the formula 7 in an inert solvent with butyllithium or a Grignard reagent to form an organometallic intermediate which is reacted with a compound of the formula 8. Compound 7 can be obtained by reacting a compound of formula 6 with a compound of the formula R 6 -Hal in the presence of a base and preferably a catalyst such as NaI in an inert solvent. R 6 is alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, aralkoxyalkyl, alkylsulfonyl or arylsulfonyl. Compound 8 can be obtained by the reaction of R 1 -NH 2 with 1-ethyl-1-methyl-4-oxo-piperidinium iodide in the present of a base. 1-Ethyl-1-methyl-4-oxo-piperidinium iodide can be obtained by the reaction of 1-ethyl-4-piperidone with methyl iodide in an inert solvent. Alternatively, as was discussed earlier, a compound of formula 2 can be obtained by the reaction of an ammonium salt having the formula R 1 NH 3 X with formaldehyde and a compound of formula 3. Compounds of formula 3 can be obtained, for example, by a Wittig reaction of the appropriate phosphorane with a compound of formula 9 in the presence of an inert solvent. Alternatively, compounds of formula 2 can be prepared by the reaction of an ammonium salt of the formula R 1 NH 3 X with formaldehyde and with a compound of the formula 4. Compounds of formula 4 can be prepared by the reaction of an organometallic compound containing a methyl group attached to the metal as in methylmagnesium bromide or methyllithium, with compound 9. Compounds of formula 4 wherein R 2 is chlorine, bromine or iodine can be prepared via oxidation of a halocumene (for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,954,876 or DE 2302751).

the formula (I), in which R 1 , R 2 and R 4 are as defined in claim 1 and in case (a) R 3 H, halogen, CN, NO 2 , C 1 -C 5 -alkyl, C 1 -C 5 -alkoxy, aryl or aryloxy, where each of the 4 lastmentioned

excess of the chlorinating agent to give the dichlorination product (I) in which R 3 chlorine. This application is a 371 of PCT/EP98/07969 Dec. 8, 1998. The invention relates to the technical field of the processes for preparing intermediates which can be employed for syntheses of active compounds, for example active compounds for crop protection agents or pharmaceuticals. Chlorobenzoxazoles have already attained great importance as intermediates for crop protection agents and pharmaceuticals. Their properties and processes for their preparation are described, inter alia, in DE-A-3207153; EP-A-43573 and GB-A-913910. Using processes from the abovementioned publications, chlorobenzoxazoles can be prepared, for example, from 2-mercapto-1,3-benzoxazoles by exchanging the mercapto group with chlorine using various chlorinating agents. Sulfur chlorides requiring disposal are obtained as byproducts. A further preparation method involves appropriately substituted 1,3-benzoxazol-2-ones which are converted into chlorobenzoxazoles using an excess of phosphorus pentachloride (EP-A-572893; EP-A-141053; DE-A-3406909). In the case of the preparation of 2,6-dichlorobenzoxazole, for example, 6-chlorobenzoxazol-2-one is employed. The reprocessing of the excess of PCl 5 employed in this process requires a special effort. It is already known that the unsubstituted thioanalog 1,3-benzothiazole compound can be converted into 2-chlorobenzo-1,3-thiazole by direct chlorination in the presence of chlorination catalysts (DE-A-3234530). However, this selective monochlorination reaction is not known for the analogous benzoxazole; on the contrary, DE-A-2059725 shows that in this case perchlorination occurs in the molecule, without any selectivity in the occupation of the possible substitution sites. An alternative process for preparing chlorobenzoxazoles is required which does not have the disadvantages of the abovementioned processes. Surprisingly, it has now been found that chlorobenzoxazoles can be obtained from benzoxazoles by direct chlorination. Both monochlorinations and, alternatively, certain dichlorinations can be carried out in this process. The invention accordingly provides a process for preparing chlorobenzoxazoles of the formula (I), in which R 1 , R 2 and R 4 are each, independently of one another, H, halogen, CN, NO 2 , C 1 -C 5 -alkyl, C 1 -C 5 -alkoxy, aryl or aryloxy, where each of the 4 lastmentioned radicals is unsubstituted or substituted, and (Case a) R 3 H, halogen, CN, NO 2 , C 1 -C 5 -alkyl, C 1 -C 5 -alkoxy, aryl or aryloxy, where each of the 4 lastmentioned radicals is unsubstituted or substituted, or (Case b) R 3 chlorine, which comprises reacting benzoxazoles of the formula (II), in which R 1 , R 2 and R 4 are as defined in formula (I) and R 3 in case (a) is as defined in formula (I) and R 3 in case (b) is hydrogen, in the presence of an acidic catalyst with a chlorinating agent to give the monochlorination product (I) or in case (b) with an excess of the chlorinating agent to give the dichlorination product (I) in which R 3 chlorine. According to the invention, the 2-chloroderivatives of the formula (I) can be prepared selectively in high yield and purity. Moreover, our experiments show that, if the chlorination reaction of benzoxazoles, preferably of unsubstituted benzoxazole, to the corresponding 2-chlorobenzoxazole is continued using excess chlorinating agent, 2,6-dichlorinated benzoxazoles, preferably 2,6-dichlorobenzoxazole, can be obtained selectively. Such a selectivity was unforeseeable. Owing to the results described in DE-A-2059725 the chlorination of benzoxazole was expected to result in unselective polychlorination. Furthermore, it was not expected that the conditions described for the chlorination of benzothiazole to give 2-chlorobenzothiazole (DE-A-3234530) could be transferred to the benzoxazole molecule, since the benzoxazole skeleton and in particular benzoxazole itself is known to be a much more sensitive (reactive) molecule system and molecule, respectively. It was therefore possible to explain the technical teachings from DE-A-2059725 and DE-A-3234530 without any contradiction. Surprisingly, however, it is possible to carry out selective chlorinations under the conditions according to the invention even with benzoxazoles, and the chloroderivatives of the formula (I) are usually obtained in high yield and selectivity. Of particular interest are processes according to the invention for preparing chlorobenzoxazoles of the abovementioned formula (I), in which R 1 , R 2 and R 4 are each, independently of one another, H, halogen, CN, NO 2 , C 1 -C 5 -alkyl, C 1 -C 5 -haloalkyl, C 1 -C 5 -alkoxy, C 1 -C 5 -haloalkoxy, phenyl or phenoxy, where each of the 2 lastmentioned radicals is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more radicals selected from the group consisting of halogen, CN, NO 2 , C 1 -C 4 -alkyl, C 1 -C 4 -haloalkyl, C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy and C 1 -C 4 -haloalkoxy, preferably H, halogen, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, methyl, ethyl, methoxy, ethoxy, CF 3 , CCl 3 , OCF 3 or OCHF 2 , in particular H or chlorine, and (Case a) R 3 in formula (I) is a radical selected from the group of the radicals possible for R 1 , R 2 and R 4 , preferably H or chlorine, or (Case b) R 3 in formula (I) is chlorine. In the formulae (I) and (II), the radicals alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, and also the corresponding unsaturated and/or substituted radicals, can in each case be straight-chain or branched in the carbon skeleton. Unless specifically defined, the lower carbon skeletons, for example those having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and 2 to 4 carbon atoms in the case of unsaturated groups, are preferred for these radicals. Alkyl radicals, also in composite meanings, such as alkoxy, haloalkyl and the like, are, for example, methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl, n-, i-, t- or 2-butyl, pentyls, hexyls, such as n-hexyl, i-hexyl and 1,3-dimethylbutyl, heptyls, such as n-heptyls, 1-methylhexyl and 1,4-dimethylpentyl. Halogen is, for example, fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, haloalkyl, -alkenyl and -alkynyl are alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl, respectively, which are partially or fully substituted by halogen, preferably by fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine, in particular by fluorine or chlorine, for example CF 3 , CHF 2 , CH 2 F, CF 3 CF 2 , CH 2 FCHCl 2 , CCl 3 , CHCl 2 , CH 2 CH 2 Cl; haloalkoxy is, for example, OCF 3 , OCHF 2 , OCH 2 F, CF 3 CF 2 O, OCH 2 CF 3 and OCH 2 CH 2 Cl; this applies correspondingly to haloalkenyl and other halogen-substituted radicals. Aryl is a monocyclic, carbocyclic aromatic ring which, in the substituted case, also includes a bi- or polycyclic aromatic system, which contains at least one aromatic ring and optionally further aromatic rings or partially unsaturated or saturated rings; aryl is, for example, phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, indenyl, indanyl, pentalenyl, fluorenyl and the like, preferably phenyl. Aryloxy is preferably an oxy radical which corresponds to the abovementioned aryl radical, in particular phenoxy. Substituted radicals, such as substituted alkyl, aryl, phenyl or phenoxy, are, for example, substituted radicals which are derived from the unsubstituted parent compound, the substituents being, for example, one or more, preferably 1, 2 or 3, radicals selected from the group consisting of halogen, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, alkylthio, hydroxyl, amino, nitro, cyano, azido, alkoxycarbonyl, alkylcarbonyl, formyl, carbamoyl, mono- and dialkylaminocarbonyl, substituted amino, such as acylamino, mono- or dialkylamino, and alkylsulfinyl, haloalkylsulfinyl, alkylsulfonyl, haloalkyl sulfonyl and, in the case of cyclic radicals, also alkyl and haloalkyl. Preferred radicals having carbon atoms are those having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, in particular 1 or 2 carbon atoms. Preference is usually given to substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, for example fluorine and chlorine, C 1 -C 4 -alkyl, preferably methyl or ethyl, C 1 -C 4 -haloalkyl, preferably trifluoromethyl, C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy, preferably methoxy or ethoxy, C 1 -C 4 -haloalkoxy, nitro and cyano. Particular preference here is given to the substituents methyl, methoxy and chlorine. The starting materials, benzoxazoles of the formula (II), can be prepared in a known manner or analogously to known processes. Benzoxazoles are obtained, for example, by reacting 2-aminophenols with orthoformic esters or with formic acid or formamide (Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, Vol. E8a). Solvents which are suitable for the chlorination reaction are organic or inorganic solvents which are inert under the reaction conditions or participate in the reaction in a suitable manner, like those which are customarily used in halogenation reactions, or mixtures thereof. In specific cases, it is also possible to employ the reaction components as solvents. Examples of suitable organic solvents are aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene and paraffins, halogenated aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, for example chlorinated alkanes and alkenes, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, nitrites, such as acetonitrile, carboxylic acids and derivatives thereof, such as acetic acid or esters thereof. Examples of suitable inorganic solvents are phosphorus oxychloride or SOCl 2 , which are additionally also suitable for use as chlorinating agents. In an advantageous manner, it is also possible to carry out the reaction neat, i.e. in the melt of the starting material (II) or in the melt of the product (I), or in mixtures thereof. Suitable catalysts are acidic substances or mixtures thereof, for example mineral acids or acidic salts thereof; acidic ion exchangers; zeolites (H form); other acidic minerals, such as montmorillonite, or Lewis acids, for example salts of transition metals, such as FeHal 3 , AlHal 3 , Sb 2 Hal 5 , ZnHal 2 , SnHal 2 , SnHal 4 , TiHal 4 , CuHal, CuHal 2 , and the like; Hal is in each case a halogen selected from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, preferably chlorine, bromine or iodine, in particular chlorine. Preference is given to using iron (III) chloride, aluminum trichloride or montmorillonite, in particular FeCl 3 or AlCl 3 . The amount of catalyst can be varied within a wide range. The optimum amount of catalyst depends on the individual catalyst and is, for example, from 0.05 to 10 mol percent, preferably from 0.1 to 3 mol percent, of catalyst, based on the amount of compound of the formula (II) employed. Depending on the solvent, the specific compounds of the formula (I) and (II), the catalysts and the chlorinating agent, the temperatures at which the reactions can be carried out can be varied within a wide range; suitable reaction temperatures are usually in the range of from 20 to 200 C. Depending on whether monochlorination or dichlorination is intended or whether polychlorination side reactions are possible, the reaction temperature should be chosen appropriately and, if required, be optimized in preliminary experiments. The temperature is preferably in a range of from 60 to 150 C., in particular from 80 to 140 C. Suitable chlorinating agents are, in general, all agents which can be used for chlorinating organic compounds, or mixtures or combinations thereof. Suitable chlorinating agents are, for example, chlorine, SO 2 Cl 2 , PCl 3 , PCl 5 , POCl 3 , SCl 2 , S 2 Cl 2 , SOCl 2 . It is also possible to use mixtures of these or with other chlorinating agents. Preference is given to introducing gaseous chlorine or using POCl 3 , PCl 5 or SOCl 2 as chlorinating agents. Furthermore, preference is given to using a combination of PCl 3 and chlorine or PCl 5 and chlorine which generates PCl 5 in situ. To this end, for example, PCl 3 or PCl 5 is employed in substoichiometric amounts (in this case it is also referred to as cochlorinating agent), for example in an amount of from 0.5 to 20 mol percent, preferably 1-10 mol percent, based on the compound of the formula (II), and the remainder of chlorinating agent is introduced in the form of chlorine gas. The amount of chlorinating agent employed is advantageously equimolar or a slight excess, preferably of from 1.0 to 1.8 mol or else 1.0 to 1.2 mol of chlorinating agent per mole of the compound of the formula (II) for monochlorination (case a), or two times the molar amount or else slightly more than two times the molar amount, preferably from 2.0 to 2.4 mol of chlorinating agent per mole of the compound of the formula (II) for dichlorination (case b). The amounts of chlorinating agent are to be reduced appropriately if the agent generates more than one molar equivalent of chlorine per mole of the agent. The synthesis is preferably carried out by initially charging the starting material (benzoxazole derivative of the formula (II)) in the melt or in the melt of the product or in a suitable solvent and adding the catalyst. If appropriate, the cochlorinating agent, such as PCl 3 or PCl 5 , is then added. At the desired temperature and with efficient stirring, chlorine is then introduced slowly, or another chlorinating agent is metered in. A considerably higher rate of conversion can be achieved by carrying out the reaction in a reactor which operates by the countercurrent principle. The desired products are obtained selectively, in high purity and in very high yields. Very pure products can be obtained, for example, by fine distillation. The experiments are illustrated in more detail by the examples below, without the invention being limited to these embodiments; unless stated otherwise, quantities are based on weight. EXAMPLE 1 In a stirred flask fitted with gas inlet tube and dry-ice cooler, 20 g (0.1302 mol) of 6-chlorobenzoxazole and 50 ml of chlorobenzene were, after addition of 0.1 g of iron (III) chloride (FeCl 3 ), heated to 100 C. With efficient stirring, a total of 11.0 g (0.155 mol) of chlorine gas was introduced slowly under the surface of the liquid over a period of approximately 4 hours. The progress of the reaction was monitored by gas chromatography (GC analysis). After the starting material had been consumed, the batch was allowed to cool. According to GC analysis, 95% of the starting material was converted into 2,6-dichlorobenzoxazole. After stripping off the solvent, the crude product could be distilled under reduced pressure. This gave 23.07 g (0.122 mol) of 2,6-dichlorobenzoxazole, purity by GC: 99.5%93.8% of theory. EXAMPLE 2 Using the method of Example 1, 11.9 g (0.1 mol) of 1,3-benzoxazole were reacted under the same conditions to give 2-chlorobenzoxazole. This gave 14.35 g of 2-chlorobenzoxazole; GC: 99% purea yield of 92.5% of theory. EXAMPLE 3 Using the method of Example 1, 11.9 g (0.1 mol) of benzoxazole were reacted, with addition of 0.5 g of montmorillonite KSF, with chlorine gas at 100 C. After addition of 1.1 times the molar amount of chlorine gas, GC showed complete conversion into 2-chlorobenzoxazole. Further introduction of chlorine gas (an additional 1.0 times the molar amount) at 120-125 C. resulted in 80.6% conversion into 2,6-dichlorobenzoxazole. EXAMPLE 4 10 g (0.065 mol) of 6-chlorobenzoxazole (99% pure) were dissolved in 70 ml of phosphorus oxychloride and admixed with 0.26 g of dry aluminum trichloride. The mixture was heated to 90 C., chlorine gas was then introduced, with efficient stirring, under the surface of the liquid, and the progress of the reaction was monitored by gas chromatography (GC analysis). After approximately 6 hours, the starting material had been consumed. The batch was cooled and the reaction mixture was transferred into a distillation apparatus fitted with a short Vigreux column. Excess POCl 3 was separated off in a forerun. A fraction of pure 2,6-dichlorobenzoxazole was subsequently distilled off under reduced pressure. This gave 11.6 g of 2,6-dichlorobenzoxazole having a purity by GC of more than 99%; this corresponds to a yield of more than 94% of theory. EXAMPLE 5 10 g (0.065 mol) of 6-chlorobenzoxazole (99% pure) and 100 ml of chlorobenzene, together with 13.54 g (0.065 mol) of phosphorus pentachloride and 0.05 g of iron (III) chloride (dry), were heated with stirring to 130-133 C. After approximately 6 hours, the reaction had ended. The reaction mixture was cooled and filtered through a layer of silica gel 60. Elution with methylene chloride and stripping off of the low-boilers gives a product which solidifies in the cold and which, according to GC, contains no other components; yield 12.25 g of 2,6-dichlorobenzoxazole (100% of theory). EXAMPLE 6 With efficient stirring, 10 g (0.083 mol) of 1,3-benzoxazole (99% pure), together with 100 ml of POCl 3 and 0.2 g of iron (III) chloride (dry), were heated to 100 C. At this temperature, chlorine gas was introduced under the surface of the liquid. GC control of the reaction showed that initially 2-chlorobenzoxazole was formed which, with further substitution, then reacted to give 2,6-dichlorobenzoxazole. Once all of the starting material had been consumed, the reaction was terminated. According to GC analysis, 21.5% of 2-chlorobenzoxazole and 71% of 2,6-dichlorobenzoxazol had been formed. The crude mixture was worked up by distillation. POCl 3 and 2-chlorobenzoxazole were collected in a first fraction and could be employed directly for a further batch. The second fraction yielded 11.0 g of 2,6-dichlorobenzoxazole (GC99% pure) (70% of theory). Taking into account the recycling of the 2-chlorobenzoxazole, a total yield of 92% of theory was obtained. EXAMPLE 7 10 g (0.065 mol) of 6-chlorobenzoxazole, 0.45 g of phosphorus trichloride and 0.09 g of anhydrous aluminum trichloride were initially charged in 30 ml of phosphorus oxychloride (POCl 3 ). With heating and stirring, chlorine gas was introduced at a rate of 0.6 equivalent of chlorine per hour. After an internal temperature of 80 C. had been reached, the stream of chlorine gas was reduced to 0.6 equivalent of chlorine per 6 hours, and the temperature was increased to 100 C. The reaction was monitored by gas chromatography. After all of the starting material had been consumed, most of the POCl 3 was distilled off and the residue was subjected to fractional distillation under reduced pressure. This gave a pure fraction of 11.9 g of the 2,6-dichlorobenzoxazole, which solidifies on cooling (GC99% pure) (97% of theory). What is claimed is: 1.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to optically active binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivatives, optically active binaphthol monophosphate derivatives and their use. The optically active binaphthol monophosphate acid derivatives of the present invention are important as in intermediates for synthesis of various catalysts for asymmetric synthesis, and the binaphthol monophosphate derivatives derived therefrom have high reactivity in various asymmetric synthetic reactions and provide reaction products having a high optical purity. Pyran compounds obtained by the method of the present invention are useful compounds as intermediates for synthesis of pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals. 2. Discussion of Background The binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivatives of the present invention and the binaphthol monophosphate derivatives derived therefrom, have not been conventionally known, and they are novel compounds. As one example of reactions to which the catalyst for asymmetric synthesis of the present invention is applicable, Diels-Alder cyclization reaction will be explained below. As the Diels-Alder cyclization reaction, many reactions of a diene with an olefin in the presence or absence of a Lewis acid catalyst such as aluminum chloride, have been known for a long time. As an asymmetric Diels-Alder cyclization reaction, e.g. a reaction of acryl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one with cyclopentadiene has been known (Shu Kobayashi et al, J. Org. Chem., 1994, 59, 3758). As an asymmetric hetero Diels-Alder cyclization reaction, e.g. a reaction of a benzaldehyde with a diene has been known (Hisashi Yamamoto et al, J. Am. Chem. 1988, 110, 310). However, with respect to the conventional asymmetric Diels-Alder cyclization reactions and asymmetric hetero Diels-Alder cyclization reactions, the reaction temperature is as low as at most 20 C. in all known reactions, whereby these reactions are not satisfactory as an industrial production method, although a reaction product having a high optical purity may be obtained in some of these reactions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been made to overcome the above object, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel binaphthol monophosphate derivative useful as a catalyst for asymmetric synthesis which can be used under more practical reaction conditions and which provides a high optical purity, and its intermediate binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative. The present inventors have conducted extensive studies to develop a catalyst for asymmetric synthesis which can be used under more practical reaction conditions and which provides a high optical purity, and as a result, they have found a binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative of the following formula (1) or (2): wherein each of R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 which are independent of one another, is hydrogen, a C 1-20 linear or branched alkyl group, a C 2-20 linear or branched alkenyl group, a C 2-20 linear or branched alkynyl group, a phenyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 1-10 linear or branched alkyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 2-10 linear or branched alkenyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 2-10 linear or branched alkynyl group, a naphthyl group or a C 3-8 cycloalkyl group, provided that R 1 to R 4 are not simultaneously hydrogen; and a novel binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative of the following formula (3) or (4) derived from a known compound: wherein each of R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 which are independent of one another, is hydrogen, a C 1-20 linear or branched alkyl group, a C 1-20 linear or branched alkenyl group, a C 2-20 linear or branched alkynyl group, a phenyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 1-10 linear or branched alkyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 2-10 linear or branched alkenyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 2-10 linear or branched alkynyl group, a naphthyl group or a C 3-8 cycloalkyl group. Further, they have found a binaphthol monophosphate derivative of the following formula (5), (6), (7) or (8): wherein each of R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 which are independent of one another, is hydrogen, a C 1-20 linear or branched alkyl group, a C 2-20 linear or branched alkenyl group, a C 2-20 linear or branched alkynyl group, a phenyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 1-10 linear or branched alkyl group, a a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to to 4-carbon atom by a C 2-10 linear or branched alkenyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 2-10 linear or branched alkynyl group, a naphthyl group or a C 3-8 cycloalkyl group, provided that R 1 to R 4 are not simultaneously hydrogen, and M is a metal element capable of forming a trivalent metal ion, wherein each of R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 which are independent of one another, is hydrogen, a C 1-20 linear or branched alkyl group, a C 2-20 linear or branched alkenyl group, a C 2-20 linear or branched alkynyl group, a phenyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 1-10 linear or branched alkyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 2-10 linear or branched alkenyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 2-10 linear or branched alkynyl group, a naphthyl group or a C 3-8 cycloalkyl group, and M is a metal element capable of forming a trivalent metal ion; which is useful as a catalyst for asymmetric synthesis, and which is derived from the compound of the above formula (1), (2), (3) or (4).

Further, such phosphates include one having from 0 to 10 molecules of water of crystallization when isolated as a crystal, and one in the form of a resin containing from 0 to 10 mol of water. The catalyst of the present invention is a Lewis acid catalyst, and thus it can be applied to any conventional reaction using a Lewis acid, and it can induce asymmetry. Specific examples of such a reaction include asymmetric Diels-Alder cyclization reaction, asymmetric hetero Diels-Alder cyclization reaction, asymmetric reduction, asymmetric nitroaldol reaction, asymmetric protonation reaction, asymmetric Michael addition, asymmetric aldol condensation, asymmetric hydrophosphonyl reaction and asymmetric Michael-aldol reaction. However, the reaction is not particularly limited thereto. The optical absolute configuration developed by the reaction using the catalyst for asymmetric synthesis of the present invention, usually depends on the optical absolute configuration of the binaphthol constituting the catalyst for asymmetric synthesis. Namely, in the case where the optical absolute configuration of the asymmetric carbon of the product is (R) configuration when a (R)-binaphthol is used, for example, the optical absolute configuration of the asymmetric carbon of the product is (S) configuration when a (S)-binaphthol as the enantiomer is used. Further, with respect to the optical absolute configuration of the asymmetric carbon of the product, the product does not always have (R) configuration in the case of using a (R)-binaphthol, but the optical absolute configuration of the product may change depending upon the type of the substrate, the type of the binaphthol and the type of the phosphate-forming element. The catalyst of the present invention is prepared by converting the binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative of the present invention to an alkali metal salt of e.g. lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium or cesium, followed by reaction with a halide, sulfate, perchlorate, perbromate, tetrafluoroborate, trifluoromethanesulfonate or pentafluoroethanesulfonate of the salt-forming element. The molar ratio of the binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative to the salt-forming element is theoretically 1 to 3. However, for preparation, the binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative is used in an amount of from 1.01 to 1.2 equivalent amount based on the salt-forming element, the binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative is converted to its phosphate by an alkali metal hydroxide in an amount of from 0.9 to 1.05 times molar amount based on the binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative, followed by reaction with the salt-forming element. When the catalyst of the present invention is used for a reaction, a ligand may be added to the reaction system as the case requires, and specific examples of the ligand include amines such as diethylamine, triethylamine, n-propylamine, di-n-propylamine, tri-n-propylamine, tert-butylamine, di-tert-butylamine, cyclohexylamine, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine, piperidine, 1-methylpiperidine, 2,6-dimethylpiperidine, 1,2,6-trimethylpiperidine, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinepyridine, piperazine, N,N-dimethylpiperazine, aniline, N,N-dimethylaniline, 2-picoline, 2-ethylpiridine, 2,4-lutidine, 2,6-lutidine, 3,5-lutidine, 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine, 2,6-bis(phenylethyl)pyridine, 2,4,6-collidine and chinaldine, phosphine oxides such as triphenylphosphine oxide, tri(2-methylphenyl)phosphine oxide, tri(3-methylphenyl)phosphine oxide, tri(4-methylphenyl)phosphine oxide, methyldiphenylphosphine oxide, methoxymethyl(diphenyl)phosphine oxide, tri-n-butylphosphine oxide, tri-n-octylphosphine oxide and tri(cyclohexyl)phosphine oxide, triamidephosphates such as hexamethyltriamidephosphate and tripiperidinophosphine oxide, and 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone and 2,6-lutidine-N-oxide. The ligand may be added in an amount of from 0 to 5 molar amount based on the salt-forming element, as the case requires. When the reaction is carried out by using the catalyst of the present invention, for removal of water in the system, a zeolite such as A type zeolite represented by molecular sieve 3A, 4A or 5A, molecular sieve 13X, Y type zeolite or L type zeolite may be used during the reaction as the case requires.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Enantiopure sulfones, e.g. of the formula R 1 CHXCHR 3 SO 2 R 2 (1), are of interest as synthetic building blocks, for example, as intermediates in the preparation of enantiopure hydroxamic acids which are under investigation as MMP inhibitors, as described in, inter alia, WO-A-9805635. The enantiopure hydroxamic acids may be prepared by resolution of an intermediate; however, resolution processes are inefficient, with a maximum yield 50% of the correct enantiomer being obtainable. For drug manufacture, an asymmetric synthesis which provides a single enantiomer is often more attractive. 3-Substituted 2-sulfonylmethylpropionic acids have been prepared in moderate e.e. (enantiomeric excess), i.e. up to around 80% e.e. in two steps, from the corresponding allyl sulfides, by sequential asymmetric hydrogenation and oxidation at sulfur (DE-A-4233100; Jendralla, Tetrahedron: Asymmetry (1994) 5:1183-1186; Beck et al, Tetrahedron (1994) 50:4691-4698; Jendrella, Proceedings of Chira Tech 97 (The Catalyst Group). The requisite allyl sulfides are normally prepared as E/Z mixtures by a Wittig olefination reaction; subsequent separation of geometric isomers is required to give optimum results in the asymmetric hydrogenation process. For example, (E)-2-tert-butylthiomethyl-3-(1-naphthyl)acrylic acid was hydrogenated in methanol using a catalyst prepared from (S)-()-BINAP, benzeneruthenium (II) chloride dimer and NaOAc at 150 C. and 13800 kPa (2000 psi), followed by peracid oxidation to give (S)-3-tert-butylsulfonyl-2-(1-naphthylmethyl)propionic acid. Similar results were achieved via hydrogenation of the corresponding cyclohexylamine salt form. To access (S)-3-tert-butylsulfonyl-2-(1-naphthylmethyl)propionic acid in 99% e.e. required additional processing, with concomitant loss of yield, by crystallisation of diastereomeric salts formed with (R)-1-phenylethylamine. Homogeneous diastereoselective hydrogenation of (-hydroxyalkyl)vinyl sulfones of formula 3 with an achiral Rh catalyst is known (Ando el al, J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. (1992) 592), giving hydrogenated material in high d.e. This reaction was elaborated by carrying out a kinetic resolution of an (-hydroxalkyl)vinyl sulfone using (S,S)-dipamp Rh. The starting (-hydroxyalkyl)vinyl sulfone was recovered in 76% e.e. at 50% substrate conversion and 89% e.e. at 57% conversion. The authors indicated that diasteroselectivity is controlled predominantly by coordination of the catalyst to the -OH group at the chiral center of the substrated. However, the products have limited utility as synthetic intermediates. This directing group effect may be akin to that required in asymmetric hydrogenation of other substrate classes. For example, the preparation of -amino acids by asymmetric hydrogenation of enamides requires a group such as acetyl (Ac) on the nitrogen, which then has to be removed carefully under conditions giving minimal racemisation at the newly created chiral centre. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention is based on the surprising discovery that prochiral vinyl sulphones of formula (2) can be hydrogenated with high enantioselectivity, in the presence of a chiral catalyst, to give enantioenriched or enantiopure sulfones of formula (1) By contrast to the disclosure of Ando et al, no OH group is required as a directing group in the -position with respect to the sulfone (i.e. as in compound (3) above); the vinyl sulfones (2) are prochiral. The reaction does not require elevated temperature or pressure to achieve good chemical conversion and high enanthioselectivity. Typically, this hydrogenation can be carried out at low to moderate pressure, e.g. 7-4140 kPa (1-600 psi) and low temperatures, e.g. 0 to 60 C. The desired sulfone product (1) is produced directly, without the need for subsequent oxidation at sulfur. In addition, the coordinating group X present in (1) provides versatile functionality for further synthetic transformations, e.g. to prepare biologically active compounds such as those described in WO-A-9805635. The sulfone group itself also facilitates a wide range of reactions, such as those reviewed by Simpkins Sulfones in Organic Synthesis, pub. Pergamon (1993). The process of the subject invention may additionally comprise converting the group X to give an enantiopure compound having therapeutic utility as an inhibitior of matrix metalloproteinases. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In formulae (1) and (2): R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are each any hydrocarbon group of less than 20 carbon atoms, optionally substituted at any position; in addition, either of R 1 and R 3 may be H. The nature of any substituent is not critical to the generality of the procedure. X will not normally be removable; it is a co-ordinating group including, but not restricted to, CO 2 H or a salt form thereof, CO 2 R, CONHOH, CONH 2 , CONHR, CONR 2 etc. The substrate (1) for hydrogenation may be in the form of a single geometric isomer, e.g. E, wherein R 2 SO 2 and X groups are trans. However, this is not always necessary, since certain hydrogenation catalysts allow the enantioconvergent reaction of E/Z mixtures. The complex which comprises the hydrogenation catalyst is made up of a transition metal, preferably rhodium, ruthenium or iridium, and a chiral ligand, preferably mono or diphosphines. Rhodium is especially preferred as the metal. Cyclic phosphines are preferred, especially those incorporating a trans-2,5-disubstituted phospholane moiety (4) or its antipode, wherein R 4 is a hydrocarbon substituent of up to 20 C atoms, typically C 1-10 linear or branched alkyl. Known examples of such phosphines are those in the DuPHOS (U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,892) and BPE (U.S. Pat. No. 5,008,457) series. Known examples of the catalysts include (S,S)-EtDuPHOS Rh (COD)BF 4 , (R,R)-MeDuPHOS Rh (COD)BF 4 , (S,S)-iPrDuPHOS Rh (COD)BF 4 , and (R,R)-MeBPE Rh (COD)BF 4 . Both enantiomers of these catalysts are available with equal facility, and therefore either enantiomer of the sulphone (2) can be obtained by the asymmetric hydrogenation. Alternative catalyst complexes, of the phosphetane type, are described in WO-A-9802445. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, vinyl sulfone (2a) 2: R 1 is Pr, R 2 is 4-o-methoxybenzyl, R 3 is H and X is CO 2 H was hydrogenated using (S,S)-EtDuPHOS Rh (COD)BF 4 in methanol at 1035 kPa (150 psi) hydrogen at room temperature for 2 hours, after which time complete substrate conversion was observed. Chiral HPLC showed that the hydrogenated sulfone (1a) variable defined as for 2a had an e.e. of 96%. Asymmetric hydrogenation of analogues of (2a), bearing additional functionality in the R 1 substituent, was similarly successful. The vinyl sulfones (starting materials) for the process of the invention may be conveniently prepared using a modified version of the procedure described by Najera et al (J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. I (1988) 1029-1032) and in EP-A-0644176. The following reaction scheme applies: A compound of formula (5) where R 1 and R 3 are defined as for formula (2) is reacted with sulfonyl iodide of formula R 2 SO 2 I where R 2 defined as for formula (2), in a solvent such as DCM, and then the reaction mixture is treated with a base such as triethylamine to eliminate hydrogen iodide and yield a vinyl sulfone of formula (2). When X is electron-withdrawing, e.g. CO 2 H, and R 3 is H, the reaction is stereoselective and the stereochemistry of the resultant vinyl sulfones is E (trans) (Najera et al, supra). Formation of a single geometric isomer, rather than an E/Z mixture, facilitates straightforward purification by crystallisation. The sulfonyl iodide may be prepared from the respective sodium sulfinic acid sodium salt (R 2 SO 2 Na) by shaking an aqueous solution of the latter with a solution of iodine in dichloromethane (DCM). Using this procedure, the sulfonyl iodide is extracted cleanly into the DCM layer which is subsequently dried and then used immediately in the above reaction.

The present invention relates to diisocyanates containing hydantoin groups, a process for their preparation, polyurethanes in which diisocyanates containing hydantoin groups are present and the use of these polyurethanes for producing fibers, films, foams, molding compositions, coatings and surface coating compositions as well as fibers, films, foams, molding compositions, coatings and surface coating compositions comprising such a polyurethane. Polyurethanes are formed by reaction of polyisocyanates with polyols. Owing to the wide variety of possible reactions of the isocyanate group and its high reactivity, the polyisocyanates are used for producing foams, fibers, films, surface coating compositions and paints. For example, rigid polyurethane foams can be used for filling hollow spaces of refrigeration appliances or heating elements with foam since they have a low thermal conductivity. Selection of the raw materials enables the properties of the rigid foams to be varied within a wide range. A summary overview of polyurethanes, their preparation and their use is described in Becker/Braun, Kunststoff Handbuch, Volume 7, Polyurethane, 3rd edition, 1993, Carl Hanser Verlag. EP-A 0 744 419, 0 744 424, 0 744 425 and 0 744 427 disclose a process for synthesizing hydantoin-containing polyurethane prepolymers. All these processes have in common the fact that the hydantoin groups are formed in the prepolymer by a ring-closing condensation reaction which occurs at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, in this process, the hydantoin groups are only formed on prepolymers whose isocyanate groups are blocked by means of a protective group. The protective group technique disclosed in these publications is disadvantageous, since it requires additional synthetic steps on the route to the finished polyurethane. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for synthesizing prepolymers and polyurethanes containing hydantoin groups and also corresponding prepolymers and polyurethanes, where the synthetic step for introducing and removing appropriate protective groups can be dispensed with. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process for synthesizing prepolymers and polyurethanes containing hydantoin groups, in which process the prepolymer or polyurethane containing hydantoin groups is formed and a flame retardant is simultaneously formed, and also to provide the corresponding prepolymers and polyurethanes. We have found that this object is achieved by a diisocyanate of the formula (I) where R 1 is a C 1 -C 10 -hydrocarbon radical and R 3 is a C 1 -C 12 -hydrocarbon group and n is an integer from 1 to 10. R 1 is preferably a C 1 -C 6 -alkyl radical, in particular a methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl radical, or an aryl radical, particularly preferably a phenyl radical. R 3 is preferably an alkylene group having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, a cycloalkylene group having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms or an arylene group having from 7 to 12 carbon atoms, in particular an unbranched alkylene group having from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, particularly preferably 6 carbon atoms, which at the ends is located next to the isocyanate group. The object is also achieved by a process for preparing diisocyanates, in particular of the formula (I), in which phospholenes of the formula (II), where R 1 is as defined above and R 2 is a C 1 -C 10 -hydrocarbon group, are reacted with diisocyanates of the formula (III), where R 3 is as defined above, forming a phosphate of the formula (IV). Here, R 1 and R 2 can be identical or different. Furthermore, it has surprisingly been found that both the diisocyanates of the formula (I) containing hydantoin groups and the polyurethanes obtained therefrom are significantly more thermally stable than the hydantoin-containing diisocyanates and polyurethanes described in the prior art. As organic diisocyanates of the formula (III), it is possible to use all known suitable aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic compounds having more than one isocyanate group. Preferred organic diisocyanates are straight-chain or branched alkylene diisocyanates having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, e.g. dodecane 1,12-diisocyanate, 2-ethylbutylene 1,4-diisocyanate, 2-methylpentylene 1,5-diisocyanate, butylene 1,4-diisocyanate, hexamethylene 1,6-diisocyanate (HDI); cycloaliphatic diisocyanates having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, e.g. cyclohexyl 1,3-diisocyanate, cyclohexyl 1,4-diisocyanate, 1-isocyanato-3,3,5-trimethyl-5-iso-cyanatomethylcyclohexane (IPDI), hexahydrotolylene 2,4- and 2,6-diisocyanate and the corresponding isomer mixtures, dicyclohexylmethane 4,4- , 2,2- and 2,4-diisocyanate and also the corresponding isomers mixtures and aromatic diisocyanates having from 7 to 12 carbon atoms, e.g. tolylene 2,4- and 2,6-diisocyanate (TDI) and their isomer mixtures, diphenylmethane 4,4-, 2,2- and 2,4-diisocyanate (MDI) and also their isomer mixtures, mixtures of diphenylmethane 4,4-, 2,2-diisocyanates, polyphenylpolymethylene polyisocyanates (polymeric MDI), mixtures of diphenylmethane 4,4-, 2,2- and 2,4-diisocyanates and polyphenylpolymethylene polyisocyanates (crude MDI) and mixtures of crude MDI and tolylene diisocyanates. Preference is given to using hexamethylene 1,6-diisocyanate (HDI), tolylene 2,4- and 2,6-diisocyanate (TDI) and their isomer mixtures, mixtures of diphenylmethane 4,4-, 2,2-diisocyanates (MDI) and polyphenylpolymethylene polyisocyanates (polymeric MDI). In a further embodiment of the process of the present invention, the phosphate of the formula (IV) formed in the reaction is removed at least partially, preferably completely, from the reaction mixture. Furthermore, in the reaction of the phospholenes of the formula (II) with the diisocyanates of the formula (III) in the process of the present invention, the diisocyanates of the formula (III) are preferably used in excess, particularly preferably at least in a two-fold excess. This reaction forms a composition which comprises at least one diisocyanate of the formula (I), a diisocyanate of the formula (III) and possibly a phosphate of the formula (IV). The amount of the flame-retardant phosphate of the formula (IV) present in the composition depends on the extent to which the phosphate of the formula (IV) has, as described above, been removed from the composition; the flame-retardant effect of the phosphate of the formula (IV) increases as the proportion present in the composition rises. The proportion of the flame-retardant phosphate of the formula (IV) in the overall composition is selected such that the amount of phosphate of the formula (IV) present in the polyurethane formed as end product is sufficient to ensure a satisfactory flame-retardant effect. The proportion of the phosphate of the formula (I) is from 0.1 to 25% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 7% by weight, based on the total polyurethane and particularly preferably based on the A component of the polyurethane. In addition, the viscosity of the composition can be controlled via the proportion of the phosphate of the formula (IV). In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the ratios of (a) to (b) and to the diisocyanate of the formula (I) are from 1:1:1 to 6:1:1 and preferably from 1:1:1 to 4:1:1. According to the present invention, particular preference is given to varying the viscosity of the not yet cured polyurethane or the polyurethane component by means of the phosphate of the formula (IV). This is particularly advantageous when the polyurethane is used for filling, preferably filling with foam, shapes having a complicated structure. The control of the viscosity in the direction of easy-flowing liquids is achieved by increasing the proportion of the phosphate of the formula (IV) in the not yet polymerized polyurethane or in the polyurethane components. In a preferred embodiment, the proportion of the phosphate of the formula (IV) in all components used except for component (a) is from 0.5 to 30% by weight, preferably from 3 to 20% by weight. The viscosity of the components used for the polyurethane synthesis, apart from component (a), is from 200 to 10,000 mPas, preferably from 600 to 3000 mPas, at 20 C. Furthermore, according to the present invention, a polyurethane is obtainable from at least the constituents: at least one diisocyanate of the formula (I) or a composition comprising at least one diisocyanate of the formula (I), a diisocyanate of the formula (III) or a mixture thereof as organic polyisocyanate (a) and at least one diol as organic compound containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms (b). The constituent (b) is preferably an acrylate resin containing at least two hydroxyl groups per molecule and having a weight average molecular weight (M w ) of from 300 to 20,000 g/mol, preferably from 10,000 to 15,000 g/mol and particularly preferably from 2000 to 10,000 g/mol. In the polyurethane of the present invention, the constituent (b) is preferably an acrylate resin, preferably if the urethane of the present invention is used as a readily curable surface coating composition. Furthermore, it is preferred that not only the constituents (a) and (b) but also chain extenders and/or crosslinkers (c) or catalyst (d) or blowing agents (e) or flame retardants (f), auxiliaries and/or additives (g) or a mixture comprising at least two of these constituents are used in the process for producing the polyurethane of the present invention and are thus present in the polyurethane obtainable thereby. In another embodiment of the process of the present invention, the polyurethane of the invention is prepared by reacting organic polyisocyanates (a) with organic compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms (b) and chain extenders and crosslinkers (c). In an embodiment which is also preferred according to the present invention, the polyurethane of the present invention is prepared by reacting organic polyisocyanates (a) with organic compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms (b) and further catalysts (d). In another embodiment of the process of the present invention for preparing the polyurethane of the present invention, organic polyisocyanates (a) are reacted with organic compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms (b) and chain extenders and crosslinkers (c) and catalysts (d). A further embodiment of the process of the present invention for preparing polyurethanes is distinguished by the organic polyisocyanates (a) being reacted with the organic compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms (b) and blowing agents (e). In a further embodiment of the process of the present invention, the organic polyisocyanates (a) are reacted with the organic compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms (b) and with chain extenders and crosslinkers (c) and also catalysts (d) for preparing the polyurethanes of the present invention. In a further embodiment of the process of the present invention, the polyurethanes of the present invention are prepared by reacting organic polyisocyanates (a) with organic compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms (b) and also flame retardants (f). In another embodiment of the process of the present invention, the polyurethanes of the present invention are prepared by reacting organic polyisocyanates (a) with organic compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms (b), chain extenders and crosslinkers (c) and flame retardants (f). An embodiment of the process of the present invention is also constituted by the polyurethanes of the present invention being prepared by reacting organic polyisocyanates (a) with organic compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms (b) and auxiliaries and/or additives. An additional embodiment of the process of the present invention is constituted by the polyurethane of the present invention being prepared by reacting organic polyisocyanates (a) with compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms (b) and chain extenders and/or crosslinkers (c) and also auxiliaries and/or additives (g). In another embodiment of the process of the present invention, the polyurethane of the present invention is prepared by reacting organic polyisocyanates (a) with organic compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms (b) in the presence of catalysts (d) and blowing agents (e). In another embodiment of the process of the present invention, the polyurethane of the present invention is prepared by reacting polyisocyanates (a) with organic compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms (b) and chain extenders and/or crosslinkers (c) in the presence of catalysts (d) and blowing agents (e). In a further embodiment of the process of the present invention, the polyurethane of the present invention is prepared by reacting organic polyisocyanates (a) and compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms (b) and chain extenders and crosslinkers (c) in the presence of flame retardants (f) and blowing agents (e). In another embodiment of the process of the present invention, the polyurethanes of the present invention are prepared by reacting organic polyisocyanates (a) with organic compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms (b) and, if desired, chain extenders and crosslinkers (c) in the presence of catalysts (d), blowing agents (e), flame retardants (f) and also, if desired, auxiliaries and/or additives (g). All the above embodiments of the process of the present invention for preparing the polyurethanes of the present invention have in common the use of at least one diisocyanate of the formula (I). Furthermore, the component combinations of the above embodiments apply analogously to the polyurethanes and polyurethane compositions obtainable from these processes. The preparation of the phospholene intermediates is described in Ramirez et al., Tetrahedrom 24, 1941, (1968). In an embodiment which is preferred according to the present invention, the phospholenes are obtained by reacting a diketone containing the above-defined radicals R 1 , where the two keto groups are preferably joined directly to one another, preferably diacetyl and benzil, with a phosphite whose oxygen atoms bear the above-described radicals R 2 , preferably trimethyl phosphite, tripropyl phosphite, triphenyl phosphite and particularly preferably triethyl phosphite. The reaction is preferably carried out in a temperature range from 20 to 20 C., preferably from 10 to 10 C. and particularly preferably from 0 to 5 C. It is also preferred for the reaction to be carried out in an inert gas atmosphere, preferably in a nitrogen or argon atmosphere, or a mixture of both and particularly preferably in a nitrogen atmosphere. In the phospholene synthesis, it is also preferred according to the present invention for the product to be held at room temperature for a plurality of hours, preferably from 2 to 30 hours, more preferably from 10 to 20 hours and particularly preferably from 12 to 13 hours, after the reaction is complete. It has also been found to be advantageous to work up the resulting reaction product by distillation. Although the phospholene synthesis can be carried out in any suitable solvent, it has been found to be particularly advantageous to carry out the reaction without additional solvent. The hydantoin-containing diisocyanates of the formula (I) are obtained by reacting a corresponding phospholene of the formula (II) with an isocyanate of the formula (III). The reaction is preferably carried out in a temperature range of from 0 to 80 C., preferably from 20 to 70 C. and particularly preferably from 30 to 50 C. Furthermore, it is advantageous in the process for preparing the hydantoin-containing diisocyanates of the formula (I) to carry out the reaction in a solvent, preferably an aprotic solvent, preferably selected so that its boiling point is within the abovementioned temperature ranges. Particular preference is given to aprotic polar and halogenated solvents, with the halogenated solvents being particularly preferred. Suitable halogenated solvents are, for example, carbon tetrachloride, trichioromethane, dichloromethane, monochloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, trichloroethylene and 1,1,1-trichloroethane, with dichloromethane being particularly preferred. Particular preference is given to carrying out the reaction in dichloromethane at a temperature at which the dichloromethane boils. Preference is also given to carrying out the reaction according to the present invention in an inert gas atmosphere, preferably an atmosphere of argon or nitrogen or a mixture thereof and particularly preferably of nitrogen. Preference is also given to both the phospholene of the formula (II) and the diisocyanate of the formula (III) being taken up in solvents. In addition, preference is given to the diisocyanate of the formula (III) being initially charged in a suitable solvent and the phospholene of the formula (II), likewise taken up in a solvent, being added to the solution of the diisocyanate of the formula (III) over a period of time. Furthermore, it is advantageous in the synthesis of the novel hydantoin-containing diisocyantes of the formula (I) for the reaction to be carried out by heating within the abovementioned temperature range until the component of which a deficiency is present has been completely reacted. After the reaction is complete, the solvent or solvents is/are preferably removed by distillation and the reaction product is likewise worked up by distillation, with a vacuum distillation, preferably in the range from 1 to 20 torr, being advantageous. According to the present invention, preference is also given to mixing the hydantoin-containing diisocyanates of the formula (I) with further isocyanates such as polyisocyanates and diisocyanates, preferably diisocyanates, as are to be found in the listing of the polyisocyanates (a). However, particular preference is given to mixtures with diisocyanates referred to in the following as standard diisocyanates, with diarylalkyl diisocyanates, preferably diphenylmethane diisocyanate and particularly preferably diphenylmethane 4,4-diisocyanate (MDI), and polymeric diarylalkyl diisocyanates, preferably diphenylmethane diisocyanate and particularly preferably diphenylmethane 4,4-diisocyanate (polymeric MDI), being preferred. According to the present invention, preference is given to using a mixture of a two-ring MDI with polymeric diisocyanates containing a higher number of rings. This mixture preferably has a viscosity in the range from 50 to 3000 mPs, more preferably from 90 to 2500 mPas, at 25 C. Preference is also given to this mixture having an NCO content of 30-34% by weight. Furthermore, it is preferred according to the present invention that the monomeric MDI content is from 10 to 80 and preferably from 20 to 60% by volume of the total MDI mixture. The novel hydantoin-containing diisocyanates of the formula (I), and also their mixtures with other isocyanates, can be used for preparing polyurethanes which can in turn be used for producing fibers, films, foams, molding compositions, coatings and surface coating compositions. Particularly preferably, a rigid polyurethane foam is produced from at least one hydantoin-containing diisocyanate of the formula (I) or at least one of the abovementioned mixtures together with at least one polyol. The polyurethanes and in particular the rigid polyurethane foams are produced, after good mixing of the components, in a temperature range of from 10 to 70 C., preferably from 20 to 60 C., and particularly preferably from 35 to 55 C. The rigid polyurethane foams are particularly preferably produced in a mold which is configured as the negative of the rigid foam body resulting from polyurethane formation. The moldings obtained from the rigid polyurethane foams preferably have a density of from 50 to 90 kg/m 3 , preferably from 60 to 80 kg/m 3 and particularly preferably from 65 to 75 kg/m 3 . The time to removal from the mold is preferably from 10 to 60 minutes, more preferably from 20 to 40 minutes and particularly preferably from 25 to 35 minutes. The novel hydantoin-containing diisocyanate of the formula (I), in particular the diisocyanates of the formula (I) in which the radical R 3 is a C 1 -Cl 2 -, preferably C 4 -C 8 - and particularly preferably C 5 -C 6 -alkylene which is preferably unbranched, can be reacted with appropriate hydroxyl-containing acrylate resins to produce surface coating compositions. A hydantoin-containing diisocyanate of the formula (I) which is derived from hexamethylene 1,6-diisocyanate as diisocyanate of the formula (III) has been found to be particularly useful for the synthesis of surface coating compositions. Suitable hydroxyl-containing acrylate resins are, in particular, those having a weight average molecular weight in a range from 2000 to 20,000 g/mol, preferably from 3000 to 10,000 g/mol and particularly preferably from 5000 to 7000 g/mol. Furthermore, the suitable acrylate resins preferably have an OH number in the range from 50 to 200, more preferably from 70 to 150 and particularly preferably from 80 to 140. Pigments, preferably TiO 2 as white pigment, can be used in the polyurethanes, rigid polyurethane foams and polyurethane-based surface coating compositions of the present invention, preferably the polyurethane-based surface coating composition. The novel diisocyanate of the formula (I) also has the effect of making the polyisocyanate component (a) comprising it more fluid than one without it. For this reason, preferably in the case of surface coating compositions, preferably those comprising a hydroxyl-containing acrylate resin, which have as one constituent a mixture of the diisocyanate of the formula (I) and the component (a), the same viscosity can be achieved using a smaller amount of solvent than is possible without the diisocyanate of the formula (I). Furthermore, the presence of the diisocyanate of the formula (1) enables the elasticity of the abovementioned surface coating compositions to be improved relative to comparable surface coating compositions made up of conventional constituents. The constituents or components (a) to (g) are described by way of example below. Polyisocyanates (a) Organic polyisocyanates used are preferably the aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and particularly preferably aromatic polyfunctional isocyanates known per se. In one embodiment of the present invention, particular preference is given to polyisocyanates containing two isocyanate groups if such polyisocyanates are not to have a crosslinking action. However, if a crosslinking action of the polyisocyanates is preferred, polyisocyanates containing more than two isocyanate groups are employed in another embodiment of the present invention. Particularly preferred organic polyisocyanates (a) are, for example, alkylene diisocyanates having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms in the alkylene radical, e.g. dodecane 1,12-diisocyanate, 2-ethyltetramethylene 1,4-diisocyanate, 2-methylpentamethylene 1,5-diisocyanate, tetramethylene 1,4-diisocyanate and preferably hexamethylene 1,6-diisocyanate; cycloaliphatic diisocyanates such as cyclohexane 1,3- and 1,4-diisocyanate and also any mixtures of these isomers, 1-isocyanato3,3,5-trimethyl-5-isocyanatomethylcyclohexane (IPDI), hexahydrotolylene 2,4- and 2,6-diisocyanate and also the corresponding isomer mixtures, dicyclohexylmethane 4,4-, 2,2- and 2,4-diisocyanate and also the corresponding isomer mixtures, and preferably aromatic diisocyanates and polyisocyanates such as tolylene 2,4- and 2,6-diisocyanate and the corresponding isomer mixtures, diphenylmethane 4,4-, 2,4- and 2,2-diisocyanate and the corresponding isomer mixtures, mixtures of diphenylmethane 4,4- and 2,2-diisocyanates, polyphenylpolymethylene polyisocyanates, mixtures of diphenylmethane 4,4-, 2,4- and 2,2-diisocyanates and polyphenylpolymethylene polyisocyanates, for example crude MDI, and mixtures of crude MDI and tolylene diisocyanates. The organic diisocyanates and polyisocyanates can be used individually or in the form of mixtures. As organic polyisocyanates (a), use is frequently also made of modified polyfunctional isocyanates, i.e. products which are obtained by chemical reaction of organic diisocyanates and/or polyisocyanates. Examples of isocyanates of this type are diisocyanates and/or polyisocyanates containing ester, urea, biuret, carbodiimide, isocyanurate and/or urethane groups. Specific examples are: organic, preferably aromatic polyisocyanates containing urethane groups and having an NCO content of from 33.6 to 15% by weight, preferably from 31 to 21% by weight, based on the total weight; for example diphenylmethane 4,4-diisocyanate modified with low molecular weight diols, triols, dialkylene glycols, trialkylene glycols or polyoxyalkylene glycols having molecular weights of up to 6000, in particular up to 1500, modified diphenylmethane 4,4-diisocyanate, modified diphenylmethane 4,4- and 2,4-diisocyanate mixtures or modified crude MDI, with the dialkylene or polyoxyalkylene glycols being able to be used individually or as mixtures. Examples which may be mentioned are: diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene and polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene diols, triols and/or tetrols. According to the present invention, preference is also given to prepolymers containing NCO groups, having NCO contents of from 25 to 3.5% by weight, preferably from 21 to 14% by weight, based on the total weight of the prepolymer, and prepared from the polyester polyols and/or preferably polyether polyols described below and diphenylmethane 4,4-diisocyanate, mixtures of diphenylmethane 2,4- and 4,4-diisocyanate, tolylene 2,4- and/or 2,6-diisocyanates or crude MDI. Also preferred are liquid polyisocyanates containing carbodiimide groups and/or isocyanurate rings and having an NCO content of from 33.6 to 15% by weight, preferably from 31 to 21% by weight, based on the total weight of the polyurethane, for example those based on diphenylmethane 4,4-, 2,4- and/or 2,2-diisocyanate and/or tolylene 2,4- and/or 2,6-diisocyanate. The modified polyisocyanates can be mixed with one another or with unmodified organic polyisocyanates, for example diphenylmethane 2,4- and/or 4,4-diisocyanate, crude MDI, tolylene 2,4- and/or 2,6-diisocyanate. Particular preference is given to the following organic polyisocyanates which have been found to be particularly useful in the preparation of cellular elastomers: Prepolymers containing NCO groups and having an NCO content of from 25 to 9% by weight, based on the prepolymer, in particular those based on polyether polyols or polyester polyols and one or more diphenylmethane diisocyanate isomers, advantageously diphenylmethane 4,4-diisocyanate, and/or modified organic polyisocyanates containing urethane groups and having an NCO content of from 33.6 to 15% by weight, in particular those based on diphenylmethane 4,4-diisocyanate or diphenylmethane diisocyanate isomer mixtures. To produce flexible polyurethane foams as a subgroup of the cellular elastomers, the following have been found to be useful: Mixtures of tolylene 2,4- and 2,6-diisocyanates, mixtures of tolylene diisocyanates and polyphenylpolymethylene polyisocyanate or, in particular, mixtures of the abovementioned prepolymers based on diphenylmethane diisocyanate isomers and crude MDI, preferably polyphenylpolymethylene polyisocyanate having a diphenylmethane diisocyanate isomer content of from 30 to 80% by weight. Compounds Containing at Least two Reactive Hydrogens (b) As organic compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogens (b), preference is given to using the compounds described in more detail above, if desired in admixture with further compounds having a functionality of from 2 to 8, preferably from 2 to 4, and a molecular weight of from 300 to 10,000, preferably from 1000 to 6000. Particular preference is given to, for example, polyetherpolyamines and/or preferably polyols selected from the group consisting of polyether polyols, polyester polyols, polythioether polyols, polyesteramides, hydroxyl-containing polyacetals and hydroxyl-containing aliphatic polycarbonates or mxitures of at least two of the polyols mentioned. Polyester polyols and/or polyether polyols are preferably employed. Suitable polyester polyols can be prepared, for example, from organic dicarboxylic acids having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably aliphatic dicarboxylic acids having from 4 to 6 carbon atoms, and polyhydric alcohols, preferably diols, having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably from 2 to 6 carbon atoms.

The dicarboxylic acids can be used either individually or as mixtures. In place of the free dicarboxylic acids, it is also possible to use the corresponding dicarboxylic acid derivatives, for example dicarboxylic esters of alcohols having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or dicarboxylic anhydrides. Preference is given to using dicarboxylic acid mixtures of succinic, glutaric and adipic acid and in particular adipic acid. Examples of dihydric and polyhydric alcohols, in particular diols, are: ethanediol, diethylene glycol, 1,2- or 1,3-propanediol, dipropylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,10-decanediol, glycerol and trimethylolpropane. Preference is given to using ethanediol, diethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol and 1,6-hexanediol. In the process of the present invention for preparing the polyurethanes, it is also possible to use: polyester polyols derived from lactones, for example -caprolactone, or hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example -hydroxycaproic acid. To prepare the polyester polyols, the organic, for example aromatic and preferably aliphatic, polycarboxylic acids and/or derivatives and polyhydric alcohols can be polycondensed in the absence of catalysts or preferably in the presence of esterification catalysts. The polycondensation is preferably carried out in an atmosphere of inert gas, for example nitrogen, carbon monoxide, helium, argon and others, in the melt at from 150 to 200 C., preferably from 180 to 220 C., at atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure, to a desired acid number. The resulting acid number is advantageously 10, preferably 2. According to a preferred embodiment, the esterification mixture is polycondensed at the abovementioned temperatures to an acid number of from 80 to 30, preferably from 40 to 30, under atmospheric pressure and subsequently under a pressure of 500 mbar, preferably from 50 to 150 mbar. Suitable esterification catalysts are, for example, iron, cadmium, cobalt, lead, zinc, antimony, magnesium, titanium and tin catalysts in the form of metals, metal oxides or metal salts. The polycondensation can, however, also be carried out in the presence of diluents and/or entrainers, for example benzene, toluene, xylene or chlorobenzene, to azeotropically distill off the water of condensation. To prepare the polyester polyols, the organic polycarboxylic acids and/or derivatives and polyhydric alcohols are advantageously polycondensed in a molar ratio of 1:1-1.8, preferably 1:1.05-1.2. The polyester polyols obtained preferably have a functionality of from 2 to 4, in particular from 2 to 3, and a molecular weight of from 480 to 3000, preferably from 1000 to 3000. However, polyols used are preferably polyether polyols which are prepared by known methods, for example by anionic polymerization using alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium or potassium hydroxide or alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide, sodium or potassium ethoxide or potassium isopropoxide as catalysts with addition of at least one initiator molecule containing from 2 to 8, preferably from 2 to 4, reactive hydrogen atoms in bound form. They can also be prepared from one or more alkylene oxides having alkylene radicals containing from 2 to 4 carbon atoms by cationic polymerization using Lewis acids such as antimony pentachloride, boron fluoride etherate, etc., or bleaching earth as catalyst. Examples of suitable alkylene oxides are 1,3-propylene oxide, 1,2- or 2,3-butylene oxide, styrene oxide, THF and preferably ethylene oxide and 1,2-propylene oxide. The alkylene oxides can be used individually, alternately in succession or as mixtures. Suitable initiator molecules are, for example: water, organic dicarboxylic acids such as succinic acid, adipic acid, phthalic acid and terephthalic acid, aliphatic and aromatic, unalkylated, N-monoalkylated, N,N- and N,N-dialkylated diamines having from 1 to 2 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical, for example unalkylated, monoalkylated and dialkylated ethylenediarnine, diethylenetriamine, triethylene-tetramine, 1,3-propylenediamine, 1,3- or 1,4-butylenediamine, 1,2-, 1,3-, 1,4-, 1,5- and 1,6-hexamethylenediamine, phenylenediamine, 2,3-, 2,4- and 2,6-tolylenediamine and 4,4-, 2,4- and 2,2-diaminodiphenylmethane. Further preferred initiator molecules are: alkanolamines such as ethanolamine, N-methylethanolamine and N-ethylethanolamine, dialkanolamines such as diethanolamine, N-methyldiethanolamine and N-ethyldiethanolamine and trialkanolamines such as triethanolamine, and ammonia. Preference is given to using polyhydric, in particular dihydric and/or trihydric alcohols such as ethanediol, 1,2- and 2,3-propanediol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane and pentaerythritol or sugars, preferably beet sugar.

Suitable polyoxytetramethylene glycols have a molecular weight up to about 3500. Further polyether polyols which are useful are, in particular, polymer-modified polyether polyols, preferably graft polyether polyols, in particular those based on styrene and/or acrylonitrile. These can be prepared by in situ polymerization of acrylonitrile, styrene or preferably mixtures of styrene and acrylonitrile, for example in a weight ratio of from 90:10 to 10:90, preferably from 70:30 to 30:70, advantageously using the abovementioned polyether polyols as described in the German Patents 11 11 349, 12 22 669 (U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,304,273, 3,383,351, 3,523,039), 1 152 536 (GB 1 040 452) and 1 152 537 (GB 9 876 618). Also suitable are polyether polyol dispersions comprising as dispersant phases, usually in an amount of from 1 to 50% by weight, preferably from 2 to 25% by weight, e.g. polyureas, polyhydrazides, polyurethanes containing bound tert-amino groups and/or melamine. Such dispersions are described, for example, in EP-B-011 752 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,304,708), U.S. Pat. No. 4,374,209 and DE-A-32 31 497. Like the polyester polyols, the polyether polyols can be used individually or in the form of mixtures. They may also be mixed with the graft polyether polyols or polyester polyols or with the hydroxyl-containing polyester amides, polyacetals, polycarbonates and/or polyetherpolyamines. Suitable hydroxyl-containing polyacetals are, for example, the compounds which can be prepared from glycols such as diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, bis(4-hydroxyethylphenyl)dimethylmethane or hexanediol and formaldehyde. Suitable polyacetals can also be prepared by polymerization of cyclic acetals. Suitable hydroxyl-containing polycarbonates are, in particular, ones which can be prepared, for example, by reacting diols such as 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol and/or 1,6-hexanediol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol or tetraethylene glycol with diaryl carbonates, for example diphenyl carbonate, or phosgene. The preferred polyester amides include, for example, the predominantly linear condensates obtained from polybasic, saturated and/or unsaturated carboxylic acids, for example their anhydrides, or polyfunctional saturated and/or unsaturated aminoalcohols or mixtures of polyfunctional alcohols and aminoalcohols and/or polyamines. Preferred polyetherpolyamines which are suitable according to the present invention can be prepared from the abovementioned polyether polyols by known methods. Examples which may be mentioned are the cyanoalkylation of polyoxyalkylene polyols and subsequent hydrogenation of the nitrile formed (U.S. Pat. No. 3,267,050) or the partial or complete amination of polyoxyalkylene polyols using amines or ammonia in the presence of hydrogen and catalysts (DE 12 15 373).

Chain Extenders and/or Crosslinkers (c) The polyurethanes can be prepared with or without the use of chain extenders and/or crosslinkers. However, the addition of chain extenders, crosslinkers or, if desired, mixtures thereof can prove to be advantageous for modifying the mechanical properties, for example the hardness. The chain extenders or crosslinkers are, insofar as they possess at least two reactive hydrogen atoms, a subgroup of the compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogens (component (a)). Chain extenders and/or crosslinkers used are diols and/or triols having molecular weights of 400, preferably from 60 to 300. Examples of suitable chain extenders/crosslinkers are aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and/or araliphatic diols having from 2 to 14, preferably from 2 to 10, carbon atoms, for example ethylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,10-decanediol, o-, m-, p-dihydroxycyclohexane, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol and preferably 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol and bis(2-hydroxyethyl)hydroquinone, triols such as 1,2,3-trihydroxycyclohexane, glycerol and trimethylolpropane and low molecular weight hydroxyl-containing polyalkylene oxides based on ethylene oxide and/or 1,2-propylene oxide and the abovementioned diols and/or triols as initiator molecules. To produce cellular elastomer moldings and integral foams, secondary aromatic diamines, 3,3-dialkyl- and/or 3,3, 5,5-tetralkyl-substituted diamino-diphenylmethanes can also be employed instead of or in admixture with the abovementioned diols and/or triols as chain extenders and/or crosslinkers (b). Preferred secondary aromatic diamines are: N,N-dialkyl-substituted aromatic diamines having from 1 to 20, preferably from 1 to 4, carbon atoms in the N-alkyl radical, e.g. N,N-di-sec-phenyl-, N,N-di-sec-hexyl-, N,N-di-sec-decyl-, N,N-dicyclohexyl-p- or -m-phenylenediamine, N,N-dimethyl-, N,N-diethyl-, N,N-diisopropyl-, N,N-di-sec-butyl-, N,N-dicyclohexyl-4,4-diaminodiphenylmethane and N,N-di-sec-butylbenzidine. These can, if desired, be substituted by alkyl radicals on the aromatic ring. Catalyst (d) As catalyst (d) for preparing polyurethanes, use is made, in particular, of compounds which strongly accelerate the reaction of the compounds containing reactive hydrogen atoms, in particular hydroxyl groups, of the component (b) and, if used, (c) with the organic, modified or unmodified polyisocyanates (a). Suitable catalysts are organic metal compounds, preferably organic tin compounds such as tin(II) salts of organic carboxylic acids, for example tin(II) acetate, tin(II) octoate, tin(II) ethylhexanoate and tin(II) laurate, and the dialkyltin(IV) salts of organic carboxylic acids, for example dibutyltin diacetate, dibutyl dilaurate, dibutyltin maleate and dialkyltin diacetate. The organic metal compounds are used alone or preferably in combination with strongly basic amines. Examples which may be mentioned are amidines such as 2,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-pyrimidine, tertiary amines such as triethylamine, tributylamine, dimethylbenzylamine, N-methylmorpholine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-cyclohexylmorpholine, N,N,N, N-tetramethylethylenediamine, N,N,N,N,-tetramethyl-butanediamine, N,N,N,N-tetramethylhexane- 1,6-diamine, pentamethyldiethylenetriamine, bis(dimethyl-aminoethyl) ether, bis(dimethylaminopropyl)urea, dimethylpiperazine, 1,2-dimethylimidazole, 1-azabi-cyclo3.3.0octane and preferably 1,4-diaza-bicyclo2.2.2octane, and alkanolamine compounds such as triethanolamine, triisopropanolamine, N-methyl-diethanolamine and N-ethyldiethanolamine and dimethylethanolamine. Further preferred catalysts are: tris(dialkylaminoalkyl)-s-hexahydrotriazines, in particular tris(N,N-dimethylaminopropyl)-s-hexahydrotriazine, tetraalkylammonium hydroxides such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide, alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide and potassium isopropoxide and also alkali metal salts of long-chain fatty acids having from 10 to 20 carbon atoms and possible lateral OH groups. Preference is given to using from 0.001 to 5% by weight, in particular from 0.05 to 2% by weight, of catalyst or catalyst combination, based on the weight of the component (b). Blowing Agents (e) To produce polyurethane foams, water is used as chemical blowing agent (e); the water reacts with isocyanate groups to form amine groups and carbon dioxide, the actual blowing gas. The amounts of water which are advantageously used are from 0.1 to 5 parts by weight, preferably from 1.5 to 3.5 parts by weight and particularly preferably from 2.0 to 3.0 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the polyhydroxy compound (b), or mixtures of organic compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms, preferably relatively high molecular weight polyhydroxy compounds (b) with chain extenders and/or crosslinkers (c). In admixture with water, physically acting blowing agents can also be used as blowing agent (e). Suitable physically acting blowing agents are, in particular, liquids which are inert toward the organic, modified or unmodified polyisocyanates (a) and have a boiling point of less than 100 C., preferably less than 50 C. and particularly preferably from 50 to 30 C., at atmospheric pressure, so that they vaporize under the action of the exothermic polyaddition reaction. Examples of such liquids are hydrocarbons such as iso-pentane, preferably industrial mixtures of n- and iso-pentane, n- and iso-butane, n- and iso-propane, cycloalkanes such as cyclohexane and cyclopentane, ethers such as furan, dimethyl ether and diethyl ether, ketones such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone, alcohol carboxylates such as methyl formate, dimethyl oxalate and ethyl acetate and halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, dichloromonofluoromethane, difluoromethane, difluorochloromethane, trifluoromethane, difluoroethane, tetrafluoroethane, heptafluoropropane, 1-chloro-2,2-difluoroethane, 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane and 1-chloro-1,2-difluoroethane. It is also possible to use mixtures of these low-boiling liquids, for example of difluoromethane and 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane and/or with other halogen-substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbons. Another blowing agent which is preferred according to the present invention is CO 2 , either alone or in admixture with other blowing agents, preferably water. The amount of physically acting blowing agents can be determined in a simple manner as a function of the desired foam density and is from 0 to 25 parts by weight, preferably from 1 to 25 parts by weight and particularly preferably from 2 to 15 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the polyhydroxyl compounds (b). It may be advantageous to mix the modified or unmodified polyisocyanates (a) with the inert, physically acting blowing agent and thereby reduce the viscosity. Flame Retardants (f) Suitable flame retardants (f) apart from the phosphate of the formula (IV) are, for example, tricresyl phosphate, tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, tris(2-chloropropyl) phosphate, tetrakis(2-chloroethyl) ethylene diphosphate, dimethyl methanephosphonate, diethyl diethanolaminomethylphosphonate and also commercial halogenated flame-retardant polyols. In general, it has been found to be advantageous to use from 5 to 50 parts by weight, preferably from 5 to 25 parts by weight, of the flame retardants mentioned per 100 parts by weight of the components (a) to (e). Further information on the abovementioned other customary auxiliaries and additives may be found in the specialist literature, for example in the monograph by J. H. Saunders and K. C. Frisch High Polymers , Volume XVI, Polyurethanes , part 1 and part 2, Interscience Publishers, 1962 and 1964, or the Kunstoff-Handbuch, Polyurethane , Volume VII, Hanser-Verlag, Munich/Vienna, 1st and 2nd Editions, 1966 and 1983. To prepare the polyurethanes of the present invention, the organic polyisocyanates (a), the organic compounds containing at least two reactive hydrogen atoms (b) and, if desired, chain extenders and/or crosslinkers (c) are reacted in such amounts that the equivalence ratio of the NCO groups of the polyisocyanates (a) to the sum of the reactive hydrogen atoms of the component (b) and, if used, (c) and, when using water as blowing agent, also the water is 0.85-1.25:1, preferably 0.95-1.15:1 and in particular 1.05:1. If the polyurethanes contain at least some bound isocyanurate groups, it is usual to employ a ratio of NCO groups of the polyisocyanates (a) to the sum of the reactive hydrogen atoms of the component (b) and, if used, (c) of 1.5-20:1, preferably 1.5-8:1. Auxiliaries and/or Additives (g) If desired, auxiliaries and/or additives (g) can be incorporated into the reaction mixture for producing moldings having a compacted surface zone and a cellular core. Examples which may be mentioned are surface-active substances, foam stabilizers, cell regulators, fillers, dyes, pigments, if desired flame retardants, hydrolysis inhibitors, fungistatic and bacteriostatic substances. Examples of suitable surface-active substances are compounds which serve to aid the homogenization of the starting materials and may also be suitable for regulating the cell structure of the base materials. Preferred surface-acting substances are, for example, emulsifiers such as the sodium salt of castor oil sulfates or of fatty acids and also amine salts of fatty acids, for example diethylamine oleate, diethanolamine stearate, diethanolamine ricinoleate, salts of sulfonic acids, e.g. alkali metal or ammonium salts of dodecylbenzene- or dinaphthylmethanedisulfonic acid or ricinoleic acid; foam stabilizers such as siloxane-oxyalkylene copolymers and other organo-polysiloxanes, ethoxylated alkylphenols, ethoxylated fatty alcohols, paraffin oils, castor oil or ricinoleic esters, Turkey red oil, peanut oil and cell regulators such as paraffins, fatty alcohols, dimethylpolysiloxanes. Oligomeric acrylates having polyoxyalkylene and fluoroalkane radicals as side groups are also suitable for improving the emulsifying action, the cell structure and/or stabilizing the foam. The surface-active substances are usually employed in amounts of from 0.01 to 5 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the components (b) to (f). Preferred mold release agents are: reaction products of fatty acid esters with polyisocyanates, salts of polysiloxanes containing amino groups and fatty acids, salts of saturated or unsaturated (cyclo)aliphatic carboxylic acids having at least 8 carbon atoms and tertiary amines and also, in particular, internal mold release agents such as carboxylic esters and/or carboxamides, as described in EP-A-153 639 or DE-A-36 07 447. For the purposes of the present invention, fillers, in particular reinforcing fillers, are the customary organic and inorganic fillers, reinforcing materials, weighting agents, agents for improving the abrasion behavior in paints, coating compositions, etc. known per se.

Examples of organic fillers are carbon, melamine, rosin, cyclopentadienyl resins and graft polymers and also cellulose fibers, polyamide, polyacrylonitrile, polyurethane and polyester foams and organic fillers based on aromatic and/or aliphatic dicarboxylic esters and, in particular, carbon fibers. The inorganic or organic fillers can be used individually or as mixtures and are advantageously incorporated into the reaction mixture in amounts of from 0.5 to 50% by weight, preferably from 1 to 40% by weight, based on the weight of the components (for example (b) to (f)). The invention is illustrated by the non-limiting examples below. EXAMPLES I.

of sulphonated distyryl-biphenyl compounds of formula (1), in which R 1 and R 2 , independently, are hydrogen, C 1 -C 5 -alkyl, C 1 -C 5 -alkyl or halogen, and M represents Li, K, an alkaline earth metal or ammonium, characterized by, firstly, reacting a compound of formula (2) with a di- or trialkylamine containing 6-12 carbon atoms in each alkyl group, in a two-phase system consisting of strong aqueous mineral acid and a water immisicible organic solvent and, secondly, reacting the resulting lypophilic ammonium salt with LiOH, KOH, an alkaline earth metal hydroxide, ammonia, a mono-, di- or trialkylamine or a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, all containing 1-4 carbon atoms in each alkyl group; mono-, di- or tri(C 2 -C 4 )alkanolamine, morpholine, piperdine or pyrrolidine. The present invention relates to a new process for the preparation of salts of sulphonated distyryl-biphenyl compounds. Distyryl-biphenyl sulphonic acid salts, their preparation and use as optical brightening agents have been described, for example in British Patent Specification 1,247,934 and in French Patent Specification 2,168,210. However, due to the method of synthesis of these compounds, the resulting bis-stilbene sulphonic acids are produced in the form of their sodium salts. Despite the inherent fluorescence of these systems, which render them useful as optical brightening agents, such sodium salts may also be disadvantageous with regard to properties such as water solubility and colouration. Hence, a simple method for the interconversion of such sodium salts into those possessing more desirable properties would be advantageous. Methods for the interconversion of such salts are, for example, by way of the free acid, whereby the free acid must be far more insoluble than the sodium salt and also readily filterable, which, in general, is not the case with such bis-stilbene sulphonic acids. The free acid may also be converted into other salts by the use of a solid ion exchange resin, but, in the case, the free acid must be readily water soluble, which again is not the case with such compounds. Direct ion exchange can only be performed in order to convert a readily soluble salt into a far less soluble derivative, which is not a requirement in the present case. Surprisingly, by way of ion pair extraction, a process has now been found for the preparation of salts of sulphonated distyryl-biphenyl compounds of formula: in which R 1 and R 2 , independently, are hydrogen, C 1 -C 5 -alkyl, C 1 -C 5 -alkoxy or halogen, and M represents Li, K, an alkaline earth metal, ammonium, a mono-, di- or trialkylammonium or a tetraalkylammonium, all containing 1-4 carbon atoms in each alkyl group; a mono-, di- or tri (C 2 -C 4 )alkanolammonium, morpholinium, piperidinium or pyrrolidinium by, firstly, reacting a compound of formula: with a di- or trialkylamine containing 6-12 carbon atoms in each alkyl group, in a two-phase system consisting of strong aqueous mineral acid and a water immiscible organic solvent and, secondly, reacting the resulting lypophilic ammonium salt with LiOH, KOH, an alkaline earth metal hydroxide, ammonia, a mono-, di- or trialkylamine or a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, all containing 1-4 carbon atoms in each alkyl group; a mono-, di- or tri(C 2 -C 4 )alkanolamine, morpholine, piperidine or pyrrolidine. When, in formula (1), R 1 and R 2 represent C 1 -C 5 -alkyl, these may be methyl, ethyl, n- or isopropyl, n-, sec-,or t-butyl, n-pentyl, iso-amyl or sec-amyl groups. When, in formula (1), R 1 and R 2 represent C 1 -C 5 -alkoxy, these may be methoxy, ethoxy, n- or isopropoxy, n-, sec-,or t-butoxy, n-pentyloxy, iso-amyloxy or sec-amyloxy groups. When, in formula (1), R 1 and R 2 represent halogen, these may be fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, preferably chlorine. When M represents an alkaline earth metal these are preferably Ca or Mg, whilst when M represents ammonium these may be NH 4 , mono-, di-, tri- or tetramethylammonium, mono-, di-, tri- or tetraethylammonium, mono, di-, tri- or tetra-n- or isopropylammonium, mono, di-, tri- or tetra-n-, sec- or t-butylammonium, mono-, di- or triethanolammonium, mono-, di- or tri-n- or isopropanolammonium, mono-, di- or tri-n- sec- or t-butanolammonium, morpholinium, piperidinium or pyrrolidinium. As di- or trialkylamines containing 6-12 carbon atoms in each alkyl group, utilised in the first reaction step, these may be any of the isomers of di- or trihexylamine, di or triheptylamine, di- or trioctylamine, di- or trinonylamine, di- or tridecylamine, di- or triundecylamine or di- or tridodecylamine, but are preferably tri-n-octylamine or triisooctylamine. The process of the present invention is particularly useful for the preparation of compounds of formula (1), whereby, R 1 and R 2 both represent hydrogen, C 1 -C 3 -alkyl, C 1 -C 3 -alkoxy, bromine or chlorine, and M represents Li, K, Mg, Ca or an ammonium group. The process of the present invention is preferably used for the preparation of compounds of formula (1) in which R 1 and R 2 both represent hydrogen and M represents Li, K, Mg, Ca, N(R 3 ) 4 , whereby R 3 represents hydrogen or C 1 -C 4 -alkyl, all R 3 groups not necessarily being identical, or C 2 -C 4 alkanolammonium. The process of the present invention is most particularly useful for the preparation of compounds of the formula whereby M 1 represents Li, K, N(R 3 ) 4 , where R 3 , represents hydrogen, C 1 -C 4 -alkyl, or C 2 -C 4 -alkanol and also for the preparation of compounds of formula whereby M 2 represents Li, K or N(n-C 4 H 9 ) 4 . The molar ratios of these amines to that of compound (2) lies in the range of from about 2 to about 4, preferably being in the range of 2.2 to 4. Any strong mineral acid may be utilised in the initial reaction step, specific examples being hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid or, in particular, sulphuric acid, the amount used being such that the pH of the aqueous layer lies within the range of from 1 to 5, especially within the range of from 2 to 3. The water immiscible organic solvent utilised in the first reaction step may be a substituted or unsubstituted benzene, alkane or cycloalkylene, or mixtures thereof, specific examples of such being benzene, toluene, mono- or dichlorobenzenes, nitrobenzene, anisole, xylenes, pentane, hexane, cyclopentane or cyclohexane, isomeric mixtures of xylenes being especially preferred. The temperature at which the initial reaction step is carried out may lie within the range of from about 10 to about 90 C., preferably between 50 and 80 C. In dissolved or finely divided states, the brighteners obtained by the above process display a more or less pronounced fluorescence. They are therefore used, according to the invention, for optically brightening synthetic or natural organic materials. Examples of such materials which may be mentioned, without the review given below being intended to express any limitabon thereto, are textile fibres from the following groups of organic materials, insofar as optical brightening thereof enters into consideration: (a) Polyamides which are obtainable as polymerisation products by ring opening, for example those of the polycaprolactam type, (b) polyamides which are obtainable as polycondensation products based on bifunctional or polyfunctional compounds capable of undergoing a condensation reaction, such as hexamethylenediamine adipate and (c) natural textile organic materials of animal or vegetable origin, for example based on cellulose or proteins, such as cotton or wool, linen or silk. The organic materials to be optically brightened can be in diverse stages of processing and are preferably finished textile products. They can, for example be in the form of hank goods, textile filaments, yarns, twisted yarns, nonwovens, felts, textile fabrics, textile composites or knitted fabrics. The brighteners defined above are of particular importance for the treatment of textile fabrics. The treatment of textile substrates is advantageously carried out in an aqueous medium in which the particular optical brighteners are present in a finely divided form (suspensions, so-called microdispersions and in some cases solutions). Dispersing agents, stabilisers, wetting agents and further auxiliaries can optionally be added during the treatment. The treatment is usually carried out at temperatures of from about 20 to 140 C., for example at the boiling point of the bath, or in the region thereof (about 90 C.). For the finishing, according to the invention, of textile substrates it is also possible to use solutions or emulsions in organic solvents, as are used in dyeing practice in so-called solvent dyeing (pad-thermofix method and the exhaustion dyeing process in dyeing machines). The optical brighteners which can be used according to the present invention can also be employed, for example, in the following use forms: (a) In mixtures with so-called carriers, wetting agents, softeners, swelling agents, antioxidants, light stabilisers, heat stabilisers and chemical bleaching agents (chlorite bleach and bleaching bath additives). (b) In mixtures with crosslinking agents and finishing agents (for example starch or synthetic finishing agents) and also in combination with very diverse textile finishing processes, especially synthetic resin finishes (for example crease resistant finishes such as wash-and-wear, permanent press and no-iron), and also flame resistant finishes, soft handle finishes, anti-soiling finshes or anti-static finishes or antimicrobial finishes. (c) As additives to various soaps and washing agents. (d) In combination with other substances having an optical brightening action. If the brightening process is combined with textile treatment or finishing methods, the combined treatment can in many cases advantageously be effected with the aid of corresponding stable formulations which contain the compounds having an optical brightening action in a concentration such that the desired brightening effect is obtained. In certain cases, the full effect of the brightener is achieved by an after-treatment. This can be, for example, a chemical treatment (for example acid treatment), a thermal treatment (for example heat) or a combined chemical/heat treatment. The amount of the optical brighteners to be used according to the invention, relative to the material to be optically brightened, can vary within wide limits. A distinct and durable effect can already be achieved with vary small amounts and in certain cases, for example, with amounts of 0.03% by weight. However amounts of up to about 0.5% by weight can also be used. For most cases of interest in practice, amounts of between 0.05 and 0.5% by weight relative to the material to be brightened, are preferably of interest. The optical brighteners are also especially suitable as additives for washing baths or to industrial and household washing agents and they can be added in various ways. They are appropriately added to washing baths in the form of their solutions in water or organic solvents or also in a state of fine division as aqueous dispersions or slurries. They, or their components, are advantageously added to household or industrial washing agents at any phase of the manufacturing process of the washing agent, for example to the so-called slurry prior to spray-rying of the washing powder or during the preparation of liquid washing agent combinations. The compounds can be added both in the form of a solution or dispersion in water or other solvents and also without auxiliaries in the form of a dry brightener powder. However, they can also be sprayed, in the dissolved or pre-dispersed form, onto the finished washing agent. Washing agents which can be used are the known mixtures of detergent substances, such as, for example, soap in the form of chips and powders, synthetic products, soluble salts of sulphonic acid half-esters of higher fatty alcohols, arylsulphonic acids, which are substituted by higher alkyl and/or polysubstituted by alkyl, carboxylic acid esters with alcohols of medium to higher molecular weight, fatty acid acylaminoalkyl- or aminoaryl-glycerol-sulphonates, phosphoric acid esters of fatty alcohols and the like. So-called builders which can be used are, for example, alkali metal polyphosphates and alkali metal polymeta-phosphates, alkali metal pyrophosphates, alkali metal salts of carboxyethylcellulose and other soil redeposition inhibitors, and also alkali metal silicates, alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal borates, alkali metal perborates, nitrilotriacetic acid, ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid and foam stabilisers, such as alkanolamides of higher fatty acids. Furthermore, the washing agents can contain, for example: antistatic agents, superfatting skin protection agents, such as lanolin, enzymes, antimicrobial agents, perfumes and dyestuffs. The brighteners have the particular advantage that they are also effective in the presence of active chlorine donors, such as, for example, hypochlorite and can be used without substantial loss of the effects in washing baths with non-ionic washing agents, for example alkylphenol polyglycol ethers. Also in the presence of perborate or peracids and activators, for example tetraacetylglycoluril or ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid are the new brighteners very stable both in pulverulent washing agent and in washing baths. The brighteners according to the invention are added in amounts of 0.005 to 2% or more and preferably of 0.03 to 0.5%, relative to the weight of the liquid or pulverulent ready-to-use washing agent. When they are used to wash textiles made of cellulose fibres, polyamide fibres, cellulose fibres with a high grade finish, wool and the like, wash liquors which contain the indicated amounts of the optical brighteners according to the invention impart a brilliant appearance in daylight. The washing treatment is carried out, for example, as follows: The indicated textiles are treated for 1 to 30 minutes at 5 to 100 C. and preferably at 25 to 100 C. in a wash bath which contains 1 to 10 g/kg of a composite washing agent containing builders and 0.05 to 1% relative to the weight of the washing agent, of the brighteners claimed. The liquor ratio can be 1:3 to 1:50. After washing, the textiles are rinsed and dried in the customary manner. The wash bath can contain, as a bleach additive, 0.2 g/l of active chlorine (for example in the form of hypochlorite) or 0.1 to 2 g/l of sodium perborate. The brighteners according to the invention can also be applied from a rinsing bath with a carrier. For this purpose the brightener is incorporated in a soft rinsing agent or in another rinsing agent, which contains, as the carrier, for example, polyvinyl alcohol, starch, copolymers on an acrylic basis or formaldehyde/urea or ethylene-urea or propylene-urea derivatives, in amounts of 0.005 to 5% or more and preferably of 0.2 to 2%, relative to the rinsing agent. When used in amounts of 1 to 100 ml, and preferably of 2 to 25 ml, per litre of rinsing bath, rinsing agents of this type, which contain the brighteners according to the invention, impart brilliant brightening effects to very diverse types of treated textiles. A further application of the compounds of the invention is for the brightening of paper, either in the pulp mass during paper manufacture or in the size-press, which has been described in British Patent Specification 1,247,934, or preferably in coating compositions. When brighteners of the present invention are employed in such formulations papers brightened with them exhibit a very high degree of whiteness. The compounds obtained by the process of the present invention are particularly advantageous in that they exhibit not only extremely high whitening ability, but, in addition, in many cases highly desirable water solubilities and also possess excellent white aspects in the solid state.

CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a division of U.S. Pat. application Ser. No. 09/340,729, filed Jun. 29, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,077,845. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to acridin derivatives of general formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and relates to a method of producing them and to their use as drugs. Classical opioids such as morphine are used for the therapy of severe and very severe pain. Their use is limited, however, by their known side effects, e.g. respiratory depression, vomiting, sedation and obstipation, and by the development of tolerance. Moreover, they are less effective for neuropathic or incidental pain, from which tumour patients suffer in particular. Opioids develop their analgesic effect by binding to membrane receptors, which form part of the family of what are termed G protein-coupled receptors. The biochemical and pharmacological characterisation of subtypes of these receptors has shown that subtype-specific opioids exhibit a spectrum of effects and side-effects which is different to that of morphine for example. Whereas morphine binds selectively to what are termed -receptors, endogenous enkephalins have been characterised as -selective peptides. In the meantime, other pharmacological investigations have indicated that a plurality of subtypes of these opioid receptors ( 1 , 2 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 1 and 2 ) probably exist. Knowledge of the physiological importance of -receptor-selective substances has essentially been widened by the development of the non-peptidic antagonist naltrindol. In the meantime, it has been ascertained that -agonists exhibit an autonomous antinociceptive potential. In addition to a multiplicity of experimental studies on animals, an investigation has also been performed in which the peptidic agonist D-alanine 2 -D-leucine 5 -enkephalin (DADL) was used on cancer patients on whom morphine no longer had an analgesic effect. When administered intrathecally, DADL exhibited a long-term analgesic effect. Moreover, -agonists differ from -agonists as regards their interaction with the endogenous opioid antagonist cholecystokinin (CCK). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The underlying object of the present invention was to provide substances having an analgesic effect which exhibit an affinity for -opiate receptors. This object has been achieved by the acridin derivatives according to the present invention. These new compounds exhibit a considerable affinity for -opiate receptors.

The present invention further relates to methods of producing compounds of formula I. In order to produce compounds of formula I, wherein derivatives are excluded in which the radicals have the following meanings, namely if R 1 denotes A, R 2 denotes H or OR 12 or if R 2 and R 3 form a double bond together, if R 3 denotes H or if R 3 and R 2 form a double bond together, if R 4 denotes CH 2 NR 14 R 15 if R 5 and R 6 denote C 1-6 alkyl, if R 7 and R 7 denote H, and if the R 11 , R 12 , R 14 and R 15 radicals have the same meaning as above, cyclohexane derivatives of general formulae II, III, or IV wherein R 19 , R 20 and R 21 , independently of each other, represent H, C 1-6 alkoxy, O-C 3-7 cycloalkyl, O-aryl or O-heterocyclyl, and wherein R 14 and R 15 have the same meanings as above, are reacted with substituted 2-aminobenzaldehydes. These reactions are conducted in a C 1-4 alkyl alcohol in the presence of an acid, preferably from the group comprising hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid, at temperatures between 20 C. and 80 C. Elimination of the tertiary OH group and/or separation of the methyl ether grouping in the cyclization products obtained is effected by the reaction of the products with an acid, preferably from the group comprising formic acid, acetic acid, hydrobromic acid/glacial acetic acid, hydrobromic acid or methanesulfonic acid/methionine, at temperatures between 15 C. and 80 C. Introduction of the R 12 radical, where R 12 does not represent hydrogen, is effected by the reaction of the corresponding cyclisation products with the relevant alkyl or aryl halides or with the relevant acid chlorides in the presence of a base such as potassium tertiary butylate for example, or with sodium hydride in an organic solvent e.g. dimethylformamide. The synthesis of cyclohexanones of formula II, where R 14 and R 15 represent a methyl group, has already been described in DE-A 195 47 766. Cyclohexanones of formula II, in which R 14 and R 15 do not represent a methyl group but otherwise have the same meaning as was explained in detail above, can be produced by the reaction of a 1,4-cyclohexanedione monoethylene ketal with immonium salts of formula V, followed by the reaction of the Mannich bases which are thus obtained with an organometallic compound of formula VI, where Z denotes MgCl, MgBr, Mgl or lithium and R 22 has the meaning as defined for R 11 , and subsequent separation of the protective ketal group by an acid, for example hydrochloric acid. The reaction of the Mannich bases with a Grignard compound of formula VI in which Z represents MgCl, MgBr or Mgl, or with an organolithium compound of formula VI, can be conducted in an aliphatic ether, for example diethyl ether and/or tetrahydrofuran, at temperatures between 70 C. and 60 C. The reaction with a Grignard compound of formula VI can be effected with or without the addition of an entraining reagent, preferably 1,2bromoethane. Organolithium compounds of formula VI, in which Z denotes Cl, Br or I, can be obtained, for example, by reaction with a solution of n-butyl lithium in hexane by halogen-lithium exchange. The separion of the methyl ether grouping in the cyclohexane derivatives which are obtained in this manner is effected by the reaction of these compounds with an acid, for example formic acid, acetic acid, hydrobromic acid/glacial acetic acid, hydrobromic acid or methanesulfonic acid/methionine at temperatures between 15 C. and 80 C. Cyclohexane derivatives of formula III can be obtained by the reaction of the Mannich base of formula VII, in which R 14 and R 15 have the same meanigs as above, with an organometaffic compound of formula VI, in which Z denotes MgCl, MgBr, MgI or lihtium and R 22 has the meaning as defined for R 11 . The reaction of the Mannich base of formula VII with a Grignard compound of formula VI in which Z denotes MgCl MgBr or MgI, or with an organolithium compound of formula VI, can be conducted in an aliphatic ether, for example diethyl ether and/or tetrahydrofuran, at temperatures between 70 C. and 60 C. The reaction with a Grignard compound of formula VI can be effected with or without the addition of an entraining reagent, preferably 1,2-dibromoethane. Organolithium compounds of formula VI, in which Z denotes Cl, Br or I, can be obtained, for example, by reaction with a solution of n-butyl lithium in hexane by halogen-lithium exchange. The separation of the methyl ether grouping in the cyclohexane derivatives which are obtained in this manner is effected by the reaction of these compounds with an acid, for example formic acid, acetic acid, hydrobromic acid/glacial acetic acid, hydrobromic acid or methanesulfonic acid/methionine at temperatures between 15 C. and 80 C. Mannich bases of formula VII, wherein R 14 and R 15 represent a methyl group, have already been described in DE-A 195 25 137. Mannich bases of formula VII inwhich R 14 and R 15 do not represent amethyl group are obtained by the reaction of 3,3-dimethyl-1,5-dioxa-spiro5.5-undecan-8-one with immonium salts of formula V. Cyclohexanones of formula IV are obtained by the reaction of cyclohexane derivatives of formula III with acids, for example hydrochloric acid, formic acid or acetic acid. Subsequent hydrogenation of the products which are thus obtained using catalytically activated hydrogen, wherein platinum or palladium, absorbed on a support material such as activated carbon, are employed as the catalyst, results in compounds of formula IV. Hydrogenation is conducted in a solvent such as ethyl acetate or in a C 1-4 alkyl alcohol at pressures from 0.1 to 10 bar and temperatures of 20 C. to 80 C. Separation of the methyl ether group in compounds of formula IV is effectedby reaction with hydrobromic acid or with hydrobromic acid/glacial acetic acid at temperatures between 20 C. and 80 C. Acridin derivatives of general formula I, in which R 1 denotes A, R 2 denotes H or OR 12 or in which R 2 and R 3 form pat of a double bond, R 3 denotes H or R 3 and R 2 form part of a double bond, R 4 denotes CH 2 NR 14 R 15 , R 5 and R 6 denote C 1-6 alkyl, and R 7 and R 8 denote H, wherein the R 11 , R 12 , R 14 and R 15 radicals have the same meanings as above, are preferably produced by the reaction of 3,3-dialkyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-acridin-1-one derivatives see W. Borsche et al., Jusus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 550, 160, (1942) with immonium chlorides of formula V at temperatures between 20 C. and 80 C. in a solvent, for example acetonitrile. The Mannich bases which result therefrom are reacted with an organometallic compound of formula VI in an aliphatic ether e.g. diethyl ether and/or tetrahydrofuran at temperatures between 70 C. and 60 C. The elimination of the tertiary OH group and/or the separation of the methyl ether group in the products which are obtained in this manner can be effected with formic acid, acetic acid, hydrobromic acid/glacial acetic acid, hydrobromic acid or methanesulfonic acid/methionine at temperatures between 20 C. and 100 C. Hydrogenation of the aliphatic double bond in these products by catalytically activated hydrogen, wherein platinum or palladium which is absorbed on a support material e.g. activated carbon can be employed as the catalyst, results in compounds of formula I according to the invention wherein R 1 denotes A, R 2 denotes H, R 3 denotes H, R 4 denotes (CH 2 )N(CH 3 ) 2 , R 5 denotes CH 3 , R 6 denotes CH 3 , and wherein R 7 and R 8 denote H. The reaction is conducted in a solvent such as acetic acid, ethyl acetate or a C 1-4 alkyl alcohol at pressures of 0.1 to 10 bar and at temperatures of 20 C. to 80 C. Introduction of R 12 radicals, where R 12 does not represent hydroge is achieved by the reaction of the corresponding cyclisation products with the relevant alkyl or aryl halides or with the relevant acid chlorides in the presence of a base such as potassium tertiary butylate for example, or in the presence of sodium hydride in an organic solvent, preferably dimethylformamide. The compounds of formula I can be converted in the known manner into their salts with physiologically compatible acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, citric acid, glutamic acid and/or aspartic acid. Salt formation is preferably conducted in a solvent such as diisopropyl ether, ethyl acetate, acetone and/or 2-butanone. Trimethylchlorosilane in aqueous solution is particularly suitable for the preparation of hydrochlorides. -Opiate Receptor Binding Investigations Tests to determine the affinity of the compounds of formula I according to the invention for -opiate receptors were performed on meninx homogenates (homogenates of rats brain, without the cerebellum and medulla oblongata, taken from male Wistar rats). For this purpose, freshly prepared rat brains were each homogenised, while being cooled in ice, in 50 mmoles/l Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 5000 g and 40 C. After decantation and after rejecting the supernatant liquor, followed by renewed take-up and homogenization of the membrane sediment in 50 mmoles/l Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), the homogenate was subsequently centrifuged for 20 minutes at 20,000 g and 40 C. This washing step was repeated again. Thereafter, the supernatant liquor was decanted and the membrane seddnent was homogenized in cold 50 mmoles/l Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol (w/v), 0.01% bacitracin (w/v) (pH 7.4) and aliquots thereof were frozen until required for testing. For the receptor binding tests, the aliquots were thawed and were diluted 1:10 with the binding test buffer. A solution of 50 moles/l Tris-HCl, 5 moles/l MgCl 2 (pH 7.4), supplemented by 0.1 (w/v) bovine serum albumin, was used as the buffer in the binding tests; 1 nmole/l 3 H-2-D-Ala-deltorphin II was used as the radioactive ligand. The proportion of non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 moles/l naloxon. In further batches, the compounds according to the invention were added in a series of concentrations and the displacement of the radioactive ligand from its specific binding site was determined. The batches concerned, which were each tested in triplicate, were incubated for 90 minutes at 37 C. and were subsequently harvested in order to determine the radioactive ligand which was bound to the membrane homogenate by filtration through a glass fibre filter (GF/B). The glass fiber filter discs were dried, and the radioactivity thereof was measured in a -counter after adding a scintillator. The affinity of the compounds according to the invention for the -opiate receptor was calculated as the IC 50 value according to the law of mass action, by means of nonlinear regression.

the process comprising treating a compound of general formula (II), wherein a, b, c, and d are as described above and L 1 and L 2 each independently represent an active group provided that either Y and L 1 are different or Z and L 2 are different, with a fluorinating system in the presence of oxygen. A preferred compound of general formula (I) is 4,4-difluorobenzophenone which may be prepared from 4,4-dinitrophenylmethane using tetramethylammonium fluoride. This is a U.S. National stage Application of PCT/GB98/00622 filed Mar. 12, 1998. This invention relates to the preparation of aromatic compounds and particularly, although not exclusively, relates to the preparation of substituted benzophenone compounds, for example, 4,4-difluorobenzophenone. 4,4-difluorobenzophenone is an important monomeric reagent used in the production of polyketones, notably polyetheretherketone (PEEK), for example as described in EP 001 879 (Imperial Chemical Industries). Numerous processes have been proposed for the preparation of 4,4-difluorobenzophenone. Many known processes use fluorobenzene as a starting material. For example, JP 8961870 (Ihara) and EP 307320 (Raychem) disclose reactions which involve Friedel Crafts acylation of fluorobenzene using 4-fluorobenzoyl chloride in the presence of a catalyst. FR 2647108 (Rhone-Poulenc) discloses acylation of fluorobenzene using benzoic acid in the presence of a catalyst. Two other processes which use fluorobenzene as a starting material are described in JP 61221146 (Asahi) and EP 402623 (Rhone-Poulenc). The former process involves the reaction of fluorobenzene with carbon monoxide in the presence of oxygen and the latter process involves the reaction of fluorobenzene with phosgene to produce the desired product. One problem associated with the use of fluorobenzene is its cost. In addition, the handling and disposal of large amounts of spent catalyst used in the various processes is costly. Furthermore, some of the processes described produce relatively low yields of 4,4-difluorobenzophenone. Another known process is described in EP 0 004 710 (Imperial Chemical Industries) and this involves the reaction of 4,4-diaminodiphenylmethane with an aqueous solution of sodium nitrite and hydrogen fluoride to produce 4,4-difluorodiphenylmethane which may then be oxidised using nitric acid to produce 4,4-difluorobenzophenone. Problems associated with this process include the corrosiveness of hydrogen fluoride and undesirable nitrogen oxide biproducts of the reaction. Other known processes involve the oxidation of 4,4-difluorodiphenylmethane in the presence of a catalyst, for example a cerium (IV) compound as described in JP 1172845 (Asahi) or a cobalt compound as described in JP 61183245 (Ashai). One problem associated with each of these processes is the need to dispose of the catalyst. It is an object of the present invention to address problems associated with known processes for the preparation of substituted benzophenone compounds, for example 4,4-difluorobenzophenone. The invention is based on the discovery that a fluorination system can be used in both the oxidation and functionalisation of diphenylmethane derivatives for preparing substituted benzophenone compounds. According to the invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of a compound of general formula wherein Y and Z each independently represent a fluorine atom or a hydroxy group, and a, b, c and d independently represent 0, 1, 2 or 3 provided that the sum of a, b, c and d is 1, 2, 3 or 4, the process comprising treating a compound of general formula wherein a, b, c and d are as described above and L 1 and L 2 each independently represent an active group provided that either Y and L 1 are different or Z and L 2 are different, with a fluorinating system in the presence of oxygen. Unless otherwise stated in this specification, an alkyl group may have up to 10, suitably up to 8, preferably up to 6, more preferably up to 4, carbon atoms, with methyl and ethyl groups being especially preferred. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, an aryl group may be a benzyl or phenyl group, with a phenyl group being especially preferred. Said active group is suitably a group which is not inert and can, therefore, be involved in a subsequent reaction, for example as a bridging group or a leaving group. L 1 and L 2 may be independently selected from halogen atoms, especially fluorine, chlorine and. bromine atoms, or nitro, amino, alkoxy or hydroxy groups. Said fluorinating system is preferably involved in the subsequent reaction of one or each active group.

More preferably, said compound of general formula II represents 4,4-dinitrodiphenylmethane. Compounds of general formula II may be commercially available or may be prepared using standard techniques. For example, the compounds may be prepared by reacting a 4-substituted (chloromethyl)benzene derivative, for example 4-nitro(chloromethyl)benzene, with a suitable benzene derivative in a Friedel Crafts reaction. Said fluorinating system is preferably involved in the oxidation of the or each group CH 2 in said compound of general formula II. For example, said fluorinating system may catalyse the oxidation reaction. Preferably, said fluorinating system acts as a base in the oxidation reaction. It is believed that the fluorinating system, for example a fluoride ion thereof, may deprotonate the or each group CH 2 . Said fluorination system is preferably involved in both the oxidation of the or each group CH 2 and in the reaction, for example the displacement, of the group L 1 and/or group L 2 . For example, where group L 1 and/or group L 2 represent a nitro group, said fluorinating system is preferably capable of fluorodenitrating each nitro group. Preferably, the oxidation of the or each group CH 2 and the reaction of group L 1 and/or group L 2 occur in the same reaction mixture and/or in the same vessel suitably without the need for the product of one step to be isolated or otherwise separated from the reaction mixture prior to a second step. It is believed that the first step comprises the oxidation of the or each group CH 2 and the second step comprises reaction of group L 1 and/or group L 2 . Said fluorinating system may include an organics soluble fluoride source and compounds for the preparation of the aforesaid in situ; and alkali metal fluorides, suitably in conjunction with a catalyst. Preferably, said fluorinating system includes one or more compounds selected from only one class of reagents, wherein one class comprises an organics soluble fluoride source as described herein and another class comprises alkali metal fluorides as described herein. The fluorinating system preferably includes only one compound from one class of reagents described herein. Preferably, said organics soluble fluoride source comprises an onium fluoride derivative. Said onium fluoride derivative may be selected from ammonium, phosphonium and sulphonium fluoride derivatives, with ammonium and phosphonium derivatives being preferred and ammonium derivatives being especially preferred. Preferably, said onium fluoride derivative includes alkyl or aryl groups or mixed alkyl and/or aryl groups. Where the onium fluoride derivative is an ammonium or phosphonium fluoride derivative, it may comprise a cation of general formula QR 1 x R 2 y wherein Q represents a nitrogen or phosphorous atom, each R 1 independently represents an optionally substituted alkyl group, each R 2 independently represents an optionally substituted alkyl or aryl group and x and y independently represent 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 provided that xy4.

Said onium fluoride derivative may be a fluoride material of general formula QR 1 x R 2 y F(HF) z where Q, R 1 , R 2 , X and y are as described above and z represents 0 to 3, preferably 0 or 1. Suitable ammonium fluoride derivatives are tetraalkyl derivatives with (CH 3 ) 4 NF, (C 2 H 5 ) 4 NF, (nC 4 H 9 ) 4 NF and (CH 3 ) 4 NF(HF) being preferred. Of the aforesaid, (CH 3 ) 4 NF and (CH 3 ) 4 NF(HF) are especially preferred. A mixed alkyl derivative may be cetyldimethylethylammonium fluoride. Preferred phosphonium fluoride derivatives are tetraphenyl derivatives, with (C 6 H 5 ) 4 PHF 2 being especially preferred. Preparation of the ammonium or phosphonium fluoride derivatives may be accomplished using standard procedures. For example, tetramethylammonium fluoride may be prepared in situ by reaction of tetramethylammonium chloride with potassium fluoride, optionally in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, for example as described in J.Org.Chem 1989,54,4827. Many ammonium or phosphonium fluoride derivatives are commercially available. Preparation of sulphonium fluoride derivatives may be accomplished using standard procedures. For example, tris (dimethylamino)sulphonium bifluoride can be prepared by treating tris(dimethylamino)sulphonium difluorotrimethylsilicate with water in acetonitrile. In some cases, onium fluoride derivatives of the type described herein may be supported to provide an ion exchange resin. For example, an onium fluoride derivative such as the group CH 2 N (CH 3 ) 3 F may be bonded to the 4-position of a cross-linked polystyrene matrix to provide an ion exchange resin. Preferred alkali metal fluorides include potassium fluoride and caesium fluoride. Suitable catalysts include phase transfer catalysts, for example (C 6 H 5 ) 4 PBr and 18-crown-6.

Preferably, said fluorinating system includes ammonium or phosphonium fluoride derivatives of the type described above, with organics soluble derivatives being especially preferred. Said oxygen is involved in the oxidation of the or each CH 2 group of said compound of general formula II. Said oxygen suitably refers to free oxygen gas which is arranged to contact the reactants in the process and react with said compound of general formula II. Said oxygen gas may be a component of air which contacts the reaction mixture or may be a component of another gaseous mixture which contacts the reaction mixture. In some circumstances, substantially pure oxygen gas may be used. In the process, a gas comprising or consisting essentially of oxygen may be directed into the reaction mixture. Conveniently, an air stream may be blown into the reaction mixture. Said process is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent. Said solvent is preferably aprotic. Said solvent is preferably non-aqueous. Said solvent is preferably substantially free of water, at least at the beginning of the process. The solvent may be polar or non-polar. It is preferably polar and adapted to stabilise intermediates formed during the process. Said solvent may be selected from cyanide compounds, especially alkylcyanide compounds; ethers, including cyclic ethers; solvents having SO moieties, for example sulphone or sulphoxide solvents; and amides, including cyclic amides. A preferred alkyl cyanide compound is acetonitrile. A preferred ether is tetrahydrofuran. Solvents having SO moieties include alkyl and/or aryl (including alkyl/aryl) sulphones and sulphoxides including cyclic compounds. Preferred amides may be aliphatic or cyclic. Preferred solvents include acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, ethers, dimethylsulphoxide, dimethylacetamide, dimethyl formamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, sulpholane, diphenylsulphone and diphenylsulphoxide. Especially preferred solvents are solvents having SO moieties and amides as described. The process may be carried out in a mixture of solvents which mixture includes one or more of the aforementioned solvents. Preferred solvents have a boiling point of at least 120 C., preferably at least 140 C., more preferably at least 160 C. Said boiling point may be less than 500 C., preferably less than 400 C., more preferably less than 300 C. The process is preferably carried out above ambient temperature. The process may be carried out at a temperature of greater than 50 C., preferably of greater than 65 C. and, more preferably, of greater than 80 C. In the process, water is preferably initially removed from the fluorinating system by suitable means. For example, a fluorinating system, such as an ammonium or phosphonium fluoride derivative in a solvent, such as dimethylsulphoxide may be azeotropically dried by adding a hydrocarbon solvent such as cyclohexane in large excess to the fluorinating system and heating at an elevated temperature for several hours under an inert atmosphere such as argon so that water is driven off (see D Wails, D. Phil. Thesis, University of York, England, 1994). Other drying techniques may also be used. A preferred technique involves the use of a vacuum, suitably at an elevated temperature. After drying, the argon atmosphere may be replaced with an atmosphere containing oxygen by providing an air feed. The temperature of the reaction mixture may be raised, for example to about 100 C. and a compound of general formula II added. Heating of the reaction mixture may continue for more than 10 hours, preferably more than 20 hours. The desired product may be obtained by standard techniques, for example by column chromatography or, preferably, by distillation. It is believed that, in the process, the first step is the oxidation of the or each CH 2 group in the compound of general formula II by oxygen in conjunction with the fluorinating system which may act catalytically. In the oxidation reaction, the fluorinating system may deprotonate the or each CH 2 group to produce a carbanion or at least activate the or each CH 2 group, which then reacts with oxygen to produce a ketone group. Water may also be produced in the reaction. In order to aid the reaction, a means for removing water formed may be included. It is believed that the diphenylketone derivative formed in the first step is important for the stabilisation of intermediates formed in the second step which may comprise the nucleophilic substitution of the group L 1 and/or group L 2 . Nucleophilic substitution of group L 1 and/or L 2 preferably involves substitution by fluoride ions provided by said fluorinating system to produce a compound of general formula I wherein Y and Z represent fluorine atoms. Such a compound can advantageously be used directly in the production of polyketones for example polyetheretherketone (PEEK) when n and m represent 0. Compounds of general formula I wherein at least one of the substituents Y and Z represents a hydroxy group may involve nucleonphilic substitution of group L 1 and/or group L 2 by hydroxide ions from water generated in the oxidation of the or each CH 2 group as described above or, alternatively, may involve nucleophilic substitution by hydroxide ions of a compound of general formula I wherein substituent Y and/or Z represent fluorine atoms. In some circumstances, the group L 1 and/or the group L 2 of the compound of general formula II may be oxidised prior to undergoing a nucleophilic substitution reaction. Such an oxidation reaction may be achieved by said fluorinating system in the presence of oxygen or by addition of another oxidising agent. For example, where L 1 and/or L 2 represent an amine group in said compound of general formula II, the or each amine group may be oxidised, initially, to a nitro group, which can then undergo a nucleophilic substitution reaction with fluorine or hydroxide ions, as described above. Alternatively, an amino group may be converted to a leaving group, for example a group NH 3 , which may be substituted. Nucleophilic substitution of compounds of general formula II wherein group L 1 and/or L 2 represent nitro groups result in the displacement of nitrite ions. The substitution reaction may, therefore, be aided by providing a nitrite trap to remove the nitrite ions. Phthaloyl dichloride may be added to the reaction mixture to act as a nitrite trap. As described above, group L 1 and group L 2 are preferably nitro groups in said compound of general formula II. Such a nitro compound can be prepared from a compound of general formula II wherein L 1 and L 2 represent amine groups, by oxidation using hydrogen peroxide. Such an amine compound of general formula II is commercially available and/or can be prepared using standard procedures from commercially available reagents. As described herein, it has been found, surprisingly, that fluorinating systems which comprise an organics soluble fluoride source can be used to oxidise certain diphenylmethanes to diphenylketones in the presence of oxygen. Accordingly, the invention extends to a process for the preparation of a compound of general formula I as described above wherein Y and Z each independently represent a halogen atom or a hydroxy, nitro or amino group, which includes the step of contacting a compound of general formula II as described above, wherein L 1 and L 2 each independently represent a halogen atom or a hydroxy, nitro or amino group, with an organics soluble fluoride source in the presence of oxygen. The organics soluble fluoride source may be as described in any statement herein. Preferably, said organics soluble fluoride source acts as a catalyst in the oxidation reaction. Oxygen may be supplied in the process as described in any statement herein. A preferred halogen atom is a fluorine atom. Preferably, Y, Z, L 1 and L 2 independently represent a fluorine atom or a hydroxy group. Preferably, Y and L 1 and/or Z and L 2 represent the same atom or group. The process may include a solvent as described in any statement herein. The invention extends to a compound of general formula I prepared in a process as described herein. Any feature of any aspect of an invention described herein may be combined with any feature of any other aspect described herein. The invention will now be described, by way of example. EXAMPLE 1 Tetramethylammonium fluoride tetrahydrate (0.097 g, 6 mmol) in dimethylsulphoxide (10 ml) was azeotropically dried, for 2.5 hours with efficient stirring, using cyclohexane (40 ml) under an argon atmosphere. The argon atmosphere was then removed and replaced with an air feed. The temperature was increased to 100 C. and 4,4-dinitrodiphenylmethane (0.05 g, 2 mmol) added. The reaction was monitored using gas chromatography (GC). Initially, the reaction mixture went blue but, after 20 minutes, the mixture went brown and 4,4-difluorobenzophenone was visible in the GC trace. After 1 hour, no starting material was visible in the GC trace; the major product visible was 4,4-difluorobenzophenone (75%), with minor products being 4-fluoro-4-nitrobenzophenone, 4-fluoro-4-hydroxybenzophenone and 4,4-dinitrobenzophenone. After 24 hours, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed that 100% conversion of 4,4-dinitrodiphenylmethane had been achieved, with 84% conversion to 4,4-difluorobenzophenone, 10% conversion to 4-fluoro-4-hydroxybenzophenone and traces of other compounds being observed. EXAMPLE 2 Tetramethylammonium fluoride tetrahydrate (TMAF) was dried under a dynamic vacuum at 60 C. until a hygroscopic white solid was obtained (19.4% water w/w by Karl Fischer titration). N,N-Dimethylacetamide was dried over 3 and 4 molecular sieves for at least three days before use. 4,4-Dinitrodiphenylmethane (0.062 g, 0.24 mmol) was placed in a three-necked, 100 ml round bottomed flask along with biphenyl (0.03 g, 0.2 mmol), the internal standard. N,N-Dimethylacetamide (10 ml) was added along with an oxygen feed. The solution was heated to 100 C. with stirring. After 20 minutes of oxygen bubbling through the system, TMAF (0,086 g, 0.7 mmol) was added. The reaction was monitored by gas chromatography (GC). Initially, the reaction went blue, but gradually turned red over 15 minutes. During the course of the reaction, starting material, 4-fluoro-4-nitrobenzophenone and 4,4-difluorobenzophenone could be detected by GC. After 1 hour, no starting material was visible in the GC trace; the only detectable product was 4,4-difluorobenzophenone (48%) EXAMPLE 3 TMAF and N,N-dimethylacetamide were pre-dried as described in Example 2. 4,4-Dinitrodiphenylmethane (0.062 g, 0.24 mmol) was placed in a 100 ml, three-necked round bottomed flask with an oxygen feed, along with biphenyl (0.03 g, 0.2 mmol), the internal standard. Keeping the flask at ambient temperature, TMAF (0.005 g, 0.04 mmol) was added, resulting in immediate blue colouration of the solution. After stirring overnight, the solution had become red with GC and 1 H-nmr analysis demonstrating that quantitative conversion to 4,4dinitrobenzophenone had occurred. The solution was then heated to 100 C. and a further quantity of TMAF (0.086 g, 0.7 mmol) added. 4,4-Dinitrobenzophenone, 4-fluoro-4-nitrobenzophenone and 4,4,-difluorobenzophenone could be detected in the GC trace during the reaction, but after 1 hour, GC showed that 100% conversion of 4,4-dinitrobenzophenone had been achieved, with the only detectable product being 4,4-difluorobenzophenone (71%). EXAMPLE 4 TMAF was dried as described in Example 2. Sulfolane was distilled from sodium hydroxide into a flask and kept over 3 and 4 molecular sieves. 4,4-Dinitrodiphenylmethane (0.062 g, 0.24 mmol) was added to a 100 ml round bottomed flask with an air feed, along with biphenyl (0.03 g, 0.2 mmol), the internal standard. TMAF (0.008 g, 0.07 mmol) was added along with sulfolane (10 ml), giving an immediate blue colouration. After stirring overnight, the solution had become red. This solution was heated to 100 C. and a further quantity of TMAF (0.086 g, 0.7 mmol) added. 4,4-Dinitrobenzophenone, 4-nitro-4-fluorobenzophenone and 4,4-difluorobenzophenone could be detected in the GC trace during the reaction. After two hours, GC showed that 100% conversion of 4,4-dinitrobenzophenone had been achieved, with the only detectable product being 4,4-difluorobenzophenone (70%). EXAMPLE 5 Tetramethylammonium hydrogen difluoride (TMAHF 2 ) was dried under a dynamic vacuum at 60 C. overnight to give a free-flowing white solid. N,N-Dimethylacetamide was dried as described in Example 2. 4,4-Dinitrodiphenylmethane (0.069 g, 0.27 mmol) was placed in a 100 ml round bottomed flask with an oxygen feed, along with biphenyl (0.03 g, 0.2 mmol), the internal standard. Keeping the flask at ambient temperature, TMAHF, (0.0166, 0.015 mmol) was added, which slowly turned the mixture blue. After stirring overnight, the solution had become red. The solution was heated to 140 C. and a further quantity of TMAHF 2 (0.1841, 1.6 mmol) added. During the reaction, 4,4-dinitrobenzophenone, 4-fluoro-4-nitrobenzophenone and 4,4-difluorobenzophenone could be detected in the GC trace. After 4 hours, GC showed only the presence of 4-nitro-4-fluorobenzophenone (6% ) and 4,4-difluorobenzophenone (71%).

This is a Continuation of International Appln. No. PCT/NL97/00596 filed Oct. 30, 1997. This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/032,678, filed Dec. 9, 1996. The invention relates to a process for the continuous preparation of an alkyl 5-formylvalerate by reacting an alkyl 3-pentenoate with carbon monoxide and hydrogen by hydroformylation using a catalyst system comprising rhodium or iridium and a multidentate organic phosphite ligand according to the general formula: in which n is 2-6, X is an n-valent organic bridging group and in which the end groups R 1 -R 2 are monovalent aryl groups. Such a process is described in WO-A-9518089. This patent application describes a process in which methyl-5-formylvalerate is prepared with a selectivity of 80% starting from methyl 3-pentenoate using a catalyst system consisting of rhodium and a tetravalent organic phosphite, in which R 1 and R 2 are phenyl groups substituted on the ortho and para position with a tert-butyl group and X is a group according to C(CH 2 ) 4 . A disadvantage of this process is that the catalyst is not stable over a prolonged period of time. For example after some days of continuous operation the reaction rate will continuously drop due to deactivation of the catalyst. Deactivation of the catalyst is not desired when performing a continuous hydroformylation process especially in a large scale process. The object of this invention is a process with a reduced catalyst deactivation. This object is achieved in that the process is carried out in the presence of an acid compound having a pKa between 1 and 12 when measured in water of 18 C. It has been found that the catalyst activity can be stabilized over a prolonged period of time when such an acid is present. Moreover in spite of the addition of an acid no significant amount of 5-formylvaleric acid is formed due to acid catalyzed hydrolysis of the ester group of the alkyl 5-formylvalerate. The addition of an acid, such as aromatic compounds substituted with carboxylic or hydroxy groups, to a rhodium-organophosphite complex catalyzed hydroformylation process is known from EP-A-590613. The organophosphite ligands described in this application however differ from the ligand according to formula (1) in that the end groups of the bisphosphite ligands are connected to each other, forming a cyclic structure. The cyclic structure is present when two of the organic groups (groups like R 1 and R 2 ) are connected with each other. According to EP-A-590613 the catalyst deactivation is caused by the presence of this unique cyclic end group structure. The degradation product of the ligand described in EP-A-590613 is referred to as the poisoning phosphite having the corresponding cyclic structure. Such a poisoning phosphite however cannot be formed when a phosphite according to formula (1) is used. The acid is preferably present in an amount of 0.05 to 20 wt % during the hydroformylation reaction. More preferably between 0.1 and 1 wt %. The acid can be any acid with a pKa between 1 and 12 and preferably between 2.5 to 10, measured in water of 18 C. Examples of suitable acids are aromatic carboxylic acids, for example optionally substituted benzoic acid, p-chloro-benzoic acid, phthalic acid, aliphatic carboxylic acids, for example dicarboxylic acids having between 2-20 carbon atoms, for example adipic acid, glutaric acid and fumaric acid, mono carboxylic acids, for example valeric acid, butynic acid, decanoic acid, mono methyl adipate, mono methyl glutarate, phenols, for example phenol, cresol, p-methylphenol, bisphenols, bis--naphthol, dihydroxy naphthalene. Preferably the acid has a normal boiling point higher than 200 C. R 1 and R 2 in formula (1) are preferably the same or different monovalent aryl groups with 6 to 20 carbon atoms. It is to be understood that the various R 1 and R 2 groups can be different from each other. Preferably all R 1 and R 2 groups are the same because the resulting ligands are more readily available. Preferably R 1 and R 2 are monovalent aryl groups, for example phenyl, containing at least one group, R 3 , other than hydrogen in an ortho position relative to the oxygen atom, where R 3 is a C 1 to C 20 alkyl or C 6 -C 20 aryl group and preferably a C 1 -C 6 alkyl group. Other preferred monovalent aryl groups for R 1 and R 2 are monovalent fused aromatic ring systems with 2 or more rings having 10-20 carbon atoms. R 1 and R 2 can optionally be further substituted with for example C1-C10 alkyl, C 6 -C 20 aryl, C 1 -C 10 alkoxy, C 6 -C 20 aryloxy groups, triarylsilyl, trialkylsilyl, carboalkoxy, carboaryloxy, alkylcarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, oxazole, amide, amine or a nitrile or halogen groups, for example F, Cl or Br. When the aryl groups R 1 and R 2 are substituted with at least one R 3 -group in the ortho-position relative to the phenolic oxygen atom, higher linear selectivity is observed using these ligands in a hydroformylation process. Examples of these R 3 groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl or n-butyl. R 3 is preferably only one bulky group, having a steric hinderance of isopropyl or greater. When less bulky substituents are used preferably both ortho positions are substituted with these groups. Preferably R 1 and R 2 are 2-isopropylphenyl or 2-tert-butylphenyl groups. Another preferred class of aryl groups for R 1 and R 2 are fused aromatic ring systems with 2 or more rings having 10 to 20 carbon atoms which do not necessarily have to be substituted at the ortho position (on the carbon atom adjacent to the carbon atom which is bonded to the oxygen atom in formula (1)) with groups other than hydrogen. It has been found that when R 1 and/or R 2 is such an unsubstituted aromatic ring system, high catalyst activity, a high selectivity to terminal aldehyde and a high linearity can be achieved. Examples of such fused aromatic ring systems are phenanthryl, anthryl and naphthyl groups. Preferably 9-phenanthryl or 1-naphthyl groups are used. X is preferably an organic group having between 1 and 40 carbon atoms, and more preferably between 4 and 40 carbon atoms. Bidentate ligands, having a bivalent bridging group (n2), are most mentioned in the patent literature. Examples of bridging groups X can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,748,261, EP-A-556681 and EP-A-518241. Preferably the bridging group X is such that the multidentate phosphite ligand can form a chelate-type complex with the metal employed (rhodium or iridium) during the reaction conditions. By a chelate type complex is meant that (substantially) at least two phosphorus atoms of a ligand molecule form a coordinated bond with one rhodium or iridium atom/ion. By a non-chelate-type complex is meant that only one phosphorus P atom of a ligand molecule forms a coordinated bond with one rhodium or iridium atom/ion. The choice of bridging group X of the ligand will determine whether a chelate-type complex can be formed in the reaction zone. Examples of bridging groups which result in a ligand which can form a chelate-type bridging group are for example described in WO-A-9518089. Preferably bridging group X has a structure according to formula (2) or (3): in which Q is O, S or a CR 4 R 5 divalent group and m is 0 or 1 and R 4 and R 5 is hydrogen or a methyl group and Y and Z hydrogen or organic groups containing at least one carbon atom, and more preferably containing 1-20 carbon atoms. Preferably m0. Preferably Y and Z are individually selected from the, group of alkyl, aryl, triarylsilyl, trialkylsilyl, carboalkoxy, carboaryloxy, aryloxy, alkoxy, alkylcarbonyl, arylcarbonyl, oxazole, amide, amine or a nitrile. For Y and Z, the alkyl group is preferably a C 1 -C 10 alkyl group, for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, tert-butyl, isobutyl, pentyl or hexyl. An example of a suitable triarylsilyl group is triphenylsilyl and examples of a suitable trialkylsilyl group are trimethylsilyl and triethylsilyl. Preferred aryl groups have 6 to 20 carbon atoms, for example phenyl, benzyl, tolyl, naphthyl, anthranyl or phenanthryl. Preferred aryloxy groups have 6 to 12 carbon atoms, for example phenoxy. Preferred alkoxy groups have 1 to 20 carbon atoms, for example methoxy, ethoxy, tert-butoxy or isopropoxy. Preferred alkylcarbonylgroups have 2 to 12 carbon atoms, for example methylcarbonyl, tert-butylcarbonyl. Preferred arylcarbonyl groups have 7 to 13 carbon atoms, for example phenylcarbonyl. Preferred amide groups contain a C 1 -C 4 alkyl group and preferred amine groups contain two C 1 C 5 alkyl groups. Most preferably, Y and Z are individually a carboalkoxyl or a carboaryloxy group, CO 2 R 6 , in which R 6 is a C 1 -C 20 alkyl group or a C 6 -C 12 aryl group and preferably a C 1 -C 8 alkyl group. Examples of suitable R 6 -groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl, isobutyl, phenyl and tolyl. Even more preferably both Y and Z are the same carboaryloxy and more preferably the same carboalkoxyl group because the resulting ligands are more easily obtainable. The group according to formula (2) or (3) can optionally be further substituted with other groups, for example halogen, for example Cl or F or one of the substituents which may be present on the bridging group as described above. More preferably the bridging group is a 2,2-dihydroxy-1,1-binaphthalene bridging group according to formula (3) substituted as described above. It has been found that when using these ligand compounds a high selectivity to alkyl 5-formylvalerate can be achieved at a high reaction rate. The ligands having bridging groups according to formula (3) may be prepared by a variety of methods known in the art, for example, see descriptions in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,769,498; 4,688,651 and J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1993, 115, 2066. The organic bidentate phosphite compounds according to the invention can be prepared with the 3- or 3,3-substituted 2,2-dihydroxy-1,1-binaphthalene bridging compounds. The binaphthol bridging compounds can be prepared by procedures as described in Tetrahedron Lett. 1990, 31(3), 413-416 or in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954, 76, 296 and Org. Proc. Prep. International, 1991, 23, 200. The phosphite compounds can be prepared by using the process as described in the earlier mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,235,113 to couple these binaphthol bridging compounds with phosphorochloridites, (R 1 O)(R 2 O)PCl, prepared by treating R 1 OH and/or R 2 OH with PCl 3 . Examples of phosphite ligands which can be used in the process according to this invention are shown below. In the formulas the following fragments have the following meaning. /methyl, Lethyl, Phphenyl, isopropyl, Memethyl, tert-butyl The catalyst system used in the process according to this invention can be prepared by mixing a suitable rhodium or iridium compound with the phosphite ligand, optionally in a suitable solvent, in accordance with well-known complex-forming methods. The solvent will generally be the solvent used in the hydroformylation. Suitable rhodium and iridium compounds are for example hydrides, halides, organic acid salts, acetylacetonates, inorganic acid salts, oxides, carbonyl compounds and amine compounds of these metals. Examples of suitable catalyst precursors are, for example, Ir(CO) 2 (acac), Ir 4 (CO) 12 , RhCl 3 ,Rh(NO 3 ) 3 , Rh(OAc) 3 , Rh 2 O 3 , Rh(acac)(CO) 2 , Rh(CO) 2 (DPM), Rh(OAc)(COD) 2 , Rh 4 (CO) 12 , Rh 6 (CO) 16 , RhH(CO)(Ph 3 P) 3 , Rh(OAc)(CO) 2 2 , and RhCl(COD) 2 , (wherein acac is an acetylacetonate group; Ac is an acetyl group; COD is 1,5-cyclooctadiene; and Ph is a phenyl group, DPM is 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionate group). However, it should be noted that the rhodium and iridium compounds are not necessarily limited to the above listed compounds. The metal is preferably rhodium. In order to further improve the stability of the catalyst system it is preferred to add some organophosphorous compound which has a coordination strength to rhodium less than the multidentate phosphite ligand. Examples of suitable organophosphorous compounds are phosphites and monodentate phosphines. The presence of the organophosphorous compounds avoids oxidation of the phosphite ligand. Preferred phosphine compounds have a steric parameter of between 160-220. This preferred monodentate phosphine can be represented by the general formula P(R) 3 where the R groups are organic groups that are chosen so that the steric parameter of the phosphine is between 160 and 220, preferably between 170 and 210. The steric parameter is the top angle of a cylindrical cone, centred at 2.28 (10 10 m) from the centre of the phosphorus atom, which just touches the Van der Waals radii of the outer atoms of the R substituents of a symmetrical P(R) 3 -phosphine (see also Chemical Reviews, 1977, Volume 77, pp. 313-348 by C. A. Tolman and U.S. Pat. No. 4,169,861). The organic group R of the PR 3 phosphine is preferably an aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic group with 1-20 carbon atoms, preferably 5-12 carbon atoms, and the three R groups may be the same or different. The R group may contain one or more hetero atoms, for example oxygen, nitrogen or a halogen. Examples of monodentate phosphines according to the invention are tri(isopropylphosphine), tri(sec-butyl)phosphine, tribenzylphosphine, tricyclohexylphosphine, dicyclohexylphenylphosphine, di(t-butyl)phenylphosphine, trineopentylphosphine, tri(t-butyl)phosphine, tri-(o-hydroxyphenyl)phosphine, tri(o-methoxyphenyl)phosphine, tri(pentafluorophenyl)phosphine, tri(o-tolyl)phosphine and trimesityl-phosphine. A mixture of two or more of these compounds is also suitable for use as the monodentate phosphine. Preferably, the PR 3 phosphine is trineopentylphosphine, tri(t-butyl)phosphine or tri(o-tolyl)phosphine. Most preferably, tri(o-tolyl)phosphine is used as the monodentate phosphine in the process according to the invention. Tri(o-tolyl)phosphine is cheap, readily obtainable and shows a high effectiveness in small amounts. Examples of stabilizing phosphite compounds are triphenylphosphite, tri(p-tolyl)phosphite, tri(isopropyl)phosphite, tri(o-tolyl)phosphite, tri(o-isopropylphenyl)phosphite, tri(t-butyl)phosphite, tri(o-t-butylphenyl)phosphite, tri(2,6-dimethylphenyl)phosphite, tri(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphite, pentaerythyl -(2,4-di-t-butylphenylphosphite) and the commercially available Ultranox and Weston phosphite compounds of General Electric Plastics. Examples of preferred stabilizing phosphite compounds are tri(o-t-butylphenyl)phosphite, tri(2,6-dimethylphenyl)phosphite and tris (2,4-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphite. The alkyl group of the starting alkyl-3-pentenoate ester compound preferably has 1-20 and more preferably 1-6 carbon atoms. Examples of C 1 -C 6 alkyl-3-pentenoates are methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, isopropyl-, tert-butyl-, pentyl- and cyclohexyl-3-pentenoate. Preferably methyl- or ethyl 3-pentenoate is used as starting compound because these compounds are more readily available. The alkyl 3-pentenoate ester compound may be present in mixtures containing also alkyl 2- and/or alkyl 4-pentenoate compounds. The alkyl pentenoate mixture may have a composition of 0-10% alkyl 2-pentenoate, 0-30% alkyl 4-pentenoate and 60-100% 3-pentenoate in which the total of alkyl pentenoates add up to 100%. The alkyl 5-formylvalerate can advantageously be used in the preparation of -caprolactam or adipic acid, which are precursors for respectively Nylon-6 and Nylon-6.6. The hydroformylation process according to the invention can be performed as described below. The temperature is preferably between room temperature and 200 C., and more preferably from about 50 to 150 C. The pressure may vary from atmospheric pressure (0.1 MPa) to 20 MPa, preferably from 0.15 to 10 MPa and more preferably from 0.2 to 1 MPa. The pressure is generally equal to the combined hydrogen and carbon monoxide partial pressure. Extra inert gasses may however be present. The molar ratio hydrogen:carbon monoxide is generally between 10:1 and 1:10 and preferably between 6:1 and 1:2. The amount of rhodium or iridium (compound) is not specially limited, but is optionally selected so that favorable results can be obtained with respect to catalyst activity and process economics. In general, the concentration of rhodium or iridium in the reaction medium is between 10 and 10,000 ppm and more preferably between 50-1000 ppm, calculated as free metal. The molar ratio of bidentate phosphite ligand to rhodium or iridium is generally from about 0.5 to 100 and preferably from 1 to 10 (mol ligand/mol metal) and most preferably less than 1.2. Preferably the ratio is higher than 1.05. Small deviations in ligand or rhodium concentration will then not automatically result in a lower yield to alkyl 5-formylvalerate. It has been found that by performing the process with such a slight molar excess of ligand to rhodium (or iridium) the ligand degradation, due to other causes than oxidation, is decreased. When performing the process with a slight excess of ligand to rhodium (or iridium) it will be preferred to monitor the concentration (and degradation) of the ligand during the course of the continuous process and add fresh ligand in order to remain in the preferred ranges of operation. The choice of solvent is not critical provided the solvent is not detrimental to catalyst, reactant, and/or product. The solvent may be the mixture of reactants, such as the starting unsaturated compound, the aldehyde product and/or by-products. Suitable solvents include saturated hydrocarbons, for example kerosene, mineral oil or cyclohexane, ethers, for example diphenyl ether tetrahydrofuran or a polyethyleneglycol, for example Carbowax TM-400, ketones, for example methyl ethyl ketone or cyclohexanone, nitrites, for example 2-methylglutaronitrile or benzonitrile, aromatics, for example toluene, benzene or xylene, esters, for example methyl valerate or caprolactone, Texanol (Union Carbide), or dimethylformamide, sulfones (for example tetramethylenesulfone). The addition of extra water (apart from the water formed in the process) is not preferred. The hydroformylation can be performed in any kind of reactor which enables the reactants to be well mixed with the catalyst system and carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The continuous process is preferably performed by continuously removing part of the liquid reaction medium from the hydroformylation reactor. This mixture comprises the alkyl 5-formylvalerate, the catalyst system, optionally the solvent, by-products, unreacted alkyl pentenoate and carbon monoxide and hydrogen dissolved in said medium. In a first step any carbon monoxide and hydrogen is removed from this mixture by reducing the pressure in for example a flash operation. This carbon monoxide and hydrogen may be reused in the hydroformylation. The alkyl 5-formylvalerate, unreacted alkyl pentenoate and low boiling by-products, for example alkylvalerate, branched aldehydes and any formed water are preferably separated from the catalyst system in one or more distillation operations performed at reduced pressure. The pressure is preferably low enough to be able to perform the distillation at a temperature below 100 C. An example of a distillation unit is a rolled film evaporator. Another suitable separation method is membrane separation as for example described in WO-A-9634687. Other methods of performing this separation are of course also possible. The catalyst system is recycled to the hydroformylation reactor. Preferably any unreacted alkyl pentenoates are also recycled to the hydroformylation reactor. Any alkyl 2-pentenoate present is preferably converted to alkyl-3- or 4-pentenoate in a separate isomerization step before feeding the alkyl pentenoate mixture to the hydroformylation reactor. An example of such an isomerization process is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,874,889. The products which are separated from the catalyst system are preferably separated from each other by distillation. Other separation techniques, for example extraction and crystallization, are however also possible. The alkyl 5-formylvalerate is preferably separated from its branched by-products, alkyl 3- and alkyl 4-formylvalerate, by distillation. These branched products can be burned or decarbonylated to the alkyl pentenoate starting compound by well known processes. It has been found that it is very advantageous to contact the recirculating catalyst system with a basic compound, for example a basic resin, as described in WO-A-8503702 and EP-A-285136. It has been found that specific acids may form due to degradation of the phosphite ligand in the process according to the invention. It is believed, without being bound to any theory, that traces of these specific acids have an detrimental effect on the stability of the phosphite ligand. It is therefore advantageous to separate these acid compounds from the continuously circulating catalyst system to avoid a build up of these acids. The contacting with the basic compound may take place at any stage in which the catalyst composition is present. For example the reactor effluent can be contacted with the basic compound. Preferably the catalyst system is contacted with the basic compound after separating the aldehyde product from the catalyst system. Examples of basic compounds are metal oxides, for example CaO and MgO. Preferably heterogenic basic compounds are used and most preferably the basic compound is a resin having basic groups. Examples of possible basic groups are secondary or tertiary amine groups, according to -NHR or NR 2 , in which R is an organic group, preferably a C 1 -C 6 alkyl groups, more preferably methyl. Examples of commercially available resins which can be used are Amberlist A-21, A-22, A-23 and A-26 (Amberlist is a brand name of Rohm Haas). Because of the use of this basic resin it is necessary to use an excess of the acid in the process according to the invention, compared to the basic sites present in the resin. It is anticipated that the acid will bind to the basic sites but will be replaced by stronger acids like the above described ligand degradation products (hydroxy phosphites) thereby liberating the weaker acid which are present in the process according to this invention. Preferably, purge flows are present in the process to prevent an accumulation of by-products and the degradation products of the phosphite ligand complex. These purge flows mostly comprise an amount of the rhodium/phosphite catalyst system. The concentration of rhodium in such a purge flow will generally be higher than 100 ppm rhodium and lower than 2000 ppm rhodium. For a commercially interesting process it is necessary to recover the catalyst system comprising the rhodium/phosphite ligand complex from such a purge flow. The rhodium/phosphite ligand complex can advantageously by recovered from such purge flows using a membrane separation process as described in WO-A-9634687. The invention will be elucidated with the following non-limiting examples. EXAMPLE 1 A solution containing 5.6 grams of a bidentate phosphite ligand with structure: having a molweight of 1090 grams/mol, 1.10 grams of RhAcAc(CO) 2 , 16 grams tri-ortho-tolyl phosphine and 576 grams of m-xylene was prepared. A Hasteloy-B reactor with a nominal volume of 1 L was pressurized with CO and H 2 to 1 MPa (CO/H 2 1 (mol/mol)). The reactor was charged with 200 grams of the catalyst solution and 300 grams of freshly distilled methyl-3-pentenoate (M3P), heated to 95 C. and left to for two hours while continuously feeding CO and H 2 in a 1:1 ratio at a flow rate of 30 Nl/hr each to the autoclave. After these two hours a continuous feed to the autoclave of 90 grams/hr M3P and 80 grams/hr of catalyst solution was started originating from storage vessels containing these compounds. The catalyst solution feed was maintained until a total of 483 grams of solution was charged to the autoclave. The reactor pressure was subsequently reduced to 0.5 MPa. The level of liquid in the reactor was kept at a maximum of approximately 500 ml of liquid. Any excess liquid and any unreacted gasses will exit the reactor via a dip tube. This exit stream was let down to atmospheric pressure via a back pressure regulator and fed into a gas-liquid separator. The gas wasafter passing through a condensor to remove condensablesvented. The liquid was collected in the bottom of the gas liquid separator from where it is fed through a control valve to a first rolled film evaporator operated at 90 C. In this evaporator most of the unreacted M3P, light by-products and a small part of the methyl formylvalerate (MFV) products were evaporated under vacuum (approximately 0.05 MPa). The liquid residue obtained in the first evaporation was passed through a column filled with an amount of 7 grams of a weakly basic Amberlist A21 (ion exchange) resin. From there it was pumped to a second rolled film evaporator. In this evaporator the remainder of the unreacted M3P and light byproducts and part of the methylformylvalerate product was evaporated. The residue of the second evaporator was pumped back into the reactor thereby closing the loop. The temperature and the pressure of both evaporators were adjusted such that a constant liquid inventory of 1200 ml (if calculated back to the reactor) is maintained in the whole set-up as described above. Approximately 4 hours after starting the M3P feed all distillations and pumps were operating. After 16 hours the set-up reached stable operating conditions. The Rh concentration in the reactor was 280 ppm. A small excess of ligand to rhodium was detectable by liquid chromatography. From that time on ligand was fed to the system by feeding 2 ml an hour of a solution of 2.9 grams of the bidentate phosphite ligand in 360 grams of m-xylene. The concentration of mono methyl adipate was 0.01 wt % at the end of 65 hours of operation. It was found that the conversion of M3P at constant M3P feed rate and hold up time in the reactor dropped during this period of 65 hours continuously from 80% to 75% at a selectivity to M5FV dropping from 82.5 to 81.5%. After 65 hours 6 grams of the weak acid mono methyl adipate were charged to the system. From that time on until the conclusion of the experiment 100 hours later the conversion of M3P and thus the activity of the remaining catalyst speciesremained constant at 75%. The selectivity to MSFV increased from 81.5% to 82.5%. These results are summarized in Table 1. During the experiment no oxidation of the ligand was found to have occured. At the end of the experiment after 160 hours the tri-ortho-tolyl phosphine was found to be partly oxidized and the ligand concentration was 0.62 mgram/gram of reaction content. TABLE 1 reaction time (hours) 40 70 165 ligand/rhodium 1.05 1.10 1.20 (mol/mol) mono methyladipate 0.01 0.2 0.2 (wt %) conversion of M3P 79 75 75 (%) selectivity of methyl 82.5 81.5 82.5 5-formylvalerate (%) This example shows that when a continuous process is performed in the presence of a weak acid further deactivation of the catalyst is prevented. Comparative Experiment A Example 1 was repeated for 160 hours without adding any mono methyl adipate. During the experiment neither oxidation of the ligand nor formation of mono-methyl-adipate by oxidation of methyl 5-formylvalerate was found to have occured. The concentration of mono-methyl-adipate was 0.01 w % throughout the experiment. At the end of the experiment the tri-ortho-tolyl phosphine was found to be partly oxidized. It was found that the conversion of M3P at constant M3P feed rate and hold up time in the reactor dropped continuously from 80% to 70% with a selectivity dropping from 82.5% to 81%. Example 1 and comparison between Example 1 and Experiment A teaches that deactivation of the active catalyst species can be avoided by adding some acid to the process. EXAMPLE 2 Example 1 was repeated up to 16 hours after start up. The rhodium concentration was 300 ppm. 6.0 grams of mono methyladipate was added to the system. Ligand was fed to the process (in the same composition as described in Example 1) in such a rate that the ligand/rhodium molar ration was kept at a constant value of between 1.1-1.2 (mol/mol). This was done by constantly monitoring the ligand and rhodium concentration and adding fresh ligand to the system when the ligand concentration dropped due to ligand degradation. During the course of the experiment (runtime 260 hours) the conversion remained constant at 81% and the selectivity at 82%. The methyl 5-formylvalerate production was 75.5 grams/hr. The ligand degradation, determined by the rate of fresh ligand which had to be supplied to the process, is 0.22 grams per kilogram of methyl 5-formylvalerate produced by the process. EXAMPLE 3 Example 2 was repeated except that the ligand/rhodium molar ratio was kept at a constant value of 3 (mol/mol) at the same rhodium concentration. During the course of the experiment (runtime 260 hours) the conversion remained constant at 78% and the selectivity at 81.5%. The methyl 5-formylvalerate production was 72.3 grams/hr. The ligand degradation, determined by the rate of fresh ligand which had to be supplied to the process, is 0.96 grams per kilogram of methyl 5-formylvalerate produced by the process. As can be seen by comparing the rate of ligand degradation of Example 2 and 3 one can see that by performing the process at a slight excess of ligand to rhodium a significantly lower ligand consumption is achieved while the conversion and selectivity is hardly influenced. This is very advantageous, because the ligand cost per amount of methyl 5-formylvalerate can thus be reduced. What is claimed is: 1.
