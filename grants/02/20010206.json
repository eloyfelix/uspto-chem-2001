The therapeutically useful compounds of the invention as well as similar 5-N and N-6 substituted adenosine 5-uronamides are prepared, in accordance with a novel process, from isopropylidene (or otherwise suitably blocked) inosine-5-uronic acid. Isopropylideneinosine-5-uronic acid is reacted with a suitable inorganic acid halide, such as thionyl chloride, to yield 6-halogeno-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene--D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid halide-9H-purine. This intermediate is reacted with an amine of the general formula R 4 R 5 NH to give a 6-halogeno substituted, substituted uronic acid amide of the formula wherein X is halogen. Reaction of the latter intermediate with an amine of the formula R 1 NH 2 , and removal of the isopropylidene (or other) blocking groups yields the compounds of the invention.

The present invention is also directed to a process for making said compounds. 3. Brief Description of the Prior Art Adenosine has been known for a long time to possess certain cardiovascular activity and particularly coronary dilatory activity. In an effort to obtain adenosine analogs of greater potency, or longer duration of activity, or both, many analogs of this naturally occurring nucleoside have been synthesized and tested. Moreover, numerous studies have been conducted in order to elucidate the biochemical mechanism of action of adenosine and its analogs, and several theories and hypotheses have been proposed regarding biochemical pathways and receptor sites. For discussion of current theories regarding the foregoing, reference is made to the following articles and publications: Adenosine Receptors: Targets for Future Drugs, by John W. Daly, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 25, 197 (1982); Cardiovascular Effects of Nucleoside Analogs, by Herman H.

In addition to the foregoing publications, German Offenlegungschrift Nos. 2133273, 2426682, 1795761, 1913818, 2007273, 2238923, 2060189, 2244328, 1814711, 2136624, South African Patent Application No. 677630 (filed on Dec. 20, 1967) and British Patent Specification No. 1,123,245 describe adenosine derivatives which have cardiovascular, coronary dilator or antilipolytic activities. Still more adenosine derivatives having beneficial cardiovascular activity are described in another application for U.S. Letters Patent of the present inventors, Ser. No. 601,435, filed on Apr. 18, 1984. Still further, Published Japanese Patent Application Nos. 58-167599 and 58-167600 disclose adenosine 5-carboxamide derivatives which have fibrinolysis accelerating activity. U.S. Pat. No. 4,029,334 discloses anti-hypertensive and anti-anginal adenosine 5-carboxamide derivatives where the N 6 amino group is unsubstituted. U.S. Pat. No. 4,167,565 discloses adenosine 5-carboxamide derivatives which have substituents both in the N 6 and 5-carboxamido position, and which are useful as poisons for certain noxious animals, such as rodents and coyotes. In the cardiovascular and anti-hypertensive field, however, the therapeutic utility of the natural nucleoside adenosine and many of its analogs is limited because the desired beneficial effect is often of relatively short duration. More particularly, the short duration of the beneficial cardiovascular effects of adenosine and those of its analogs which have an unsubstituted hydroxyl group at C-5 of the ribofuranose moiety is usually attributed to rapid penetration into cells followed by enzymatic conversion into less active or impermeant metabolites. For example, adenosine deaminase converts adenosine into inosine, which is a weak cardiovascular agonist. Alternatively, phosphorylation, catalyzed by adenosine kinase, forms adenylic acid (5-AMP). Ionization of the phosphate group under physiological conditions prevents the escape of 5-AMP from the cells in which it is formed. Thus trapped, 5-AMP cannot exert its cardiovascular actions, which are mediated by cell surface receptors, as is discussed below. Some known adenosine analogs, however, cannot be phosphorylated in the 5 position because the 5 position is effectively blocked. 5-N-Ethylcarboxamidoadenosine NECA (Compound 1 in General Formula 1) is an example of such an adenosine analog incapable of phosphorylation by adenosine kinase. Nevertheless, this compound binds potently to certain adenosine receptor sites and exhibits substantial cardiovascular activity. Other examples of known derivatives of adenosine-5-carboxamide, (Compound 2) and of adenosine-5-carboxylic acid (Compound 9) are shown below in General Formulae 1 and 2. Generally speaking, in these compounds, the 5-carboxylate or 5-carboxamide group of the uronic acid moiety is substituted with lower alkyl or lower acyl groups. Some of the adenosine-5-carboxamide derivatives shown in General Formula 1 are disclosed in Chemical Abstracts Volume 100, 68652c and 68653d (1984) and in the corresponding Published Japanese Patent Application Nos. 58-167599 and 58-167600. The biological activity of adenosine-5-carboxamide derivatives, such as NECA, is thought to be due to the activation of adenylate cyclase through cell surface R a or A 2 receptors. Structure-activity studies show that the R a receptor recognizes the alkyl uronamide moiety of NECA and its congeners. A second type of cell surface adenosine receptor designated R i or A 1 inhibits the catalytic activity of adenylate cyclase. Adenosine analogs possessing certain N-6 alkyl or aralkyl substituents such as cyclohexyl or R-1-phenyl-2-propyl are selective agonists at R i receptors. Many mammalian and human cells contain both R a and R i receptors; examples of exceptions are fat cells which contain R i receptors only, and blood platelets and human placenta, in which R a receptors predominate. Currently available agonists are only selective, not absolutely specific, for R a and R i receptors. Because the two types of receptors coexist in many organs, including brain and heart, even a selective agonist will activate both to a certain degree. A goal of pharmaceutical chemistry is the development of agonists which are as nearly specific as possible because unselectivity can be a source of side effects. The prior art makes no prediction about receptor selectivity of adenosine analogs which contain, in the same molecule, the recognition groups which confer specificity for R a and R i receptors. Many of the known adenosine derivatives, including the above-noted N-6 substituted and the 5-carboxamide derivatives are less than satisfactory as cardiovascular or antihypertensive drugs for animal and human use. This is either because of low activity, short duration of the desired activity, undue toxicity or undesirable side effects. Undesirable side effects of cardiovascularly active adenosine analogs often include cardiac depression. In light of the foregoing, the pharmaceutical industry is still striving to obtain adenosine analogs having high cardiovascular and hypotensive potency coupled with other optimal physiological characteristics, such as relatively long duration of the desired activity, low toxicity and minimal side effects. The compounds of the present invention constitute a step in this direction. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide adenosine analogs which have potent and prolonged cardiovascular activity in mammals and humans, coupled with relatively low toxicity and minimal side effects. It is another object of the present invention to provide adenosine analogs which have potent or prolonged anti-hypertensive activity in mammals and humans, coupled with relatively low toxicity and minimal side effects. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a relatively efficient synthetic process for the preparation of the adenosine derivatives which meet the above-noted objectives. The foregoing and other objects and advantages are attained by compounds of the General Formula 3, wherein R 1 represents secondary alkyl; hydroxy, lower alkoxy or halogen substituted secondary alkyl; aralkyl; aralkyl substituted in the aromatic nucleus with hydroxy, halogen, lower alkoxy or lower alkyl groups; cycloalkyl; hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkyl or halogen substituted cycloalkyl; para-substituted phenyl; heteroaryl substituted alkyl; heteroaryl substituted alkyl substituted in the heteroaryl nucleus with hydroxy, halogen, lower alkoxy or lower alkyl groups; norbornyl, and hydroxy, alkyl or halogen substituted norbornyl groups. The substituent R 2 and R 3 groups in the compounds of the present invention, as shown in General Formula 3, are hydrogen, or pharmacologically acceptable organic acyl groups, or inorganic acid radicals, such as NO 2 groups, which esterify the hydroxyl groups of the ribofuranose moiety. The R 2 and R 3 groups are preferably of the type which are relatively readily hydrolyzed under physiological conditions. The R 2 and R 3 substituents need not be identical with one another. Still further, in the compounds of General Formula 3, the substituent R 4 is straight chain lower alkyl having 1-4 carbon atoms; hydroxy, lower alkoxy or halogen substituted straight chain lower alkyl having 1-4 carbon atoms; cyclopropyl; secondary alkyl having 3-6 carbon atoms; hydroxy, lower alkoxy or halogen substituted secondary alkyl having 3-6 carbon atoms; alkenyl having 3 to 6 carbon atoms; aralkyl having 1 to 4 carbons in the alkyl chain; aralkyl having 1 to 4 carbons in the alkyl chain and substituted in the aryl nucleus with hydroxy, halogen, lower alkoxy or lower alkyl groups; heteroarylalkyl having 1 to 4 carbons in the alkyl chain; and heteroarylalkyl having 1 to 4 carbons in the alkyl chain and substituted in the heteroaryl nucleus with hydroxy, halogen, lower alkoxy or lower alkyl groups. R 5 is hydrogen, or straight chain lower alkyl having 1 to 4 carbons. The compounds of the present invention are resistant to enzymatic phosphorylation and to deamination by adenosine deaminase. The compounds exhibit significant cardiovascular activity. In accordance with a novel process of the invention, the compounds of General Formula 3 are obtained from 2,3-O-isopropylideneinosine-5-uronic acid by treatment with a suitable inorganic acid halide, such as thionyl chloride, to yield the intermediate, 6-chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene--D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid chloride-9H-purine. The intermediate, 6-chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene--D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid chloride-9H-purine, (or the corresponding bromide, if, for example thionyl bromide is used instead of thionyl chloride) is usually not isolated in a pure state. The acid chloride moiety of 6-chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene--D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid chloride-9H-purine (or the acid bromide of the corresponding bromo- analog) is significantly more readily displaced by nucleophilic reagents than the halide group in the 6 position of the purine moiety. Therefore, in accordance with the process of the present invention, 6-chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene--D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid chloride-9H purine is reacted with a first nucleophilic reagent having the formula R 4 ,R 5 -NH (General Formula 4) to yield an intermediate substituted carboxamide shown in General Formula 5, wherein the halide is retained in the 6position of the purine moiety. The intermediate of General Formula 5 is subsequently reacted with a nucleophile having the formula R 1 - NH 2 (General Formula 6) and the isopropylidene blocking group is removed with acid to yield the compounds of the invention (General Formula 3), having free hydroxyl groups in the 2 and 3 positions of the ribofuranose moiety. Instead of the isopropylidene blocking group, other acid stable blocking groups can also be used to protect the 2OH and 3OH groups of the ribofuranose moiety during the step of treatment with the inorganic acid halide. The groups R 1 , R 4 and R 5 in General Formulae 4-6 are defined the same as in General Formula 3. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Certain derivatives of 5-carboxamidoadenosine wherein both the amino nitrogen (N-6) of the purine moiety and the amino nitrogen of the 5-carboxamido moiety are substituted, have been found, in accordance with the present invention, to possess significant cardiovascular and/or anti-hypertensive activity. The compounds of the invention have the composition characterized by General Formula 3. The substituent R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 and R 5 groups are defined above in the summary description of the present invention.

The second substituent on the 5-carboxamido nitrogen, R 4 , is hydrogen, or straight chain lower alkyl having 1 to 4 carbons. The R 2 and R 3 substituents on the hydroxyl groups of the ribofuranose moiety are the same as described above in connection with the compounds of General Formulae 7, 8, and 9. Specific examples of compounds of the subclass of General Formula 10, where the R 2 and R 3 substituents are hydrogen, are: Compound 17: R 1 is ethyl, R 4 is H; Compound 28: R 1 is methyl, R 4 is H; Compound 29: R 1 is isopropy, R 4 is H; Compound 30: R 1 is 3-pentyl, R 4 is H; Compound 31: R 1 is allyl, R 4 is H; Compound 32: R 1 is (2-methyl)propyl, R 4 is H; Compound 33: R 1 is cyclopropyl, R 4 is H; Compound 35 R 1 is phenylmethyl, R 4 is H; Compound 36 R 1 is 2-methoxyphenylmethyl, R 4 is H; Compound 37 R 1 is 2-thienylmethyl, R 4 is H; Compound 38 R 1 is 2-phenylethyl, R 4 is H; Compound 39 R 1 is methyl, R 4 is methyl; Compound 40 R 1 is n-butyl, R 4 is methyl; Compound 41 R 1 is ethyl, R 4 is ethyl; The physical characteristics and biological activity of specific examples of the compounds of the present invention are noted below together with certain biological activity data.

PROCESS FOR MAKING THE COMPOUNDS OF THE INVENTION The compounds of the present invention are prepared in accordance with a novel process of the invention from a suitably blocked derivative of inosine-5-uronic acid, such as 2,3-O-isopropylideneinosine-5-uronic acid (Compound 43). 2,3-O-isopropylideneinosine-5-uronic acid (Compound 43) is readily obtained from inosine by treatment with acetone to block the 2- and 3- hydroxy groups of the ribofuranose moiety, followed by oxidation with chromic acid, in accordance with the published procedure of R. R. Schmidt and H. J. Fritz, Chemische Berichte., 103, 1867 (1970). 2,3-O-isopropylideneinosine-5-uronic acid (Compound 43) is treated in accordance with the process of the present invention, with a suitable inorganic acid halide, such as thionyl chloride, to convert, in the same reaction step, the uronic acid moiety into a uronic acid halide and to introduce a halogen substitutent into the 6 position of the purine moiety. In this regard it is noted that the blocking groups of the 2 and 3 hydroxyl groups must be capable of withstanding the conditions of this reaction, which is advantageously conducted in neutral solvents, such as chloroform, in the presence of dimethylformamide or other dialkylamides. The isopropylidene blocking group serves well for this purpose. Nevertheless, other ketal, acetal or even acyl blocking groups are also suitable. Instead of thionyl chloride other inorganic acid halides, such as thionyl bromide, may also be used. The product of the just described first step of the novel reaction sequence is 6-chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene--D-ribofuranosyl 5-uronic acid chloride-9H-purine (Compound 44). The reaction sequence leading to the compounds of the present invention, using the example of 6-chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene--D-ribofuranosyl 5-uronic acid chloride)-9H-purine (Compound 44) as the important intermediate, is shown in Reaction Scheme 1. 6-chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene--D-ribofuranosyl-5-uronic acid chloride-9H-purine (Compound 44) is preferably not isolated in a pure state. Rather, it is reacted with an amine of the General Formula 4 to displace the halide of the uronic acid moiety and to provide compounds of the General Formula 5, wherein the halogen in the 6 position of the purine nucleus is retained. This selective displacement of the acid chloride group is readily conducted in neutral solvents, such as chloroform, preferably at low temperature. The intermediates of General Formula 5, may be isolated in a purified state. They are subsequently reacted with a nucleophilic amine of General Formula 6 in a suitable solvent such as ethyl alcohol, to displace the halogen substituent in the 6 position of the purine nucleus. The displacement reaction is preferably conducted in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as triethyl amine. The blocking groups of the 2 and 3 hydroxyls of the ribofuranose moiety are thereafter removed to provide the compounds of the invention (General Formula 3). Removal of the isopropylidene blocking groups is affected, for example, by heating with aqueous hydrochloric acid. These steps are illustrated in the continuation of Reaction Scheme 1. In the formulae shown in Reaction Scheme 1, the definition of the substituent R groups is the same as was given above in connection with the respective general formulae. Specific examples of the steps of the novel process of the present invention for the preparation of ethyl N 6 -(3-pentyl)adenosine-5-uronamide (Compound 17) and of N,N-dimethyl N 6 -(3-pentyl)adenosine-5-uronamide (Compound 39) are given below. Actually, the invention of the herein disclosed novel process is broader than the preparation of the herein disclosed compounds having beneficial cardiovascular or anti-hypertensive properties. In a broad sense, a multitude of N-6 and 5-N substituted adenosine 5-uronamides can be synthesized in accordance with the process of the present invention. The compounds which are obtainable by the process of the present invention include, in addition to the compounds described above, those compounds wherein the carboxamido nitrogen is mono or di substituted with alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, and heterocyclyl groups. The carboxamido nitrogen (5-N) can also be a member of a saturated heterocyclic ring such as a piperidine or morpholine ring. An alternative process for the preparation of at least some of the compounds of the present invention comprises the steps of oxidizing N-6 substituted adenosine derivatives which are suitably protected (for example by isopropylidene or benzyl groups) on the 2 and 3 hydroxyl groups. The step of oxidation is conducted in analogy to the procedure published by R. R. Schmidt and H. J. Fritz in Chemische Berichte, 103, 1867 (1970). The N-6 substituted adenosine derivatives can be obtained by reaction of 6-chloro--D-ribofuranosyl-9H-purine with the suitable amine. The resulting uronic acid is then converted to the corresponding acid halide by treatment, for example, with thionyl chloride, in analogy to the process which was described above. The resulting uronic acid halide is thereafter reacted with a primary amine bearing the desired R 4 and R 5 substituents. After removal of the protecting groups from the ribofuranosyl moiety, the compounds of the present invention are obtained. 6-Chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene-5-ethylcarboxamido--D-ribofuranosyl-9H-purine (Compound 45). A mixture of 2,3-O-isopropylideneinosine-5-uronic acid (6.5 g, 20 mmols), thionyl chloride (4 ml, 53.3 mmols), dry dimethylformamide (1.5 ml, 40 mmols) and dry chloroform (250 ml) was refluxed for 4 to 5 hours. The chloroform was removed in vacuo to give a syrup. The syrup was dissolved in dry chloroform (80 ml), and the resulting solution was added to a mixture of ethylamine (14 mi) and dry chloroform (150 ml) at 10 C. The mixture was stirred for one hour at 10 C., and then poured into cold water (300 ml). The resulting organic layer was separated and washed in succession with aqueous hydrochloric acid (10%, 2200 ml), aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (saturated, 1200 ml) and water (1100 ml), and dried over magnesium sulfate. The chloroform solvent was removed in vacuo to give 6.3 g (85% yield) of a slightly yellow solid. The product is usable in the subsequent reaction steps without further purification. Ethyl N 6 -(3-pentyl)adenosine-5-uronamide, (Compound 17) A mixture of 6-Chloro-9-2,3-O-isopropylidene-5-ethylcarboxamido--D-ribofuranosyl-9H-purine (Compound 45) (6.3 g, 17.1 mmols), 3-pentylamine (1.6 g, 18.4 mmols), triethylamine (4.7 ml, 34 mmols) and absolute ethanol (200 ml) was refluxed for about 48 hours, or until thin layer chromatography indicated complete reaction. The ethanol was removed in vacuo and the product purified by chromatography on a silica gel column eluted with chloroform/acetone 16:1. Evaporation of fractions containing product yielded a syrup which was heated for 1.5 hours with aqueous hydrochloric acid (1.0 N, 100 ml) at 70 C. Upon cooling it yielded Compound 17 as white crystals. Recrystallization from ethanol yielded white needles, (4.5 g, 70% yield). The physical characteristics and analytical data of Compound 17 were described above. Dimethyl N 6 -(3-pentyl)adenosine-5-uronamide (Compound 39) from 2,3-O-isopropylideneinosine-5-uronic acid (Compound 43) A mixture of 2,3-O-isopropylideneinosine-5-uronic acid (5.0 g; 15.5 mmols) thionyl chloride (2.5 ml; 33.3 mmols) dry dimethylformamide (1.25 ml; 18.1 mmols) and dry chloroform (170 ml) was refluxed for 5 hours. The solvents were removed in vacuo to give a syrup. The syrup was dissolved in dry chloroform (50 ml) and the resulting solution was added to a mixture of dimethylamine (20 ml, 302 mmols) and dry chloroform (150 ml) at 10 C. The mixture was stirred for 15 minutes after the addition was complete, and thereafter poured into cold water (300 ml). The organic phase was separated and washed successively with water (1100 ml), 10% aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (2100 ml), saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, and was thereafter dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The chloroform solvent was removed in vacuo to give a syrup. The syrup was refluxed for 48 hours (or until thin layer chromatography indicated complete reaction) with 3-pentylamine (2.3 ml; 20 mmols), triethylamine (2.8 ml, 20 mmols) and anhydrous ethanol (100 ml). The solvent and volatile reagents were removed in vacuo to give a syrup (blocked nucleoside). The blocked (isopropylidine) nucleoside was purified by C-18 high performance low pressure liquid chromatography (HPLPLC), methanol-water (70%) being used as the eluent. The solvent was removed in vacuo from the appropriate fractions, to yield a light yellow solid which was thereafter heated at 70 C. for 1.5 hours in 2N aqueous hydrochloric acid (100 ml). Cooling and neutralization with solid sodium bicarbonate yielded Compound 39 as a white syrup, which was crystallized from methanol/water to give 4.0 g (68%) of colorless needles. The physical characteristics and analytical data of Compound 39 were described above. BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY AND PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES The cardiovascular and anti-hypertensive activities of the compounds of the present invention were determined in bioassays conducted on dogs and spontaneously hypertensive rats. More particularly, in one type of assay in which the activity of the compounds of the present invention was determined, the compounds to be tested are infused intracoronarily into either open-chest anesthetized or conscious dogs. Adenosine has a demonstrable coronary dilator effect under these conditions. The concentration of the test compound in coronary plasma which causes half-maximal vasodilation is designated ED-50. More specifically, ED-50 is determined in the following manner. Late diastolic coronary conductance (LDCC) of the experimental dog is monitored through suitable instrumentation. Late diastolic coronary conductance is measured at maximum coronary vasodilation (peak reactive hyperemid), and is designated LDCC max . Late diastolic coronary conductance is also measured at basal coronary vasodilation, and is designated LDCC 0 . The difference between instantaneously measured late diastolic coronary conductance (LDCC) and basal late diastolic coronary conductance (LDCC 0 ) is expressed as a fraction of the difference between maximum late diastolic coronary conductance (LDCC max ) and basal late diastolic coronary conductance (LDCC 0 ). Thus, LDCC is defined by Equation I. As the concentration of the test compound is varied, and the corresponding LDCC is obtained through measurements and the above-summarized calculations, data of an LDCC versus concentration function or plot are obtained. ED-50 is derived from these data by log-logit transformation of the LDCC versus concentration plot; namely by solving the linear regression of logit (LDCC) on log (concentration) for LDCC0.5. When ED-50 of a tested compound is compared to ED-50 of adenosine in the same dog, as is set forth in EQUATION II, then the resulting molar potency ratio (mpr) provides good comparison of the cardiovascular activity of the tested compound with cardivascular activity of other compounds in the same or other experimental dogs. Thus, molar potency ratio (mpr) is a useful measure of the cardiovascular vasodilatory effect, and hence of the utility of the tested compounds. The greater the vasodilatory effect of a tested compound, the larger the corresponding molar potency ratio (mpr). For a more detailed description of the bioassay used for determining molar potency ratios, reference is made to an article written by Olsson et al., and titled Coronary Vasoactivity of Adenosine in the Conscious Dog, Circulation Research, 45, 468 (1979). Molar potency ratios of the specific examples of the compounds of the present invention are listed above next to the detailed description of the specific compounds. These data demonstrate that the compounds are cardiovascularly active. In another assay for the anti-hypertensive activity of the compounds of the invention, blood pressure of unanesthetized, unheated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) is measured indirectly (through a tail cuff) usually at 2, 4, and 6 hours after oral administration of a single dose of the compounds of the invention. Reduction in mean blood pressure by more than ten per cent (10%) indicates anti-hypertensive activity. The test itself, is well established in the art and need not described here in further detail. The data obtained in the hypertensive rat (SHR) assay are indicated next to the description of the compounds. In the data, the percentage reduction of blood pressure in 2, 4 and 6 hours after the single oral dose is indicated in parentheses. A * sign after the data shows that the measured reduction of blood pressure occurred 1, 2, and 3 hours after the oral dose; a sign indicates that the measured reduction occurred in 1, 2 and 2.5 hours after the oral dose. The data demonstrate the anti-hypertensive activity of the compounds of the invention. An assay for the affinity of some of the compounds of the present invention for R a receptors employs a modification of the radioligand displacement method described by Fox and Kurpis in The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Volume 258 pages 6952-55 (1983). Briefly, this method comprises the steps of incubating 3 HNECA and the analogs to be tested, with human placenta membrane particles, a source of R a receptors. The particles are then filtered, washed with a buffer to remove unbound ligand and then the amount of bound radioligand is measured. By varying the concentration of the competing analog one may estimate an index of binding affinity, IC-50, the concentration of which causes half-maximum displacement of 3 HNECA. Using 3 HNECA in this assay instead of 3 H-2-chloroadenosine is a modification of the original method. The compounds of the present invention were found to compete weakly, or not at all, with 3 Hethyladenosine-5-uronamide at R a receptor sites of human placenta. The foregoing indicates that the compounds of the present invention are selective to R a receptors of the cardiovascular system. Such selectivity would not be expected on the basis of prevailing prior art theory. Further advantages of the compounds of the present invention include their inability to undergo phosphorylation in the 5-position, and their stability to acid. Therefore, the therapeutic effect of the compounds of the present invention is unlikely to be eliminated by the action of phosphorylating enzymes, and the compounds are unlikely to be incorporated into DNA or RNA. As is known, incorporation into RNA or DNA is likely to cause teratogenic, mutagenic or carcinogenic effects. Moreover, because the compounds of the present invention are stable to acid (they survive heating with 1N aqueous HCl for 1.5 hour at 70 C.) they are capable of surviving the acidic conditions prevailing in the stomach. Therefore, they are suitable as drugs for oral administration to humans and animals. Various modifications of the herein disclosed invention, in terms of structural modifications of the invented compounds and also in terms of making or using the same, may become readily apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the above disclosure. For example the compounds of the present invention may be administered as pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Inasmuch as the compounds of the present invention are useful as cardiac vasodilators, cardivascular, and particularly as anti-hypertensive agents in mammals, domestic animals and humans, various modes of administering the compounds will be apparent to a person having average skill in the art. Such modes of administering the compounds include oral and topical administration, and intravenous infusion. One having average skill in the art may readily prepare suitable formulations for the above-mentioned and other modes of administering the compounds of the invention.

circle replication reporter systems", "abstract": "Disclosed are compositions and a method for of amplifying nucleic acid sequences useful for detecting the presence of molecules of interest. The method is useful for detecting specific nucleic acids in a sample with high specificity and sensitivity. The method also has an inherently low level of background signal. A preferred form of the method consists of a DNA ligation operation, an amplification operation, and a detection operation. The DNA ligation operation circularizes a specially designed nucleic acid probe molecule. This operation is dependent on hybridization of the probe to a target sequence and forms circular probe molecules in proportion to the amount of target sequence present in a sample. The amplification operation is rolling circle replication of the circularized probe. A single round of amplification using rolling circle replication results in a large amplification of the circularized probe sequences. Following rolling circle replication, the amplified probe sequences are detected and quantified using any of the conventional detection systems for nucleic acids such as detection of fluorescent labels, enzyme-linked detection systems, antibody-mediated label detection, and detection of radioactive labels. Because, the amplified product is directly proportional to the amount of target sequence present in a sample, quantitative measurements reliably represent the amount of a target sequence in a sample. Major advantages of this method are that the ligation step can be manipulated to obtain allelic discrimination, the DNA replication step is isothermal, and signals are strictly quantitative because the amplification reaction is linear and is catalyzed by a highly processive enzyme. In multiplex assays, the primer oligonucleotide used for the DNA polymerase reaction can be the same for all probes. Also described are modes of the method in which additional amplification is obtained using a cascade of strand displacement reactions.", "related_docs": [], "pct_data": [], "external_files": [{"file": "US06183960-20010206-C00001.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "description", "compounds": ["CC(C)(C)(C)(C)(C)(C)C", "C"]}]}, {"publication": {"country": "US", "doc_number": "06183967", "kind": "B2", "date": "20010206"}, "application": {"country": "US", "doc_number": "09258797", "date": "19990301"}, "series_code": "09", "ipc_classes": ["C12Q168", "C12Q1934", "C07H2102", "C07H2104", "C12N912"], "cpc_classes": [], "applicants": [], "inventors": [{"first_name": "Sumedha", "last_name": "Jayasena", "city": "Boulder", "state": "CO", "country": "US"}, {"first_name": "Larry", "last_name": "Gold", "city": "Boulder", "state": "CO", "country": "US"}], "assignees": [{"organization": "NeXstar Pharmaceuticals", "first_name": null, "last_name": null, "city": "Boulder", "state": "CO", "country": "US"}], "title": "Nucleic acid ligand inhibitors to DNA polymerases", "abstract": "This invention discloses high-affinity oligonucleotide ligands to the thermostable Taq polymerase, Tth polymerase and TZ05 polymerase.

An embodiment of the present invention is that when q is 2, O(CR 3 R 4 ) q is O(CHCH 3 CHCH 3 ), O(C(CH 3 ) 2 CH 2 ) or O(CH 2 C(CH 3 ) 2 ). Preferred are those compounds in which in X the heterocycle is selected from 1,2,4-oxadiazolyl, oxazolinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrazolyl, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrolyl, tetrazolyl, 1,2,3-thiadiazolyl, 1,3,5-triazinyl, and 1,2,4-triazolyl, optionally substituted with halogen, cyano, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, alkoxyalkyl, or haloalkoxyalkyl, and the optional linkage is selected from O, (CH 2 ) p , or O(CHR 3 ) q ; R 1 and R 2 are independently selected from trifluoromethylphenyl, trifluoromethoxyphenyl, trifluoromethylpyridyl, trifluoromethoxypyridyl, pentafluorothiophenyl, trifluoromethylthiophenyl, trifluoromethylsulfinylphenyl, trifluoromethylsulfonylphenyl, 2,2-dihalo-1,3-benzodioxolyl, pentafluorothiopyridyl, trifluoromethylthiopyridyl, trifluoromethylsulfinylpyridyl, trifluoromethylsulfonylpyridyl, and 2,2-dihalo-1,3-dioxoleno4,5-bpyridyl; n is 1, and p and q are independently 1 or 2; with the proviso that halogen means chlorine or fluorine; and the corresponding N-oxides and agriculturally acceptable salts.

The compounds of the present invention were prepared by methods generally known to those skilled in the art. In the method shown in Schema 1, where R 1 and R 2 are the same, ethyl piperidin4-ylcarboxylate was reacted with either an appropriately substituted alkyl halide, for example, 4-methoxyphenylmethyl bromide, or with an appropriately substituted aldehyde under reductive conditions, for example, 4-phenoxybenzaldehyde, affording the corresponding ethyl N-substituted alkylpiperidin-4-ylcarboxylate (A). Intermediate (A) was then treated with more than two molar equivalents of the Grignard reagent of an appropriately substituted halide, for example, 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl magnesium bromide, yielding the desired N-(substituted alkyl)4-bis(substituted)hydroxymethypiperidine (I), for example, N-(4-methoxyphenylmethyl)-4bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 1). Example 1 provides a detailed description of how these reactions are conducted. Compound (I) of the present invention, as depicted in Schema 1, can be further reacted to obtain additional compounds within the scope of Compound (I). For example, compounds where R 1 and R 2 are phenyl substituted with haloalkylthio can be converted to the corresponding compounds where R 1 and R 2 are phenyl substituted with haloalkylsulfinyl or haloalkylsulfonyl by the mild oxidation of the haloalkylthio moiety with sodium perborate Synth. Commun.; 1993, 23 (6), 765-769. Another method, again for cases where R 1 and R 2 are the same, is shown in Schema 2. In this method ethyl piperidin-4-ylcarboxylate is reacted with diethyl carbamoyl chloride, under basic conditions, affording the corresponding intermediate, ethyl N-diethylaminocarbonylpiperidin-4-yl-carboxylate (B). Intermediate (B) is treated with more than two molar equivalents of the Grignard reagent of an appropriately substituted halide, yielding the corresponding N-diethylaminocarbonyl-4-bis(substituted phenyl or pyridyl)hydroxymethylpiperdine (C). Intermediate (C) is then treated with lithium aluminum hydride, affording the 4-bis(substituted phenyl or pyridyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (II), for example, 4-bis(4trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine. As depicted in Schema 2a, intermediate (II) may be reacted with either an appropriately substituted alkyl halide or with an appropriately substituted aldehyde, as previously described, affording the desired N-(substituted alkyl)-4-bis(substituted phenyl or pyridyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (I), for example, N-4-(2-methyltetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 9). For the preparation of those compounds in which R 1 and R 2 may be pyridyl, the appropriate pyridyl bromide is lithiated at 78 C. with tert-butyllithium, and the resulting product is used as described for the magnesium Grignard reagents. The preparation of intermediate (II) using the method described above provided relatively low yields of (II). In a preferred method to prepare the intermediate 4-bis(substituted phenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (II), ethyl piperidin-4-ylcarboxylate was reacted with chlorotrimethylsilane under basic conditions in diethyl ether, affording ethyl N-(trimethylsilyl)piperidin-4-yl-carboxylate. The so-prepared ethyl carboxylate was then reacted with more than two molar equivalents of the Grignard reagent of an appropriately substituted halide, a method previously described, affording intermediate (II) Both steps of this method provided product in good yield. Example 3 provides a detailed description of how this reaction is conducted. Schema 3 shows this method. The intermediate 4-bis(substituted phenyl or pyridyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (II) described above, can also be reacted, as shown in Schema 2a, with an appropriately substituted acid chloride, for example, 4-(1-methyltetrazol-5-yl)benzoyl chloride, under basic conditions, yielding the corresponding N-(substituted carbonyl)-4-bis-(substituted phenyl or pyridyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (G). Intermediate (G) is reduced with borane-methyl sulfide complex, affording the desired N-(substituted alkyl)-4-bis(substituted)hydroxymethylpiperidine (I), for example, N-4-(1-methyltetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 8). Schema 4 shows the method used when R 1 and R 2 are not the same. Here 4-aminocarbonylpiperidine is reacted with an appropriately substituted alkyl halide, for example, 4-(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)phenylmethyl chloride, under basic conditions, affording the corresponding N-(substituted alkyl)-4-aminocarbonylpiperidine (H). Treatment of intermediate (H) with phosphorous oxychloride yields the corresponding N-(substituted alkyl)-4-cyanopiperidine (J), which is in turn reacted with the Grignard reagent of an appropriately substituted halide, for example, 2-trifluoromethoxyphenylmagnesium bromide, yielding the corresponding N-(substituted alkyl)-4-(substituted carbonyl)piperidine (K). Intermediate (K) is reacted with a different Grignard reagent of an appropriately substituted halide, for example, 4-trifluoromethoxyphenylmagnesium bromide, yielding the desired N-(substituted alkyl)-4-di(substituted phenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (I), for example, N-4-(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)phenylmethyl-4-(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)( 2-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 103). In an alternate one-step route, the dehydroxylated compounds (IB) are also prepared by the reduction of N-(substituted alkyl))-4-bis(substituted phenyl or pyridyl)hydroxymethylpiperidines (I) with trifluoroacetic acid and triethylsilane in methylene chloride. Included within the scope of the present invention are the N-oxides (IA) of the compounds prepared by methods discussed above. The N-oxides (IA) were prepared by treating the parent compounds, for example, N-4-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethyl-4bis(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 31) with an oxidizing agent, such as 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, yielding the corresponding N-oxide, for example, N-4-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)phenylmethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine N-oxide (Compound 32). Example 10 provides a detailed description of how this reaction is conducted. The following examples illustrate general methods by which the compounds of the present invention were prepared. EXAMPLE 1 Synthesis of N-(4-Methoxyphenylmethyl)-4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 1) To a stirred mixture of 1.1 grams (0.045 gram-atom) of magnesium turnings in 30 mL of diethyl ether was added dropwise 15 mL of a solution of 11.0 grams (0.045 mole) of 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl bromide in 30 mL of diethyl ether. Once the reaction had started, the remaining 15 mL of the bromide solution was added portionwise during a 45 minute period. When the reaction subsided, a solution of 5.0 grams (0.018 mole) of ethyl N-(4-methoxyphenylmethyl)piperidin-4-ylcarboxylate in 20 mL of diethyl ether was added dropwise during a five minute period. Upon completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was heated to reflux, where it stirred for about 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was then allowed to cool to ambient temperature, where it stirred for about 18 hours. After this time an aqueous solution saturated with ammonium chloride was added dropwise to quench the reaction. The mixture was then partitioned between water and diethyl ether. The diethyl ether layer was separated and washed first with a solution saturated with sodium chloride and then with water. The organic layer was dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residual oil. The oil was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, with 10% diethyl ether in hexane, 100% diethyl ether, and 10% methanol in diethyl ether as eluants. The product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 6.7 grams of N-(4-methoxyphenylmethyl)-4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine, mp 86-96 C. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. EXAMPLE 2 Synthesis of N-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethyl)piperidine (Compound 2) Step A Synthesis of ethyl N-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethylpiperidin-4-ylcarboxylate as an intermediate A stirred mixture of 5.0 grams (0.032 mole) of ethyl piperidin-4-ylcarboxylate, 5.4 grams (0.032 mole) of 1-(2-chloroethyl)-4-methoxybenzene and 4.4 grams (0.032 mole) of potassium carbonate in 50 mL of dried N,N-dimethylformamide was heated at 70 C. for about 16 hours. After this time the reaction mixture was cooled and partitioned between diethyl ether and water. The organic layer was separated and washed with water and then with an aqueous solution saturated with sodium chloride. The organic layer was dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residue, which was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, with diethyl ether/hexane mixtures as eluants. The product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 2.4 grams of ethyl N-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethylpiperidin-4-ylcarboxylate. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. Step B Synthesis of N-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine (Compound 2) This compound was prepared in a manner analogous to that of Example 1, with 1.6 grams (0.005 mole) of ethyl N-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethylpiperidin-4-ylcarboxylate, 2.4 grams (0.010 mole) of 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl bromide, and 0.3 gram (0.011 gram-atom) of magnesium turnings in about 35 mL of diethyl ether as reagents. This reaction differed from Example 1 in that once the Grignard reaction commenced, the ethyl N-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethylpiperidin-4-ylcarboxylate was added to the diethyl ether solution of 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl bromide. The combination was then added dropwise to the reaction mixture, thereby introducing the piperidin-4-ylcarboxylate to the reaction mixture as the Grignard reagent was forming. Upon completion of addition, the reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for about 18 hours. After this time an aqueous solution saturated with ammonium chloride was added dropwise to quench the reaction. The reaction mixture was then extracted with methylene chloride. The combined extracts were washed with a dilute aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid and then with an aqueous solution saturated with sodium chloride. The organic layer was dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to a residue, which was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, with hexane/diethyl ether and ethyl acetate/methanol combinations as eluants. A second column chromatography on silica gel was required, with diethyl ether as the eluant, to afford pure product. The product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding 0.3 gram of N-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl-4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. EXAMPLE 3 An Alternate Synthesis of 4-bis(4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine for Use as an Intermediate Step A Synthesis of ethyl N-(trimethylsilyl)piperidin-4-ylcarboxylate as an intermediate Under a nitrogen atmosphere, a stirred solution of 100.0 grams (0.64 mole) of ethyl piperidin-4-ylcarboxylate and 94 mL (0.67 mole) of triethylamine in 1400 mL of diethyl ether was cooled to 15 C., and a solution of 86 mL (0.68 mole) of chlorotrimethylsilane in 100 mL of diethyl ether was added dropwise during a 30 minute period. Upon completion of the addition, the thick reaction mixture was stirred vigorously for one hour while warming to ambient temperature. The reaction mixture was then filtered, and the collected solid was washed with diethyl ether. The combined wash and filtrate were concentrated under reduced pressure to a residual oil. The oil was distilled under reduced pressure, yielding 115.0 grams (79% yield) of ethyl N-(trimethylsilyl)piperidin-4-ylcarboxylate, bp 75 C./0.1 mm Hg. The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. Step B Synthesis of 4-bis(trifluoromethoxyphenyl)hydroxymethylpiperidine as an intermediate A stirred mixture of 5.0 grams (0.021 mole) of 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl bromide, 13.8 grams (0.570 gram-atom) of magnesium turnings, and a crystal of iodine in 25 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran was warmed to 50-60 C.

The NMR spectrum was consistent with the proposed structure. Representative compounds prepared by the methods exemplified above are listed in Table 1. Characterizing properties are given in Table 2. Biological Data Candidate insecticides were incorporated into an artificial diet for evaluation of insecticidal activity against the tobacco budworm ( Heliothis virescens Fabricius) in the following manner. Stock solutions of test chemical in dimethyl sulfoxide, ranging from 50 micromolar to 0.005 micromolar, were prepared for each rate of application. One hundred microliters of each of the stock solutions was manually stirred into 50 mL of a molten (65-70 C.) wheat germ-based artificial diet. The 50 mL of molten diet containing the test chemical was poured evenly into twenty wells in the outer two rows on each side of a twenty-five well, five row plastic tray. (Each well in the tray was about 1 cm in depth, with an opening of 3 cm by 4 cm at the lip.) Molten diet containing only dimethyl sulfoxide at the levels used in the test chemical-treated diet was poured into the five wells in the third (center) row of the tray. Each tray therefore contained one test chemical at a single rate of application, together with an untreated control. The rates of application, expressed as the negative log of the molar concentration, and the corresponding concentrations of the stock solution prepared for each rate are shown below: Stock Solution Rate of Application 50 micromolar 4 5 5 0.5 6 0.05 7 0.005 8 Single second instar tobacco budworm larvae, selected at a stage of growth at which they uniformly weigh about 5 mg each, were placed in each well. Upon completion of infestation, a sheet of clear plastic was heat-sealed over the top of the tray by use of a common household flat iron. The trays were held at 25 C. at 60% relative humidity for five days in a growth chamber. Lighting was set at 14 hours of light and 10 hours of darkness. After the 5-day exposure period, mortality counts were taken, and the surviving insects were weighed. From the weights of the surviving insects that fed on the treated diet as compared to those insects that fed on the untreated diet, the percent growth inhibition caused by each test chemical was determined. From these data, the negative log of the concentration of the test chemical that provided 50% growth inhibition (pI 50 ) was determined by linear regression, when possible, for each test chemical. Also, where possible, the negative log of the concentration of the test chemical that provided 50% mortality (pLC 50 ) was determined. Compounds 118 and 119 were tested in a similar manner in which the artificial diet was surface-treated with candidate insecticide rather than having the candidate insecticide incorporated into the diet. Candidate insecticides with high p150 values from the diet test were tested for insecticidal activity in foliar evaluations against tobacco budworm, beet armyworm ( Spodoptera exigua Hubner), and cabbage looper ( Trichoplusia ni Hubner). In these tests against tobacco budworm and beet armyworm, nine-day-old chick pea plants ( Cicer arietinum ) were sprayed at 20 psi to runoff on both upper and lower leaf surfaces with solutions of test chemical to provide application rates as high as 1000 ppm of test chemical. The solvent used to prepare the solutions of test chemical was 10% acetone or methanol (v/v) and 0.1% of the surfactant octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol in distilled water. Four replicates, each containing one chick pea plant, for each rate of application of test chemical were sprayed. The treated plants were transferred to a hood, where they were kept until the spray had dried. The four chick pea plants for each replicate treated with test chemical as described above were removed from their pots by cutting the stems just above the soil line. The excised leaves and stems from the four plants in each replicate were placed in individual 8-ounce paper cups, each containing a moistened filter paper. Five second-instar (6 days old) tobacco budworms or beet armyworms (7-8 days old) were counted into each cup, taking care not to cause injury. An opaque plastic lid was placed on each cup, which was then held in a growth chamber for a 96 hour exposure period at 25 C. and 50% relative humidity. At the end of the 96 hour exposure period the cups were opened, and the numbers of dead, moribund, and live insects were counted. Using the insect counts, the efficacy of the test chemical was expressed in percent control. Percent control is derived from the total number of dead insects (TD) plus the total number of moribund insects (TM) as compared to the total number of insects (TI) in the test: The condition of the test plants was also observed for phytotoxicity and for reduction of feeding damage as compared to an untreated control. Foliar tests with cabbage looper were conducted in the same manner as described above, the difference being that pinto bean plants ( Phaseolus vulgaris ) were used in place of chick pea plants. The compounds of the present invention were active in the diet test against the tobacco budworm. Over forty of the compounds listed in Table 1 exhibited pI 50 values of 6.0 or greater. Compounds 9, 15, 31-34, 43, 53, 54, 72, 73, 95, 96, 98-101, 103, and 104 all exhibited pI 50 values of 6.5 or greater. Table 3 gives the insecticidal activity data for compounds tested in the diet test. The compounds of the present invention also showed good to excellent insecticidal activity in the foliar test against tobacco budworm, beet armyworm, and cabbage looper. It can be seen from Table 4 that many compounds provided 80% control or greater of one or more of the test insect species at an application rate of 100 ppm in the foliar test. For insecticidal application, the active compounds are formulated into insecticidal compositions by admixture in insecticidally effective amount with adjuvants and carriers normally employed in the art for facilitating the dispersion of active ingredients for the particular utility desired, recognizing the fact that the formulation and mode of application of a toxicant may affect the activity of the material in a given application. Thus, for agricultural use the present insecticidal compounds may be formulated as granules of relatively large particle size, as water-soluble or water-dispersible granules, as powdery dusts, as wettable powders, as emulsifiable concentrates, as solutions, or as any of several other known types of formulations, depending on the desired mode of application. These insecticidal compositions may be applied either as water-diluted sprays, or dusts, or granules to the areas in which insect control is desired. These formulations may contain as little as 0.1%, 0.2% or 0.5% to as much as 95% or more by weight of active ingredient. Dusts are free flowing admixtures of the active ingredients with finely divided solids such as talc, natural clays, kieselguhr, flours such as walnut shell and cottonseed flours, and other organic and inorganic solids which act as dispersants and carriers for the toxicant; these finely divided solids have an average particle size of less than about 50 microns. A typical dust formulation useful herein is one containing 1.0 part or less of the insecticidal compound and 99.0 parts of talc. Wettable powders are in the form of finely divided particles which disperse readily in water or other dispersant. The wettable powder is ultimately applied to the locus where insect control is desired either as a dry dust or as an emulsion in water or other liquid. Typical carriers for wettable powders include Fullers earth, kaolin clays, silicas, and other highly absorbent, readily wet, inorganic diluents. Wettable powders normally are prepared to contain about 5-80% of active ingredient, depending on the absorbency of the carrier, and usually also contain a small amount of a wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agent to facilitate dispersion. For example, a useful wettable powder formulation contains 80.8 parts of the insecticidal compound, 17.9 parts of Palmetto clay, and 1.0 part of sodium lignosulfonate and 0.3 part of sulfonated aliphatic polyester as wetting agents. Other useful formulations for insecticidal applications are emulsifiable concentrates (ECs) which are homogeneous liquid compositions dispersible in water or other dispersant, and may consist entirely of the insecticidal compound and a liquid or solid emulsifying agent, or may also contain a liquid carrier, such as xylene, heavy aromatic naphthas, isophorone, or other non-volatile organic solvent. For insecticidal application these concentrates are dispersed in water or other liquid carrier, and normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated. The percentage by weight of the essential active ingredient may vary according to the manner in which the composition is to be applied, but in general comprises 0.5 to 95% of active ingredient by weight of the insecticidal composition. Flowable formulations are similar to ECs except that the active ingredient is suspended in a liquid carrier, generally water. Flowables, like ECs, may include a small amount of a surfactant, and contain active ingredient in the range of 0.5 to 95%, frequently from 10 to 50%, by weight of the composition. For application, flowables may be diluted in water or other liquid vehicle, and are normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated. Typical wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agents used in agricultural formulations include, but are not limited to, the alkyl and alkylaryl sulfonates and sulfates and their sodium salts; alkylaryl polyether alcohols; sulfated higher alcohols; polyethylene oxides; sulfonated animal and vegetable oils; sulfonated petroleum oils; fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols and the ethylene oxide addition products of such esters; and the addition product of long-chain mercaptans and ethylene oxide. Many other types of useful surface-active agents are available in commerce. The surface-active agents, when used, normally comprise from 1 to 15% by weight of the composition. Other useful formulations include suspensions of the active ingredient in a relatively non-volatile solvent such as water, corn oil, kerosene, propylene glycol, or other suitable solvents. Still other useful formulations for insecticidal applications include simple solutions of the active ingredient in a solvent in which it is completely soluble at the desired concentration, such as acetone, alkylated naphthalenes, xylene, or other organic solvents. Granular formulations, wherein the toxicant is carried on relatively coarse particles, are of particular utility for aerial distribution or for penetration of cover crop canopy. Pressurized sprays, typically aerosols wherein the active ingredient is dispersed in finely divided form as a result of vaporization of a low boiling dispersant solvent carrier, such as carbon dioxide, propane, or butane, may also be used. Water-soluble or water-dispersible granules are also useful formulations for insecticidal application of the present compounds. Such granular formulations are free-flowing, non-dusty, and readily water-soluble or water-miscible. The soluble or dispersible granular formulations described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,920,442 are useful herein with the present insecticidal compounds. In use by the farmer on the field, the granular formulations, emulsifiable concentrates, flowable concentrates, solutions, etc., may be diluted with water to give a concentration of active ingredient in the range of say 0.1% or 0.2% to 1.5% or 2%. The active insecticidal compounds of this invention may be formulated and/or applied with other insecticides, fungicides, nematicides, plant growth regulators, fertilizers, or other agricultural chemicals. In using an active compound of this invention, whether formulated alone or with other agricultural chemicals, to control insects, an effective amount and concentration of the active compound is applied to the locus where control is desired. The locus may be., e.g., the insects themselves, plants upon which the insects feed, or the insect habitat. When the locus is the soil, e.g., soil in which agricultural crops have been or will be planted, the composition of the active compound may be applied to and optionally incorporated into the soil. For most applications the effective amount may be as low as, e.g. about 10 to 500 g/ha, preferably about 100 to 250 g/ha. It is apparent that various modifications may be made in the formulation and application of the compounds of this invention without departing from the inventive concepts herein as defined inventive concepts herein as defined in the claims.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to IP receptor antagonists, especially to certain 2-(substituted-phenyl)amino-imidazoline derivatives; pharmaceutical compositions containing them; and methods for their use as therapeutic agents. 2. Background Information and Related Disclosures Prostaglandins or prostanoids (PG) are a group of biologically active compounds derived from membrane phospholids and are formed from certain polyunsaturated fatty acids. They fall into several main classes designated by letters including D, E, F, G, H, and I (prostacyclin). The main classes are further subdivided as indicated by subscripts 1, 2, or 3, which reflect the fatty acid precursor, for example PGE 1 or PGE 2 . Prostanoids are ubiquitously produced and the rate of their production usually increases in response to diverse stimuli. They thereby exhibit a wide variety of pharmacological properties. The diversity of effects of prostanoids can be explained by the existence of a number of distinct receptors that mediate their action. The receptors have been named for the natural prostaglandin for which they have the greatest affinity and have been divided into five main types, designated as DP (PGD 2 ), FP (PG 2 ), IP (PGI 2 ), TP (TXA 2 ), AND EP (PGE 2 ). Additional information relating to prostaglandins and their receptors are described in Goodman Gillmans, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics , ninth edition, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996, Chapter 26, pages 601-616. Prostanoids are generated by most cells in response to mechanical, thermal or chemical injury and inflammatory insult, and are responsible for the sensitization or direct activation of nearby sensory nerve endings. The hyperalgesic effects (an increased responsiveness to a stimulus that is normally painful) of several prostanoids have been reported in several inflammatory models of nociception. Even though PGE 2 has attained wide recognition as the primary mediator of hyperalgesia, significant quantities of other prostanoids, including PGI 2 , are released by injury or inflammation. Indeed, when the effects of PGE 2 and PGI 2 on sensory neurons are compared directly, PGI 2 is equally or more effective as a hyperalgesic or sensitizing agent both in vivo and in vitro assays. However, to date, there have been no selective receptor antagonists which could unequivocally characterize the prostanoid receptor subtype(s) that mediate the sensitizing effects of PGE 2 or PGI 2 . When the intrinsic instability and pharmacokinetic properties of PGI 2 are taken into account, a preponderance of in vivo analgesia studies in rodents suggest that PGI 2 plays a major role in the induction of hyperalgesia. Likewise, in vitro studies provide substantial evidence to suggest that IP receptors act as important modulators of sensory neuron function. Since IP receptors in sensory neurons are coupled to activation of both adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C, and hence, cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, these receptors can exert powerful effects on ion channel activity and thus neurotransmitter release. Recent compelling evidence for a prominent role for IP (PGI 2 -preferring) receptors in inflammatory pain has been obtained from recent studies in transgenic mice lacking the IP receptor (T. Murata et al., Nature 1997, 388, 678-682). In these animals, the acetic acid-induced writhing response or the carrageenan-induced paw edema was reduced to levels similar to those seen with administration of indomethacin in wild-type mice. In contrast, spinal nociceptive reflexes measured by the tail-flick and hot-plate test were normal. The modest writhing response induced by PGE 2 was unchanged in the transgenic animals. Based upon these observations, the compounds of the present invention are expected to be effective anti-nociceptive agents. In addition to being mediators of hyperalgesia, prostanoids are known to be generated locally in the bladder in response to physiologic stimuli such as stretch of the detrusor smooth muscle, injuries of the vesical mucosa, and nerve stimulation (K. Anderson, Pharmacological Reviews 1993, 45(3), 253-308). PGI 2 is the major prostanoid released from the human bladder. Several lines of evidence suggest that prostanoids may be the link between detrusor muscle stretch produced by bladder filling and activation of C-fiber afferents by bladder distension. It has been proposed that prostanoids may be involved in the pathophysiology of bladder disorders, e.g., bladder outlet obstruction, and conditions associated with urinary incontinence such as urge incontinence, stress incontinence, and bladder hyperreactivity. Therefore, antagonists of prostanoid IP receptors are expected to be useful in the treatment of such conditions. Certain 2-(substituted-phenyl)amino-imidazoline compounds have been exemplifed in the patent literature.

Crystal form refers to various solid forms of the same compound, for example polymorphs, solvates, and amorphous forms. (a) Polymorphs are crystal structures in which a compound can crystallize in different crystal packing arrangements, all of which have the same elemental composition. Different polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, storage temperature, and other factors may cause one crystal form to dominate. (b) Solvates are generally a crystal form that contains either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent. Often, during the process of crystallization some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar ratio of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state, thus forming a solvate. When the solvent is water, hydrates may be formed. (c) Amorphous forms are noncrystalline materials with no long range order and generally do not give a distinctive powder X-ray diffraction pattern. Crystal forms of the present invention have been obtained for 24-(4-isoproxybenzyl)phenylamino-imidazoline sulfate, and are designated as Crystal Forms I and II. Crystal Forms I and II were obtained by utilizing the methods described in Examples 1 and 22, respectively, and are described in more detail in Examples 21-23. Crystal forms, in general, are further described in in Byrn et aL, Pharmaceutical Research , 1995, vol 12(7), 945-954, and in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 1995, edited by E. W. Martin, Mack Publishing Company, 19th edition, Easton, Pa., Vol. 2, Chapter 83, 1447-1462. Treating or treatment of a disease includes: (1) preventing the disease, i.e., causing the clinical symptoms of the disease not to develop in a mammal that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease, (2) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting the development of the disease or its clinical symptoms, or (3) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease or its clinical symptoms. A therapeutically effective amount means the amount of a compound that, when administered to a mammal for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease. The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending on the compound, the disease state being treated, the severity of the disease treated, the age and relative health of the subject, the route and form of administration, the judgement of the attending medical practitioner, and other factors. As is well-known in the art, the imidazolin-2-ylamino group in compounds such as the compounds of Formula I is in tautomeric equilibrium with the imidazolin-2-ylideneamino group: For convenience, all the compounds of Formula I are shown as having the imidazolin-2yi-amino structure, but it is to be understood that compounds of both tautomeric forms are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Nomenclature The naming and numbering of the compounds of this invention is illustrated below: Side chains of the R 1 substituent are numbered as shown below: The compounds of the invention are named as imidazoline derivatives, and the nomenclature used in this application is generally based on the IUPAC recommendations. However, because a strict adherence to these recommendations would result in the names changing substantially when only a single substituent is changed, compounds have been named in a form that maintains consistency of nomenclature for the basic structure of the molecule. For example, a compound of Formula I wherein R 1 is a group represented by formula (A), R 2 and R 4 are hydrogen, and R 3 is sec-butoxy, is named 2-4-(4-sec-butoxybenzyl)phenylamino-imidazoline.

Accordingly, these compounds are therefore useful as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents in mammals, especially humans. They find utility in pain conditions (states) from a wide variety of causes, including but not limited to, inflammatory pain, surgical pain, visceral pain, dental pain, premenstrual pain, central pain, pain due to burns, migraine or cluster headaches, nerve injury, neuritis, neuralgias, poisoning, ischemic injury, interstitial cystitis, cancer pain, viral, parasitic or bacterial infection, post-traumatic injuries (including fractures and sports injuries), and pain associated with functional bowel disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. The compounds also find utility in inflammatory conditions from a variety of causes, including but not limited to, bacterial, fungal or viral infections, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, surgery, bladder infection or idiopathic bladder inflammation, over-use, old age, or nutritional deficiencies, prostatis, conjunctivitis. The compounds also find utility in bladder disorders associated with bladder outlet obstruction and urinary incontinence conditions such as urge incontinence, stress incontinence, and bladder hyperreactivity. The compounds also find utility in respiratory conditions such as asthma, in which the C-fibers in the lungs are hyper-responsive to a number of environmental stimuli, including cold air, dust, pollen and other antigens. Since these C-fibers express IP prostanoid receptors, the activation of these receptors by PGI 2 , and a subsequent release of neurokinins may contribute to the contraction of lung smooth muscle tissues, edema, and mucus secretion. Thus, compounds of this invention given either systemically or with aerosol application may constitute an effective therapy for asthma. In addition, the compounds also find utility in the treatment of septic shock.

Example 30 Carrageenan-Induced Mechanical Hyperalgesia Assay The anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity of compounds of this invention was determined by the Carrageenan-Induced Mechanical Hyperalgesia Assay by measuring the inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw hyperalgesia in the rat, using a modification of the method described in L. O. Randall and J. J. Selitto, Archives of International Pharmacodynamics , 1957, 11, 409-419, and Vinegar et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics , 1969, 166, 96-103. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (130-150 g) were weighed and randomly assigned to treatment groups (n1 0). To induce mechanical hyperalgesia, rats were lightly anesthetized with halothane and administered 1% carrageenan or vehicle 1 (100 l) in the plantar surface of the left hindpaw. Rats were administered vehicle (10 ml/kg, p.o.or 1 ml/kg, i.v) or compounds of this invention (at 1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) or (0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 10mg/kg, i.v.) one hour before testing. Mechanical hyperalgesia was measured using an Analgesy-meter (UGO BASILE, Biological Research Apparatus, Comerio, Italy). The vehicle- or carrageenan-treated hindpaw was placed on the dome of the apparatus, plantar surface facing down. A constantly increasing force was then applied to the dorsal surface of the paw. The force at which the rat withdrew its paw, struggled, or vocalized was considered the end point. Treatment groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance on the paw withdrawal force (RESP). Pairwise comparisons for the drug-treated groups to the vehicle group were made using Fishers LSD strategy and Dunns procedure. Percent inhibition of mechanical hyperalgesia was calculated for each animal, and the average ID 50 value was estimated using the following sigmoidal model: % inhibition100/(1exp ((ID 50 dose)/N)) where ID50 is the dose of the compound needed to inhibit half of the maximum response (i.e., 100% in this model) and N is a curvature parameter. The compounds of this invention were active in this assay. Example 31 Complete Freunds Adjuvant-Induced Mechanical Hyperalgesia Assay The anti-inflammatory/analgesic activity of compounds of this invention may also be determined using an adjuvant-induced arthritis pain model in the rat, where pain is assessed by the animals response to the squeezing of the inflamed foot, using a modification of the method described in J. Hyiden et al., Pain 1989, 37, 229-243. The modification includes the assessment of hyperalgesia instead of changes in activity of spinal cord neurons. Briefly, rats were weighed and randomly assigned to treatment groups. To induce mechanical hyperalgesia, rats were lightly anesthetized with halothane and 100 l of Complete Freunds Adjuvant or saline was administered into the plantar surface of the left hindpaw. Twenty-four hours later, water (vehicle) or compounds of this invention were orally administered to the rats one hour before testing. Mechanical hyperalgesia was measured using an Analgesy-meter (UGO BASILE, Biological Research Apparatus, Comerio, Italy). The saline or carrageenan-treated hindpaw was placed on the dome of the apparatus, plantar surface facing down. A constantly increasing force was then applied to the dorsal surface of the paw, and the force at which the rat withdrew its paw, struggled, or vocalized was considered the end point. The treatment groups were compared using a one-way analysis of variance on the paw withdrawal force. Percent inhibition was calculated for each animal in the form: 100((c/dc/v)(s/vc/v)) where c/d is the paw withdrawal force for the carrageenan-treated paw in an animal to which drug has been administered; c/v is the paw withdrawal force for the carrageenan-treated paw in an animal to which vehicle has been administered; and s/v is the paw withdrawal force for the saline-treated paw in an animal to which vehicle has been administered. Significance was determined using Students t-test. The compounds of the invention were active in this assay.

A. Maggi et aL, J. Pharm. and Exper. Therapeutics , 1984, 230, 500-513. Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were weighed and randomly assigned to treatment groups. A catheter was inserted through the urethra into the bladder to induce bladder contractions, and a warm saline solution (5 mL) was infused. Rhythmic contractions were produced in about 30% of the animals. The compounds of the invention (0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg) were administered intravenous at the onset of regular rhythmic contractions. The effects on rhythmic contracts were then measured. The compounds of this invention were active in this assay. Example 33 Inhibition of Volume-Induced Contractions in Rats The inhibition of bladder contractions was determined by an assay using a modification of the method described in S. S. Hegde et al., Proceedings of the 26 th Annual Meeting of the International Continence Society (Aug. 27th-30th) 1996, Abstract 126. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with urethane and instrumented for intravenous administration of drugs and, in some cases, measurement of arterial pressure, heart rate and intra-bladder pressure. The effect of test compounds on volume-induced bladder contractions was determined in separate groups of animals. Volume-induced reflex bladder contractions were induced by filling the bladder with saline. The test compounds were administered intravenously in a cumulative manner at 10-minute intervals. Atropine (0.3 mg/kg, iv) was administered at the end of the study as a postive control. The compounds of this invention were active in this assay. Example 34 Reversal of Endotoxin-Induced Hypotension in Rats Septic shock, sometimes referred to as endotoxic shock, is caused by the presence of infectious agents, particularly bacterial endotoxins, in the bloodstream and is characterized by hypotension and organ dysfunction. Many symptoms of septic shock, in particular, hypotension, are induced in the rat by the administration of bacterial endotoxins. The ability of a compound to inhibit endotoxin-induced hypotension is therefore predictive of the utility of the compound in the treatment of septic or endotoxic shock. The activity of the compounds of the invention in the treatment of septic or endotoxic shock was determined by measuring the reversal of endotoxin-induced hypotension in the rat, using a modification of the method described in M. Giral et al, British Journal of Pharmacology , 1969,118, 1223-1231. Briefly, adult rats (200 g) were anesthetized with an inhalation anesthetic and femoral arteries and veins were cannulated for insertion of blood pressure transducers and drug administration lines, respectively. They were placed in Mayo restrainers while still under the influence of the anesthetic. After recovery from anesthesia and stabilization of heart rate and blood pressure (which typically required about 30 minutes), endotoxin (50 mg/kg E. coli and 25 mg/kg Salmonella) was administered intravenously. Changes in blood pressure and heart rate were monitored. After one hour, compounds of this invention or vehicle were also administered intravenously, and cardiovascular parameters were continuously monitored for the next three hours. Responses are represented as percentage return to initial diastolic blood pressure. Significance was determined using Students t-test. The compounds of this invention were active in this assay.

TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to the field of antivirals and in particular to derivatives of acyclic nucleosides useful against herpes and retroviral infections and methods for their manufacture and novel intermediates. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The practical utility of many acyclic nucleosides is limited by their relatively modest pharmacokinetics. A number of prodrug approaches have been explored in an effort to improve the bioavailability of acyclic nucleosides in general. One of these approaches involves the preparation of ester derivatives, particularly aliphatic esters, of one or more of the hydroxy groups on the acyclic side chain. European patent EP 165 289 describes the promising antiherpes agent 9-4-hydroxy-(2-hydroxymethyl)butylguanine, otherwise known as H2G. European patent EP 186 640 discloses 6-deoxy H2G. European patent EP 343 133 discloses that these compounds, particularly the R-() enantiomer, are additionally active against retroviral infections such as HIV. Various derivatives of H2G, such as phosphonates, aliphatic esters (for example, the diacetate and the dipropionate) and ethers of the hydroxy groups on the acyclic side chain are disclosed in EP 343 133. This patent also discloses methods for the preparation of these derivatives comprising the condensation of the acyclic side chain to the N-9 position of a typically 6-halogenated purine moiety or, alternatively, the imidazole ring closure of a pyrimidine or furazano-3,4-d-pyrimidine moeity or the pyrimidine ring closure of an imidazole moiety, where the acyclic side chain is already present in the precursor pyrimidine or imidazole moiety, respectively. In the broadest description of each of these methods the acyclic side chain is pre-derivatised but individual examples also show a one-step diacylation of H2G with acetic or proprionic anhydride and DMF. Harnden, et al., J. Med. Chem. 32, 1738 (1989) investigated a number of short chain aliphatic esters of the acyclic nucleoside 9-4-hydroxy-(3-hydroxymethyl)butylguanine, otherwise known as penciclovir, and its 6-deoxy analog. Famciclovir, a marketed antiviral agent, is the diacetyl derivative of 6-deoxy penciclovir. Benjamin, et al., Pharm. Res. 4 No. 2, 120 (1987) discloses short chain aliphatic esters of 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)-methylguanine, otherwise known as ganciclovir. The dipropionate ester is disclosed to be the preferred ester. Lake-Bakaar, et al., discloses in Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 33 No. 1, 110-112 (1989) diacetate and dipropionate derivatives of H2G and monoacetate and diacetate derivatives of 6-deoxy H2G. The diacetate and dipropionate derivatives of H2G are reported to result in only modest improvements in bioavailability relative to H2G. International patent application WO94/24134, published Oct. 27, 1994, discloses aliphatic ester prodrugs of the 6-deoxy N-7 analog of ganciclovir, including the di-pivaloyl, di-valeroyl, mono-valeroyl, mono-oleoyl and mono-stearoyl esters. International patent application WO93/07163, published Apr. 15, 1993 and International patent application WO94/22887, published Oct. 13, 1994, both disclose mono-ester derivatives of nucleoside analogs derived from mono-unsaturated C18 or C20 fatty acids. U.S. Pat. No. 5,216,142, issued Jun. 1, 1993, also discloses long chain fatty acid mono-ester derivatives of nucleoside analogs. A second approach to providing prodrugs of acyclic nucleosides involves the preparation of amino acid esters of one or more of the hydroxy groups on the acyclic side chain. European patent EP 99 493 discloses generally amino acid esters of acyclovir and European patent application EP 308 065, published Mar. 22, 1989, discloses the valine and isoleucine esters of acyclovir. European patent application EP 375 329, published Jun. 27, 1990, discloses amino acid ester derivatives of ganciclovir, including the di-valine, di-isoleucine, di-glycine and di-alanine ester derivatives. International patent application WO95/09855, published Apr. 13, 1995, discloses amino acid ester derivatives of penciclovir, including the mono-valine and di-valine ester derivatives. DE 19526163, published Feb. 1, 1996 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,543,414 issued Aug. 6, 1996, disclose achiral amino acid esters of ganciclovir. European patent application EP 694 547, published Jan. 31, 1996, discloses the mono-L-valine ester of ganciclovir and its preparation from di-valyl-ganciclovir. European patent application EP 654 473, published May 24, 1995, discloses various bis amino acid ester derivatives of 9-(1,2-bishydroxymethyl)-cyclopropan-1ylmethylguanine. International patent application WO95/22330, published Aug. 24, 1995, discloses aliphatic esters, amino acid esters and mixed acetate/valinate esters of the acyclic nucleoside 9-3,3-dihydroxymethyl-4-hydroxy-but-1-ylguanine. This reference discloses that bioavailability is reduced when one of the valine esters of the trivaline ester derivative is replaced with an acetate ester. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION We have found that diester derivatives of H2G bearing specific combinations of an amino acid ester and a fatty acid ester are able to provide significantly improved oral bioavailability relative to the parent compound (H2G). In accordance with a first aspect of the invention there is thus provided novel compounds of the formula I wherein a) R 1 is C(O)CH(CH(CH 3 ) 2 )NH 2 or C(O)CH(CH(CH 3 )CH 2 CH 3 )NH 2 and R 2 is C(O)C 3 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl; or b) R 1 is C(O)C 3 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl and R 2 is C(O)CH(CH(CH 3 ) 2 )NH 2 or C(O)CH(CH(CH 3 )CH 2 CH 3 )NH 2 ; and R 3 is OH or H; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The advantageous effect on oral bioavailability of the mixed fatty acid and amino acid esters of the invention is particularly unexpected in comparison to the oral bioavailability of the corresponding fatty acid esters. Based on the results using a urinary recovery assay (Table 1A) or a plasma drug assay (Table 1B) of H2G from rats, neither the mono or di-fatty acid esters of H2G provide any improvement in oral bioavailability relative to the parent compound H2G. Indeed the di-stearate derivative provided significantly lower bioavailability than the parent, indicating that a stearate ester may be detrimental for improving oral bioavailability of H2G. Converting one or both of the hydroxyls in certain other acyclic nucleoside analogues to the corresponding valine or di-valine ester has been reported to improve bioavailability. Conversion of H2G to the coresponding mono- or di-valyl ester derivatives produced similar improvement in bioavailability relative to the parent compound. Given that fatty acid derivatives of H2G are shown to be detrimental for improving bioavailability, it was unexpected that a mixed amino acid/fatty acid diester derivative of H2G would provide improved or comparable oral bioavailability to that of the valine diester derivative of H2G, based on urine recovery and plasma drug assays, respectively.

Further aspects of the invention include the compounds of Formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts for use in therapy and the use of these compounds and salts in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of viral infection in humans or animals. The compounds of the invention are potent antivirals, especially against herpes infections, such as those caused by Varicella zoster virus, Herpes simplex virus types 1 2, Epstein-Barr virus, Herpes type 6 (HHV-6) and type 8 (HHV-8). The compounds are particularly useful against Varicella zoster virus infections such as shingles in the elderly including post herpetic neuralgia or chicken pox in the young where the duration and severity of the disease can be reduced by several days. Epstein Barr virus infections amenable to treatment with the compounds include infectious mononucleosis/glandular fever which has previously not been treatable but which can cause many months of scholastic incapacity amongst adolescents. The compounds of the invention are also active against certain retroviral infections, notably SIV, HIV-1 and HIV-2, and against infections where a transactivating virus is indicated. Accordingly a further aspect of the invention provides a method for the prophylaxis or treatment of a viral infection in humans or animals comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of Formula I or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt to the human or animal. Advantageously group R 3 is hydroxy or its tautomer O so that the base portion of the compounds of the invention is the naturally occuring guanine, for instance in the event that the side chain is cleaved in vivo. Alternatively, R 3 may be hydrogen thus defining the generally more soluble 6-deoxy derivative which can be oxidised in vivo (e.g. by xanthine oxidase) to the guanine form. The compound of formula I may be present in racemic form, that is a mixture of the 2R and 2S isomers. Preferably, however, the compound of formula I has at least 70%, preferably at least 90% R form, for example greater than 95%. Most preferably the compound of formula I is enantiomerically pure R form. Preferably the amino acid of group R 1 /R 2 is derived from an L-amino acid. Preferably the fatty acid of group R 1 /R 2 has in total an even number of carbon atoms, in particular, decanoyl (C 10 ), lauryl (C 12 ), myristoyl (C 14 ), palmitoyl (C 16 ), stearoyl (C 18 ) or eicosanoyl (C 20 ). Other useful R 1 /R 2 groups include butyryl, hexanoyl, octanoyl or behenoyl (C 22 ). Further useful R 1 /R 2 groups include those derived from myristoleic, myristelaidic, palmitoleic, palmitelaidic, n6-octadecenoic, oleic, elaidic, gandoic, erucic or brassidic acids. Monounsaturated fatty acid esters typically have the double bond in the trans configuration, preferably in the -6, -9 or 11 position, dependent upon their length. Preferably the R 1 /R 2 group is derived from a fatty acid which comprises a C 9 to C 17 saturated, or n:9 monounsaturated, alkyl. The saturated or unsaturated fatty acid or R 1 /R 2 may optionally be substituted with up to five similar or different substituents independently selected from the group consisting of such as hydroxy, C 1 -C 6 alkyl, C 1 -C 6 alkoxy, C 1 -C 6 alkoxy C 1 -C 6 alkyl, C 1 -C 6 alkanoyl, amino, halo, cyano, azido, oxo, mercapto and nitro, and the like. Most preferred compounds of the formula I are those where R 1 is C(O)CH(CH(CH 3 ) 2 )NH 2 or C(O)CH(CH(CH 3 )CH 2 CH 3 )NH 2 and R 2 is C(O)C 9 -C 17 saturated alkyl.

The compounds of formula I can form salts which form an additional aspect of the invention. Appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I include salts of organic acids, especially carboxylic acids, including but not limited to acetate, trifluoroacetate, lactate, gluconate, citrate, tartrate, maleate, malate, pantothenate, isethionate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, butyrate, digluconate, cyclopentanate, glucoheptanate, glycerophosphate, oxalate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, nicotinate, palmoate, pectinate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, proprionate, tartrate, lactobionate, pivolate, camphorate, undecanoate and succinate, organic sulphonic acids such as methanesulphonate, ethanesulphonate, 2-hydroxyethane sulphonate, camphorsulphonate, 2-napthalenesulphonate, benzenesulphonate, p-chlorobenzenesulphonate and p-toluenesulphonate; and inorganic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, bisulphate, hemisulphate, thiocyanate, persulphate, phosphoric and sulphonic acids. Hydrochloric acid salts are convenient. The compounds of Formula I may be isolated as the hydrate. The compounds of the invention may be isolated in crystal form, preferably homogenous crystals, and thus an additional aspect of the invention provides the compounds of Formula I in substantially pure crystalline form, comprising 70%, preferably 90% homogeneous crystalline material, for example 95% homogeneous crystalline material. The compounds of the invention are particularly suited to oral administration, but may also be administered rectally, vaginally, nasally, topically, transdermally or parenterally, for instance intramuscularly, intravenously or epidurally. The compounds may be administered alone, for instance in a capsule, but will generally be administered in conjunction with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The invention extends to methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising bringing a compound of Formula I or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt in conjunction or association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle. Oral formulations are conveniently prepared in unit dosage form, such as capsules or tablets, employing conventional carriers or binders such as magnesium stearate, chalk, starch, lactose, wax, gum or gelatin. Liposomes or synthetic or natural polymers such as HPMC or PVP may be used to afford a sustained release formulation. Alternatively the formulation may be presented as a nasal or eye drop, syrup, gel or cream comprising a solution, suspension, emulsion, oil-in-water or water-in-oil preparation in conventional vehicles such as water, saline, ethanol, vegetable oil or glycerine, optionally with flavourant and/or preservative and/or emulsifier. The compounds of the invention may be administered at a daily dose generally in the range 0.1 to 200 mg/kg/day, advantageously, 0.5 to 100 mg/kg/day, more preferably 10 to 50 mg/kg/day, such as 10 to 25 mg/kg/day. A typical dosage rate for a normal adult will be around 50 to 500 mg, for example 300 mg, once or twice per day for herpes infections and 2 to 10 times this dosage for HIV infections. As is prudent in antiviral therapy, the compounds of the invention can be administered in combination with other antiviral agents, such as acyclovir, valcyclovir, penciclovir, famciclovir, ganciclovir and its prodrugs, cidofovir, foscarnet and the like for herpes indications and AZT, ddl, ddC, d4T, 3TC, foscarnet, ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, delaviridine, Vertex VX 478, Agouron AG1343 and the like for retroviral indications. The compounds of the invention can be prepared de novo or by esterification of the H2G parent compound which is prepared, for example, by the synthesis methodology disclosed in European Patent EP 343 133, which is incorporated herein by reference. A typical reaction scheme for the preparation of H2G is depicted below: The condensation in step 1 is typically carried out with a base catalyst such as NaOH or Na 2 CO 3 in a solvent such as DMF. Step 2 involves a reduction which can be performed with LiBH 4 /tetrahydrofuran in a solvent such as t-BuOH. The substitution in step 3 of the chlorine with an amino group can be performed under pressure with ammonia. Step 4 employs adenosine deaminase which can be conveniently immobilized on a solid support. Cooling the reaction mixture allows unreacted isomeric precursor to remain in solution thereby enhancing purity. Starting materials for compounds of the invention in which R 3 is hydrogen may be prepared as shown in European Patent EP 186 640, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. These starting materials may be acylated as described for H2G below, optionally after protecting the purine 2-amino group with a conventional N-protecting group as defined above, especially BOC (tBuOCO), Z (BnOCO) or Ph 3 C. The compounds of the invention may be prepared from H2G as described below in Schemes A and B. A. Direct Acylation Method Scheme A depicts the preparation of compounds in which R 1 is derived from the amino acid and R 2 is derived from the fatty acid, but the converse scheme is applicable to compounds where R 1 is derived from the fatty acid and R 2 is derived from the amino acid ester. In the variant specifically depicted in scheme A above, G is guanine or 6-deoxyguanine, PG is an optional N-protecting group or hydrogen, R 1 * is the valine or isoleucine side chain and R 2 * is the fatty acid chain. H2G is depicted above as a starting material but this of course may be optionally protected at R 3 or the 2 position of the purine with conventional N-protecting groups (not shown). The H2G (derivative) reacts in the first step with an activated R 1 -amino acid derivative, as further described below, in a solvent such as dimethylformamide or pyridine, to give a monoacylated product. The R 1 -amino acid may be suitably N-protected with N-BOC or N-CBz or the like. Under controlled conditions, the first acylation can be made to predominantly take place at the side chain 4-hydroxy group on the side chain of H2G. These controlled conditions can be achieved, for example, by manipulating the reagent concentrations or rate of addition, especially of the acylating agent, by lowering the temperature or by the choice of solvent. The reaction can be followed by TLC to monitor the controlled conditions. After purification, the R 1 monoacylated compounds are further acylated on the side chain 2-CH 2 OH group with the appropriate activated fatty acid derivative to give diacylated products using similar procedures as for the first esterification step. The diester products are subsequently subjected to a conventional deprotection treatment using for example trifluoroacetic acid, HCl(aq)/dioxane or hydrogenation in the presence of catalyst to give the desired compound of Formula I. The compound may be in salt form depending on the deprotection conditions. The activated R 1 /R 2 acid derivative used in the various acylations may comprise e.g. the acid halide, acid anhydride, activated acid ester or the acid in the presence of coupling reagent, for example dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, where acid in each case represents the corresponding R 1 /R 2 amino acid or the R 1 /R 2 fatty acid. Representative activated acid derivatives include the acid chloride, formic and acetic acid derived mixed anhydrides, anhydrides derived from alkoxycarbonyl halides such as isobutyloxycarbonylchloride and the like, N-hydroxysuccinamide derived esters, N-hydroxyphthalimide derived esters, N-hydroxy-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxamide derived esters, 2,4,5-trichlorophenol derived esters, sulfonic acid derived anhydrides (for example, p-toluenesulonic acid derived anhydrides and the like) and the like. B. Via Protection of the Chain 4-hydroxy Group wherein G, PG, R 1 * and R 2 * are as described for scheme A. Scheme B has been exemplified with reference to the preparation of a compound where R 1 is derived from an amino acid and R 2 is derived from the fatty acid ester, but a converse scheme will be applicable to compounds where R 2 is derived from the amino acid and R 1 is derived from the fatty acid. This scheme relies on regioselective protection of the H2G side chain 4-hydroxy group with a bulky protecting group. In scheme B above this is depicted as t-butyldiphenylsilyl, but other regioselective protecting groups such as trityl, 9-(9-phenyl)xanthenyl, 1,1-bis(4-methylphenyl)-1-pyrenylmethyl may also be appropriate. The resulting product is acylated at the side chain 2-hydroxymethyl group using analogous reagents and procedures as described in scheme A above, but wherein the activated acid derivative is the R 2 fatty acid, for example, myristic, stearic, oleic, elaidic acid chloride and the like. The thus monoacylated compounds are subjected to appropriate deprotection treatment to remove the side chain 4-hydroxy protecting group which can be done in a highly selective manner with such reagents, depending on the regioselective protecting group, as HF/pyridine and the like and manipulation of the reaction conditions, viz reagent concentration, speed of addition, temperature and solvent etc, as elaborated above. The then free side chain 4-hydroxy group is acylated with the activated -amino acid in a similar way as described in scheme A above. Additional techniques for introducing the amino acid ester of R 1 /R 2 , for instance in schemes A, B, C, D or E herein include the 2-oxa-4-aza-cycloalkane-1,3-dione method described in International patent application No. WO 94/29311. Additional techniques for introducing the fatty acid ester of R 1 /R 2 , for instance in schemes A, B, C, D or E herein include the enzymatic route described in Preparative Biotransformations 1.11.8 (Ed S M Roberts, J Wiley and Son, NY, 1995) with a lipase such as SP 435 immobilized Candida antarcticus (Novo Nordisk), porcine pancreatic lipase or Candida rugosa lipase. Enzymatic acylation is especially convenient where it is desired to avoid N-protection and deprotection steps on the other acyl group or the purine 2-amine. An alternative route to compounds of Formula I in which R 3 is hydrogen is to 6-activate the correponding guanine compound of Formula I (wherein the amino acid ester moiety of R 1 /R 2 is optionally protected with conventional N-protecting groups such as BOC) with an activating group such as halo. The thus activated 6-purine is subsequently reduced to purine, for instance with a palladium catalyst and deprotected to the desired 6-deoxy H2G di-ester. A further aspect of the invention thus provides a method for the preparation of the compounds of formula I comprising a) optionally N-protecting the purine 2 and/or 6 positions of a compound of formula I wherein R 1 and R 2 are each hydrogen; b) regioselectively acylating the compound of Formula I at the side chain 4-hydroxy group with either i) an optionally N-protected valine or isoleucine group, ii) an optionally substituted, saturated or monounsaturated C 3 -C 21 COOH derivative, or iii) a regioselective protecting group; c) acylating at the side chain 2-hydroxymethyl group with i) an optionally N-protected valine or isoleucine derivative, or ii) an optionally substituted, saturated or monounsaturated C 3 -C 21 COOH derivative; d) replacing the regioselective protecting group at R 1 , if present, with i) an optionally N-protected valine or isoleucine derivative; or ii) an optionally substituted, saturated or monounsaturated C 3 -C 21 COOH derivative; and e) deprotecting the resulting compound as necessary. Schemes A and B above employ selective acylation to stepwise add the amino acid and fatty acid esters. An alternative process for the preparation of the compounds of formula I starts with a diacylated H2G derivative, wherein both the acyl groups are the same, and employs selective removal of one of the acyl groups to obtain a monoacyl intermediate which is then acylated with the second, differing, acyl group in the same manner as Schemes A and B above. Accordingly a further aspect of the invention provides a method for the preparation of a compound of the formula I, as defined above, which method comprises A) the monodeacylation of a diacylated compound corresponding to formula I wherein R 1 and R 2 are both a valyl or isoleucyl ester (which is optionally N-protected) or wherein R 1 and R 2 are both C(O)C 3 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl; and B) acylating the thus liberated side chain 4-hydroxy or side chain 2-hydroxymethyl group with the corresponding valyl, isoleucyl or C(O)C 3 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl; and C) deprotecting as necessary. This alternative process has the advantage that the preparation of the diacylated H2G derivative is facile and requires little or no purification steps. Selective removal of one only of the acyl groups of a diacylated H2G derivative can be achieved by manipulating the reaction conditions, in particular the temperature, rate of reactant addition and choice of base. Compounds amenable to this alternative synthesis route are thus of the formula: wherein R 1 and R 2 are valyl or isoleucyl (which are optionally N-protected) or a C(O)C 3 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl; and R 3 is OH or H. For ease of synthesis in this alternative route, it is preferred that R 1 and R 2 are both initially identical and are most preferably the same amino acid ester. Such a di-amino acid ester will generally be N-protected during its preparation and may be used directly in this condition in the selective deacylation step. Alternatively, such an N-protected di-aminoacylated H2G derivative may be deprotected and optionally reprotected, as described below. The unprotected di-aminoacyl H2G derivative thus comprises one of the following compounds: (R)-9-2-(L-isoleucyloxymethyl)-4-(L-isoleucyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-(L-valyloxymethyl)-4-(L-valyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-2-amino-9-4-(L-isoleucyloxy)-2-(L-isoleucyloxymethyl)butylpurine, and (R)-2-amino-9-4-(L-valyloxy)-2-(L-valyloxymethyl)butylpurine. These unprotected H2G diacylated derivatives can be directly subject to selective deacylation of one of the acyl groups (typically the side chain 4-position acyl) followed by enzymatic acylation of the liberated 4-hydroxy as described above. Alternatively, the unprotected H2G diacylated derivative can be re-protected and then subjected to the selective deacylation, followed in turn by conventional acylation with the fatty acid ester, as described in Schemes A and B. Conveniently, such a reprotection step is done with a different N-protecting group, having properties appropriate to the subsequent acylation. For example, it is convenient to employ a lipophilic N-protecting group, such as Fmoc when preparing a di-amino acid H2G derivative, as the lipophilic nature of the protecting group assists with separation of the acylated products. On the other hand, the lipophilic nature of Fmoc is of less utility when conducting an acylation with a fatty acid, and thus it is convenient to reprotect a diacylated H2G with an alternative N-protecting group such as BOC. It will also be apparent that the preparation of the compounds of formula I can commence with the novel monoacylated intermediates of step b i), ii) or iii) in the above defined first method aspect of the invention. These compounds are thus of the formula: wherein one of R 1 and R 2 is i) C(O)CH(CH(CH 3 ) 2 )NH 2 or C(O)CH(CH(CH 3 )CH 2 CH 3 )NH 2 , ii) a C(O)C 3 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl, or iii) a regioselective protecting group; the other of R 1 and R 2 is hydrogen; and R 3 is OH or H. Useful compounds thus include: (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(t-butyldiphenylsilyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(trityloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(9-(9-phenyl)xanthenyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(1,1-bis(4-methylphenyl)-1-pyrenylmethyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(decanoyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl)-4-(dodecanoyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(tetradecanoyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl)-4-(hexadecanoyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(octadecanoyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl)-4-(eicosanoyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(docosanoyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(decanoyloxymethyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(dodecanoyloxymethyl) butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(tetradecanoyloxymethyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(hexadecanoyloxymethyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(octadecanoyloxymethyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(eicosanoyloxymethyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(docosanoyloxymethyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl-4-(L-valyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hydroxymethyl)-4-(L-isoleucyloxy)butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(L-isoleucyloxymethyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-4-hydroxy-2-(L-valyloxymethyl) butylguanine.

Regioselectively protected, sidechain 4-hydroxy intermediates from step c) of the above described first method aspect of the invention are also novel compounds. Useful compounds thus include: (R)-9-2-decanoyloxymethyl-4-(t-butyldiphenylsilyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-dodecanoyloxymethyl-4-(t-butyldiphenylsilyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-tetradecanoyloxymethyl-4-(t-butyldiphenylsilyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-hexadecanoyloxymethyl-4-(t-butyldiphenylchlorosilane)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-octadecanoyloxymethyl-4-(t-butyldiphenylsilyl)butylguanine, (R)-9-2-eicosanoyloxymethyl-4-(t-butyldiphenylsilyl)butylguanine, and (R)-9-2-docosanoyloxymethyl-4-(t-butyldiphenylsilyl)butylguanine. An alternative process for the preparation of compounds of the invention of the formula I wherein R 3 is OH is shown in Scheme C. Referring to Scheme C, malonate 1 (R 4 and R 5 are lower alkyl or benzyl or the like) is alkylated by reaction with from about 0.5 to about 2.0 molar equivalents of acetal 2 (R 6 and R 7 are lower alkyl or benzyl and the like or R 6 and R 7 taken together are CH 2 CH 2 or CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 or CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 and X 1 is a leaving group (for example, Cl, Br or l, or a sulfonate such as methanesulfonate, triflate, p-toluenesulfonate, benzenesulfonate and the like)) in the presence of from about 0.5 to about 2.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example, potassium t-butoxide or sodium ethoxide or NaH or KH and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, DMF or THF or dioxane or dioxolane or N-methylpyrrolidone and the like) at a temperature of from about 40 C. to about 190 C. to provide alkylated malonate 3. Alkylated malonate 3 can be purified by distillation or by first treating the crude alkylated malonate with dilute aqueous base (for example, 7% aqueous KOH), followed by removal of volatile impurities by distillation. Reduction of 3 with from about 0.5 to about 4.0 molar equivalents of an ester to alcohol reducing agent (for example, LiBH 4 or Ca(BH 4 ) 2 or NaBH 4 or LiAlH 4 and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or methyl t-butyl ether or t-BuOH and the like) at a temperature of from about 20 C. to about 100 C. provides diol 4. Enzymatic esterification of 4 by reaction with from about 1.0 to about 20.0 molar equivalents of a vinyl ester 5 (R 8 is C 1 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl) in the presence of a lipase (for example, Lipase PS-30 or Lipase PPL or Lipase CCL and the like) or a phospholipase (for example phospholipase D and the like) provides the desired stereoisomer of ester 6. This reaction can be carried out in the absence of solvent or in the presence of an inert solvent (for example, methyl t-butyl ether or toluene or hexane and the like). The reaction is carried out at a temperature of from about 20 C. to about 80 C. The alcohol substituent of 6 is converted to a leaving group (for example, a halogen or a sulfonate) by reaction with a halogenating agent (for example NBS/P(Ph) 3 or NCS/P(Ph) 3 or POCl 3 or NCS/P(Ph) 3 /Nal in acetone and like) in an inert solvent (for example, methylene chloride or toluene or ethylacetate and the like) or by reaction with from about 0.8 molar equivalents to about 2.0 molar equivalents of a sulfonyl halide (for example, benzenesulfonylchloride, toluenesulfonylchloride or methane sulfonylchloride and the like) in the presence of from about 1.0 to about 4.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example, triethylamine or potassium carbonate or pyridine or dimethylaminopyridine or ethyldiisopropylamine and the like) in an inert solvent (for example methylene chloride or toluene or ethylacetate or pyridine or methyl t-butyl ether and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. to provide ester 7 (X 2 is a halogen or sulfonate leaving group). Reaction of 7 with from about 0.9 to about 2.0 molar equivalents of 2-amino-6-chloropurine 8 in the presence of from about 1.0 to about 6.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example, potassium carbonate or LiH or NaH or KH or NaOH or KOH or lithium diisopropylamide or LiN(Si(CH 3 ) 3 ) 2 and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, DMF or THF or acetonitrile or N-methylpyrrolidone or ethanol or DMSO and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 140 C. provides substituted purine 9. Alternatively, the base can be a sterically bulky amine base (for example, 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-diazabicyclo2.2.2octane (Dabco), 1,5-diazabicyclo4.3.0non-5-ene (DBN), tetramethylguanidine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine and the like) or a sterically bulky phosphazine base (for example, tert-butylimino-tri(pyrrolidino)-phosphorane, tert-butylimino-tri(dimethylamino)phosphorane, tert-octylimino-tri(dimethylamino)phosphorane and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or DMF or DMSO and the like). Alternatively Mitsunobu coupling (for example P(Ph) 3 /diethyl azidocarboxylate) of alcohol 6 with 2-amino-6-chloropurine 8 provides 9. Reaction of 9 with from about 2.0 to about 20 molar equivalents of an alcohol R 9 OH (R 9 is an alcohol protecting group such as benzyl or diphenylmethyl and the like) in the presence of from about 1.0 to about 6.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example, potassium t-butoxide or potassium carbonate or NaH or KH or lithium diisopropylamide and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or DMF and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 150 C. provides alcohol 10. Removal of the alcohol protecting group R 9 of 10 (for example, by catalytic hydrogenation in an inert solvent such as ethanol or benzyl alcohol or methanol or THF and the like in the presence of an hydrogenation catalyst such as Pd/C or Pd(OH) 2 and the like) provides substituted guanine 11. Esterification of 11 by reaction with a) from about 0.8 to about 2.0 molar equivalents of R 10 COOH and a coupling agent (for example DCC/DMAP) and the like in an inert solvent (for example THF or DMF and the like) or b) from about 0.8 to about 2.0 molar equivalents of an activated derivative of R 10 COOH (for example, the acid chloride or N-hydroxysuccinimide ester or R 10 C(O)OS(O) 2 R 30 (R 30 is loweralkyl, phenyl or toluyl) or R 10 C(O)OC(O)R 10 or R 10 C(O)OC(O)R 10a (R 10a is loweralkyl and the like) in the presence of from about 0 to about 3.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example, pyridine or dimethylaminopyridine or triethylamine or ethyldiisopropylamine or N-methylmorpholine or DBU or potassium carbonate and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, methylene chloride or THF or pyridine or acetonitrile or DMF and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. provides ester 12. R 10 is C 3 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl. The acetal substituent of 12 is deprotected and the resulting aldehyde is reduced by first reacting 12 with from about 0.1 to about 10.0 molar equivalents of an acid (for example, triflic acid or HCl or formic acid or acetic acid/formic acid or sulfuric acid and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF/H 2 O or methylene chloride/H 2 O or ethylacetate/H 2 O or ethanol/H 2 O or methanol/H 2 O or water and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. To the crude reaction mixture is added from about 0.1 to about 10.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example, sodium bicarbonate or potassium carbonate or triethylamine or pyridine or KOH and the like), (optionally, additional inert solvent (for example, THF and or methylene chloride or ethylacetate or methyl t-butyl ether or isopropoanol and the like) is added) and from about 0.3 to about 5.0 molar equivalents of an aldehyde reducing agent (for example, sodium borohydride or RaNi/H 2 or borane t-butylamine complex and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. to provide alcohol 13. The optical purity of compound 13 can be enhanced by reaction with optically active oraganic sulfonic acids such as (S)-()-camphorsulfonic acid and the like. A preferred sulfonic acid for this purpose is (S)-()-camphorsulfonic acid. Alternatively, the acetal substituent of 12 can be hydrolyzed by reaction in an inert solvent with an acid resin (for example, Amberlyst 15 resin, Nafion NR50 resin, Dowex 50WX4-200R resin or Amerlite 120 resin and the like) to provide the corresponding aldehyde. The aldehyde can be isolated prior to reduction to the alcohol 13 as described above or the crude aldehyde can be reduced directly in situ. Reaction of 13 with from about 0.8 to about 3.0 molar equivalents of N-protected amino acid P 1 NHCH(R 11 )COOH or an activated derivative thereof (P 1 is an N-protecting group (for example, benzyloxycarbonyl, t-butyloxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl and the like) and R 11 is isopropyl or isobutyl) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or dioxane or dioxolane or DMF or methylene chloride and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. provides alcohol 14. N-deprotection of 14 provides the compound of the invention of formula I wherein R 3 is OH. For example, when the protecting group can be removed by hydrogenation, such as when the protecting group is Cbz, hydrogenation in the presence of Pd/C in ethanol or Pd/BaCO 3 or Pd/BaSO 4 and the like in THF or isopropanol/THF and the like is preferred. Alternatively, compound 13 can be reacted with the symmetrical anhydride derived from P 1 NHCH(R 11 )COOH (i.e., P 1 NHCH(R 11 )C(O)OC(O)CH(R 11 )NHP 1 ) to provide 14. The anhydride can be prepared in situ or can be separately prepared prior to reaction with 13. Alternatively, 11 can be prepared by hydrolysis of the ester of 9 to an alcohol (for example, by reaction with a base such as K 2 CO 3 , Li 2 CO 3 , Na 2 CO 3 , KHCO 3 , LiOH, NaOH or KOH and the like in an inert solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, THF, water or mixtures thereof and the like, most prefereably with K 2 CO 3 in MeOH/H 2 O and the like), followed by direct conversion of the chloro group to an OH (for example, by reaction with an inorganic base such as KOH or NaOH and the like in H 2 O with heating and the like). In another alternative method, 11 can be prepared directly by hydrolysis of the chloro-ester 9 (for example, by reaction with an inorganic base such as KOH or NaOH and the like in H 2 O with heating and the like). In another alternative, the ester of 9 can be hydrolyzed by an esterase in water or an aqueous buffer, with or without the presence of an added organic solvent such as an alcohol (for example, ethanol or isopropanol and the like), THF, DMF or DMSO and the like. In another alternative method, 11 can be prepared from 9 (or from the hydroxy compound resulting from the hydrolysis of the ester in 9) by reaction with an inorganic base (for example, NaOH, LiOH, KOH and the like, preferably, NaOH) and trimethylamine in an aqueous solvent. In yet another alternative method, 11 can be prepared directly by hydrolysis of the chloro-ester 9 (for example, by reaction with 1-3 equivalents of a base such as sodium methoxide (and the like) in the presence of mercaptoethanol in a mixed solvent of water and methanol or dioxane (and the like) at a temperature of from about 20 C. to about relfux and the like). In yet another alternative method, prior to conversion of 9 to 10 or 11, the ester of 9 can be hydrolyzed to the alcohol as described above. The alcohol can then be reesterified and purified (for example, from methyl t-butyl ether and the like). This process leads to an increase in the enantiomeric excess (i.e., purity) of the resulting ester 9. Preferably, the alcohol is reesterified to provide the acetate, which is purified from methyl t-butyl ether. In yet another alternative method, 13 can be prepared by reaction of 9 (wherein R 8 R 10 )with formic acid, optionally with heating, followed by reduction of the aldehyde to give 13. In yet another alternative, 13 can be prepared from 11 without isolation of intermediates and with in situ generation of the esterification agent, thus increasing purity of the resulting product and allowing increased throughput in the process. Another alternative process for the preparation of compounds of Formula I wherein R 3 is OH is shown in Scheme D. Malonate 1 (R 4 and R 5 are lower alkyl or benzyl and the like) is alkylated with from about 0.5 to about 2.0 molar equivalents of ether 15 wherein X 1 is a leaving group (for example Cl, Br or I, or a sulfonate such as methane sulfonate, triflate, p-toluenesulfonate, benzenesulfonate and the like) and R 12 is CH(Ph) 2 , C(Ph) 3 or Si(t-Bu)(Me) 2 and the like (Phphenyl) in the presence of from about 0.5 to about 2.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example potassium t-butoxide or sodium ethoxide or NaH or KH and the like) in an inert solvent (for example DMF or THF or dioxane or dioxolane or N-methyl pyrrolidinone and the like) at a temperature of from about 40 C. to about 190 C. to provide alkylated malonate 16. Reduction of 16 with from about 0.5 to about 4.0 molar equivalents of an ester to alcohol reducing agent (for example LiBH 4 or Ca(BH 4 ) 2 or NaBH 4 or LiAlH 4 and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or methyl t-butyl ether or ethanol or t-butanol and the like) at a temperature of from about 20 C. to about 100 C. provides diol 17. Enzymatic esterification of 17 by reaction with from about 1.0 to about 20.0 molar equivalents of a vinyl ester 5 (R 8 is C 1 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl) in the presence of a lipase (for example, Lipase PS-30 or Lipase PPL or Lipase CCL and the like) or a phospholipase (for example phospholipase D and the like) provides the desired stereoisomer of ester 18. The reaction can be carried out in the absence of solvent or in the presence of an inert solvent (for example methyl t-butyl ether or toluene or hexane or the like). The reaction is carried out at a temperature of from about 20 C. to about 80 C. The alcohol substituent of 18 is converted to a leaving group (for example a halogen or sulfonate) by reaction with a halogenating agent (for example NBS/P(Ph) 3 or NCS/P(Ph) 3 or POCl 3 or NCS/P(Ph) 3 /Nal in acetone and the like) in an inert solvent (for example methylene chloride or toluene or ethylacetate and the like) or by reaction with from about 0.8 molar equivalents to about 2.0 molar equivalents of a sulfonyl halide (for example benzenesulfonylchloride, toluenesulfonylchloride or methane sulfonylchloride and the like) in the presence of from about 1.0 to about 4.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example triethylamine or potassium carbonate or pyridine and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, methylene chloride or toluene or ethyl acetate or methyl t-butyl ether and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. to provide ester 19 (X 2 is a halogen or sulfonate leaving group). Reaction of 19 with from about 0.9 to about 2.0 molar equivalents of 2-amino-4-chloropurine 8 in the presence of from about 1.0 to about 6.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example potassium carbonate or LiH or NaH or KH or NaOH or KOH or lithium diisopropylamide or LiN(Si(CH 3 ) 3 ) 2 and the like) in an inert solvent (for example DMF or THF or acetonitrile or N-methylpyrrolidone or ethanol and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 140 C. provides substituted purine 20. Alternatively, Mitsunobu coupling (for example, P(PH) 3 /diethyl azidocarboxylate) of alcohol 18 with 2-amino-4-chloropurine 8 provides 20. Reaction of 20 with from about 2.0 to about 20.0 molar equivalents of an alcohol R 9 OH (R 9 is an alcohol protecting group such as benzyl or diphenylmethyl and the like) in the presence of from about 1.0 to about 6.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example, potassium t-butoxide or potassium carbonate or NaH or KH or lithium diisopropylamide and the like in an inert solvent (for example, THF or DMF and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 150 C. provides alcohol 21. Removal of the alcohol protecting group R 9 of 21 (for example by catalytic hydrogenation in an inert solvent such as ethanol or benzyl alcohol or methanol or THF and the like in the presence of an hydrogenation catalyst such as Pd/C or Pd(OH) 2 and the like) provides substituted guanine 22, which can be esterified as described in Scheme C (i.e., 11 to 12) to provide 23. The ether substitutent of 23 is deprotected by reaction with a) a reducing agent (for example, HCO 2 H and Pd/C and the like) wherein R 12 is CH(Ph) 2 or C(Ph) 3 , or b) a desilylating agent (for example Bu 4 NF and the like) wherein R 12 is Si(t-Bu)(Me) 2 and the like to provide 13. Alcohol 13 can be converted to I as outlined in Scheme C. Alternatively, 22 can be prepared by hydrolysis of the ester of 20 to an alcohol (for example, by reaction with K 2 CO 3 in MeOH/H 2 O and the like), followed by direct conversion of the chloro group to an OH (for example, by reaction with KOH in H 2 O with heating and the like). In another alternative method, 22 can be prepared directly by hydrolysis of the chloro-ester 20 (for example, by reaction with KOH in H 2 O with heating and the like). In another alternative method, 22 can be prepared from 20 (or from the hydroxy compound resulting from the hydrolysis of the ester in 20) by reaction with an inorganic base (for example, NaOH, LiOH, KOH and the like, preferably, NaOH) and trimethylamine in an aqueous solvent. In yet another alternative method, 22 can be prepared directly by hydrolysis of the chloro-ester 20 (for example, by reaction with 1-3 equivalents of a base such as sodium methoxide (and the like) in the presence of mercaptoethanol in a mixed solvent of water and methanol or dioxane (and the like) at a temperature of from about 20 C. to about relfux and the like). In yet another alternative method, 23 can be prepared by reaction of 20 (wherein R 8 R 10 ) with formic acid, optionally with heating, followed by reduction of the aldehyde to give 23. An additional alternative involves enzymatic esterification of alcohol 4 or 17 with the vinyl ester CH 2 CHOC(O)R 10 (i.e., R 8 R 10 in Schemes C and D) to directly incorporate into 6 or 18 the desired carboxylic acid ester of the final product I. This allows the elimination of the ester hydrolysis and reesterification involved in going from 9 to 12 or from 20 to 23. The processes of Schemes C and D are characterized by the fact that each of the hydroxyl groups of the acyclic side chain is differentiated by the use of different hydroxy protecting groups or precursor groups. This allows the selective acylation of each of the hydroxy groups with either an amino acid or a fatty acid group. Schemes C and D have been illustrated and described with reference to embodiments of the invention wherein R 1 is derived from an amino acid and R 2 is derived from a fatty acid. However, it will be apparent that respective converse schemes will apply to compounds where R 1 is derived from a fatty acid and R 2 is derived from an amino acid. Yet another method for preparing compounds of Formula I is shown in Scheme E. Enzymatic esterification of 4 (see Scheme C) by reaction with from about 1.0 to about 20.0 molar equivalents of a vinyl ester 24 (R 10 is C 3 -C 21 saturated or monounsaturated, optionally substituted alkyl) in the presence of a lipase (for example, Lipase PS-30 or Lipase PPL or Lipase CCL and the like) or a phospholipase (for example phospholipase D and the like) provides the desired stereoisomer of ester 25. This reaction can be carried out in the absence of solvent or in the presence of an inert solvent (for example, methyl t-butyl ether or toluene or hexane and the like). The reaction is carried out at a temperature of from about 20 C. to about 80 C. The alcohol substituent of 25 is converted to a leaving group (for example, a halogen or a sulfonate) by reaction with a halogenating agent (for example NBS/P(Ph) 3 or NCS/P(Ph) 3 or POCl 3 or NCS/P(Ph) 3 /Nal in acetone and like) in an inert solvent (for example, methylene chloride or toluene or ethylacetate and the like) or by reaction with from about 0.8 molar equivalents to about 2.0 molar equivalents of a sulfonyl halide (for example, benzenesulfonylchloride, toluenesulfonylchloride or methane sulfonylchloride and the like) in the presence of from about 1.0 to about 4.0 molar equivalents of a base (for example, triethylamine or potassium carbonate or pyridine or dimethylaminopyridine or ethyldiisopropylamine and the like) in an inert solvent (for example methylene chloride or toluene or ethylacetate or pyridine or methyl t-butyl ether and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. to provide ester 26 (X 2 is a halogen or sulfonate leaving group). The acetal substituent of 26 is hydrolyzed to the aldehyde 27 by reacting 26 with an acid (for example, trifluoroacetic acid, triflic acid or HCl or formic acid or acetic acid/formic acid or sulfuric acid and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF/H 2 O or methylene chloride/H 2 O or ethylacetate/H 2 O or ethanol/H 2 O or methanol/H 2 O or water and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. To the aldehyde 27 in an inert solvent (for example, THF and or methylene chloride or ethylacetate or methyl t-butyl ether or isopropoanol and the like) is added an aldehyde to alcohol reducing agent (for example, sodium borohydride or RaNi/H 2 or borane t-butylamine complex and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. to provide the corresponding alcohol. Reaction of the resulting alcohol with from about 0.8 to about 3.0 molar equivalents of N-protected amino acid P 1 NHCH(R 11 )COOH or an activated derivative thereof (P 1 is an N-protecting group (for example, benzyloxycarbonyl, t-butyloxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl, trichloroethylcarbonyl and the like) and R 11 is isopropyl or isobutyl) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or dioxane or dioxolane or DMF or methylene chloride and the like) at a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 100 C. provides diester 28. Alternatively the alcohol can be reacted with the symmetrical anhydride derived from P 1 NHCH(R 11 )COOH (i.e., P 1 NHCH(R 11 )C(O)OC(O)CH(R 11 )NHP 1 ) to provide 28. Conversion of 27 to 28 can be accomplished with or without isolation/purification of the intermediate alcohol. A preferred aldehyde to alcohol reducing agent is borane t-butylamine complex. A preferred esterification agent is the symmetrical anhydride. Reaction of 28 with purine 29 in the presence of a base (for example potassium carbonate or LiH or NaH or KH or NaOH or KOH or lithium diisopropylamide or LiN(Si(CH 3 ) 3 ) 2 and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, DMF and the like) provides 30. Purine 29 is prepared from 6-chloro-2-amino purine by reaction with R 9 OH in an inert solvent (for example, toluene or THF and the like) in the presence of a base (for example, NaH or KH or NaOH or KOH or potassium t-butoxide and the like). A preferred process for the the preparation of purine 29 involves reaction of 2-amino-6-chloropurine with neat R 9 -OH in the presence of a base such as NaOH or KOH or potassium t-butoxide and the like. Substituted purine 30 is deprotected to provide the compound of Formula I. Alternatively, in the reaction of 28 with 29, the base can be a sterically bulky amine base (for example, 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0-undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-diazabicyclo2.2.2octane (Dabco), 1,5-diazabicyclo4.3.0non-5-ene (DBN), tetramethylguanidine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine and the like) or a sterically bulky phosphazine base (for example, tert-butylimino-tri(pyrrolidino)-phosphorane, tert-butylimino-tri(dimethylamino)phosphorane, tert-octylimino-tri(dimethylamino)phosphorane and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or DMF or DMSO and the like). Yet another method for preparing compounds of Formula I is shown in Scheme F. Reaction of 28 with amino-chloropurine 8 in the presence of a base (for example potassium carbonate or LiH or NaH or KH or NaOH or KOH or lithium diisopropylamide or LiN(Si(CH 3 ) 3 ) 2 and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, DMF THF and the like) provides 31. Hydrolysis of 31 to 14 can be accomplished under basic or acidic conditions (for example, with trimethlyamine or DABCO or KOH or LiOH or NaOH and the like in water/THF or methylene chloride and the like or with acetic acid and the like). Alternatively, 8 can be be alkylated with 28 using a sterically bulky amine base (for example, 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-diazabicyclo2.2.2octane (Dabco), 1,5-diazabicyclo4.3.0non-5-ene (DBN), tetramethylguanidine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine and the like) or a sterically bulky phosphazine base (for example, tert-butylimino-tri(pyrrolidino)-phosphorane, tert-butylimino-tri(dimethylamino)phosphorane, tert-octylimino-tri(dimethylamino)phosphorane and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or DMF or DMSO and the like). In each of Schemes C, D and F, the 2-amino-6-chloro-purine (8) can be replaced with 2-amino-6-iodo-purine or 2-amino-6-bromopurine, which can be alkylated and then transformed to the substituted guanine in a manner analogous to that disclosed for alkylation and transformation of 8 Yet another method for preparing the compounds of formula I is shown in Scheme G. Alkylation of 32 with 7 in the presence of a base (for example, potassium carbonate, LiH, NaH and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, DMF THF and the like) provides 33. R 25 is hydrogen or C(O)NR 27 R 28 wherein R 27 and R 28 are independently selected from loweralkyl, phenyl and benzyl or R 27 and R 28, taken together with the nitrogen to which they are attached, form a pyrrolidinyl group or a piperidinyl group. R 26 is loweralkyl, phenyl or benzyl. Hydrolysis of 33 to 11 can be accomplished under basic conditions (for example, with KOH in water and the like). Alternatively, 32 can be alkylated with 7 using a sterically bulky amine base (for example, 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-diazabicyclo2.2.2octane (Dabco), 1,5-diazabicyclo4.3.0non-5-ene (DBN), tetramethylguanidine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine and the like) or a sterically bulky phosphazine base (for example, tert-butylimino-tri(pyrrolidino)-phosphorane, tert-butylimino-tri(dimethylamino)phosphorane, tert-octylimino-tri(dimethylamino)phosphorane and the like) in an inert solvent (for example, THF or DMF or DMSO and the like).

The results appear on Table 2 below: TABLE 2 Compound R 1 R 2 Bioavailability Comparative example 1 hydrogen hydrogen 8% Comparative example 2 valyl hydrogen 29% Comparative example 3 valyl valyl 36% Example 1 valyl stearoyl 56% Comparative example 4 stearoyl stearoyl 1% Example 2 valyl myristoyl 57% Example 3 valyl oleoyl 51% Example 4 valyl butyryl 45% Comparative example 5 valyl acetyl 11% Example 5 valyl decanoyl 48% Example 6 valyl docosanoyl 48% Example 7 isoleucyl stearoyl 53% Example 8 isoleucyl decanoyl 57% Example 9 isoleucyl myristoyl 49% Example 10 valyl 4-acetylbutyryl 52% Example 11 valyl dodecanoyl 46% Example 12 valyl palmitoyl 58% Example 17 stearoyl valyl 52% Comparative example 6 alanyl stearoyl 23% Comparative example 7 glycyl decanoyl 25% Comparative Example 8 acetyl valyl 7% Comparative Example 9 hydrogen stearoyl 12% Comparative Example 10 stearoyl hydrogen 7% Comparison of the bioavailabilities of the compounds of the invention with the comparative examples indicates that the particular combination of the fatty acids at R 1 /R 2 with the amino acids at R 1 /R 2 produces bioavailabilities significantly greater than the corresponding diamino acid ester or difatty acid ester. For example, in this model, the compound of Example 1 displays 55% better bioavailability than the corresponding divaline ester of Comparative example 3. The compound of Example 4 displays 25% better availability than the corresponding divaline ester. It is also apparent, for instance from Comparative examples 5, 6 and 7 that only the specified fatty acids of this invention in combination with the specified amino acids produce these dramatic and unexpected increases in pharmacokinetic parameters. Biology Example 2 Plasma Concentrations in Rats A plasma concentration assay was done in male Sprague Dawley derived rats. The animals were fasted overnight prior to dosing but were permitted free access to water. Each of the compounds evaluated was prepared as a solution/suspension in propylene glycol at a concentration corresponding to 10 mg H2G/ml and shaken at room temperature for eight hours. Groups of rats (at least 4 rats in each group) received a 10 mg/kg (1 ml/kg) oral dose of each of the compounds; the dose was administered by gavage. At selected time points after dosing (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 24 hours after dosing), heparinized blood samples (0.4 ml/sample) were obtained from a tail vein of each animal. The blood samples were immediately chilled in an ice bath. Within two hours of collection, the plasma was separated from the red cells by centrifugation and frozen till analysis. The components of interest were separated from the plasma proteins using acetonitrile precipitation. Following lyophilisation, and reconstitution, the plasma concentrations were determined by reverse phase HPLC with fluorescence detection. The oral uptake of H2G and other test compounds was determined by comparison of the H2G area under the curve derived from the oral dose compared to that obtained from a 10 mg/kg intravenous dose of H2G, administered to a separate group of rats. The results are depicted in Table 1B above. Biology Example 3 Bioavailability in Monkeys The compounds of Example 1 and Comparative example 3 (see Biology Example 1 above) were administered p.o. by gavage to cynomolgus monkeys. The solutions comprised: Example 1 150 mg dissolved in 6.0 ml propylene glycol, corresponding to 25 mg/kg or 0.0295 mmol/kg. Comparative 164 mg dissolved in 7.0 ml water, corresponding to Example 3 23.4 mg/kg or 0.0295 mmol/kg. Blood samples were taken at 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10 and 24 hours. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2500 rpm and the samples were inactivated at 54 C. for 20 minutes before being frozen pending analysis. Plasma H2G levels were monitored by the HPLC/UV assay of Example 30 above. FIG. 1 depicts the plasma H2G recovery as a function of time. Although it is not possible to draw statistically significant conclusions from single animal trials, it appears that the animal receiving the compound of the invention experienced a somewhat more rapid and somewhat greater exposure to H2G than the animal which received an alternative prodrug of H2G. Biology Example 4 Antiviral Activity Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1)-infected mouse serves as an animal model to determine the efficacy of antiviral agents in vivo. Mice inoculated intraperitoneally with HSV-1 at 1000 times the LD 50 were administered either with a formulation comprising the currently marketed anti-herpes agent acyclovir (21 and 83 mg/kg in a 2% propylene glycol in sterile water vehicle, three times daily, p.o.) or the compound of Example 29 (21 and 83 mg/kg in a 2% propylene glycol in sterile water vehicle, three times daily, p.o.) for 5 consecutive days beginning 5 hours after inoculation. The animals were assessed daily for deaths. The results are displayed in FIG. 2 which charts the survival rate against time. In the legend, the compound of the invention is denoted Ex.29 and acyclovir is denoted ACV. The percentage of mice surviving the HSV-1 infection was significantly greater following a given dose of the compound of the invention relative to an equivalent dose of acyclovir.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a novel compound for photography oxidatively releasing a development inhibitor in a development process, and more particularly to a compound for a silver halide color photographic material having an improved interimage effect and an improved sharpness. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is known that by color developing a silver halide color photographic material, dyes such as indophenol, indoaniline, indamine, azomethine, phenoxazin, phenazine, and dyes similar to the above-described dyes are formed by the reaction of an oxidized aromatic primary amino color developing agent and couplers to form color images. In the system, for the color reproduction, a subtractive color process is usually used and for the process, silver halide emulsions selectively having sensitivities to blue, green and red respectively and color image-forming agents of yellow, magenta, and cyan each of which is in a complementary color relation with each of the above-described silver halide emulsions are used. That is, to form yellow color images, for example, acylacetanilide series or dibenzoylmethane series couplers are used, to form magenta color images, for example, pyrazolone series, pyrazolotriazole series, pyrazolobenzimidazole series, pyrazolopyrazole series, cyanoacetophnenone series, or indazolone series couplers are mainly used, and to form cyan color images, for example, phenol series or naphthol series couplers are used. Now, each of the dyes formed from these couplers does not have an ideal absorption spectrum, in particular, the magenta and cyan dyes each has a broad absorption spectrum and/or has a side absorption in a short wavelength region, which are undesirable for color reproduction of color photographic materials. In particular, the side absorption in a short wavelength region has a tendency of lowering the saturation. As one means for improving the fault, it can be improved to some extent by causing an interimage effect. The interimage effect is described, for example, in Hanson et al, Journal of the Optical Society of America , Vol. 42, pages 663 to 669 and A. Theils, Zeitschrift fur Wissenschftliche Photographie, Photophysigue und Photochemie , Vol. 47, pages 106 to 118 and pages 246 to 255. It is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,536,386 and 3,536,487 and JP-B-48-34169 (the term JP-B as used herein means an examined Japanese patent publication) that the interimage effect is obtained by using 4-thiazoline-2-thione compounds. However, when each of these compounds is mixed with a silver halide emulsion for coating, after preparing the coating composition containing them, the compound causes a bad action with the passage of time and also when the silver halide light-sensitive material is used after storing the light-sensitive material for a long period of time, there occurs a problem of lowering the sensitivity, etc. When the compound is added to a layer containing substantially no silver halide emulsion adjacent to a silver halide emulsion layer, the above-described problem cannot be avoided. On the other hand, a means of releasing a compound of emphasizing the interimage effect by the oxidation during the development process by using a DIR hydroquinone is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,379,529, 3,620,746, 4,377,634, and 4,332,878 and JP-A-6-308689 (the term JP-A as used herein means an unexamined published Japanese patent application). By these means, the occurrence of the above-described bad action after preparing the coating solution and the problem of causing lowering of the sensitivity after storing the light-sensitive material for a long period of time, which material is prepared by coating the coating solution are reduced and the interimage effect is obtained but these improvements are yet insufficient. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a compound for photography for offering a silver halide color photographic material giving an excellent sharpness without reducing other photographic properties. It has now been discovered that the above-described object can be achieved by the present invention described hereinbelow. That is, according to a 1st aspect of the present invention, there is provided a compound for photography represented by following formula (I): wherein R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 each represents a hydrogen atom or a group capable of being substituted; A and B each represents a hydrogen atom or a group which can be removed with an alkali; time represents a group which releases PUG after released from an oxidation product of the hydroquinone mother nucleus; m represents 0 or 1; and PUG represents a group represented by following formula (II): wherein X represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, a carboxyl group, an alkoxycarbonyl group, a cyano group, or a carbamoyl group; Y represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an aryl group, a heterocyclic group, a carbamoyl group, or an alkoxycarbonyl group; L represents an alkylene group or an arylene group; and n represents 0 or 1.

That is,-when the total silver amount of the same spectral sensitivity layers is 100%, the silver amount of the high-sensitivity emulsion layer is from 15 to 40%, that of the intermediate-sensitivity emulsion layer is from 20 to 50%, and that of the low-sensitivity emulsion layer is from 20 to 50%. In addition, it is preferred that the coated silver amount of the high-sensitivity emulsion layer is less than the coated silver amount of the intermediate-sensitivity emulsion layer or the low-sensitivity emulsion layer.

EXAMPLE 1 (Synthesis methods of the compounds in the present invention) Synthesis Example 1 (Synthesis of PUG (Compound K) of the Compound I-1) To 180.0 g (1.63 mols) of ammonium dithiocarbamate was added 1.5 liters of isopropyl alcohol, the mixture was stirred and then 268.9 g (1.63 mols) of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate was added dropwise to the mixture. After stirring the resultant mixture for 3 hours under refluxing, 300 ml of water was added to the reaction mixture, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and crystals formed were collected by filtration under a reduced pressure to obtain crude crystals. The crude crystals were recrystallized from ethyl acetate to obtain 188 g (yield 57%) of 4-ethoxycarbonylmethyl-2-mercaptothiazole. In 366 ml of water was suspended 185 g (0.91 mol) of 4-ethoxycarbonylmethyl-2-mercaptothiazole and 366 ml (1.84 mols) of an aqueous solution of 5 mol/l sodium hydroxide was added dropwise to the suspension. After heating the mixture for 2 hours in a steam bath with-stirring, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and 165 ml (1.90 mols) of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added dropwise to the mixture. The crystals formed were collected by filtration under a reduced pressure to provide 139.4 g (yield 87.4%) of 4-carboxymethyl-2-mercaptothiazole. In 350 ml of tetrahydrofuran was dissolved 35 g (0.2 mol) of 4-carobxymethyl-2-mercaptothiazole and while cooling the solution to a temperature below 10 C., a solution made up of 41.3 g (0.2 mol) of N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 50 ml of tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise to the solution followed by stirring for one hour at room temperature. Then, while cooling the mixture to a temperature below 5 C., 15.5 g (0.2 mol) of a methanol solution of 40% N-methylamine was added dropwise to the mixture followed by stirring for 2 hours at room temperature. To the reaction mixture were added 750 ml of water and 500 ml of methanol followed by stirring and solids formed were removed by filtration. The filtrate was concentrated under a reduced pressure and purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtained 28.8 g (yield 76.5%) of the desired compound K (N-metylcarbamoylmethyl-2-mercaptothiazole) having a melting point of 146 to 148 C. The structure of the compound thus obtained was confirmed by various kinds of spectra and the elemental analysis. Compound K Synthesis Example 2 (Synthesis of Compound I-1) In 650 ml of chloroform were dissolved 41.3 g (114 mmols) of 2-pentadecanoylamino-1,4-benzoquinone, 24 g (127 mmols) of Compound K, and 5 g (26 mmols) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate and the solution was stirred for 2 hours at 40 C. under a nitrogen gas atmosphere. The reaction mixture was concentrated under a reduced pressure and 300 ml of methanol was added to the residue formed followed by stirring. Crystals formed were collected by filtration under a reduced pressure to obtain 44.1 g (yield 70.4%) of the desired compound I-1 having a melting point of 135 to 137 C. The structure of the compound was confirmed by various kinds of spectra and the elemental analysis. The properties of the compounds synthesized by the synthesis methods as in Synthesis Example 2 are shown in Tables 1, 2 and 3 below. TABLE 1 Melting Elemetal Analysis (%) Compd.

Then, in a ultraviscomill (UVM-2) (trade name, manufactured by Aimex Co.) were filled 1700 ml of zirconia beads having an average particle diameter of 0.5 mm and the above-described slurry was passed therethrough and ground for 8 hours at the circumference speed of about 10 meters/second and at a jetting amount of 0.5 liter/minute. The beads were removed by filtration and after adding water to the filtrate to dilute at a dye concentration of 3%, the filtrate was heated for 10 hours at 90 C. for the stabilization. The average particle diameter of the fine dye particles obtained was 0.60 m and the distribution width of the particle diameters (particle diameter standard deviation100/average particle diameter) was 18%. Similarly, the solid dispersions of the dye E-2 and the dye E-3 respectively were obtained. The average particle diameters of the fine dye particles were 0.54 m and 0.56 m respectively. Preparation of Samples 102 to 118: By following the same procedure as preparing the Sample 101 except that Comparative compound A was added to the layers 3, 4, 10, 16, and 18 of the Sample 101 at the coated amounts (overages) of 810 4 mmol, 510 3 mmol, 110 3 mmol, 310 3 mmol, and 610 3 mmol respectively, Sample 102 was prepared. Also, by following the same procedure of preparing the Sample 102 except that the Comparative compound A used in the Sample 102 was replaced with the equimolar amount of Comparative compound B, Comparative compound C, compounds I-1, I-2, I-7, I-8, I-9, I-12, I-13, I-17, I-25, I-26, I-27, I-29, I-35, and I-36 respectively, Samples 103 to 118 were prepared. The comparative compounds used for preparing the above-described comparative samples are shown below. Comparative Compound A: (the compound described in JP-A-3-226745) Comparative Compound B: (the compound described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,380,633) Comparative Compound C: (the compound released from the compounds I-1, I-2, I-12, etc., of the present invention) Comparative Compounds A, B and C and the compounds of the present invention each was dissolved in four times of tricyclohexyl phosphate, two times of high-boiling organic solvent Oil-3, four times of ethyl acetate, 0.1 times of di-t-octylhydroquinone and two times of U-6, as much as the weight of the compound, under heating. An oily phase component on the solution was added to eight times of aqueous phase component (having a gelatin concentration of 10%, and containing surface active agents W-5 and W-3 each at a concentration of 0.1%) as much as the weight of the oily phase component and the mixture was stirred with maintaining the mixture at a temperature of 50 C. to obtain an emulsified dispersion. The dispersion was added to each layer. Evaluation of samples: After exposing each of the samples 101 to 118 to while light through a continuous wedge, the sample was subjected to the photographic processing described below and image densities obtained were measured. The sensitivities were obtained from the reciprocals of the exposure amounts giving the density of 1.0 about the cyan, magenta, and yellow color image densities of each sample as relative sensitivities to those of the sample 101 taken as 100, respectively and shown as the red sensitivity (S(R)), the green sensitivity (S(G)), and the blue sensitivity (S(B)). Then, each of the samples 101 to 118 was exposed to a red light of the same exposure amount as the red light exposure amount at the above-described white light exposure through the same continuous wedge as the white light exposure and subjected to the photographic processing described below. the difference in the logarithmic values of the exposure amounts logE(R) in the cyan density of 1.0 at the white light exposure and the red light exposure was determined, which was defined as the measure for the interimage effect for the red-sensitive emulsion layer. Similarly, the measures logE(G) and logE(B) of the interimage effect for the green-sensitive emulsion layer and the blue-sensitive emulsion layer were determined. Furthermore, each of the samples 101 to 118 was exposed to a white light through a MTF pattern and subjected to the photographic processing described below. Also, the comparison of the sharpness was performed at the value of MTF of 10 cycles/mm. The summaries of the samples prepared as described above and the evaluation results thereof are shown in Table 7 below.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to antibacterial and antimicrobial compounds useful for pharmaceutical preparations, veterinary drugs, drugs for fisheries use and antibacterial and antimicrobial preservatives. This invention also relates to antibacterial and antimicrobial drugs and antibacterial and antimicrobial preparations containing these compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Since the discovery of norfloxacin, attempts have been made to improve the antimicrobial activity and pharmacokinetics of synthetic quinolone antimicrobial agents. As a result, a number of compounds are clinically available today as chemotherapeutic drugs efficacious in treating systemic infectious diseases. In recent years, however, bacteria hyposensitive to these drugs have been increasing in the field of clinical medicine. Moreover, some bacteria tolerant to drugs other than these synthetic quinolone antimicrobial agents have also become hyposensitive thereto. Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an example of such bacteria having no sensitivity to -lactam antibiotics. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop highly efficacious drugs in the field of clinical medicine. In addition, it is reported that these antimicrobial agents sometimes induce convulsions when administered together with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and exhibit other side effects such as phototoxicity. Thus, there is also a need to develop safer quinolone drugs. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the above, the present inventors have conducted extensive studies with the aim of providing compounds which satisfy the aforementioned requirements. As a result, the present inventors have discovered that substituted aminomethylpyrrolidine derivatives represented by the following formulae (I) and (XI), their salts and hydrates thereof have a broad antibacterial spectrum, exhibit potent antibacterial activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria including Gram positive bacteria, particularly MRSA, and also have favorable pharmacokinetics and high safety. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of these findings. Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention relates to a compound represented by the following formula (I), its salts and hydrates thereof: wherein R 1 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms; R 2 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, wherein the alkyl group represented by R 2 may have at least one substituent selected from the group consisting of a hydroxyl group, a halogen atom, an alkylthio group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms and an alkoxyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms;

The compound represented by the formula (XV) can be formed by removing Q from a compound represented by the following formula: wherein R 111 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a protective group for amino group; R 2 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, provided that the alkyl group may have one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of a hydroxyl group,-a halogen atom and an alkoxy group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms; R 3 and R 5 each represents a hydrogen atom; R 4 represents a hydroxyl group, a halogen atom, a carbamoyl group, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkoxyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an alkylthio group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, provided that the alkyl group may have one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of a hydroxyl group, a halogen atom and an alkoxy group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms; and R 4 and the substituent on the pyrrolidine ring of the following formula: are located in the cis-configuration (as a matter of course, the substituents R 3 and R 5 are also located at the cis-configuration); R 6 and R 7 each independently represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms; n is an integer of from 1 to 3; and Q represents an amino-protective group selected from the group consisting of optionally substituted alkoxycarbonyl groups, optionally substituted aralkyloxycarbonyl groups, optionally substituted acyl groups, optionally substituted alkyl groups, optionally substituted aralkyl groups and substituted silyl groups. This compound having Q moiety may occur as a salt or hydrate thereof or as a hydrate of the salt. Examples of the acid addition salts include inorganic acid salts and organic acid salts. More particularly, inorganic acid salts (e.g., hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, hydrobromide, hydroiodide and phosphate) and organic acid salts (e.g., sulfonates such as methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate and toluenesulfonate, and carboxylates such as acetate, citrate, maleate, fumarate and lactate) are exemplified. When R 111 and Q are both protective groups for amino group, they may be either the same or different from each other. To produce the compound of formula (XI), it is advantageous that these amino-protective groups are those which are removed under different reaction conditions. Examples of the protective groups for R 111 and Q include optionally substituted alkoxycarbonyl groups, optionally substituted aralkyloxycarbonyl groups, optionally substituted acyl groups, optionally substituted alkyl groups, optionally substituted aralkyl groups and substituted silyl groups. Particular examples thereof include optionally substituted alkoxycarbonyl groups (e.g., tert-butoxycarbonyl and 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl), optionally substituted aralkyloxycarbonyl groups (e.g., benzyloxycarbonyl, p-methoxybenzyloxycarbony and p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl), optionally substituted acyl groups (e.g., acetyl, methoxyacetyl, trifluoroacetyl, chloroacetyl, pivaloyl, formyl and benzoyl), optionally substituted alkyl groups and optionally substituted aralkyl groups (e.g., tert-butyl, benzyl, p-nitrobenzyl, p-methoxybenzyl and triphenylmethyl), ethers (e.g., metoxymethyl, tert-butoxymethyl, tetrahydropyranyl and 2,2,2-trichloroethoxymethyl) and substituted silyl groups (e.g., trimethylsilyl, isopropyldimethylsilyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl, tribenzylsilyl and tert-butyldiphenylsilyl). The compound of the formula (XV) can be produced as a cis-compound by forming a compound (pyrroline derivative) wherein the carbon atom to which the substituent R 4 is bonded and the adjacent carbon atom is bonded via a double bond followed by catalytic reduction. Alternatively, the cis-compound can be produced by once forming a compound wherein the substituent R 4 and the substituent moiety having the cyclic structure are located at the trans-configuration and then inverting the configuration of the substituent R 4 . When the compound represented by formula (I) or formula (XI) according to the first and second aspects of the present invention has a structure allowing for the existence of diastereomers, it is preferable that a compound comprised of a single diastereomer is administered to human beings or animals. The term comprised of a single diastereomer as used herein means not only one being completely free from other diastereomers, but also one having a certain degree of chemically purity. That is to say, it may contain other diastereomers so long as neither the physical constants nor the physiological activities thereof are affected thereby. Also, the term stereochemically pure as used herein means a compound consisting of one of the isomers, when the compound has two or more isomers due to one or more asymmetric carbon atoms contained therein. The term pure of this case can be understood in the same manner as the abovementioned case. The pyridonecarboxylic acid derivatives of the first and second aspect of the present invention may be in a free state. Alternatively, they may be converted into acid addition salts or carboxylates thereof. Examples of the acid addition salts include inorganic acid salts (e.g., hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, hydrobromide, hydroiodide and phosphate) and organic acid salts (e.g., acetate, methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, citrate, maleate, fumarate and lactate). Examples of the carboxylates include alkali metal salts (e.g., lithium salt, sodium salt and potassium salt), alkaline earth metal salts (e.g., magnesium salt and calcium salt), ammonium salt, triethylamine salt, N-methylglucamine salt and tris-(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane salt. Either inorganic salts or organic salts are usable therefor. These free pyridonecarboxylic acid derivatives or their acid addition salts or carboxylates may occur as hydrates thereof. On the other hand, quinolone derivatives wherein the carboxylate moiety is an ester are useful as intermediates for synthesis or as prodrugs. For example, alkyl esters, benzyl esters, alkoxyalkyl esters, phenylalkyl esters and phenyl esters are useful as synthetic intermediates. The esters usable as prodrugs are those which are easily cleaved in vivo to thereby form free carboxylates. Examples thereof include acetoxymethyl ester, pivaloyloxymethyl ester, ethoxycarbonyl ester, choline ester, dimethylaminoethyl ester, 5-indanyl ester and oxoalkyl esters such as phthalidinyl ester, 5-alkyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxol-4-ylmethyl ether and 3-acetoxy-2-oxobutyl ester and the like.

DE 1 193 490 and R. Marbet and G. Saucy, Helv. Chim. Acta 50, (1967), 2091-2095 and 2095-2100 disclose a process for the preparation of ,-unsaturated ketones by reacting an allyl alcohol with enol ethers, in particular isopropenyl ethers, in the presence of an acid catalyst, e.g. phosphoric acid. Furthermore, U.S. Pat. No. 3,029,287 and G. Saucy and R. Marbet, Helv. Chim. Acta 50, (1967) 1158-1167 disclose the reaction of the propargyl alcohols with enol ethers in the presence of acid catalysts to give ,,-diunsaturated ketones. In both reactions, one mole of the corresponding ketal is formed as a byproduct from 2 moles of enol ether used, for example acetone dimethyl ketal from isopropenyl methyl ether used, in accordance with the following equations: In these equations, R 1 to R 5 are each hydrogen or alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl or aralkyl radicals which are unsubstituted or substituted by oxygen-containing groups, it also being possible for R 1 and R 2 , together with the carbon atom to which they are bonded, to form a 5- or 6-membered ring, and R 6 is alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The ketal IV obtained as a byproduct must be converted back into the enol ether III for economic reasons. It is known that this can be done by converting the ketals, either in the liquid phase with acidic catalysts (according to EP 703 211) or in the gas phase over heterogeneous catalysts (according to DE 19 544 450) with elimination of alcohol, into the corresponding enol ethers according to the following equation: Here, R is hydrogen or alkyl and R 6 has the abovementioned meaning. The stated known processes permit the preparation of the enol ethers in good yields in some cases but have the following disadvantages: The reaction in the liquid phase according to EP 703 211 requires the use of a dissolved foreign substance, ie. an organic acid, the removal of which from the reaction mixture requires an additional separation step. Compared with the process in the liquid phase using a homogeneously dissolved catalyst, the process according to DE 19544450 has the advantage of the reaction in the gas phase over a heterogeneous catalyst that requires fairly high temperatures. Common to both processes is that one mole of alcohol is separated per mole of ketal and has to be separated off in an additional purification step, at considerable expense in some cases, and as a rule has to be discarded. This applies in particular to methanol, which frequently forms azeotropic mixtures. The weight yield, based on the ketal, is thus inevitably reduced. It is an object of the present invention to provide a combination process which on the one hand permits the preparation of the required enol ether III over a heterogeneous catalyst in good yields without the alcohol originating from the ketal being obtained as a byproduct in stoichiometric amount and, on the other hand, recycling of the ketal obtained in the reactions of equations 1 and 2 into the preparation of the enol ethers. We have found that this object is achieved, according to the invention, by a process for the preparation of unsaturated ketones of the formulae Ia and Ib where R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 and R 5 are each hydrogen or alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl or aralkyl radicals which are substituted or unsubstituted by oxygen-containing groups, it also being possible for R 1 and R 2 together to form a 5- or 6-membered ring, which comprises the combination of the following reactions: a) The conventional reaction of an allyl alcohol of the formula IIa or a propargyl alcohol of the formula IIb with an isopropenyl ether of the formula III where R 6 is alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, with formation of a ketal of the formula IV where R 6 has the abovementioned meaning, as a byproduct, b) preparation of the isopropenyl ether of the formula III by reacting a ketal of the formula IV with propyne or allene, or a mixture thereof in the gas phase at elevated temperatures in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst containing zinc or cadmium together with silicon or oxygen, and c) feeding the ketal of the formula iv formed in the reaction (a) into stage (b) for the preparation of the isopropenyl ether of the formula III again. The reaction of stage (a) is described in detail in the technical literature and is claimed in the present invention not for itself, but in combination with steps (b) and (c): The conditions in stage (a) are described in DE 1193490 or U.S. Pat. No. 3,029 287 or the stated publications in Helv. Chim. Acta. In this context, the information in these patent publications and literature publications are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. The conditions in stage (a) are in general not critical for carrying out the novel combination process and can of course also be varied, for example by the choice of the catalyst and, if required, of the starting materials. Accordingly, more recent improvements of the reaction in stage (a) are of course also suitable, as described, for example, in DE 19 649 564.4. Preferred starting materials of the formula IIa are in particular tertiary allyl alcohols, R 1 preferably being a saturated or unsaturated, branched or straight-chain alkyl radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by oxygen-containing groups, e.g. methoxy or ethoxy groups, an aryl radical or an alkylaryl radical of up to 20 carbon atoms and R 2 is preferably C 1 -C 4 -alkyl, in particular methyl, it also being possible for R 1 and R 2 together to be tetramethylene or pentamethylene which is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more lower alkyl groups, and R 3 , R 4 and R 5 are each hydrogen. Specific examples are 3-methyl-1-buten-3-ol, 3,7-dimethyl-1-octen -3-ol (hydrolinalool), 3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-3-ol (linalool), 1-vinylcyclohexanol, 3,7,11-trimethyl-dodeca-1,6,10-trien-3-ol (nerolidol), 3,7,11-trimethyl-dodeca-1,6-dien-3-ol (hydronerolidol) and 3,7,11-trimethyl-dodec-1-en-3-ol(tetrahydronerolidol) and isophytol. Preferred propargyl alcohols are tertiary propargyl alcohols of the formula IIb where R 1 is a saturated or unsaturated, branched or straight-chain alkyl radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by oxygen-containing groups, or an aryl radical or an alkylaryl radical, each of up to 20 carbon atoms, and R 2 is C 1 -C 4 -alkyl, in particular methyl, it also being possible for R 1 and R 2 together to be tetramethylene or pentamethylene which is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more lower alkyl groups, and R 4 is hydrogen. Specific examples are 3-methylbutyn-3-ol, 3,7-dimethyl-l-octyn-3-ol(hydrodehydrolinalool), 3,7-dimethylocta-6-en-1-yn-3-ol(dehydrolinalool), 3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-6,10-dien-1-yn-3-ol(dehydronerolidol), 3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-6-en-1-yn-3-ol and 3,7,11-trimethyldodec-1-yn-3-ol. A particularly suitable isopropenyl ether of the formula III is isopropenyl methyl ether. The preparation of the isopropenyl ethers of the formula III where R 6 has the abovementioned meanings, as described more comprehensively and claimed in German Patent Application 19 726 667.3, is carried out according to stage (b) by reacting a ketal of the formula IV with propyne and/or allene in the gas phase in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst containing zinc or cadmium and silicon and oxygen. Although the mechanism of this reaction is not known in detail, the reaction may be regarded formally as if one mole of an alcohol R 6 OH is transferred from the dialkoxy compound of the formula IV to the acetylene or allene with formation of the enol ether of the formula III. Examples of suitable ketals are the dimethyl, diethyl, di-n-propyl, di-n-butyl and diisobutyl ketals of acetone. 2,2-Dimethoxypropane (acetone dimethyl ketal) is particularly preferred as a starting material. The ketals and their preparation from acetone are disclosed in the technical literature. They are obtained, for example, by reacting acetone with the corresponding alcohols or preferably by an addition reaction of alcohols with alkynes or allene, mixtures of enol ethers and the corresponding ketals being obtained, enol ethers being used immediately after the separation of said mixtures and it being possible to feed the ketals to stage (b). In the overall balance of the novel process, however, only the losses of ketal as a result of secondary reactions should be replenished since, in the overall balance according to Equations 3 and 4 and Summation equation 5, the required enol ether is constantly formed again from propyne and allene. Equation 3 (for the reaction of the allyl alcohols as in the Example) Instead of pure methylacetylene or pure allene, mixtures thereof may also be used, especially mixtures as can be isolated, for example, from a C 3 stream of a steamcracker. The reaction of the ketals or acetals with the acetylenes or allenes is carried out in the presence of the heterogeneous catalyst containing zinc or cadmium and silicon and oxygen in the gas phase, either over a fixed bed or in a fluidized bed at from 50 to 400 C., preferably from 100 to 250 C., particularly preferably from 120 to 200 C., and pressures of from 0.1 to 50, in particular from 0.8 to 20, particularly preferably from 0.9 to 10, bar (all pressures are based on the sum of partial pressures of the starting materials). If required, the reaction mixture may be diluted with inert gases, such as nitrogen, argon, low molecular weight alkanes or olefins for operational safety or better heat removal. The molar ratio of ketal or acetal to alkyne or allene may be from 0.01 to 100, and is preferably from 0.1 to 2, particularly preferably from 0.7 to 1.3. Suitable catalysts containing zinc or cadmium and silicon and oxygen are cadmium silicates and preferably zinc silicates, for example silicates selected from the group consisting of (a) X-ray amorphous zinc silicate and cadmium silicate, prepared by impregnating a silica carrier with a zinc or cadmium salt, (b) crystalline zinc silicate having essentially the composition and structure of hemimorphite of the formula Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 H 2 O, where the zinc may be present in up to 25% more or less than the stoichiometric amount, and/or (c) essentially X-ray amorphous zinc silicate, prepared by precipitation in aqueous solution from a soluble silicon and zinc compound of the formula V Zn a Si c O a2c0.5e (OH) e f H 2 O V, where e is from 0 to 2a4c, the ratio a/c is from 1 to 3.5 and the ratio f/a is from 0 to 200. (a) X-ray amorphous zinc silicate or cadmium silicate catalysts are obtained, for example, by loading amorphous silica with a zinc salt or cadmium salt and forming the catalyst by thermal treatment. The SiO 2 carrier is at least predominantly amorphous, has a BET surface area from 10 to 1500 m 2 /g, particularly preferably from 100 to 500 m 2 /g and water absorbtivity of from 0.1 to 2, particularly preferably from 0.7 to 1.3 ml/g and can be used in the form of a powder or in the form of prepared moldings. The carrier can furthermore be calcined prior to impregnation. Preferably, however, the carrier is not calcined. The zinc or cadmium compound used is a compound which is soluble in a suitable solvent. Zinc(II) salts which are soluble in water or aqueous ammonia or alcohols, preferably lower alcohols, and whose decomposition temperature is below 400 C. to 500 C. are preferably used. An ammoniacal zinc(II) acetate solution is particularly preferably used for the impregnation. In some cases, it has proven advantageous to carry out the loading with zinc in a plurality of successive impregnations. If the carrier is used in the form of a powder, the catalyst may be brought into the desired form by shaping (for example mixing, kneading and extrusion or pelleting). To increase the pore volume, pore formers may also be used during the shaping (for example superabsorbers, such as Lutexal (from BASF Ludwigshafen) or Walocel (methylcellulose/synthetic resin combination, from Wolff, Walsrode)). Alternatively, it is also possible to impregnate another carrier, eg. Al 2 O 3 , with a silica precursor compound (eg. Si(OR) 4 ) and with a zinc salt or cadmium salt. The zinc or cadmium load may vary within wide limits. Typical values for an uncalcined precatalyst which was prepared by impregnating an SiO 2 carrier with a zinc salt or cadmium salt are, for example, from 1 to 60, preferably from 7 to 30, particularly preferably from 10 to 25, % by weight (calculated in each case as ZnO or CdO) of Zn or Cd. The precatalyst may furthermore be doped with other elements, preferably alkali metals, alkaline earth metals or transition metals. Moreover, the catalytically active component may be doped with up to 80, preferably up to 50, in particular up to 20, mol percent of further metals selected from the group (A) consisting of beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel and copper and from the group (B) consisting of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, germanium, tin and lead, some of the elements of group (A) replacing zinc or cadmium and some of the elements from group (B) replacing silicon. The precatalyst can then be calcined at not more than 600 C., in particular from 80 to 300 C., in air or under an inert gas. Calcination at from 120 to 250 C. in air is particularly preferred. After the preparation of the generally still catalytically inactive precatalyst by application of a zinc or cadmium compound to a silica carrier, forming is preferably carried out, in which the actual active phase is formed in particular on the surface of the catalyst. This solid-state reaction is promoted by the presence of water, alcohols, preferably lower alcohols, or carboxylic acids, preferably lower carboxylic acids, and is therefore advantageously carried out by heating the precatalyst at from 50 to 400 C. in a water- or alcohol-containing atmosphere. The reaction is preferably carried out at from 100 to 250 C. in a water- or methanol-containing gas mixture. The reaction is particularly preferably carried out at from 120 to 200 C. with a methanol-containing gas mixture directly in the reactor in which the reaction with the alkyne or allene is subsequently to take place. If a precatalyst based on zinc acetate is used, it is very easy to determine when the solid-state reaction is complete as virtually no methyl acetate is to be found in the exit gas at this time. In some cases it has proven advantageous to treat the precatalyst under reaction conditions with a mixture of methanol with propyne and allene and possibly also other components (eg. propene or propane) for the formation of the active phase. Formation of the active layer is indicated by the increase in the propyne and allene conversion (after from about 5 to 30 minutes, depending on the temperature), by the increase in the selectivity (after from 10 to 300 minutes, depending on the temperature) and by the decline in the concentration of methyl acetate in the exit gas. A steady state (with high propyne or allene conversions) and a high selectivity is reached after from about 2 to 20 hours, depending on the temperature. It is also possible to prepare the corresponding mercury silicates but these are technically and ecologically less suitable. Standard methods were used for characterizing the catalyst samples (fresh samples as well as samples removed from the reactor). The measured BET surface area, which is typically from 10 to 800 m 2 /g, and the hardness are stated in the respective examples. Catalysts having BET surface areas of from 100 to 400 m 2 /g are preferred. Furthermore, the samples were investigated in detail by means of powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Neither of the two structure analysis methods reveals any long-range order in the sense of a crystalline structure; all samples were amorphous. The distribution of the zinc over the carrier was investigated on appropriate sections under the electron microscope and by means of a microprobe. All samples, even after removal from the reactor, show that the catalyst has a substantially homogeneous distribution of elements and contains little or no crystalline ZnO. In the IR investigation (KBr pellets), the active catalyst prepared with zinc acetate shows no acetate bands (these are still visible in the precatalyst at 1570, 1410, 670 and 610 cm 1 ). In the 13 C-CP-MAS-NMR, too, acetate signals are no longer present. In the 29 Si-CP-MAS-NMR, the catalyst shows only the broad band at 109 ppm which is typical of amorphous SiO 2 , and a shoulder at 99 ppm (about 10% of the intensity of the main peak). The elemental analysis of a zinc acetate/SiO 2 precatalyst shows that the molar C/Zn ratio is dependent on the calcination temperature. Catalysts dried at room temperature have a C/Zn ratio of 3.5 4. After calcination at 200-250 C. (optimum temperature), the C/Zn ratio is from 1 to 2. At higher temperatures, the C/Zn ratio decreases even further, as does the catalytic activity of the catalysts formed therefrom. After calcination at 500 C. (24 hours), the C/Zn ratio in the precatalyst is 0.02. Active catalyst cannot be formed from this. Since the decomposition of the zinc acetate on the precatalyst is relatively slow, said precatalyst can be exposed to even higher temperatures for short times without the catalytic activity being completely lost. (b) Hemimorphite as catalyst Hemimorphite is a zinc silicate of the formula Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 H 2 O. However, not only pure hemimorphite but in general heterogeneous catalysts which contain, as active component, at least predominantly zinc silicate having the structure of hemimorphite of the formula Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 22y O y x H 2 O, where x and y are from 0 to 1, are suitable for the novel reaction. The preparation of hemimorphite is disclosed in the literature. It can be carried out under standard pressure conditions or under hydrothermal conditions. (b1) Preparation under standard pressure conditions A. G. Merkulov and B. S. Khristoforov, (Tr. Soveshch, Eksp. Tekh. Mineral. Petrogr., 8th (1971), Meeting Date 1968, 322-8; Editor(s): V. V. Lapin; Publisher: Nauka, Moscow, USSR) describe the preparation of various zinc silicates by reaction of various zinc salts (carbonate, sulfate, chloride, acetate, oxide) with sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide in aqueous solution at 90-100 C. and at atmospheric pressure. Different zinc silicates form depending on the pH established. For example, pure sauconite having the composition Zn 3 Si 4 O 10 (OH) 2 n H 2 O forms at a final pH of 5-6. Pure willemite (-Zn 2 SiO 4 ) is obtained at a pH of 6.5-8.5. On the other hand, pure hemimorphite (Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 H 2 O) crystallizes out only in a weakly alkaline medium at pH greater than 10. In another paper by the stated authors (A. G. Merkulov and B. S. Khristoforov, Izv. Sib. Otd. Akad. Nauk SSSR, Ser. Khim. Nauk 4 (1969), 70-4), it is stated that pure hemimorphite is formed in the reaction of the zinc salts with sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide at 90-100 C. and atmospheric pressure in aqueous solution only at a pH of 10-12. Furthermore, T. Baird, A. G. Cairns Smith and D. S. Snell (Reactivity of Solids, Proc. Int. Symp., 8th (1977), Gothenberg, Meeting Date 1976, 337-42; Editor(s): J. Wood, O. Lindqvist und C. Helgesson; Publisher: Plenum Press, New York, N.Y.) were able to prepare large crystals of hemimorphite by reacting Zn(OH) 2 with silica and LiOH in aqueous solution at a pH of 10. Finally, H. Nagata, M. Matsunage and K. Hosokawa (Zairyo-to-Kankyo 42 (1993), 225-233) prepared hemimorphite by reacting aqueous zinc sulfate solution with sodium hydroxide solution and aqueous sodium silicate solution at a pH of 13, isolating the precipitate obtained and washing it thoroughly and ageing it at 85 C. for at least 24 hours. (b2) Hydrothermal preparation According to EP 165 647, hemimorphite can be prepared from an acid-treated clay mineral and zinc oxide or zinc hydroxide under hydrothermal conditions (170 C., 5 h). However, the acid pretreatment of the clay is very expensive and this process is therefore disadvantageous. According to D. M. Roy and F. A. Mumpton (Econ. Geol. 51 (1956), 432-443), hemimorphite can also be obtained by a hydrothermal reaction of mixtures of ZnO and SiO 2 at 175-200 C. (composition: 3 ZnO2 SiO 2 ). The product obtained contains predominantly hemimorphite but is contaminated with sauconite (Zn 3 Si 4 O 10 O(OH) 2 4 H 2 O). Finally, P. Taylor and D. G. Owen, (Polyhedron 3(2) (1984), 151-155) describe the hydrothermal synthesis of hemimorphite by reacting ZnO with SiO 2 in aqueous solution at 150 C. However, long reaction times of at least 4 days are required for the preparation of products having a high hemimorphite content. Although hemimorphite products obtained by the known methods described above are very suitable as a catalyst for the novel addition reaction, it was found to be desirable further to improve their properties to propose a method which permits the preparation of catalysts with a reproducibly good property profile. Accordingly, a preferred novel preparation method, both under atmospheric pressure and under hydrothermal conditions, is one in which an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal silicate, preferably sodium silicate, is reacted with a zinc salt, in particular zinc nitrate, and a base, such as an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, in particular sodium hydroxide, in aqueous solution at pH of from 4 to 9.5, preferably from 5.5 to 8, in particular at neutral pH, for example, at pH 6-7.5, at from 50 to 100 C., in particular from 70 to 100 C., in the case of atmospheric pressure and at from 100 to 250 C., preferably from 100 to 200 C., in the case of hydrothermal conditions. Pure hemimorphite having a Zn/Si ratio of 2 can be synthesized by this preparation method. However, hemimorphite preparation having a zinc content up to 25% less than or greater than the stoichiometric amount, corresponding to a Zn : Si atomic ratio of from 1.6 to 2.5, are also obtainable. Hemimorphites which contain 0-20% excess of zinc are preferred as catalysts. Hemimorphites which contain 0-10% excess of zinc are particularly preferred. The hemimorphite products are obtained in the synthesis as white crystalline precipitate in the form of an aqueous suspension and must be separated from the aqueous solution by suitable measures, for example filtration or centrifuging. In the case of filtration, the filter cake obtained is then washed sodium- and nitrate-free and then dried. Drying can be carried out at up to 600 C., preferably from 90 to 250 C. Thermogravimetric investigations have shown that the crystallized hemimorphite of the composition Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 H 2 O loses increasing proportions of its water of crystallization at from about 100 to 200 C. with a retention of the hemimorphite structure, resulting in hemimorphite preparations of the composition Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 x H 2 O where x is less than 1 and decreases with increasing temperature. If drying is carried out in a higher temperature range from about 200 to 600 C., the OH ions present in the hemimorphite are additionally converted into O 2 -ions and eliminated H 2 O (2 OH H 2 OO 2 ), likewise with retention of the hemimorphite structure, resulting in hemimorphite preparations of the composition Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 22y O y , where y is from 0 to 1 and increases with increasing temperature. Hemimorphite preparations obtained after drying up to 600 C., preferably from 90 to 450 C., and having the composition Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 22y O y x H 2 O, where x and y are from 0 to 1, are then usually processed by the conventional shaping methods, for example pelleting or extrusion, or are converted into coated catalysts on steatite beads to give catalytic moldings. The details are described in the examples. Standard methods are used for characterizing the catalyst samples (fresh samples as well as samples removed from the reactor). The measured BET surface area is as a rule from 3 to 400 m 2 /g. Catalysts with BET surface areas of from 20 to 300 m 2 /g are preferably used. Furthermore, the samples obtained by the novel preparation process are investigated in detail by means of powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The measured powder X-ray diffraction pattern agrees with that of index card 5-0555 of the JCPDS-ICDD index (1995). (c) X-ray amorphous zinc silicate catalyst If the procedure is carried out essentially under the same preparation conditions but for a shorter reaction time, an X-ray amorphous product having improved catalytic properties is obtained as an intermediate for the preparation of a crystalline hemimorphite. For this purpose, an aqueous suspension of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal silicate is reacted with an aqueous solution of a zinc salt a) at from 20 C., preferably 50 C., to the boiling point of the resulting aqueous suspension b) at a pH of from 4 to 9.5, preferably at a pH close to the neutral point, c) and in ratios of alkali metal silicate to zinc salt such that the conditions of the formula V are fulfilled and d) the residence time is maintained such that crystallization of the zinc silicate does not yet occur to any considerable extent. The essentially X-ray amorphous zinc silicate thus obtainable contains Zn 2 , Si 4 and O 2 ions; in addition, the compound may contain OH ions and water of hydration. The Zn/Si ratio is from 0.3 to 5, preferably from 1 to 2.7, particularly preferably from 2 to 2.3, very particularly preferably 2. In the latter case, the X-ray amorphous zinc silicate thus has the Zn/Si ratio of crystalline hemimorphite (Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 H 2 O). In a graph in which the intensity A of the diffracted X-rays is plotted as a function of twice the diffraction angle (2) , the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the X-ray amorphous zinc silicate, obtained using Cu-K 1 radiation (1.5406 ), has, in the 2 range from 10 to 90, very broad intensity maxima at 2315 and at 2617. The precipitated amorphous zinc silicate catalyst to be used according to the invention can also be doped with up to 80, preferably up to 50, in particular up to 20, mol percent of further metals selected from the group (A) consisting of beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, cadmium and mercury and from the group (B), consisting of titanium, zirconium, hafnium, germanium, tin and lead, the elements of group (A) replacing some of the zinc and the elements of group (B) replacing some of the silicon in the hemimorphite structure. The X-ray amorphous zinc silicate is obtained as a powder in the preparation. This powder can be used as such for the catalytic reaction (for example in a fluidized-bed reactor) or after molding (for example extrusion, pelleting, etc., possibly also with the addition of assistants in a form suitable for a fixed-bed reactor. Before use, the catalyst can be calcined at from 80 to 750 C., preferably from 120 to 500 C., particularly preferably from 200 to 400 C. in the air. To increase the pore volume, pore formers may also be added during the shaping, for example during the pelleting or extrusion (for example superabsorbers such as Lutexal P (from BASF AG) or Walocel (methylcellulose/synthetic resin combination, from Wolff, Walsrode AG)). General reaction conditions of the novel combination process with the steps (a), (b) and (c). The combination of stages (a) to (c) can be carried out batchwise or, preferably, continuously. In the case of the batchwise procedure, the ketal of the formula IV obtained as a byproduct in stage (a) is collected in a storage container and converted into the enol ether of the formula III, temporarily, and, if required, spatially separately from the process of stage (a). In the continuous procedure preferred on the industrial scale, the preparation of the enol ether and the recycling of the ketal to the enol ether preparation stage are spatially integrated in one plant. A very small volume is then required for the buffer container and transport is dispensed with. The reaction of stage (b) is carried out as a rule in a tube reactor, the propyne and/or allene (or preferably a mixture composed of 30-43% by volume of propyne, 16-20% by volume of allene, 20-45% by volume of propene, 5-10 by volume of isobutane and 2-6% by volume of propane, obtained by distillation from a side-stream of a steam cracker) were metered in with the ketal under superatmospheric pressure. The starting materials are mixed shortly before the reactor and are let down into the reactor space. The reaction is carried out as a rule isothermally from 120 to 300 C. and with a feed rate of from 0.5 to 10 mmol/min of propyne and/or allene and from 0.5 to 20 mmol/min of ketal. The reaction pressure is from 0.1 to 50, preferably from 1.1 to 3.5, bar (absolute). The enol ether formed in stage (b) is separated from the propene/propane inert gas stream and then purified by distillation. The distilled enol ether is then used in stage (a). The ketal formed as a byproduct in stage (a) is separated from the reacted mixture, if necessary after prior neutralization, by distillation over a column having about 10 theoretical plates at from 100 mbar to 1 bar, preferably from 300 to 800 mbar, and is taken off via the top. The distillate contains excess enol ether III and acetone in addition to the ketal IV. This stream can, in accordance with stage (c), be fed directly into the synthesis of the enol ether or, preferably, be further purified in another column. This column can be operated batchwise or, preferably, continuously. In this case, the excess enol ether III is obtained as top product and used directly as a starting material for stage (a). Acetone is removed via a side take-off. The ketal IV is obtained at the bottom and is reacted with propyne/allene to give the enol ether III, in accordance with stage (c). EXAMPLES Example 1 Stage a) 200 g of hydrodehydrolinalool (1.3 mol), 306 g of an azeotropic mixture consisting of 2-methoxypropene (prepared by the process of stage b, see below) and methanol (3.9 mol of 2-methoxypropene) and 1 g of potassium hydrogen sulfate (dried and powdered) were introduced into a pressure-resistant vessel. The reactor was flushed with nitrogen and closed. The reaction was initiated during heating up. The temperature increased to 140 C. in the course of about 20 minutes, and the pressure to about 5 bar. The reaction mixture was then stirred for a further 2.5 hours at 120 C. to complete the reaction. First, the low boilers contained in the reacted mixture, ie. primarily 2,2-dimethoxypropane and excess 2-methoxypropene, were separated off in a rotary evaporator at about 500 mbar and condensed in a cold trap. The residue was distilled at a reduced pressure of 1 mbar over a bridge. 249 g of 6,10-dimethylundeca-4,5-dien-2-one were obtained in a purity of 85%. Stage c) The condensate containing 2,2-dimethoxypropane, acetone and excess 2-methoxypropene and obtained from a plurality of batches were subjected to fractional distillation and the fraction consisting of 2-methoxypropene was reused directly for stage (a). The fraction consisting of 2,2-dimethoxypropane was fed into stage (b). The fraction consisting mainly of acetone was discarded. Stage b) ba) Preparation of the catalyst (amorphous zinc silicate; by impregnation) The Zn/SiO 2 supported catalyst was obtained by impregnating X-ray amorphous SiO 2 moldings (beads of diameter 3-6 mm) having a BET surface area of 358 m 2 /g, a water absorbtivity of 0.9 ml/g and a hardness of 43 N/molding with ammoniacal zinc acetate solution. For this purpose, 225 g of SiO 2 carrier (Siligel, from Solvay) were impregnated with 151.70 g of Zn(OAc) 2 2 H 2 O (Merck), dissolved in 220 g of 9% strength NH 4 OH solution at room temperature, and the precatalyst was dried for 16 hours at 120 C. and then calcined for 4 hours under air at 250 C. The precatalyst had a BET surface area of 195 m 2 /g and a hardness of 76 N/molding. The acetate/Zn ratio was 0.9 mol/mol. bb) Reaction About 90 ml of precatalyst were introduced into a stirred reactor. Propyne/allene mixture (55 mol %, remainder propene) and 2,2-dimethoxypropane were then metered in by means of HPLC pumps. The reaction was continued at the first setting (170 C.) until the active catalyst had completely formed and the conversion and selectivity were constant (about 20 hours). The temperature and the feeds were then changed according to Table 1. The results are summarized in Table 1. The pressure was 1.35 bar (abs) in all experiments. Abbreviations: 2 MP: 2-methoxypropene; 22 DMP: 2,2-dimethoxypropane; 1 MP: 1-methoxypropene (cis and trans); 11 DMP: 1,1-dimethoxypropane. The stated selectivities are based on propyne and allene. The condensed reacted mixtures were subjected to fractional distillation. The 2-methoxypropene fraction was used as a starting material in stage (a) and the unconverted dimethoxypropane fraction was recycled to reaction (bb). TABLE 1 Feeds/mmol/min Conversions/% Temp.

The reactor was flushed with nitrogen and closed. After a reaction time of 1 hour at 120 C., the mixture was cooled to about 50 C. and a further 0.58 g of KHSO 4 , dissolved in 1.74 g of water, was added. The mixture was once again heated to 120 C. After a reaction time of one hour, the reaction was complete. Distillation was carried out as in Example 1.147 g of a mixture comprising mainly 2-methoxypropene and 2,2-dimethoxypropane and 213 g of a fraction comprising 1.6% of 3,7,11-trimethyldodec-1-yn-3-ol, 67% of 6,10,14-trimethylpentadeca-4,5-dien-2-one, and 7.3% of 6,10,14-trimethylpentadeca-3,5-dien-2-one were obtained. Stage c) The methoxypropene/2,2-dimethoxypropane/acetone mixture from a plurality of batches was subjected to fractional distillation, the methoxypropene fraction was reused directly for the reaction of stage (a) and the dimethoxypropane fraction was introduced into stage b (see below) as a starting material. Stage b) ba) Preparation of the catalyst (hemimorphite Zn/Si2) In an 8 l stirred container, a suspension A comprising 1.5 mol of SiO 2 and 0.89 mol of Na was prepared from 4.5 l of demineralized water and 145.1 g of soda water glass powder containing 62.1% by weight of SiO 2 and 19.0% by weight of Na 2 O (from Riedel-de Haen, D-30918 Seelze). Furthermore, 910.7 g of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 6 H 2 O (98% strength) were dissolved in 2.25 l of demineralized water at room temperature, a solution B containing 3 mol of Zn and 6 mol of NO 3 being obtained. Finally, an aqueous solution was prepared from 204.4 g of NaOH in 0.225 1 of demineralized water, a solution C having an Na content of 5.11 mol being obtained. Solutions B and C were then added to suspension A at room temperature, a milky suspension D containing the following proportions of elements being obtained: Zn content3 mol, Si content1.5 mol, Na content6 mol, NO 3 content6 mol. The pH of the resulting suspension D was 7.1. The suspension D was heated to 90 C. and stirred at a speed of 200 rpm for 24 hours at this temperature. The suspension was then cooled to room temperature, and a final pH of 7.0 was measured. The white precipitate which crystallized out was filtered off and washed Na-free with demineralized water and the resulting filter cake was dried at 90 C. in a drying oven. The dried white powder was investigated by X-ray diffraction and gave an X-ray powder pattern which corresponded completely to index card 5-0555 of the JCPDS-ICDD index (1995) and thus indicated the preparation of Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 H 2 O. The specific surface area of the resulting powder, determined according to BET, was 30 m 2 /g. For the preparation of a catalyst, the still moist powder was directly molded to give extrudates (diameter3 mm, pressure50 bar), which were then dried for 16 hours at 120 C. The prepared catalyst had a BET surface area of 26 m 2 /g and a hardness of 6 N/molding. bb) Reaction About 90 ml of the catalyst were introduced into a stirred reactor. Propyne/allene (about 63% strength by volume, 1.68 mmol/min) and 2,2-dimethoxypropane (2.17 mmol/min; total feed with inert substances: 6.46 mmol/min; 2,2-dimethoxypropane/(propyneallene) ratio1.29) were then metered in by means of HPLC pumps. The reaction temperature was 170 C. and the pressure 1.35 bar (abs), and the partial pressure of the starting materials was 0.8 bar. The following selectivities were observed from the beginning (ie. the catalyst had no forming time): 2-methoxypropene: 97.4%; acetone: 2.3%; cis- and trans-1-methoxypropene: 0.3%. The condensed reacted mixtures were subjected to fractional distillation. The 2-methoxypropene fraction was used as a starting material in stage (a) and the dimethoxypropane fraction not added was recycled to the reaction (bb). By-products formed in small amounts were discarded. Example 3 Stage a) 25.9 g of hydrolinalool and 45.5 g of isopropenyl ethyl ether (purity 85%) and 93 mg of 75% strength phosphoric acid were introduced into a pressure-resistant container having a volume of 300 ml, and the container was closed, flushed with nitrogen and heated to 175 C. After a reaction time of 12 hours, the container was cooled and emptied and the reacted mixture was distilled over a column (h10 cm, filled with 3 mm wire mesh rings). The first fraction (27.2 g) distilled over at 70 C. at atmospheric pressure and contained 2,2-diethoxypropane as the main product. At 0.9 mbar, 6,10-dimethylundec-5-en-2-one was obtained in a yield of 83%. Stage c) The forerun containing 2,2-diethoxypropane was collected from a plurality of batches and introduced into stage b) as starting material. Stage b) ba) Preparation of the catalyst (hemimorphite Zn/Si2.2) In a 6 l stirred container, a suspension A containing 1.0 mol of SiO 2 and 0.59 mol of Na was prepared from 3.0 l of demineralized water and 96.8 g of soda water glass powder containing 62.1% by weight of SiO 2 and 19.0% by weight of Na 2 O (from Riedel-de Haen, D-30918 Seelze), a solution B containing 2.2 mol of Zn and 4.4 mol of NO 3 was prepared from 667.8 g of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 6 H 2 O (98% strength) in 1.5 l of demineralized water at room temperature and an aqueous solution C having an Na content of 3.81 mol was prepared from 152.3 g of NaOH in 0.4 l of demineralized water. Solutions B and C were added to suspension A at room temperature, a milky suspension D containing the following proportions of elements being obtained: Zn content2.2 mol, Si content1 mol, Na content4.4 mol, NO 3 content4.4 mol. The pH of the resulting suspension D was 7.2. The suspension D was heated to 90 C. and stirred at 200 rpm for 24 hours at this temperature. After the suspension had been cooled to room temperature, a final pH of 7.0 was measured. The resulting white precipitate was filtered off and washed Na-free with demineralized water and the filter cake obtained was dried at 90 C. in a drying oven. The dried white powder was investigated by X-ray diffraction and gave an X-ray powder pattern which completely corresponded to index card 5-0555 of the JCPDS-ICDD index (1995) and thus indicated the preparation of Zn 4 Si 2 O 7 (OH) 2 H 2 O. The specific surface area of the resulting powder, determined according to BET, was 60 m 2 /g. 650 g of the powder were mixed with 20.2 g of magnesium stearate (Merck) and molded to give 20 mm pellets. These pellets were processed to give chips (0.5 mm). The pellets were then calcined for 10 hours at 350 C. The prepared catalyst had a BET surface area of 44 m 2 /g and a hardness of 44 N/molding. bb) Reaction About 90 ml of the catalyst were introduced into a stirred reactor. Propyne/allene mixture (about 60% strength by volume, 1.64 mmol/min) and 2,2-diethoxypropane (2.14 mmol/min; total feed with inert substances: 8.34 mmol/min; 2,2-diethoxypropane/(propyneallene) ratio1.30) were then metered in by means of HPLC pumps. The reaction temperature was 170 C. and the pressure 1.35 bar (abs.), and the partial pressure of the starting materials was 0.8 bar. The following selectivities were observed from the beginning (ie. the catalyst had no forming time): 2-ethoxypropene: 97.0%; acetone: 2.3%; cis- and trans-1-ethoxypropene: 0.5%. The following values were determined for the catalyst after removal from the reactor: BET surface area 44 m 2 /g, hardness 12 N/molding. The collected condensed reacted mixture was subjected to fractional distillation and the 2-ethoxypropene fraction was fed to stage a) as a starting material. Unconverted diethoxypropane was recycled to the reaction. Example 4 Stage a) 18.7 g of hydrolinalool, 46 g of isopropenyl propyl ether (purity 80%) and 85 mg of 75% strength phosphoric acid were reacted and worked up as in the previous example. 27 g of a byproduct fraction containing 2,2-dipropoxypropane as the main component and a yield of 79% of theory, based on hydrolinalool, of 6,10-dimethylundec-5-en-2-one were obtained. The 2,2-dipropoxypropane fraction was fed to stage (b). Stage b) (Precipitated X-ray amorphous catalyst; Zn/Si ratio 2.1) In a 12 l stirred container, 120.93 g of soda water glass powder containing 62.1% by weight of SiO 2 and 19.0% by weight of Na 2 O (from Riedel-de-Haen, D-30918 Seelze) were added to 7.5 l of demineralized water at 80 C with constant stirring (100 rpm), a suspension A containing 1.25 mol of SiO 2 and 0.74 mol of Na being obtained. An aqueous solution B comprising 180.4 g of NaOH (corresponding to 4.51 mol of Na) in 0.5 l of demineralized water was then prepared. In addition, 796.8 g of Zn(NO 3 ) 2 6 H 2 O (Zn content98%) were dissolved in 2.5 l of demineralized water, a solution C containing 2.625 mol of Zn and 5.25 mol of NO 3 being obtained. The solution B was then added to the suspension A at 80 C., a clear solution D being obtained after about 5 minutes. The solution C was then added to the solution D obtained. A white suspension E containing 2.625 mol of Zn, 1.25 mol of Si, 5.25 mol of Na and 5.25 mol of NO 3 resulted. The suspension E was heated at 80 C. for 2 hours while stirring (100 rpm) and then cooled to room temperature. After cooling, a final pH of 6.5 was measured. The resulting white precipitate was filtered off and washed Na-free with demineralized water. The filter cake obtained was dried at 80 C. in a drying oven. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The dried white powder was investigated by X-ray diffraction and gave an X-ray powder pattern which corresponded to that of FIG. 1 and thus indicated the preparation of predominant amounts of X-ray amorphous zinc silicate in addition to a small amount of crystalline ZnO (index card 5-0664 of the JCPDS-ICDD index (1995)). The specific surface area of the resulting powder, determined according to BET, was 102.1 m 2 /g. 650 g of the amorphous zinc silicate prepared as described above and having the composition of hemimorphite were mixed with 20.2 g of zinc stearate and precompacted to give 20 mm pellet, then communicated to chips having a diameter of 0.5 mm and then molded to give pellets measuring 4.755.2 mm. The catalyst had a BET surface area of 75 m 2 /g and a hardness of 43 N/pellet. A 100 g portion of the catalyst was then calcined at 350 C. for 10 hours in the air. About 90 ml of the catalyst were introduced into a stirred reactor. Propyne/allene mixture (49.8% strength by volume, 1.84 mmol/min) and 2,2-dipropoxypropane (2.15 mmol/min; total feed with inert substances: 6.79 mmol/min; 2,2-dipropoxypropane/(propyneallene) ratio1.17) were then metered in by means of HPLC pumps. The reaction temperature was 170 C. and the pressure 1.35 bar (abs), and the partial pressure of the starting materials was 0.8 bar. The following selectivities were observed: 2-propoxypropene 97.1%; 2-dipropoxypropane 2.5%; cis- and trans-1-propoxypropene 0.4%. The conversion was 21%, based on propyne/propadiene. This catalyst had virtually no forming time. The stated conversion and the selectivity were virtually constant from the beginning. The BET surface area was 82 m 2 /g after the calcination and 64 m 2 /g after removal from the reactor. The hardness was 28 N/pellet after calcination and 36 N/pellet after removal from the reactor. Example 5 380.8 g of hydrolinalool, 55.5 g of isopropenyl n-butyl ether (purity 90%) and 113 mg of 75% strength phosphoric acid were reacted as in Example 4. Working up was carried out by distillation at 0.3 mbar. 29 g of a mixture consisting mainly of 2,2-dibutoxypropane, isopropenyl n-butyl ether and butanol were obtained and 6,10-dimethylundec-5-en-2-one was obtained in a yield of 74%. Using the catalyst described in Example 4, similar results were obtained on recycling of the 2,2-dibutoxypropane and reaction with fresh 2,2-dibutoxypropane. Example 6 66 g of hydronerolidol, 60 g of an azeotropic mixture of isopropenyl methyl ether and methanol (about 91% of isopropenyl methyl ether) and 248 mg of 75% strength phosphoric acid were combined in a pressure-resistant vessel. After flushing with nitrogen, the reaction mixture was stirred for 8 hours at 150 C. The reacted mixture was neutralized with aluminum triisopropylate and subjected to fractional distillation. 42 g of a mixture comprising 85% of 2,2-dimethoxypropane, 11.3% of acetone, 0.4% of isopropenyl methyl ether and 0.4% of methanol were obtained at atmospheric pressure. At 0.3 mbar, 6,10,14-trimethylpentadeca-5,9-dien-2-one was obtained in a yield of 78%, based on hydronerolidol used. Similar results were obtained if the preparation of the 2-methoxypropene is carried out as described in Example 1 and the 2,2-dimethoxypropane obtained as a byproduct is separated from acetone and then recycled to stage (b).

In this invention, we use vertical strataed bed or horizontal series bed as the treating unit, which are packed with weakly basic and strongly basic anion resins. This can increase the efficiency of eliminating formic acid and acetic acid from process water, save cost, and reduce the amount of wastewater.", "related_docs": [], "pct_data": [], "external_files": [{"file": "US06184423-20010206-C00001.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "description", "compounds": ["*.CC(=O)O |atomProp:0.CDX_NODE_ID.18|", "*.C=O |atomProp:0.CDX_NODE_ID.8|", "C"]}, {"file": "US06184423-20010206-C00002.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "description", "compounds": ["C"]}]}, {"publication": {"country": "US", "doc_number": "06184425", "kind": "B2", "date": "20010206"}, "application": {"country": "US", "doc_number": "09230961", "date": "19990707"}, "series_code": "09", "ipc_classes": ["C07B1720"], "cpc_classes": [], "applicants": [], "inventors": [{"first_name": "Alexander", "last_name": "Kolomeitsev", "city": "Kiew", "state": null, "country": "UA"}, {"first_name": "Sergej", "last_name": "Pasenok", "city": "Kelkheim", "state": null, "country": "DE"}], "assignees": [{"organization": "Aventis Research  Technologies GmbH  Co.", "first_name": null, "last_name": null, "city": "Frankfurt", "state": null, "country": "DE"}], "title": "Process for preparing fluorine-containing compounds", "abstract": "The present invention relates to a process for preparing fluorine-containing compounds by reacting a compound which contains fluorine-exchangeable halogen with a fluoride or a mixture of fluorides with the formula I MeF(I), in which Me is an alkaline earth metal ion, NH 4 -ion or alkali metal ion, in the presence of a compound or a mixture of compounds of the formula (II) in which A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , A 4 , A 5 , A 6 , A 7 , A 8 independently of one another are identical or different and are a straight-chain or branched alkyl or alkenyl having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl having 4 to 8 carbon atoms, an aryl having 6 to 12 carbon atoms, or an aralkyl having 7 to 12 carbon atoms, or A 1 A 2 , A 3 A 4 , A 5 A 6 , and A 7 A 8 independently of one another are identical or different and are connected to one another directly or by way of O or NA 9 to form a ring having 3 to 7 ring members, A 9 is an alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and B is a monovalent acid radical or the equivalent of a polyvalent acid radical, in the presence or absence of a solvent at a temperature from 40 to 260 C.", "related_docs": [], "pct_data": [], "external_files": [{"file": "US06184425-20010206-C00001.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "abstract", "compounds": ["C[PH](C)(C)C"]}, {"file": "US06184425-20010206-C00002.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "description", "compounds": ["C[PH](C)(C)C"]}, {"file": "US06184425-20010206-C00003.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "description", "compounds": ["[1CH3][C]1=C[C]([2CH3])=[W][CH]=[Y]1"]}, {"file": "US06184425-20010206-C00004.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "description", "compounds": ["[1CH3]C1=C([6CH3])[C]([2CH3])=[W][C]([4CH3])=C1[5CH3]"]}, {"file": "US06184425-20010206-C00005.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "description", "compounds": ["[1CH3]C1=C([6CH3])[C]([2CH3])=[W][C]([4CH3])=C1[5CH3]"]}, {"file": "US06184425-20010206-C00006.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "description", "compounds": ["[1CH3]C1=C(Cl)[C]([2CH3])=[W][C]([4CH3])=C1Cl"]}, {"file": "US06184425-20010206-C00007.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "description", "compounds": ["[1CH3][C]1=C[C]([2CH3])=[W][CH]=[Y]1", "[1CH3]C1=C([6CH3])[C]([2CH3])=[W][C]([4CH3])=C1[5CH3]", "[1CH3]C1=C(Cl)[C]([2CH3])=[W][C]([4CH3])=C1Cl"]}, {"file": "US06184425-20010206-C00008.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "description", "compounds": ["CCCCN(C)CC"]}, {"file": "US06184425-20010206-C00009.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "claims", "compounds": ["C[PH](C)(C)C"]}, {"file": "US06184425-20010206-C00010.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "claims", "compounds": ["[1CH3][C]1=C[C]([2CH3])=[W][CH]=[Y]1"]}]}, {"publication": {"country": "US", "doc_number": "06184426", "kind": "B2", "date": "20010206"}, "application": {"country": "US", "doc_number": "09381539", "date": "19990921"}, "series_code": "09", "ipc_classes": ["C07C2118"], "cpc_classes": [], "applicants": [], "inventors": [{"first_name": "Gennadii G.", "last_name": "BelenKill", "city": "Moscow", "state": null, "country": "RU"}, {"first_name": "Viacheslav A.", "last_name": "Petrov", "city": "Hockessin", "state": "DE", "country": "US"}, {"first_name": "Paul R.", "last_name": "Resnick", "city": "Cary", "state": "NC", "country": "US"}], "assignees": [{"organization": "DISA", "first_name": null, "last_name": null, "city": "Geneva", "state": null, "country": "CH"}], "title": "Addition of hydrofluorocarbons to fluoroolefins", "abstract": "A process is disclosed for forming adducts of the formula: RR 1 R 2 CCR 1 R 2 F or (FR 1 R 2 CCRR 2 CH 2 ) 2 where R is CH 3 , CH 2 F, or F(CF 2 ) n CH 2 CH 2 (where n is an integer from 1 to 10) each R 1 is H, Cl, F or CF 3 and each R 2 is H, F or CF 3 .
