The invention also relates to a cosmetic composition, in particular a make-up composition and especially an eyeshadow, comprising such a compound in a silicone binder. A subject-matter of the present invention is the use of an indigoid compound in a cosmetic composition, in particular a make-up composition, in order to confer on it antimicrobial properties and the property of lengthy hold over time and/or the property of non-migration and/or the property of freedom from transfer and/or the property of non-formation of streaks, as well as a cosmetic composition, in particular a make-up composition, comprising such an indigoid compound in combination with a silicone binder. Cosmetic compositions and in particular make-up compositions, such as free or compact powders, foundations, face powders, eyeshadows, lipsticks or nail varnishes, are composed of an appropriate vehicle and of various colouring agents intended to confer a certain colour on the said compositions before and/or after their application to the skin, mucous membranes, such as the internal part of the lower eyelids, semi-mucous membranes, such as the lips, and/or superficial body growths, such as the nails, eyelashes, eyebrows or hair. A fairly limited range of colouring agents is used today to create colours, among which colouring agents may be mentioned compounds which are generally insoluble in aqueous and organic media, such as organic lakes, inorganic pigments or pearlescent pigments. The pigments and lakes used in the make-up field are highly varied in origin and in chemical nature. Their physicochemical properties, in particular particle size, specific surface, relative density and the like, are therefore very different. These difference are reflected by variations in behaviour: their ease of use or dispersion in the medium, their stability with regard to light or to temperature, their mechanical properties, their hold over time, their colouring power and their covering power. Thus, inorganic pigments, in particular inorganic oxides, such as iron oxides, ultramarine blue, Prussian blue (ferric ferrocyanide), cobalt blue (CoOAl 2 O 3 ) or manganese violet, are very stable with regard to light and pH but give rather lifeless, dull and pale colours and/or colours with a weak colouring power, the colours being easily diluted when they are mixed with a white pigment of the titanium dioxide type, and/or colours with a weak covering power, that is to say transparent on application. It is therefore necessary to introduce a large amount of them into the cosmetic formulations in order to obtain a sufficiently saturated feature. This high percentage of inorganic particles can, nevertheless, affect the gloss of the composition, its homogeneity on application, its hold and its comfort. In addition, for manganese violet, the appearance of mould is observed at the surface of some compositions. Use may also be made, in order to obtain coloured effects, of pearlescent pigments of varied but never very intense colours, which make it possible to obtain iridescent but mostly fairly weak effects. In the field of temporary or transient hair colouring, which gives rise to a slight modification of the natural colour of the hair which lasts from one shampooing to another and which serves to beautify or correct a shade which has already been obtained, provision has already been made for colouring with conventional inorganic pigments, in order to introduce a temporary highlight to the hair, but the shades obtained by this colouring remain fairly lifeless, too uniform and not very playful. In the field of make-up, only organic lakes have until now made it possible to obtain vivid or intense colours. However, most organic lakes exhibit very poor hold with regard to light, which results in a very marked attenuation in their colour over time, are very transparent on application, that is to say have little covering power, and have a weak colouring power. They can also be unstable with regard to temperature and/or pH. Furthermore, some lakes result in an excessive degree of bleeding, that is to say that they exhibit the disadvantage of staining the support to which they are applied. Thus, this can have the consequence of staining ocular lenses, in the case of eyeliners or mascaras, or of leaving a colouring on the skin or nails after the removal of make-up, in the case of lipsticks or nail varnishes. Finally, the instability of lakes is further exacerbated when they are used in combination with photoreactive pigments, such as titanium dioxide. In point of fact, these pigments are very widely used in make-up, in particular for protection against UV radiation. Consequently, the use of organic lakes in cosmetics is fairly limited, the consequence of which is a limitation in the tints achievable. Thus, the need remains to have available colouring agents which can be used in cosmetics and which make it possible to obtain an appropriate colouring of the compositions and of the make-up film obtained, it being necessary for the said colouring agents not to migrate or to bleed onto the support on which the said compositions are deposited or not to transfer onto another support and it being necessary for the said colouring agents to have a high colouring power, a high covering power and a lengthy hold over time, without the appearance of streaks, in particular on the eyelids. Furthermore, these colouring agents must not promote the growth of mould. After much research, the Applicant Company has demonstrated that the use of a very specific family of organic compounds makes it possible to obtain such a result. Thus, a subject-matter of the invention is the use of at least one indigoid compound of formula (I): in which: R 1 and R 1 are, independently of another, saturated or unsaturated, linear, branched or cyclic alkyl radicals having 1 to 18 carbon atoms which are optionally substituted by one or more halogens and/or by one or more hydroxyl radicals and/or interrupted by one or more heteroatoms; R 2 , R 2 , R 3 , R 3 , R 4 , R 4 , R 5 and R 5 are, independently of one another, chosen from a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a hydroxyl radical or a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, alkyl, alkyloxy, acyl or acyloxy radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, in a cosmetic composition, in particular a make-up composition, in order to confer on it at least one of decreasing or eliminating the migration potential of the cosmetic composition, decreasing or eliminating the transferability of the cosmetic composition, and decreasing or eliminating the streak forming capacity of a cosmetic composition, to impart, for example, properties of lengthy hold over time and/or of non-migration and/or of freedom from transfer and/or of non-formation of streaks, in particular on the eyelids. Another subject-matter of the invention is the use of at least one indigoid compound of above formula (I) in the antimicrobial protection of cosmetic compositions, in particular make-up compositions. It is usual to introduce silicone binders into cosmetic compositions, in particular make-up compositions, in order to facilitate the application and the spreading thereof while providing comfort and softness. However, the inventor has found that the absence of non-volatile silicone oil in the silicone binder of make-up compositions has a tendency to decrease the hold over time of these compositions, in particular of eyeshadows. In the absence of non-volatile silicone oil, the eyeshadow is converted to powder and does not hold. The inventor has discovered, surprisingly, that, by combining silicone oils, in particular non-volatile silicone oils, in cosmetic compositions, in particular make-up compositions, with an indigoid colouring agent of above formula (I), she obtains cosmetic compositions having not only good spreading, comfort and softness properties but also good properties of hold over time, both as regards the colour and the make-up. Furthermore, the make-up compositions thus obtained can confer an intense, in particular blue, very saturated and very covering colour which does not fade over time. They do not migrate and do not bleed onto (do not stain) the support on which they are deposited; they do not transfer to another support and do not form streaks, in particular on the eyelids. The inventor has also discovered, surprisingly, that the use of volatile silicone oils in the silicone binder of make-up compositions comprising an indigoid colorant of formula (I) confers advantageous transfer-free properties on the latter, that is to say properties of non-migration onto certain supports with which it can enter into contact, such as an item of clothing, a solid object or the skin. Another subject-matter of the present invention is therefore a cosmetic composition, in particular a make-up composition, comprising, in a cosmetically acceptable medium comprising at least one non-volatile silicone oil, at least one indigoid compound of formula (I) as defined above. The compounds used in the cosmetic composition of the invention are, in some cases, compounds known in the literature. Some have been disclosed in particular in the publication 2,2-Binaphthyliden-1,1-dione, Farbe and Struktur 2,2-Binaphthylidene-1,1-dione, Colour and Structure by Gltner et al., Liebigs Ann. Chem., 1991, pages 1085-1089. This publication discloses in particular a preparation process which makes it possible to obtain some of these compounds in the form of crystals with a mauve colour or blue colour ranging from pale blue to dark blue. However, there is nothing in this publication which allows it to be envisaged that these compounds can be employed with success in cosmetic compositions, that is to say that they make possible the preparation of a cosmetically acceptable composition, capable of being applied to the skin, giving an intense, very saturated and very covering colour, having a lengthy hold over time, not migrating and not bleeding onto the support on which it is deposited, not transferring onto another support and not forming streaks, in particular on the eyelids. The inventor has also found that, in addition, it is possible to adjust the colour of the compounds of formula (I) by varying the nature and/or the position of the various R substituents present on the molecule. It is thus possible to obtain compounds with a colour which can vary from mauve to red, passing through blue and green. Furthermore, the compounds used in the cosmetic composition of the invention exhibit good stability with regard to temperature, pH and light. They are also readily accessible by chemical synthesis, even on an industrial scale. In the above formula (I), the heteroatoms can be oxygen, silicon, nitrogen or sulphur atoms or groups of these atoms. R 1 and/or R 1 are preferably alkyl radicals having 1 to 8 carbon atoms and in particular methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl or hexyl radicals. R 2 to R 5 and R 2 to R 5 preferably represent a hydrogen atom. In particular, mention may be made, as compounds capable of being used according to the invention, of the following compounds: 4,4-dimethyloxy-2,2-binaphthylidene-1,1-dione, 4,4-diethyloxy-2,2-binaphthylidene-1,1-dione, 4,4-diisopropyloxy-2,2-binaphthylidene-1,1-dione, and 4,4-di(n-hexyloxy)-2,2-binaphthylidene-1,1-dione. 4,4-Dimethyloxy-2,2-binaphthylidene-1,1-dione is preferred for use according to the invention as it makes it possible to obtain an intense blue colour with lengthy hold over time. The compounds of formula (I) are provided in solid form. They produce vivid and varied colours, according to the nature of the substituents. They are generally insoluble in water and have very little solubility in oils of varied nature and/or polarity. These compounds consequently exhibit the advantage of showing very little migration when they are used in compositions comprising fatty substances. The compounds according to the invention can be easily prepared by a person skilled in the art on the basis of the prior art and of his general technical knowledge. The compounds of formula (I) can be incorporated in a cosmetic composition, in particular a make-up composition, in an amount which can be between 0.5 and 30% by weight with respect to the total weight of the composition, preferably in an amount from 0.5 to 10% by weight. The said compounds can be present in the composition in the free form or in the form of a combination with substrate particles, which they coat. This is because it has been found that the compounds of formula (I) exhibit the distinguishing feature of being able to coat, at least partially, indeed even completely, substrate particles such as conventional pigments or fillers. Mention may in particular be made, among particles capable of being coated by the compounds of formula (I), of metal oxide pigments or nanopigments, such as titanium, zinc, iron, manganese, cerium and/or zirconium oxides, fillers, such as talc, mica, silica, kaolin, or nylon and polyethylene powders, or microspheres, such as hollow microspheres formed of vinylidene chloride/acrylonitrile copolymers. Talc is preferably chosen as substrate particle to be coated. The pulverulent materials thus obtained, composed of the coated substrate particles, can then themselves be used as colouring agent in cosmetic compositions. It has been found that the said pulverulent materials exhibit, under electron microscopy, a very homogeneous structure. It has also been found that the said pulverulent materials can exhibit the properties and advantages of each of the starting materials; in particular, when talc, known to contribute softness, is coated, a coated talc is obtained which retains its softness. Furthermore, the use of a very small amount of compound of formula (I) coating a conventional filler makes it possible to obtain a colouring agent which has a high colouring strength, even used in a small amount, and which contributes appropriate coverage, as well as a colour having good hold with regard to light. Use will preferably be made of the compounds of formula (I) in an amount of 0.1 to 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of substrate particles to be coated. The coated pulverulent material is preferably composed of 1 to 20% by weight of compounds of formula (I) and of 80 to 99% by weight of substrate particles. However, it is possible to envisage a coated pulverulent material composed of 50% by weight of compounds of formula (I) and of 50% by weight of substrate particles. The pulverulent material, composed of substrate particles which are at least partially coated with the compound of formula (I), will generally be prepared in the following way: in a first step, the compound of formula (I) is dissolved in an appropriate solvent, for example dimethylformamide, then the said compound is precipitate on the substrate particle to be coated, for example by adding the solution of the said compound to an aqueous dispersion or suspension of the said particle. The pulverluent material can subsequently be filtered off, washed and dried according to conventional techniques. The said compounds of formula (I) and/or the said pulverulent materials can be used in particular as colouring agents in a cosmetic composition which can be provided in the form of a product to be applied to the lips and/or keratinous materials, such as the skin and superficial body growths (nails, eyelashes, eyebrows and hair, including body hair). The said composition therefore comprises a cosmetically acceptable medium, that is to say a medium compatible with all keratinous substances, such as the skin, nails, hair, eyelashes and eyebrows, lips and any other cutaneous region of the body and face. The said medium can comprise or be provided in the form of, in particular, a suspension, a dispersion or a solution in solvent or aqueous/alcoholic medium which is optionally thickened, indeed even gelled; an oil-in-water, water-in-oil or multiple emulsion; a gel or a foam; an emulsified gel; a dispersion of vesicles, in particular lipid vesicles; a two-phase or multiphase lotion; a spray; a free, compact or cast powder; or an anhydrous paste. A person skilled in the art can choose the appropriate pharmaceutical dosage form, as well as its method of preparation, on the basis of his overall knowledge, taking into account, on the one hand, the nature of the constituents used, in particular their solubility in the vehicle, and, on the other hand, the application envisaged for the composition. The cosmetic composition according to the invention comprises a fatty phase comprising at least one non-volatile silicone oil and optionally a volatile silicone oil. The term silicone oil means any fluid silicone and in particular any silicone which is liquid at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, as well as any silicone solution. The silicone oils can be silicone surfactants or can comprise silicone surfactants, such as alkyl, alkoxy or aryl dimethicone copolyols in which the alkyl, alkoxy or aryl chain comprises 1 to 24 carbon atoms and can be a pheny radical and in particular a cetyl radical.

Of course, a person skilled in the art will take care to choose the optional additional compounds and/or their amount so that the advantageous properties of the composition according to the invention are not, or not substantially, detrimentally affected by the envisaged addition. The cosmetic compositions according to the invention can be provided in the form of a care and/or make-up product for the skin, an antisun or self-tanning product, or a hair product. They find a particular application in the make-up field, in particular as lipsticks, foundations, face powders, eyeshadows, free or compact powders, eyeliners, mascaras or nail varnishes.

This application is a division of Ser. No. 09/147,886, filed Mar. 19, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,106,908 which is a 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT/GB97/02542 filed Sep. 22, 1997. The present invention describes new compounds. In particular it describes compounds for use in liquid crystal mixtures and in liquid crystal displays (LCDs) or in applications relating to inter alia thermography utilising nematic liquid crystal or chiral nematic liquid crystal mixtures. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION LCDs, such as multiplexed Twisted Nematic TN-LCDs, Super Twisted Nematic STN-LCDs, Super Birefringent SBE-LCDs, Electrically Controlled Birefringence ECB-LCDs, or flexoelectric LCDs are currently used or being developed for computer monitors, laptop or notebook computers, portable telephones, personal digital assistants, etc. The optical, electrical and temporal performance, e.g., contrast, threshold and driving voltages, and response times, of such displays depends crucially on the ratios of the elastic constants (k 33 , k 22 , k 11 ) and the cell gap, d. Currently commercially available nematic mixtures for sophisticated high-information-content LCDs, such as STN-LCDs, incorporate trans-1,4-disubstituted-cyclohexyl derivatives with a terminal alkenyl chain (i.e., incorporating a carbon-carbon double bond) directly attached to the cyclohexane ring in order to produce the necessary elastic constant ratios for short response times, high multiplexing rates and low driving voltages. Such materials are costly and difficult to synthesise due to the requirement for a trans configuration of the 1,4-disubstituted cyclohexane ring and the necessity of synthesising the carbon-carbon double bond stepwise from this trans-1,4-disubstituted-cyclohexyl intermediate. If the carbon-carbon double bond is substituted at both carbon atoms, it must have a trans (E) configuration in order to exhibit an advantageous combination of elastic constants and to have an acceptably high nematic-isotropic transition temperature (N-I). The trans configuration is then generally produced by isomerisation of the cis (Z) form generated by the preceding Wittig reaction. These materials exhibit low or intermediate values of birefringence (n) due to the presence of the saturated cyclohexane rings. As the ratio d.n determines the optical properties of TN-LCDs and is fixed for driving the LCD in the first or second minimum, it is clear that higher values of n would allow smaller cell gaps. As the response time, t on of TN-LCDs is inversely proportional to d 2 , smaller cell gaps have a dramatic effect on t on . Low values of t on also allow the use of colour or more shades of colour due to the shorter frame times. Liquid crystals with a (E, E)-butadiene chain are known and are described in, for example W. Meier and K. Markau Z. Phys. Chem. N. F., (1961), Vol. 28, pp 190, Y. Goto and T. Ogawa, EPA 0 280 902 (1988). For all the above applications it is not usual for a single compound to exhibit all of the properties highlighted, normally mixtures of compounds are used which when mixed together induce the desired phases and required properties. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a plan view of a matrix multiplex addressed liquid crystal display; FIG. 2 is a cross-section of a display such as that of FIG. 1 in a transmission mode; and FIG. 3 is a cross-section of a display similar to FIG. 2 operating in a reflective mode. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION According to this invention materials are provided of Formula I: wherein n may be 1-5; m may be 1-5; p may be 0, 1 or 2; q may be 0, 1 or 2; pq is less than or equal to 3; A 1 , A 21 A 3 are independently chosen from 1,4-disubstituted benzene, 2,5-disubstituted pyrimidine, 2,5-disubstituted pyridine, 2,6-disubstituted naphthalene which may be laterally substituted with F, Cl, Br or CN, trans-1,4-disubstituted cyclohexane, 2,5-disubstituted dioxane, 2,5-disubstituted thiophene, 2,5-disubstituted furan, 2,5-disubstituted thiodiazole; Z 1 may be COO, OCC, OCH 2 , O; Z 2 , Z 3 are independently chosen from a direct bond, COO, OOC, C 2 H 4 , CH 2 O, OCH 2 , C 4 H 8 , C 3 H 6 O, (E)CHCHC 2 H 4 , (E)CHCHCH 2 O, CC; R 1 may be alkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl, alkenyloxy, alkanoyl, alkenoyl, F, Cl, Br, CN, OCHF 2 , OC w F 2w1 , NCS or CHC(CN) 2 , CHCF 2 , (E)CHCHCl; R 1 may contain up to 20 carbon atoms and may be branched or a straight chain and w may be 1-7. The structural and other preferences are expressed below on the basis of inter alia desirable liquid crystalline characteristics, in particular an advantageous combination of elastic constants and high birefringence in the nematic phase, a wide nematic phase, a high nematic-isotropic liquid transition temperature and ready synthesis from commercially available. Starting materials already incorporating at least one carbon-carbon double bond with the desired configuration and position. Preferably n is 1-3; Preferably when Z 1 is 0 m is 1 and when Z 1 is COO m is 0; Preferably nm is5; Preferably p is 0 or 1; Preferably q is 0 or 1; Preferably pq is 0 or 1; Preferably A 1 , A 2 . A 3 , are 1,4-disubstituted benzene or trans-1,4-disubstituted cyclohexane; Preferably Z 2 , Z 3 are direct bonds or C 2 H 4; Preferably R 1 is nitrile or alkyl or alkoxy. Overall preferred structures for formula I are those listed below: Compounds of formula I can be prepared by various routes. Typically the ethers can be prepared by the Mitsunobu reaction (Synthesis, (1981) pp 1) of a phenol with an alka-2,4-dienol in the presence of triphenyl phosphine, a dehydrating agent, such as diethyl azodicarboxylate, and a suitable solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran or N, N-dimethylformamide. Alternatively they can be synthesised by alkylation of a secondary alcohol or phenol with the tosylate of the appropriate alka-2,4-dienol in the presence of a suitable base, such as potassium tert.-butoxide, and a suitable solvent, such as tert.-butyl-methyl ether or 1,2-dimethoxyethane (J. Mater. Chem., (1994) Vol. 4, pp 1673). The esters can be prepared by esterification (Angewandte Chemie (1978) Vol. 90, pp 556) of the appropriate phenol or secondary alcohol with an alkenoic acid in the presence of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine, a dehydrating agent, such as N, N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and a suitable solvent, such as dichloromethane or N, N-dimethylformamide. Alternatively they can be synthesised by esterification of the appropriate phenol or secondary alcohol with an alkenoic acid chloride (produced, for example, from the corresponding alkenoic acid by the action of thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride) in the presence of a base, such as pyridine or triethylamine, and a suitable solvent, such as toluene or dichloromethane. In the following examples C signifies the crystalline state, N the nematic phase, I the isotropic phase, S the smectic phase and T NI the temperature range of the nematic phase. The invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the following examples.

EXAMPLE 3 Preparation of trans-, trans-4-(E, E)-hexa-2,4-dienyloxy4-pentyl-1, 1-bicyclohexane A mixture of toluene-4-sulfonic acid (E, E)-hexa-2,4-dienyl ester (1.0 g, 4.0 mmol), trans-, trans-4-hydroxy-4-pentyl-1, 1-bicyclohexane (0.37 g, 1.5 mmol), potassium tert-butoxide (0.55 g, 4.5 mrnol) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (20 cm 3 ) is stirred at room temperature overnight, filtered to remove inorganic material, diluted with water (100 cm 3 ) and then extracted into diethyl ether (325 cm 3 ). The combined organic extracts are washed with water (2200 cm 3 ), dried (MgSO 4 ), filtered and then evaporated down. The residue is purified by column chromatography on silica gel using a 9:1 hexane/ethyl acetate mixture as eluent and recrystallisation from ethanol to yield 0.25 g (51%) of the desired ether. The toluene-4-sulfonic acid (E, E)-hexa-2,4-dienyl ester requirets starting material could be prepared as follows: A solution of toluene4-sulfonyl chloride (0.75 g, 4.0 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 cm 3 ) is added slowly to a solution of (E, E)-hexa-2,4-dienol (0.40 g, 4.0 mmol), triethylamine (0.80 g, 8.0 mmol) and dichloromethane (50 cm 3 ) at 0 C. The reaction mixture is stirred at 0 C. for 6 h, washed with dilute hydrochloric acid (250 cm 3 ), water (250 cm 3 ) and dilute sodium carbonate solution (250 cm 3 ), dried (MgSO4), filtered and then evaporated down to yield 1.0 g (99%) of the desired tosylate, which is used without further purification.

T is the temperature at which the measurement was taken (in Kelvin) and T NI is the phase transition for the nematic-isotropic phase change (in Kelvin). One known device in which the materials of the current invention may be incorporated is the twisted nematic device which uses a thin layer of a nematic material between glass slides. The slides are unidirectionally rubbed and assembled with the rubbing directions orthogonal. The rubbing gives a surface alignment to the liquid crystal molecules resulting in a progressive 90 twist across the layer. When placed between polarisers, with their optical axis perpendicular or parallel to a rubbing direction the device rotates the plane of polarised light in its OFF state and transmits without rotation in the ON state. Small amounts of cholesteric material may be added to the nematic material to ensure the 90 twist is of the same sense across the whole area of the device as explained in UK patents 1,472,247 and 1,478,592. An improvement in the performance of large, complex, nematic LCDs occurred in 1982 when it was observed that the voltage dependence of the transmission of nematic LC layers with twist angles in the range 180 to 270 could become infinitely steep, see C. M. Waters, V. Brimmell and E. P. Raynes, Proc. 3rd Int. Display Res. Conf., Kobe, Japan, 1983, 396. The largertwist angles are produced by a combination of surface alignment and making the nematic mixture into a long pitch cholesteric by the addition of a small amount of a chiral twisting agent. The increasing twist angle steepens the transmission/voltage curve, until it becomes bistable for 270 twist; for a specific twist angle between 225 and 270 the curve becomes infinitely steep and well suited to multiplexing. The larger twist angles present have resulted in the name supertwisted nematic (STN) for these LCDs. Liquid Crystal Devices describing the use of STNs may be found in patent application GB 8218821 and resulting granted patents including U.S. Pat. No. 4,596,446. The display of FIGS. 1 and 2 comprises a liquid crystal cell 1 formed by a layer 2 of cholesteric liquid crystal material contained between glass walls 3 , 4 . A spacer ring 5 maintains the walls typically 6 m apart. Strip like row electrodes 6 1 to 6 m , e.g. of SnO 2 are formed on one wall 3 and similar column electrodes 7 1 to 7 n formed on the other wall 4 . With m-row electrodes and n-column electrodes this forms an mxn matrix of addressable elements. Each element is formed by the interaction of a row and column electrode. A row driver supplies voltage to each row electrode 6 . Similarly a column drive 9 supplies voltages to each column electrode 7 . Control of applied voltages is from a control logic 10 which receives power from a voltage source 11 and timing from a clock 12 . An example of the use of a material and device embodying the present invention will now be described with reference to FIG. 2 . The liquid crystal device consists of two transparent plates, 3 and 4 , for example made from glass. These plates are coated on their internal face with transparent conducting electrodes 6 and 7 . An alignment layer is introduced onto the internal faces of the cell so that a planar orientation of the molecules making up the liquid crystalline material will be approximately parallel to the glass plates 3 and 4 . This is done by coating the glass plates 3 , 4 complete with conducting electrodes so that the intersections between each column and row form an x, y matrix of addressable elements or pixels. For some types of display the alignment directions are orthogonal. Prior to the construction of the cell the alignment layers are rubbed with a roller covered in cloth (for example made from velvet) in a given direction, the rubbing directions being arranged parallel (same or opposite direction) upon construction of the cell. A spacer 5 e.g. of polymethyl methacrylate separates the glass plates 3 and 4 to a suitable distance e.g. 2 microns. Liquid crystal material 2 is introduced between glass plates 3 , 4 by filling the space in between them. This may be done by flow filling the cell using standard techniques. The spacer 5 is sealed with an adhesive in a vacuum using an existing technique. Polarisers 13 may be arranged in front of and behind the cell. Alignment layers may be introduced onto one or more of the cell walls by one or more of the standard surface treatment techniques such as rubbing, oblique evaporation or as described above by the use of polymer aligning layers. In alternative embodiments the substrates with the aligning layers on them are heated and sheared to induce alignment, alternatively the substrates with the aligning layers are thermally annealed above the glass transition temperature and below the liquid crystal to isotropic phase transition in combination with an applied field. Further embodiments may involve a combination of these aligning techniques. With some of these combinations an alignment layer may not be necessary. The device may operate in a transmissive or reflective mode. In the former, light passing through the device, e.g. from a tungsten bulb, is selectively transmitted or blocked to form the desired display. In the reflective mode a mirror, or diffuse reflector, ( 16 ) is placed behind the second polariser 13 to reflect ambient light back through the cell and two polarisers. By making the mirror partly reflecting the device may be operated both in a transmissive and reflective mode. The alignment layers have two functions, one to align contacting liquid crystal molecules in a preferred direction and the other to give a tilt to these moleculesa so called surface tiltof a few degrees typically around 4 or 5. The alignment layers may be formed by placing a few drops of the polyimide on to the cell wall and spinning the wall until a uniform thickness is obtained. The polyimide is then cured by heating to a predetermined temperature for a predetermined time followed by unidirectional rubbing with a roller coated with a nylon cloth. In an alternative embodiment a single polariser and dye material may be combined. Cholesteric or chiral nematic liquid crystals possess a twisted helical structure which is capable of responding to a temperature change through a change in the helical pitch length. Therefore as the temperature is changed then the wavelength of the light reflected from the planar cholesteric structure will change and if the reflected light covers the visible range then distinct changes in colour occur as the temperature varies. This means that there are many possible applications including the areas of thermography and thermooptics. The cholesteric mesophase differs from the nematic phase in that in the cholesteric phase the director is not constant in space but undergoes a helical distortion. The pitch length for the helix is a measure of the distance for the director to turn through 3600. By definition, a cholesteric material is chiral material. Cholesteric materials may also be used in electro-optical displays as dopants, for example in twisted nematic displays where they may be used to remove reverse twist defects, they may also be used in cholesteric to nematic dyed phase change displays where they may be used to enhance contrast by preventing waveguiding. Thermochromic applications of cholesteric liquid crystal materials usually use thin film preparations of the cholesterogen which are then viewed against a black background. These temperature sensing devices may be placed into a number of applications involving thermometry, medical thermography, non-destructive testing, radiation sensing and for decorative purposes. Examples of these may be found in D G McDonnell in Thermotropic Liquid Crystals, Critical Reports on Applied Chemistry, Vol 22, edited by G W Gray, 1987 pp 120-44; this reference also contains a general description of thermochromic cholesteric liquid crystals. Generally, commercial thermochromic applications require the formulation of mixtures which possess low melting points, short pitch lengths and smectic transitions just below the required temperature-sensing region. Preferably the mixture or material should retain a low melting point and high smectic-cholesteric transition temperatures. In general, thermochromic liquid crystal devices have a thin film of cholesterogen sandwiched between a transparent supporting substrate and a black absorbing layer. One of the fabrication methods involves producing an ink with the liquid crystal by encapsulating it in a polymer and using printing technologies to apply it to the supporting substrate. Methods of manufacturing the inks include gelatin microencapsulation, U.S. Pat. No. 3,585,318 and polymer dispersion, U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,161,039 and 3,872,050. One of the ways for preparing well-aligned thin-film structures of cholesteric liquid crystals involves laminating the liquid crystal between two embossed plastic sheets. This technique is described in UK patent 2,143,323.

synthesis reactions, particularly asymmetric hydrogenation reaction. Particularly, it provides a diphosphine compound represented by a general formula (1): wherein R 1 and R 2 each independently represents a cycloalkyl group, an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl group or a five-membered aromatic heterocycle residue. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a novel optically active diphosphine compound, a production intermediate thereof, a transition metal complex containing the diphosphine compound as a ligand and a transition metal complex catalyst useful as a catalyst of various asymmetric synthesis reactions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A large number of transition metal complexes have been reported, which can be used in asymmetric syntheses such as asymmetric hydrogenation reaction, asymmetric isomerization reaction and asymmetric hydrosilylation reaction. Particularly, a complex in which an optically active tertiary phosphine compound is coordinated to a transition metal complex such as of ruthenium, rhodium, iridium or palladium has excellent performance as a catalyst of asymmetric synthesis reactions. In order to further improve this performance, a large number of phosphine compounds having various structures have so far been developed (Chemical Review 32 Chemistry of Organic Metal Complex, pp. 237-238, 1982, edited by The Chemical Society of Japan; Asymmetric Catalysis In Organic Synthesis, edited by R. Noyori, A Wiley-Interscience Publication). Particularly, 2,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1-binaphthyl (to be referred to as BINAP hereinafter) is one of the excellent optically active phosphine compounds, and a rhodium complex (JP-A-55-61973; the term JP-A as used herein means an unexamined published Japanese patent application) and a ruthenium complex (JP-A-61-63690), which contain the BINAP as a ligand, have already been reported. Also, it has been reported that a rhodium complex (JP-A-60-199898) and a ruthenium complex (JP-A-61-63690), which contain 2,2-bis(di-(p-tolyl)phosphino)-1,1-binaphthyl (to be referred to as p-TolBINAP hereinafter) as a ligand, give good results in asymmetric hydrogenation reaction and asymmetric isomerization reaction. In addition, it has been reported in JP-A-3-255090 that a ruthenium complex of 2,2-bis(di-(3,5-dialkylphenyl)phosphino)-1,1-binaphthyl gives excellent results in asymmetric hydrogenation of -ketoesters. However, since their selectivity (chemical selectivity or enantio-selectivity) and catalytic activities are not sufficient depending on the intended reactions or reaction substrates thereof, there are cases in which these catalysts have to be improved. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the above, it therefore becomes an object of the invention to provide a novel catalyst which has excellent performance (chemical selectivity, enantio-selectivity and catalytic activity) as a catalyst of asymmetric synthesis reactions, particularly asymmetric hydrogenation reaction. The invention also contemplates providing a novel phosphine compound and further providing a novel phosphine compound which is useful as a ligand of the catalyst. With the aim of achieving these objects, the present inventors have conducted intensive studies and found as a result of the efforts that a transition metal complex of an optically active diphosphine compound represented by the following formula (6) (to be referred sometimes to as 7,8-dihydro-6H-dibenzof,h1,5dioxonine-1,13-diyl-bis(diphenylphosphine) hereinafter) is effective as a catalyst component which is concerned in the asymmetric hydrogenation reaction, and that this transition metal complex exerts excellent catalytic activity and enantio-selectivity in the asymmetric hydrogenation reaction of benzoylacetic acid esters. Thereafter, the invention has been established by further conducting evaluations. In this connection, the inventors have already developed a transition metal complex of ((5,6), (5,6)-bis-(methylenedioxy)biphenyl-2,2-diyl)bis(diphenylphosphine) (to be referred to as SEGPHOS hereinafter), but effects of the transition metal complex of diphenylphosphine compound of the invention are equal to or higher than those of the above transition metal complex. Other objects and advantages of the invention will be made apparent as the description progresses. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION One of the diphosphine compounds of the invention is a compound represented by the following general formula (1): wherein R 1 and R 2 each independently represents a cycloalkyl group, an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl group or a five-membered aromatic heterocycle residue. The cycloalkyl group is preferably cyclopentyl group, cyclohexyl group or cycloheptyl group, the five-membered aromatic heterocycle residue is preferably 2-furyl group, 3-furyl group, 2-benzofuryl group or 3-benzofuryl group, and the substituent group of the substituted phenyl group is preferably an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a di(lower alkyl)amino group or a halogen atom. The term lower alkyl as used herein means an alkyl group having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. Preferred among these compounds is a compound of a formula (7): wherein R 5 and R 6 each independently represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or an alkoxy group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and R represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkoxyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a di (lower alkyl)aminogroup. The term lower alkyl as used here in means an alkyl group having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. More preferred is a compound in which R 5 and R 6 are the same and selected from the group consisting of hydrogen atom, t-butyl group, n-butyl group, n-propyl group, isopropyl group, ethyl group and methyl group, and R 7 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen atom, t-butoxy group, isopropoxy group, ethoxy group and methoxy group. A diphosphine oxide compound represented by the following formula (2) is also a compound which belongs to the invention: wherein R 1 and R 2 are as defined in the foregoing. The compound of formula (2) is a production intermediate of the diphosphine compounds of formulae (1) and (7). A compound represented by the following formula (3) is also a compound which belongs to the invention: wherein R 3 and R 4 each independently represents a cycloalkyl group, an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl group, a five-membered aromatic heterocycle residue, an alkoxyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, phenoxy group, benzyloxy group, chlorine atom or bromine atom. In this connection, the compound represented by formula (3) can be divided into a compound in which R 3 and R 4 each independently represents a cycloalkyl group, an unsubstituted or substituted phenyl group or a five-membered aromatic heterocycle residue and a compound in which R 3 and R 4 each independently represents an alkoxyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, phenoxy group, benzyloxy group, chlorine atom or bromine atom. Of these two compounds, the former is a production intermediate of the compound of formula (2) and the latter is a production intermediate of the former compound. In addition, racemic modifications and optically active compounds of the above compounds are also the compounds which belong to the invention. Methods for the production of these compounds are described in the following. For the sake of avoiding complexity, production methods of the compounds of the invention are illustratively described using an optically active ()-form of a compound represented by the following formula (8), (()-7,8-dihydro-6H-dibenzof,h1,5dioxonine-1,13-diyl-bis(diphenylphosphine)), as an example of the compounds included in the invention. However, the invention is not limited to this example. That is, 3,3-dibromo-1,1-trimethylenedioxydibenzene (10) is prepared by allowing sodium hydride and trimethylene dibromide to react with 3-bromophenol (11). The compound (10) is allowed to react with magnesium pieces to obtain a Grignards reagent which is then allowed to react with diphenylphosphinyl chloride to obtain 1,1-trimethylenedioxydibenzene-3,3-diyl-bis(diphenylphosphine oxide) (32) (R 1 , R 2 phenyl). Next, the compound (32) is made into lithium salt by allowing it to react with lithium diisopropylamide and then the salt is allowed to react with ferric chloride as an oxidizing agent to obtain a racemic compound (7,8-dihydro-6H-dibenzof,h1,5dioxonine-1,13-diyl-bis(diphenylphosphine oxide)) (2) (R 1 , R 2 phenyl). Thereafter, the compound (2) is subjected to optical resolution using ()-dibenzoyl-L-tartaric acid (to be referred to as ()-L-DBT hereinafter) and then reduced using trichlorosilane, thereby obtaining (()-7,8-dihydro-6H-dibenzof,h1,5dioxonine-1,13-diyl-bis(diphenylphosphine)). Also, an optically active ()-form of the compound of formula (9), (()-7,8-dihydro-6H-dibenzof,h1,5dioxonine-1,13-diyl-bis(diphenylphosphine)), can be obtained from the compound (2) in the scheme 1 by subjecting it to optical resolution using ()-dibenzoyl-D-tartaric acid. In describing a preparation method of a compound which is a diphosphine compound of the above formula (1) and has a substituent group on the phenyl group, the compound of interest can be obtained by using a diphenylphosphinyl chloride derivative having a substituent group instead of diphenylphosphinyl chloride in the method of scheme 1. As an alternative method, the compound of interest can be obtained by firstly preparing a compound (31) having a substituent group on the phenyl group by the method of the following scheme 2 and then continuing the reaction using this compound (31) instead of the compound (32) of scheme 1. Preparation of the compound (31) is carried outby allowing a compound (10) to react with magnesium pieces to obtain a Grignards reagent which is subsequently allowed to react with diphenyl chlorophosphate to obtain a compound (4), and then allowing the compound (4) to react with a phenyl Grignards reagent (41) having a substituent group. Among compounds of the invention, particularly an optically active compound of the compound (2) can also be obtained from a racemic compound of the compound (2) by carrying out optical resolution of enantiomers using an optically active column. Among compounds of the invention, a compound (1), particularly an optically active compound thereof, is useful as a ligand of transition metal complexes.

NiCl 2 (L), NiBr 2 (L), NiI 2 (L) The thus obtained transition metal complexes which contain the novel optically active diphosphine compound as a ligand are useful as a catalyst of asymmetric hydrogenation reaction. When one of these complexes is used as a catalyst, the complex may be used after increasing its purity or directly without purification. Among these transition metal complexes, particularly a complex which contains ruthenium and an optically active diphosphine compound, 7,8-dihydro-6H-dibenzof,h1,5dioxonine-1,13-diyl-bis(diphenylphosphine), as a ligand gives higher enantio-selectivity than that of other ruthenium complexes such as of BINAP and p-TolBINAP in the asymmetric hydrogenation reaction of benzoylacetic acid esters. When asymmetric hydrogenation is carried out using these transition metal complexes, examples of the substrate to be subjected to the asymmetric hydrogenation reaction include carbonyl compounds and unsaturated compounds. Their illustrative examples include -ketoesters, -ketoesters and ,-unsaturated carboxylic acids. More illustratively, methyl benzoylacetate and dehydronaproxen are suitable. Next, the reaction conditions are described. Since these conditions can vary depending, for example, on the substrate and complex to be used, they cannot be described in a wholesale manner, but the reaction is generally carried out at a temperature of from 10 to 80 C. for a period of from 5 to 24 hours under a hydrogen pressure of from 10 to 60 atmospheres. Amount of the complex to be used is approximately from 1/500 to 1/5,000 (molar ratio) based on the substrate. Any reaction solvent can be used with the proviso that it is stable and does not exert influences upon the substrate and product, and its illustrative examples include lower alcohols such as methanol and ethanol, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylenechloride and chlorobenzene. Thus, as has been described in the foregoing, the novel diphosphine compound of the invention is useful particularly as a ligand of a transition metal complex. Also, the transition metal complex is useful as a catalyst of asymmetric hydrogenation reaction. This reaction catalyst is industrially markedly useful, because its use renders possible high yield production of asymmetric hydrides having high optical purity.

The compounds of the present invention exhibit excellent herbicidal effects when used as an active ingredient (ai) of a herbicide. The herbicide can sometimes be used for a wide range of applications, for example on crop lands such as paddy fields, upland farms, orchards and mulberry fields, and non-crop lands such as forests, farm roads, playgrounds, and factory sites. The application method may be suitably selected for soil treatment application and foliar application. The compounds of the present invention are capable of controlling noxious weeds including grass (gramineae) such as barnyardgrass ( Echinochloa crus - galli ), large crabgrass ( Digilaria sanguinalis ), green foxtail ( Setaria viridis ), goosegrass ( Eleusine indica L.), wild oat ( Avena fatua L.), Johnsongrass ( Sorghum halepense ), quackgrass ( Agropyron repens ), alexandergrass ( Brachiaria plantaginea ), paragrass ( Panicum purpurascen ), sprangletop ( Leptochloa chinensis ) and red sprangletop ( Leptochloa panicea ); sedges (or Cyperaceae) such as rice flatsedge ( Cyperus iria L.), purple nutsedge ( Cyperus rotundus L.), Japanese bulrush ( Scirpus Juncoides ), flatsedge ( Cyperus serotinus ), small-flower umbrellaplant ( Cyperus difformis ), slender spikerush ( Eleocharis acicularis ), and water chestnut ( Eleocharis kuroguwai ); alismataceae such as Japanese ribbon wapato ( Sagittaria pygmaea ), arrow-head ( Sagittaria trifolia ) and narrowleaf waterplantain ( Alisma canaliculatum ); pontederiaceae such as monochoria ( Monochoria vaginalis ) and monochoria species ( Monochoria korsakowii ); scrophulariaceae such as false pimpernel ( Lindernia pyxidaria ) and abunome ( Dopatriuni Junceum ); lythraceae such as toothcup ( Rotala indica ) and red stem ( Ammannia multiflora ); and broadleaves such as redroot pigweed ( Amaranthus retroflexus ), velvetleaf ( Abutilon theophrasti ), momingglory ( Ipomoea hederacea ), lambsquarters ( Chenopodium album ), prickly sida ( Sida spinosa L.), common pursiane ( Portulaca oleracea L.), slender amaranth ( Amaranthus viridis L.), sicklepod ( Cassia obtusifolia ), black nightshade ( Solanum nigrum L.), pale smartweed ( Polygonum lapathifolium L.), common chickweed ( Stellaria media L.), common cocklebur ( Xanthium strumarium L.), flexuous bittercress ( Cardamine flexuosa WITH.), henbit ( Lamium amplexicaule L.) and threeseeded copperleaf ( Acalypha australis L.). Accordingly, it is useful for controlling noxious weeds non-selectively or selectively in the cultivation of a crop plant such as corn ( Zea mays L.), soybean ( Glycine max Merr.), cotton (Gossypium spp.), wheat (Triticum spp.), rice ( Oryza sativa L.), barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.), oat ( Avena sativa L.), sorgo ( Sorghum bicolor Moench), rape ( Brassica napus L.), sunflower ( Helianthus annuus L.), sugar beet ( Beta vulgaris L.), sugar cane ( Saccharum officinarum L.), Japanese lawngrass ( Zoysia Japonica stend ), peanut ( Arachis hypogaea L.) or flax ( Linum usitatissimum L.). For use as herbicides, the active ingredients of this invention are formulated into herbicidal compositions by mixing herbicidally active amounts with inert ingredients known to the art to facilitate either the suspension, dissolution or emulsification of the active ingredient for the desired use. The type of formulation prepared recognizes the facts that formulation, crop and use pattern all can influence the activity and utility of the active ingredient in a particular use. Thus for agricultural use the present herbicidal compounds may be formulated as water dispersible granules, granules for direct application to soils, water soluble concentrates, wettable powders, dusts, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates (EC), microemulsion, suspoemulsion, invert emulsion or other types of formulations, depending on the desired weed targets, crops and application methods. These herbicidal formulations may be applied to the target area (where suppression of unwanted vegetation is the objective) as dusts, granules or water or solvent diluted sprays. These formulation may contain as little as 0.1% to as much as 97% active ingredient by weight. Dusts are admixtures of the active ingredient with finely ground materials such as clays (some examples include kaolin and montmorillonite clays), talc, granite dust or other organic or inorganic solids which act as dispersants and carriers for the active ingredient; these finely ground materials have an average particle size of less than 50 microns. A typical dust formulation will contain 1% active ingredient and 99% carrier. Wettable powders are composed of finely ground particles which disperse rapidly in water or other spray carriers. Typical carriers include kaolin clays, Fullers earth, silicas and other absorbent, wettable inorganic materials. Wettable powders can be prepared to contain from 1 to 90% active ingredient, depending on the desired use pattern and the absorbability of the carrier. Wettable powders typically contain wetting or dispersing agents to assist dispersion in water or other carriers. Water dispersible granules are granulated solids that freely disperse when mixed in water. This formulation typically consists of the active ingredient (0.1% to 95% active ingredient), a wetting agent (1-15% by weight), a dispersing agent (1 to 15% by weight) and an inert carrier (1-95% by weight). Watcr dispersible granules can be formed by mixing the ingredients intimately then adding a small amount of water on a rotating disc (said mechanism is commercially available) and collecting the agglomerated granules. Alternatively, the mixture of ingredients may be mixed with an optimal amount of liquid (water or other liquid) and passed through an extruder (said mechanism is commercially available) equipped with passages which allow for the fornation of small extruded granules. Alternatively, the mixture of ingredients can be granulated using a high speed mixer (said mechanism is commercially available) by adding a small amount of liquid and mixing at high speeds to affect agglomeration. Alternatively, the mixture of ingredients can be dispersed in water and dried by spraying the dispersion through a heated nozzle in a process known as spray drying (spray drying equipment is commercially available). After granulation the moisture content of granules is adjusted to an optimal level (generally less than 5%) and the product is sized to the desired mesh size. Granules are granulated solids that do not disperse readily in water, but instead maintain their physical structure when applied to the soil using a dry granule applicator. These granulated solids may be made of clay, vegetable material such as corn cob grits, agglomerated silicas or other agglomerated organic or inorganic materials or compounds such as calcium sulfate. The formulation typically consists of the active ingredient (1 to 20%) dispersed on or absorbed into the granule. The granule may be produced by intimately mixing the active ingredient with the granules with or without a sticking agent to facilitate adhesion of the active ingredient to the granule surface, or by dissolving the active ingredient in a solvent, spraying the dissolved active ingredient and solvent onto the granule then drying to remove the solvent. Granular formulations are useful where in-furrow or banded application is desired. Emulsifiable concentrates (EC) are homogeneous liquids composed of a solvent or mixture of solvents such as xylenes, heavy aromatic naphthas, isophorone or other proprietary commercial compositions derived from petroleum distillates, the active ingredient and an emulsifying agent or agents. For herbicidal use, the EC is added to water (or other spray carrier) and applied as a spray to the target area. The composition of an EC formulation can contain 0.1% to 95% active ingredient, 5 to 95% solvent or solvent mixture and 1 to 20% emulsifying agent or mixture of emulsifying agents. Suspension concentrate (also known as flowable) formulations are liquid formulations consisting of a finely ground suspension of the active ingredient in a carrier, typically water or a non-aqueous carrier such as an oil. Suspension concentrates typically contain the active ingredient (5 to 50% by weight), carrier, wetting agent, dispersing agent, anti-freeze, viscosity modifiers and pH modifiers. For application, suspension concentrates are typically diluted with water and sprayed on the target area. Solution concentrates are solutions of the active ingredient (1 to 70%) in solvents which have sufficient solvency to dissolve the desired amount of active ingredient. Because they are simple solutions without other inert ingredients such as wetting agents, additional additives are usually added to the spray tank mix before spraying to facilitate proper application. Microemulsions are solutions consisting of the active ingredient (1 to 30%) dissolved in a surfactant or emulsifier, without any additional solvents. There are no additional solvents added to this formulation. Microemulsions are particularly useful when a low odor formulation is required such as in residential turfgrass applications. Suspoemulsions are combinations of two active ingredients. One active ingredient is made as a suspension concentrate (1-50% active ingredient) and the second active is made as a emulsifiable concentrate (0.1 to 20%). A reason for making this kind of formulation is the inability to make an EC formulation of the first ingredient due to poor solubility in organic solvents. The suspoemulsion formulation allows for the combination of the two active ingredients to be packaged in one container, thereby minimizing packaging waste and giving greater convenience to the product user. The herbicidal compounds of this invention may be formulated or applied with insecticides, fungicides, acaricides, nematicides, fertilizers, plant growth regulators or other agricultural chemicals. Certain tank mix additives, such as spreader stickers, penetration aids, wetting agents, surfactants, emulsifiers, humectants and UV protectants may be added in amounts of 0.01% to 5% to enhance the biological activity, stability, wetting, spreading on foliage or uptake of the active ingredients on the target area or to improve the suspensibility, dispersion, redispersion, emulsifiability, UV stability or other physical or physico-chemical property of the active ingredient in the spray tank, spray system or target area.

Test Example A standard greenhouse herbicide activity screening system was used to evaluate the herbicidal efficacy and crop safety of these test compounds. Six broadleaf weed species including redroot pigweed ( Amaranthus retroflexus , AMARE), velvetleaf ( Abutilon theophrasti , ABUTH), sicklepod ( Cassia obtusifolia , CASOB), ivyleaf morningglory ( Ipomoea hederacea , IPOHE), lambsquarters ( Chenopodium album , CHEAL) and common ragweed ( Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., AMBEL) were used as test species. Four grass weed species including green foxtail ( Setaria viridis , SETVI), barnyardgrass ( Echinociloa crusgalli , ECHCG), Johnsongrass ( Sorghum halepense , SORHA), and large crabgrass ( Digitaria sanguinalis , DIGSA) were also used. In addition, three crop species, field corn ( Zea mays L., var. Dekalb 535, CORN), soybean ( Glycine max L., var. Pella 86, SOY), and upland rice (Oryza sp., var.Tebonnet, RICE) were included. Test Example 1. Pre-emerge test All plants were grown in 10 cm square plastic pots which were filled with a sandy loam soil mix. For pre-emerge tests, seeds were planted one day prior to application of the test compounds. Immediately after application, test units of the pre-emerge applications were watered at the soil surface to incorporate the test materials. Subsequently, these test units were bottom-watered. All test compounds were dissolved in acetone and applied to the test units in a volume of 187 l/ha. Test materials were applied at rates ranging from 125 g ai/ha to 1000 g ai/ha using a track sprayer equipped with a TJ8001E even flow flat fan spray nozzle. Plants were arranged on a shelf so that the top of the canopy (post-emerge) or top of the soil surface (pre-emerge) was 40-45 cm below the nozzle. Pressurized air was used to force the test solution through the nozzle as it was mechanically advanced (via electrically driven chain drive) over the top of all test plants/pots. This application simulates a typical commercial field herbicide application. Test Example 2. Post-emerge test In the post-emerge test, a commercial non-ionic surfactant was also included (0.25% v/v) to enhance wetting of the leaf surfaces of target plants at rates ranging from 63 g ai/ha to 1000 g ai/ha. For post-emerge tests, seeds were planted 8-21 days prior to the test to allow emergence and good foliage development prior to application of the test substances. At the time of the post-emerge application, plants of all species were usually at the 2-3 leaf stage of development. Post-emerge test units were always bottom-watered. At 14 days after application of the test materials, phytotoxicity ratings were recorded. A rating scale of 0-100 was used as previously described in Research Methods in Weed Science , 2nd edition, B. Truelove, Ed., Southern Weed Science Society, Auburn University, Auburn, 1977. Briefly, 0 corresponds to no damage and 100 corresponds to complete death of all plants in the test unit. This scale was used both to determine efficacy against weed species and damage to crop species. Herbicide activity data for various compounds of this invention, which are shown by compound number in Tables 1-9, are shown in Tables 13 and 14. The data demonstrate significant differences between compounds for both efficacy against weeds and selectivity for crop species. For selected compounds, excellent activity against a majority of the weed species was observed with minimal damage to at least one of the crop species.

other agricultural chemicals, fertilizers or phytotoxicity-reducing agents. In such a case, they may exhibit even better effects or activities. As other agricultural chemicals, herbicides, fungicides, antibiotics, plant hormones, insecticides, or acaricides may, for example, be mentioned. Especially with herbicidal compositions having the compounds of the present invention used in admixture with or in combination with one or more active ingredients of other herbicides, it is possible to improve the herbicidal activities, the range of application time(s) and the range of applicable weed types. Further, the compounds of the present invention and an active ingredient of another herbicide may be separately formulated so they may be mixed for use at the time of application, or both may be formulated together. The present invention covers such herbicidal compositions. The blend ratio of the compounds of the present invention with the active ingredient of other herbicides can not generally be defined, since it varies depending on the time and method of application, weather conditions, soil type and type of formulation. However one active ingredient of other herbicide may be incorporated usually in an amount of 0.01 to 100 parts by weight, per one part by weight of the compounds of the present invention. Further, the total dose of all of the active ingredients is usually from 1 to 10000 g/ha, preferably from 5 to 500 g/ha. The present invention covers such herbicidal compositions. As the active ingredients of other herbicides, the following (common name) may be mentioned. Herbicidal compositions having the compounds of the present invention used in combination with other herbicides, may occasionally exhibit a synergistic effect. 1.

Those which are believed to exhibit herbicidal effects by interfering with the normal metabolism of inorganic nitrogen assimilation such as glufosinate, glufosinate-ammonium, phosphinothricin or bialophos. 9. Those which are believed to exhibit herbicidal effects by inhibiting cell division of plant cells, including a dinitroaniline type such as trifluralin, oryzalin, nitralin, pendamethalin, ethafluralin, benefin and prodiamine, an amide type such as bensulide, napronamide, and pronamide, a carbamate type such as propham, chlorpropham, barban, and asulam, an organophosphorous type such as amiprofos-methyl or butamifos and others such as DCPA and dithiopyr. 10. Those which are believed to exhibit herbicidal effects by inhibiting protein sysnthesis of plant cells, including a acetanilide type such as alachlor, metolachor, propachlor, acetochlor (including combinations with herbicide safeners) and dimethenamid. 11. Those in which the mode of action causing the herbicidal effects are not well understood including the dithiocarbamates such as thiobencarb, EPTC, diallate, triallate, molinate, pebulate, cycloate, butylate, vernolate or prosulfocarb and miscellaneous herbicides such as MSMA, DSMA, endothall, ethofumesate, sodium chlorate, pelargonic acid and fosamine.

The invention relates to compounds of the formula I cyclo-(Arg-X-Asp-R 1 )I in which X is Gly, Ala or NHNHCO, where the amino acids mentioned can also be derivatized, and the amino acid residues are linked to one another in a peptide-like manner via the -amino and -carboxyl groups, R 1 is a radical of the formula II R 2 ,R 3 ,R 4 in each case independently of one another are H, A, Ar, R 5 -Ar, Het or R 5 -Het, A is alkyl having 1-6 C atoms, Ar is phenyl which is unsubstituted or mono-, di- or trisubstituted by R 7 ,R 8 or R 9 , or unsubstituted naphthyl, R 5 is alkylene having 1-6 C atoms, R 6 ,R 6 in each case independently of one another are H, A, benzyl or phenyl, R 7 ,R 8 ,R 9 in each case independently of one another are R 6 , OR 6 , Hal, NO 2 , NR 6 R 6 , NHCOR 6 , CN, NHSO 2 R 6 , COOR 6 or COR 6 , Hal is F, Cl, Br or I and Het is a mono- or binuclear heterocycle having 1 to 4 N, O, and/or S atoms, which can be unsubstituted or mono-, di- or trisubstituted by Hal, A, NR 6 R 6 , CN or NO 2 , where, providing the residues are optically active amino acids and amino acid derivatives, both the D- and the L-forms are included, and their salts. Similar cyclic peptide compounds are disclosed, for example, in DE 43 10 643 or EP 0 683 173. The invention was based on the object of discovering novel compounds having valuable properties, in particular those which can be used for the production of medicaments. It has been found that the compounds of the formula I and their salts have very valuable pharmacological properties together with good tolerability. They act especially as integrin inhibitors, inhibiting, in particular, the interactions of the v -, 3 - or 5 -integrin receptors with ligands, such as, for example, the binding of fibrinogen to the 3 -integrin receptor. The compounds exhibit particular efficacy in the case of the integrins v 1 , v 3 , v 5 , IIb 3 and also v 6 and v 8 . This action can be detected, for example, by the method which is described by J. W. Smith et al. in J. Biol. Chem. 265, 12267-12271 (1990). The dependency of the origin of angiogenesis on the interaction between vascular integrins and extracellular matrix proteins is described by P. C. Brooks, R. A. Clark and D. A. Cheresh in Science 264, 569-71 (1994). The possibility of the inhibition of this interaction and thus for the initiation of apoptosis (programmed cell death) of angiogenic vascular cells by a cyclic peptide is described by P. C. Brooks, A. M. Montgomery, M. Rosenfeld, R. A. Reisfeld, T.-Hu, G. Klier and D. A. Cheresh in Cell 79, 1157-64 (1994). Compounds of the formula I which block the interaction of integrin receptors and ligands, such as, for example, of fibrinogen on the fibrinogen receptor (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa), prevent, as GPIIb/IIIa antagonists, the spread of tumour cells by metastasis. This is confirmed by the following observations: The spread of tumour cells from a local tumour into the vascular system takes place through the formation of microaggregates (microthrombi) by interaction of the tumour cells with blood platelets. The tumour cells are shielded by protection in the microaggregate and are not recognized by the cells of the immune system. The microaggregates can fix to vascular walls, whereby a further penetration of tumour cells into the tissue is facilitated. Since the formation of microthrombi is mediated by fibrinogen binding to the fibrinogen receptors on activated blood platelets, the GPIIa/IIIb antagonists can be regarded as effective metastasis inhibitors. The compounds of the formula I can be employed as pharmaceutical active compounds in human and veterinary medicine, in particular for the prophylaxis and/or therapy of thrombosis, myocardial infarct, arteriosclerosis, inflammations, apoplexy, angina pectoris, oncoses, osteolytic diseases such as osteoporosis, pathologically angiogenic diseases such as, for example, inflammations, ophthalmological diseases, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, myopia, ocular histoplasmosis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, rubeotic glaucoma, ulcerative colitis, Crohns disease, atherosclerosis, psoriasis, restenosis after angioplasty, viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection, in acute kidney failure and in wound healing for assisting the healing process. The compounds of the formula I can be employed as substances having antimicrobial activity in operations where biomaterials, implants, catheters or heart pacemakers are used. They have an antiseptic effect here. The efficacy of the antimicrobial activity can be demonstrated by the method described by P.Valentin-Weigund et al., in Infection and Immunity, 2851-2855 (1988). Since the compounds of the formula I are inhibitors of fibrinogen binding and thus ligands of the fibrinogen receptors on blood platelets, they can be used as diagnostics for the detection and localization of thrombi in the vascular system in vivo, provided they are substituted, for example, by a radioactive or Uv-detectable radical. As inhibitors of fibrinogen binding, the compounds of the formula I can also be used as efficacious medicaments for the study of the metabolism of blood platelets in different activation stages or of intracellular signal mechanisms of the fibrinogen receptor. The detectable unit of a label to be incorporated, e.g. an isotope labelling by 3 H, allows the mechanisms mentioned to be investigated, after binding to the receptor. The abbreviations of amino acid residues mentioned above and below stand for the radicals of the following amino acids: Ala Alanine AMP Aminomethylphenyl residue Asn Asparagine Asp Aspartic acid Arg Arginine Cys Cysteine Gln Glutamine Glu Glutamic acid Gly Glycine His Histidine homo-Phe homo-Phenylalanine Ile Isoleucine Leu Leucine Lys Lysine Met Methionine Nle Narleucine Orn Ornithine Phe Phenylalanine Phg Phenylglycine 4-Hal-Phe 4-Halaphenylalanine Pro Proline Ser Serine Thr Threonine Trp Tryptophan Tyr Tyrosine Val Valine.

Some preferred groups of compounds can be expressed by the following subformulae Ia to Ie, which correspond to the formula I and in which the radicals not described in greater detail have the meaning indicated in formula I, but in which in a) R 2 ,R 3 in each case independently of one another are H or A, R 4 is H, A, Ar, R 5 -Ar, Het or R 5 -Het and R 6 ,R 6 are H or A; in b) R 2 ,R 3 in each case independently of one another are H or A, R 4 is H, A, Ar, R 5 -Ar, Het or R 5 -Het R 6 ,R 6 are H or A and Ar is phenyl which is unsubstituted or monosubstituted by R 7 ; in c) R 2 ,R 3 in each case independently of one another are H or A, R 4 is H, A, Ar, R 5 -Ar, Het or R 5 -Het, R 6 ,R 6 are H or A, Ar is phenyl which is unsubstituted or monosubstituted by R 7 and Het is a mononuclear aromatic or saturated heterocycle having 1 or 2 N or O atoms, which can be unsubstituted or mono- or disubstituted by Hal, A, NR 6 R 6 , CN or NO 2 ; in d) R 2 ,R 3 in each case independently of one another are H or A, R 4 is H, A, Ar or R 5 -Ar, R 6 ,R 6 are H or A and Ar is phenyl which is unsubstituted or monosubstituted by R 7 ; in e) X is Gly or Ala R 2 ,R 3 in each case independently of one another are H or A, R 4 is H, A, Ar or R 5 -Ar, R 6 ,R 6 are H or A and Ar is phenyl which is unsubstituted or monosubstituted by R 7 . The compounds of the formula I and also the starting substances for their preparation are otherwise prepared by methods known per se, such as are described in the literature (e.g. in the standard works such as Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie Methods of Organic Chemistry, Georg-Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart), namely under reaction conditions which are known and suitable for the reactions mentioned. Use can also be made in this case of variants which are known per se, but not mentioned here in greater detail. The starting substances, if desired, can also be formed in situ, such that they are not isolated from the reaction mixture, but immediately reacted further to give the compounds of the formula I. Compounds of the formula I can preferably be obtained by cyclization of compounds of the formula III under the conditions of a peptide synthesis. The reaction is expediently carried out here according to customary methods of peptide synthesis, as are described, for example, in Houben-Weyl, 1.c., Volume 15/II, pages 1 to 806 (1974). The reaction preferably takes place in the presence of a dehydrating agent, e.g. of a carbodiimide such as DCCI or EDCI, and further, for example, propanephosphonic anhydride (cf. Angew. Chem. 92, 129 (1980)), diphenylphosphoryl azide or 2-ethoxy-N-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline, in an inert solvent, e.g. a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, an amide such as DMF or dimethylacetamide, a nitrile such as acetonitrile, in dimethyl sulfoxide or in the presence of mixtures of these solvents, at temperatures between approximately 10 and 40, preferably between 0 and 30. In order to promote intramolecular cyclization before intermolecular peptide bonding, it is expedient to work in dilute solutions. The reaction time, depending on the conditions used, is between a few minutes and 14 days. Instead of compounds of the formula III, derivatives of compounds of the formula III, preferably a preactivated carboxylic acid, or a carboxylic acid halide, a symmetrical or mixed anhydride or an active ester can also be employed. Radicals of this type for the activation of the carboxyl group in typical acylation reactions are described in the literature (e.g. in the standard works such as Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie Methods of Organic Chemistry, Georg-Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart). Activated esters are expediently formed in situ, e.g. by addition of HOBt or N-hydroxysuccinimide. As a rule, the reaction is carried out in an inert solvent, using a carboxylic acid halide in the presence of an acid-binding agent, preferably of an organic base such as triethylamine, dimethylaniline, pyridine or quinoline. The addition of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate or of another salt of a weak acid of the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, preferably of potassium, sodium, calcium or caesium, may also be favourable. As a rule, the starting substances of the formula III are new. They can be prepared by known methods of peptide synthesis. The compounds of the formula I can further be obtained by liberating them from their functional derivatives by solvolysis, in particular hydrolysis, or by hydrogenolysis. Preferred starting substances for solvolysis or hydrogenolysis are those which, instead of one or more free amino and/or hydroxyl groups, contain corresponding protective amino and/or hydroxyl groups, preferably those which, instead of an H atom which is bonded to an N atom, carry an amino protective group, e.g. those which correspond to the formula I, but instead of an NH 2 group contain an NHR group (in which R is an amino protective group, e.g. BOC or CBZ). Starting substances are further preferred which, instead of the H atom of a hydroxyl group, carry a hydroxyl protective group, e.g. those which correspond to the formula I, but instead of a hydroxyphenyl group contain an RO-phenyl group (in which R is a hydroxyl protective group). A number ofidentical or differentprotected amino and/or hydroxyl groups can also be present in the molecule of the starting substance. If the protective groups present differ from one another, they can be selectively removed in many cases. The expression amino protective group is generally known and relates to groups which are suitable for protecting (for blocking) an amino group from chemical reactions, but which are easily removable after the desired chemical reaction has been carried out at other positions in the molecule. Typical groups of this type are, in particular, unsubstituted or substituted acyl, aryl, aralkoxymethyl or aralkyl groups. Since the amino protective groups are removed after the desired reaction (or reaction sequence), their nature and size is otherwise not critical; however, those having 1-20, in particular 1-8 C atoms, are preferred. The expression acyl group is to be interpreted in the widest sense in connection with the present process. It includes acyl groups derived from aliphatic, araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic carboxylic acids or sulfonic acids, such as, in particular, alkoxycarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl and especially aralkoxycarbonyl groups. Examples of acyl groups of this type are alkanoyl such as acetyl, propionyl, butyryl; aralkanoyl such as phenylacetyl; aroyl such as benzoyl or toluyl; aryloxyalkanoyl such as POA; alkoxycarbonyl such as methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, BOC, 2-iodoethoxy-carbonyl; aralkyloxycarbonyl such as CBZ (carbobenzoxy), 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, FMOC; arylsulfonyl such as Mtr. Preferred amino protective groups are BOC and Mtr, and further CBZ, Fmoc, benzyl and acetyl. The expression hydroxyl protective group is likewise generally known and relates to groups which are suitable for protecting a hydroxyl group from chemical reactions, but which are easily removable after the desired chemical reaction has been carried out at other positions in the molecule. Typical of such groups are the abovementioned unsubstituted or substituted aryl, aralkyl or acyl groups, and further also alkyl groups. The nature and size of the hydroxyl protected groups is not critical, since they are removed again after the desired chemical reaction or reaction sequence; groups having 1-20, in particular 1-10 C atoms, are preferred. Examples of hydroxyl protective groups are, inter alia, benzyl, p-nitrobenzoyl, p-toluenesulfonyl, tert-butyl and acetyl, benzyl and tert-butyl being particularly preferred. The COOH groups in aspartic acid and glutamic acid are preferably protected in the form of their tert-butyl esters (e.g. Asp(OBut)). The liberation of the compounds of the formula I from their functional derivatives is carried outdepending on the protective group usedfor example, with strong acids, expediently with TFA or perchloric acid, but also with other strong inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, strong organic carboxylic acids such as trichloroacetic acid or sulfonic acids such as benzene- or p-toluenesulfonic acid. The presence of an additional inert solvent is possible, but not always necessary. Suitable inert solvents are preferably organic solvents, for example carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, amides such as DMF, halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, and further also alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, and also water. Mixtures of the abovementioned solvents are also possible. TFA is preferably used in an excess without addition of a further solvent, perchloric acid in the form of a mixture of acetic acid and 70% strength perchloric acid in the ratio 9:1. The reaction temperatures for the cleavage are expediently between approximately lacuna and approximately 50; the reaction is preferably carried out between 15 and 30 (room temperature). The groups BOC, OBut and Mtr can be removed, for example, preferably using TFA in dichloromethane or using approximately 3 to 5N HCl in dioxane at 15-30; the FMOC group using an approximately 5 to 50% solution of dimethylamine, diethylamine or piperidine in DMF at 15-30. The trityl group is employed for the protection of the amino acids histidine, asparagine, glutamine and cysteine. The cleavage is carried out, depending on the desired final product, using TFA/10% thiophenol, the trityl group being removed from all amino acids mentioned; when using TFA/anisole or TFA/thioanisole, the trityl group is removed only His, Asn and Gln, while it remains on the Cys side chain. Hydrogenolytically removable protective groups (e.g. CBZ or benzyl) can be removed, for example, by treating with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst (e.g. of a noble metal catalyst such as palladium, expediently on a support such as carbon). Suitable solvents here are those indicated above, in particular, for example, alcohols such as methanol or ethanol or amides such as DMF. As a rule, the hydrogenolysis is carried out at temperatures between approximately 0 and 100 and pressures between approximately 1 and 200 bar, preferably at 20-30 C. and 1-10 bar. Hydrogenolysis of the CBZ group takes place, for example, readily on 5 to 10% Pd/C in methanol or with ammonium formate (instead of hydrogen) on Pd/C in methanol/DMF at 20-30. A base of the formula I can be converted into the associated acid addition salt using an acid, for example by reaction of equivalent amounts of the base and of the acid in an inert solvent such as ethanol and subsequent evaporation. For this reaction, suitable acids are in particular those which yield physiologically acceptable salts. Thus inorganic acids can be used, e.g. sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrohalic acids such as hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acids, such as orthophosphoric acid, sulfamic acid, and further organic acids, in particular aliphatic, alicyclic, araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic mono- or polybasic carboxylic, sulfonic or sulfuric acids, e.g. formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, pivalic acid, diethylacetic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, pimelic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, gluconic acid, ascorbic acid, nicotinic acid, isonicotinic acid, methane- or ethanesulfonic acid, ethanedisulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenemono- and disulfonic acids, and laurylsulfuric acid. Salts with physiologically unacceptable acids, e.g. picrates, can be used for the isolation and/or purification of the compounds of the formula I. On the other hand, an acid of the formula I can be converted into one of its physiologically acceptable metal or ammonium salts by reaction with a base. Possible salts here are in particular the sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and ammonium salts, and also substituted ammonium salts, e.g. the dimethyl, diethyl or diisopropylammonium salts, monoethanol-, diethanol- or diisopropylammonium salts, cyclohexyl- or dicyclohexylammonium salts, dibenzylethylenediammonium salts, and furthermore, for example, salts with arginine or lysine. The invention further relates to the use of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically acceptable salts for the production of pharmaceutical preparations, in particular by a non-chemical route. In this context, they can be brought into a suitable dosage form together with at least one solid, liquid and/or semisolid excipient or auxiliary and, if appropriate, in combination with one or more further active compounds. The invention further relates to pharmaceutical preparations comprising at least one compound of the formula I and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts. These preparations can be used as medicaments in human or veterinary medicine. Suitable excipients are organic or inorganic substances which are suitable for enteral (e.g. oral) or parenteral administration, topical application or for administration in the form of an inhalation spray and do not react with the novel compounds, for example water, vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols, alkylene glycols, polyethylene glycols, glycerol triacetate, gelatine, carbohydrates such as lactose or starch, magnesium stearate, talc and petroleum jelly. In particular, tablets, pills, coated tablets, capsules, powders, granules, syrups, juices or drops are used for oral administration, suppositories are used for rectal administration, solutions, preferably oily or aqueous solutions, and also suspensions, emulsions or implants are used for parenteral administration, and ointments, creams or powders are used for topical application. The novel compounds can also be lyophilized and the lyophilizates obtained used, for example, for the production of injection preparations. The preparations indicated can be sterilized and/or can contain auxiliaries such as lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers and/or wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for affecting the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, colorants, flavourings and/or one or more other active compounds, e.g. one or more vitamins. For administration as an inhalation spray, sprays can be used which contain the active compound either dissolved or suspended in a propellant gas or propellant gas mixture (e.g. CO 2 or chlorofluorohydrocarbons). The active compound is expediently used here in micronized form, it being possible for one or more additional physiologically tolerable solvents to be present, e.g. ethanol. Inhalation solutions can be administered with the aid of customary inhalers. The compounds of the formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts can be used as integrin inhibitors in the control of illnesses, in particular of thromboses, cardiac infarct, coronary heart disorders, arteriosclerosis, tumours, osteoporosis, inflammations and infections. The compounds of the formula I according to claim 1 and/or their physiologically acceptable salts are also used in pathological processes which are supported or propagated by angiogenesis, in particular in tumours or rheumatoid arthritis. In this case, the substances according to the invention can as a rule be administered in analogy to other known, commercially available peptides, but in particular in analogy to the compounds described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,472,305, preferably in doses of between approximately 0.05 and 500 mg, in particular between 0.5 and 100 mg per dose unit. The daily dose is preferably between approximately 0.01 and 2 mg/kg of body weight. The specific dose for each patient depends, however, on all sorts of factors, for example on the efficacy of the specific compound employed, on the age, body weight, general state of health, sex, on the diet, on the time and route of administration, on the excretion rate, pharmaceutical combination and severity of the particular disorder to which the therapy relates. Parenteral administration is preferred. The compounds of the formula I can further be used as integrin ligands for the preparation of columns for affinity chromatography for the preparation of integrins in pure form. The ligand, i.e. a compound of the formula I, is in this case covalently coupled to a polymeric support via an anchor function, e.g. the carboxyl group of Asp. Suitable polymeric support materials are the polymeric solid phases known per se in peptide chemistry, preferably having hydrophilic properties, for example crosslinked polysugars such as cellulose, Sepharose or Sephadex, acrylamides, polymers based on polyethylene glycol or Tentakel polymers. The preparation of the materials for affinity chromatography for integrin purification is carried out under conditions such as are customary and known per se for the condensation of amino acids. The compounds of the formula I contain one or more chiral centres and can therefore be present in racemic or in optically active form. Racemates obtained can be separated into the enantiomers mechanically or chemically by methods known per se. Preferably, diastereomers are formed from the racemic mixture by reaction with an optically active resolving agent. Suitable resolving agents are, for example, optically active acids, such as the D- and L-forms of tartaric acid, diacetyltartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, lactic acid or the various optically active camphorsulfonic acids such as -camphorsulfonic acid. An enantiomer separation with the aid of a column packed with an optically active resolving agent (e.g. dinitrobenzyolphenylglycine) is also advantageous; suitable eluents are, for example, a mixture of hexane/isopropanol/acetonitrile, e.g. in the volume ratio 82:15:3. Of course, it is also possible to obtain optically active compounds of the formula I by the methods described above by using starting substances which are already optically active. Above and below, all temperatures are indicated in C. In the following examples, customary working up means: if necessary, water is added, the mixture is adjusted, if necessary, to a pH of between 2 and 10 depending on the constitution of the final product, and extracted with ethyl acetate or dichloromethane, the organic phase is separated off, dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated, and the residue is purified by chromatography on silica gel and/or by crystallization. R f values on silica gel; eluents: ethyl acetate/methanol 9:1. RTretention time (minutes) on HPLC in the following systems: A Column: LichrosorbRP 18 (2504; 5 m); Eluent A: 0.1% TFA in water Eluent B: 0.1% TFA in 90% acetonitrile, 10% water Flow rate: 1 ml/min Gradient: 20-95% B/50 min Detection at 215 nm. The diastereomers are preferably separated under the conditions indicated. Mass spectrometry (MS): FAB (Fast Atom Bombardment) (MH) EXAMPLE 1 Equimolar amounts of methyl (R,S)-2-bromo-2-phenylacetate and 3-hydroxymethylaniline are reacted to give methyl N-(3-hydroxymethylphenyl)aminophenyl-acetate. By reaction with thionyl chloride to give methyl N-(3-chloromethylphenyl)aminophenylacetate and subsequent reaction with sodium azide, methyl N-(3-azidomethylphenyl)aminophenylacetate (A) is obtained. A solution of 9.2 g of A in 350 ml of ethyl acetate is hydrogenated for 35 minutes in the presence of 1 g of Pd/C (5%). After removing the catalyst and the solvent, methyl N-(3-aminomethylphenyl)aminophenyl-acetate) (B) is obtained as an oil, RT 19.5; FAB 271. By reaction of B with benzyl anhydride, methyl N-(3-benzyloxycarbonylaminomethyl-phenyl)aminophenylacetate is obtained, which is then hydrolyzed in KOH/methanol to give N-(3-benzyloxycarbonylaminomethylphenylacetic acid (N-(Z-3-AMP)-aminophenylacetic acid). By reaction with 1 equivalent in each case of H-Arg(Mtr)-Gly-OtBu, DCCI and HOBt in dichloromethane, Z-3-AMP-Phg-Arg(Mtr)-Gly-OtBu is obtained. The removal of the Z-protective group is carried out as described above by catalytic hydrogenation; subsequent peptide coupling with BOC-Asp(OBzl)-3-AMP-Phg-Arg(Mtr)-Gly-OtBu. After removal of the BOC protective group and of the tert-butyl ester in HCl/dioxane, H-Asp(OBzl)-3-AMP-Phg-Arg(Mtr)-Gly-OH- is obtained, and, after cyclization, the compound Cyclo-(Asp(OBzl)-3-AMP-Phg-Arg(Mtr)-Gly). After hydrolysis of the ester, removal of the Mtr protective group in 98% trifluoroacetic acid, purification and separation by means of HPLC, cyclo-(Asp-3-AMP-L-Phg-Arg-Gly) and cyclo-(Asp-3-AMP-D-Phg-Arg-Gly) are obtained. The two compounds are characterized as follows: RT 15.5 FAB 567 and RT 12.5 FAB 567, the assignment for the two diastereomers being open to question. Analogously, the following are obtained starting from 2-bromo-3-methylbutyric acid cyclo-(Asp-3-AMP-L-Val-Arg-Gly) (SEQ ID NO: 1) and cyclo-(Asp-3-AMP-D-Val-Arg-Gly), from 2-bromoacetic acid cyclo-(Asp-3-AMP-Gly-Arg-Gly) (SEQ ID NO: 3) and from 2-bromo-3-phenylpropionic acid cyclo-(Asp-3-AMP-L-Phe-Arg-Gly) (SEQ ID NO: 2) and cyclo-(Asp-3-AMP-D-Phe-Arg-Gly).

Preferably, the composition is used as an anti-HIV agent or a drug for treating AIDS. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to 4-C-ethynyl nucleosides and the use thereof for producing pharmaceuticals, and more particularly to the use thereof in treating acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). 2. Background Art The clinical setting for AIDS has been dramatically changed by a multi-drug therapy called highly active antiretroviral therapy, or HAART. In this therapy, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) such as zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), stavudine (d4T), and lamivudine (3TC) and protease inhibitors (PIs) are employed in combination. Application of this therapy has drastically decreased the number of deaths due to AIDS in many countries (Textbook of AIDS Medicine, p751 (Williams Wilkins, Baltimore, 1999)). In spite of the decrease in AIDS-related deaths due to HAART, there has emerged a multi-drug resistant HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus-1) mutant exhibiting cross-resistance to various drugs. For example, in the early 1990s patients infected with an HIV exhibiting resistance to both AZT and 3TC were very rare, whereas the percentage of AIDS patients infected with such an HIV was as high as 42% in 1995-1996 ( AIDS, 11, 1184(1997)). It has been reported that such multi-drug resistant viruses cause 30-60% of drug failure cases in which the viremia level drops once below the detection limit and then revives to exhibit lasting viremia ( AIDS, 12, 1631(1998)). Thus, the present status of AIDS treatment is serious. Conventionally, in terms of a compound which exhibits potent antiviral activities against multi-drug resistant viruses, there have been known only a few protease inhibitors; e.g., JE-2147, which have potent antiviral activity against a multi-PI resistant HIV-1 ( Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 96,8675(1999)). However, no nucleoside derivative having such potent activities has been reported yet. Ohrui, one of the inventors of the present invention, has synthesized 1-(4-C-ethynyl--D-ribopentofuranosyl)thymine, 4-C-ethynyluridine, and 4-C-ethynylcytidine and assayed biological activities such as antiviral and antitumor activities thereof. However, no such biological activities have been observed for these compounds ( Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 63(4), 736-742, 1999). Furthermore, Matsuda et al. have synthesized 4-C-ethynylthymidine and assayed the anti-HIV activity thereof. The anti-HIV activity of the compound is weaker than that of AZT. However, the assay described by Matsuda et al. ( Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 9(1999), 385-388) is drawn to an ordinary assay for determining anti-HIV activity on the basis of MT-4 cells versus an HIV-1 III b strain, and does not use a multi-drug resistant virus strain. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In order to find a compound having more potent antiviral activity than AZT, the present inventors have synthesized a variety of 4-C-ethynyl nucleosides and evaluated the antiviral activity thereof, and have found that: 1) a 4-ethynyl nucleoside derviative having a specific structure exhibits potent anti-HIV activity equal to or greater than that of AZT; 2) the compound has potent antiviral activity against a multi-drug resistant virus strain exhibiting resistance to various anti-HIV drugs such as AZT, ddI, ddC, d4T, and 3TC; and 3) the compound exhibits no significant cytotoxicity. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of these findings. Accordingly, the present invention provides 4-C-ethynyl nucleosides (other than 4-C-ethynylthymidine) represented by formula I: wherein B represents a base selected from the group consisting of pyrimidine, purine, and derivatives thereof; X represents a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group; and R represents a hydrogen atom or a phosphate residue. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition containing any one of the compounds and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably, the composition is employed as an antiviral drug or a drug for treating AIDS. The present invention also provides use, as pharmaceuticals, of compounds represented by formula 1. The present invention also provides a method for treatment of AIDS, comprising administering a compound of formula 1 to a vertebrate, including human.

In addition, the compounds of the present invention encompass a variety of isomers thereof such as tautomers. (2) Method of Production One of the compounds of the present invention in which X is a hydrogen atom; i.e., a 2-deoxy derivative, can be produced by the following steps. First Step In the first step, a hydroxymethyl group at the 4-position of the compound represented by II is oxidized to thereby form an aldehyde, which is further converted into an alkyne to thereby yield a compound represented by formula III: wherein each of R1 and R2 represents a protective group; R3 represents a hydrogen atom or a protective group; and Bn represents a benzyl group. The starting material of the reaction is a known compound represented by formula II (Biosci. Biotech. Biochem., 57, 1433-1438(1993)). Each of R1 and R2 may be a protective group which is typically employed for protecting a hydroxyl group. Examples of types of a protective moiety containing R1 or R2 include an ether type, an acyl type, a silyl type, and an acetal type. Specific examples protective groups include a silyl group, an acetyl group, a benzyl group, and an isopropylidenyl group. When the hydroxymethyl group at the 4-position of the compound represented by II is converted into an aldehyde group by use of an oxidizing agent, examples of oxidizing agents include a chromium-containing oxidizing agent such as chromic anhydride-pyridine-acetic anhydride composite reagent, pyridinium chlorochromate, or pyridinium dichromate; a high-valency iodine oxidizing agent such as Dess-Martin reagent; and a dimethylsulfoxide-based oxidizing agent such as a combination of dimethylsulfoxide and any one of acetic anhydride, oxalyl chloride, or dicyclohexyl carbodiimide. Reaction conditions vary depending on an employed oxidizing agent. For example, when oxidation is carried out by use of oxalyl chloride and dimethyl sulfoxide, oxaly chloride in an amount of 0.5-5 mol and dimethyl sulfoxide in an amount of 1.5-6 mol are added to 1 mol of a compound represented by formula II in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane optionally under an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen. The mixture is then allowed to react for approximately 15 minutes to two hours at 100 C. to 0 C. Subsequently, a base such as triethylamine is added in an amount of 2-10 mol to the mixture, and the resultant mixture is further allowed to react at room temperature for approximately 15 minutes to two hours. The thus-formed aldehyde can be converted into a corresponding alkyne through carbon-increasing (i.e., CC bond formation) reaction of the aldehyde; treating the resultant compound with a strong base to thereby form a metal alkynyl compound; and introducing a protective group to the metal alkynyl compound. Carbon-increasing reaction may be carried out in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane or dichloroethane, optionally under an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen. Specifically, 1 mol of the above-produced aldehyde is reacted with 1-5 mol of carbon tetrabromide and 2-10 mol of triphenylphosphine at 0-50 C. for approximately 15 minutes to three hours. Treatment with a strong base may be carried out in an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, or dimethoxyethane, optionally under an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen. Specifically, 1 mol of a compound obtained through carbon-increasing reaction is reacted with 2-4 mol of a lithium compound such as n-butyllithium or t-butyllithium at 100 C. to 20 C. for approximately 5-60 minutes. Furthermore, when a silyl protective group represented by R3 is introduced into an alkynyl group in the thus-obtained compound, the aforementioned treatment is followed by addition of a silylating agent such as chlorotriethylsilane. A protective group can be introduced to a hydroxyl group by use of a customary method. For example, an acetyl group may be introduced through reaction with an acetylating agent such as acetic anhydride. The thus-obtained compound represented by formula III may be isolated and purified through a manner which is employed for isolating and purifying typical protected saccharides. For example, the crude compound is partitioned by use of an ethyl acetate-saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and the isolated compound is purified by use of a silica gel column. Second Step The second step includes condensation of a compound represented by formula III and a base represented by B; deoxygenation at the 2-position; removing a protective group of a saccharide portion; and optionally phosphorylating the hydroxyl group at the 5-position, to thereby produce a compound represented by formula I: wherein B represents a base selected from the group consisting of pyrimidine; purine, including azapurine or deazapurine; and a derivative thereof (other than thymine); R represents a hydrogen atom or a phosphate residue; each of R1 and R2 represents a protective group; R3 represents a hydrogen atom or a protective group; and Bn represents a benzyl group. Condensation of a compound represented by formula III and a base represented by B can be carried out by reacting the compound with the base in the presence of a Lewis acid. The base represented by B may be silylated, and silylation may be carried out through a known method. For example, a base is silylated by use of hexamethylsilazane and trimethylchlorosilane under reflux. Examples of Lewis acids include trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, tin tetrachloride, zinc chloride, zinc iodide, and anhydrous aluminum chloride. Condensation reaction may be carried out in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, acetonitrile, or toluene, optionally under an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen. Specifically, 1 mol of a compound represented by formula III is reacted with 1-10 mol of a base represented by B and 0.1-10 mol of Lewis acid at 20 C. to 150 C. for approximately 30 minutes to three hours. Deoxygenation at the 2-position may be carried out by converting the derivative having a hydroxyl group to the derivative having a group such as halogeno, phenoxythiocarbonyl, thiocarbonylimidazolyl, or methyldithiocarbonyl and reducing the converted derivative using a radical reducing agent in the presence of a radical initiator. For example, when deoxygenation is carried out through phenoxythiocarbonate, conversion of a hydroxyl group to a phenoxythiocarbonyl group may be carried out in an organic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, or dichloromethane, in the presence of a base such as dimethylaminopyridine or pyridine, optionally under an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen. Specifically, 1 mol of the aforementioned condensation product in which only the protective group for the hydroxyl group at the 2-position had been eliminated is reacted under stirring with 1-10 mol, preferably 1.1-2 mol, of a phenyl chlorothionoformate derivative at 0-50 C. for approximately 0.5-5 hours. Alternatively, when deoxygenation is carried out via a bromo compound, the bromination may be carried out in an organic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, or dichloromethane, by use of a brominating agent such as acetyl bromide at 0-150 C. for approximately 0.5-5 hours, optionally under an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen. The brominating agent is used in an amount of 1-50 mol, preferably 5-20 mol, per mol of the aforementioned condensate from which a protective group at the 2-position had been removed. Subsequently, reduction may be carried out in an organic solvent such as toluene or benzene in the presence of a radical initiator such as azobisisobutyronitrile, optionally under an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen. Specifically, 1 mol of the aforementioned phenoxythiocarbonate or bromide is reacted under stirring with 1-10 mol, preferably 2-5 mol, of a radical reducing agent such as tributyltin hydride at 50-150 C. for approximately 1-5 hours. One of the compounds of the present invention in which X is a hydroxyl group; i.e., an arabino derivative, can be produced by the following steps. First Step The first step includes condensation of a compound represented by formula III and a base represented by B; stereochemically inverting the hydroxyl group at the 2-position to be an arabino form; removing a protective group of a saccharide portion; and optionally phosphorylating the hydroxyl group at the 5-position, to thereby produce a compound represented by formula I: wherein B represents a base selected from the group consisting of pyrimidine, purine including azapurine or deazapurine, and a derivative thereof; R represents a hydrogen atom or a phosphate residue; each of R1 and R2 represents a protective group; R3 represents a hydrogen atom or a protective group; and Bn represents a benzyl group. Condensation of a compound represented by formula III and a base represented by B can be carried out by reacting the compound with the base in the presence of a Lewis acid. The base represented by B may be silylated, and silylation may be carried out through a known method. For example, a base is silylated by use of hexamethylsilazane and trimethylchlorosilane under reflux. Examples of Lewis acids include trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, tin tetrachloride, zinc chloride, zinc iodide, and anhydrous aluminum chloride. Condensation reaction may be carried out in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, acetonitrile, or toluene, optionally under an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen. Specifically, 1 mol of a compound represented by formula III is reacted with 1-10 mol of a base represented by B and 0.1-10 mol of Lewis acid at 20 C. to 150 C. for approximately 30 minutes to three hours. Stereo-inversion of the hydroxyl group at the 2-position can be carried out by converting a compound containing the hydroxyl into a corresponding 2,2-anhydrocyclonucleoside and hydrolyzing the nucleoside. Anhydrocyclization may be carried out through treatment with a sulfonating agent such as methanesulfonyl chloride, or through treatment with a fluorinating agent such as diethylaminosulfur trifluoride. For example, when diethylaminosulfur trifluoride is employed, anhydrocyclization may be carried out in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane or toluene, optionally under an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen. Specifically, 1 mol of the aforementioned condensation product in which the protective group for the hydroxyl group at the 2-position was removed is reacted with 1.1-5 mol, preferably 1.5-2 mol, of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride at 0 C. to room temperature for approximately five minutes to 2 hours. Alternatively, when methanesulfonyl chloride is employed, anhydrocyclization may be carried out in an organic solvent such as pyridine, optionally under an inert gas such as nitrogen. Specifically, 1 mol of the aforementioned condensation product in which the protective group for the hydroxyl group at the 2-position had been eliminated is reacted with 1.1-5 mol, preferably 1.5-2 mol, of methanesulfonyl chloride at 0-50 C. for approximately five minutes to 10 hours. Subsequently, hydrolysis may be carried out in the presence of an appropriate base or acid catalyst. For example, when a base catalyst is employed, hydrolysis may be carried out in a solvent mixture comprising water and an alcoholic solvent such as ethanol in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide at room temperature to 100 C. for approximately 30 minutes to 5 hours. In the case in which a base represented by B in the target compound; i.e., 4-ethynylnucleoside, is a base having an amino group, the target compound may also be produced from a hydroxyl-containing base compound through a known method. For example, if the 4-position of a pyrimidine base is sought to be aminated, the hydroxyl group at the 4-position of a pyrimidine base may be converted into a group such as chloro, silyloxy, alkyloxy, sulfonyloxy, or triazolyl, and then the converted group is reacted with ammonia. For example, amination through a triazole derivative may be carried out with stirring in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, or pyridine in the presence of a base such as triethylamine (triethylamine may be omitted if pyridine is used as a solvent) and a phosphorylating agent such as 4-chlorophenylphosphorodichloridate, optionally under an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen. Specifically, 1 mol of the aforementioned condensation product is reacted with 1-20 mol, preferably 2-10 mol, of 1,2,4-triazole at 0 C. to room temperature for approximately 12-72 hours, followed by addition of aqueous ammonia in an appropriate amount and further reaction at 0 C. to room temperature for approximately 1-12 hours. In addition, an amino group in a base may be removed through a conventional method making use of any of a variety of deaminases, such as adenosine deaminase or cytidine deaminase. Finally, a protective group of the thus-produced nucleoside is removed, to thereby obtain the compounds (RH) of the present invention. A protective group may be removed through a method appropriately selected from a routine procedure such as hydrolysis under acidic conditions, hydrolysis under basic conditions, treatment with tetrabutylammonium fluoride, or catalytic reduction, in accordance with the protective group employed. When R in a target compound is a phosphate residue such as monophosphate or diphosphate, a compound in which R is a hydrogen atom is reacted with a phosphorylating agent; e.g., phosphorus oxychloride or tetrachloropyrophosphoric acid, which selectively phosphorylates the 5-position of a nucleoside, to thereby produce a target compound in a free or salt form. The compounds of the present invention may be isolated and purified through conventional methods, in appropriate combination, which are employed for isolating and purifying nucleosides and nucleotides; e.g., recrystallization, ion-exchange column chromatography, and adsorption column chromatography. The thus-obtained compounds may further be converted to a salt thereof in accordance with needs.

Test Examples Test Methods (1) Anti-HSV-1 Activity 1. Human embryonic lung cells are subcultured by splitting at 1:2 to 1:4 in an Eagles MEM supplemented with 10% bovine serum (Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation) at intervals of 4-5 days. 2. The suspension of cells obtained from parent cells by splitting at 1:2 is added to a 96-well-microplate at 200 l/well, and the cells are cultured in a CO 2 -incubator for four days at 37 C. 3. After culture medium is removed, a test agent (100 l) in serial fivefold dilution with a Hanks MEM is added to the wells. 4. An Eagles MEM (100 l) supplemented with 5% bovine serum containing 100-320 TCID 50 of herpes simplex virus type-1, VR-3 strain is added to the wells to thereby seed the virus, and the infected cells are cultured at 37 C. in a CO 2 -incubator. 5. After the cells are cultured for 2-3 days, the degree of CPE of each well is observed under a microscope for evaluation on a scale of 0 to 4. When the cells in test agent-free controls are completely degenerated through infection with the virus, the CPE score is 4. 6. The antiviral activity is expressed as ED 50 at which HSV-induced CPE were expressed at least 50%. (2) Anti-human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Activity 1) MTT method using MT-4 cells 1. A test agent (100 l) is diluted on a 96-well microplate. MT-4 cells infected with HIV-1 (III b strain; 100 TCID 50 ) and non-infected MT-4 cells are added to the microplate such that the number of cells in each well becomes 10,000. The cells are cultured at 37 C. for five days. 2. MTT (20 l, 7.5 mg/ml) is added to each well, and the cells are further cultured for 2-3 hours. 3. The cultured medium (120 l) is sampled, and MTT terminating solution (isopropanol containing 4% Triton X-100 and 0.04N HCl) is added to the sample. The mixture is stirred to form formazane, which is dissolved. The absorbance at 540 nm of the solution is measured. Since the absorbance is proportional to the number of viable cells, the test agent concentration at which a half value of the absorbance is measured in a test using infected MT-4 cells represents EC 50 , whereas the test agent concentration at which a half value of the absorbance is measured in a test using non-infected MT-4 cells represents CC 50 . 2) MAGI Assay Using HeLa CD4/LTR-beta-Gal Cells 1. HeLa CD4/LTR-beta-Gal cells are added to 96 wells such that the number of cells in each well is 10,000. After 12-24 hours, the culture medium is removed, and a diluted test agent (100 l) is added. 2. A variety of HIV strains (wild strain: WT, drug-resistant strain: MDR, M184V, NL4-3, 104pre, and C; each equivalent to 50 TCID 50 ) are added, and the cells are further cultured for 48 hours. 3. The cells are fixed for five minutes using PBS containing 1% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde. 4. After the fixed cells are washed with PBS three times, the cells are stained with 0.4 mg/ml X-Gal for one hour, and the number of blue-stained cells of each well is counted under a transmission stereoscopic microscope. The test agent concentration at which blue-stained cells decrease to 50% and 90% in number represents EC 50 and EC 90 , respectively. 5.

This application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT/JP 98/03267 filed Jul. 22, 1998. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to hexahydro-1,4-diazepine derivatives or their salts which are useful as drugs, especially as an activated blood coagulation factor X inhibitor. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Recently, thromboembolic disorders, such as myocardial infarction, cerebral thrombosis and peripheral arteriothrombosis, are increasing year by year with the popularization of Western life-styles and the increase in aged population, and there is much increasing social demand for the treatment of such disorders. Anticoagulant therapy as well as adenolytic therapy and antiplatelet therapy is a part of medical therapy for treatment and prevention of thrombosis (Sogo Rinsho, 41: 2141-2145, 1989). In particular, anticoagulants for prevention of thrombosis indispensably require high safety for long-term administration and the ability of surely and appropriately expressing the anticoagulation activity. However, the anticoagulating ability of warfarin potassium, which is only one oral anticoagulant now being popularly used in the world, is difficult to control because of the characteristic of itself based on the action and the mechanism thereof ( J. Clinical Pharmacology , 32, 196-209, 1992; and N. Eng. J. Med ., 324 (26), 1865-1875, 1991), and the drug is extremely difficult to use in clinics. It is known that thrombin acts to convert fibrinogen into fibrin in the final stage of coagulation, while deeply participating in the activation and the coagulation of platelets. At present, however, no oral thrombin inhibitor is commercially available because of its low bioavailability in oral administration and of its low safety (Biomed. Biochim. Acta, 44, 1201-1210, 1985). On the other hand, the activated blood coagulation factor X is a key enzyme existing in the junction of intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation cascade reactions, and inhibiting this factor is more efficient than thrombin inhibition, and could bring about specific inhibition of coagulation systems ( THROMBOSIS RESEARCH (19), 339-349, 1980). As compounds having the ability of inhibiting the activated blood coagulation factor X, known are amidinonaphthylbenzene derivatives or their salts (JP-A-5-208946 ; Thrombosis Haemostasis , 71 (3), 314-319, 1994 ; Thrombosis Haemostasis , 72 (3), 393-396, 1994); and WO96/16940 discloses amidinonaphthyl derivatives of the following general formula or their salts. In the formula, B represents a lower alkylene group, etc.; R 1 represents a hydrogen atom or a group of a formula, AWR 4 where A represents CO, SO 2 , etc.; W represents a single bond or an NR 5 group (where R 5 represents a hydrogen atom, a CONH 3 group, etc.); R 4 represents an optionally-substituted lower alkyl group, etc.; R 2 represents a lower alkyl group; R 3 represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, etc.; and n0 or 1. As so mentioned above, inhibitors for the activated blood coagulation factor X are more effective than thrombin inhibitors in anticoagulant therapy, and are expected to bring about specific inhibition of coagulation systems. Accordingly, it is desired to create selective activated blood coagulation factor X inhibitors, which are different from the known compounds noted above in the chemical structure, can be orally administered and are more effective. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION We, the present inventors have found that hexahydro-1,4-diazepine derivatives of the following general formula (I) or their salts, of which the chemical structure is characterized in that an amidinonaphthylmethyl group or the like is bonded to a phenyl group or a pyridyl group via a nitrogen atom and that the phenyl group or the pyridyl group is directly bonded to the nitrogen atom of the hexahydro-1,4-diazepine ring, have an excellent activity of inhibiting the activated blood coagulation factor X, and have completed the present invention.

(Production Method) One typical method for producing the compounds (I) of the invention is mentioned below. (In the formulae, A, B, R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , X and Y have the same meanings as above; Alk represents a lower alkyl group; R 1a represents a hydrogen atom or a pyridyl group; and P represents a pyridly group or anamino-protecting group.) The amino-protecting group of P is not specifically limited, and may be any and every group generally used for protecting amino groups.

Step A Of the compounds of the invention, those (Ia) where R 1 is a hydrogen atom or a pyridyl group can be produced according to any of the methods (1) to (3) mentioned below. (1) A method of converting a nitrile into an imidate, followed by condensing it with an amine: A nitrile compound (III) is reacted with an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or the like in the presence of hydrochloric acid gas at 40 to 0 C. to be converted into an imidate, which is then reacted with an amine or amine salt, such as ammonia, ammonium carbonate, ammonium chloride, ammonium acetate or the like. As a solvent, a solvent which is effective for the reaction, or an inert solvent is used. The inert solvent includes tetrahydrofuran (THF), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), benzene, toluene, xylene, ethyl acetate, acetone, acetonitrile, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, mixtures thereof, etc. (2) A method of converting a nitrile into a thioimidate via a thioamide, followed by condensing it with an amine: First, a nitrile compound (III) is reacted with hydrogen sulfide in the presence of an organic base such as methylamine, triethylamine, pyridine, picoline, or the like, or is reacted with O,O-diethyl dithiophosphate in the presence of hydrogen chloride, thereby converting it into a thioamide. Next, the resulting thioamide is reacted with a lower alkyl halide such as methyl iodide, ethyl iodide, or the like, thereby converting it into a thioimidate, which is then reacted with an amine or amine salt, such as ammonia, ammonium carbonate, ammonium chloride, ammonium acetate, or the like. As a solvent, the above-described inert solvent is used. (3) A method of directly adding an amine, an amine salt, a metal amide, or a Grignard reagent to a nitrile: To a nitrile compound (III), added is any reagent of ammonia, ammonium chloride combined with ammonia, ammonium thiocyanate, an alkylammonium thiocyanate, MeAl(Cl)NH 2 , NaNH 2 , (CH 3 ) 2 NMgBr, or the like. The reaction can be carried out in an inert solvent such as that mentioned above or in the absence of a solvent. A base such as sodium hydride or an acid such as aluminum chloride, p-toluenesulfonic acid, etc. may be added as a catalyst, whereby the reaction may be greatly promoted. The reaction may be effected with cooling, or at room temperature, or under heating. In the reaction of converting the nitrile into an amidino group, the amino-protecting group of P could not be removed as the case may be. In that case, the protecting group may be removed in any suitable method for further removing it to obtain the compound (Ia) of the invention. Where the compound (III) has a COO-alkyl group bonded thereto, the COO-alkyl group may be converted into a CONH 3 group during the amidination. Step B Of the compounds of the invention, those (Ib) where R 1 is a C(NH)-lower alkyl group can be synthesized by reacting the compound (Ia) of the invention, which is produced in the previous first step and which has a secondary amino group (R 1a H) with an imidate compound in the presence of a base. This reaction may be effected with cooling or under heating, in which is usable the above-described inert solvent. As the base, usable are organic bases such as N-methylmorpholine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, pyridine, picoline, lutidine, dimethylaniline, etc. and inorganic bases such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydrogencarbonate, etc. Where the compound (Ib) has a COO-alkyl group bonded thereto, the group may be converted into a carboxyl group through hydrolysis under basic, acidic or neutral conditions, as the case may be. In the hydrolysis, employable is a base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, barium hydroxide or the like under the basic conditions; an acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, Lewis acids, e.g., boron trichloride, p-toluenesulfonic acid, or the like under the acidic conditions; and a halide such as lithium iodide, lithium bromide, or the like, or an alkali metal salt of thiol or selenol, or iodotrimethylsilane, an enzyme such as esterase, or the like under the neutral conditions. The reaction is effected generally at room temperature using an inert solvent such as that mentioned above, but in some cases, it requires cooling or heating the reaction system. The conditions may be suitably determined in any ordinary manner. (Methods for Producing Starting Compounds) Typical methods for producing starting compounds for the compounds (I) of the invention are mentioned below. (In the formulae, A, B, R R 2 , R 4 , R 5 , X, Y and P have the same meanings as above; W represents a halogen atom or an organic sulfonic acid residue; Q represents an aldehyde group or a group of formula, CH 2 -W; and P represents P or a hydrogen atom.) Method 1: This is to react a hexahydro-1,4-diazepine derivative (IV) with a nitrobenzene or nitropyridine derivative (V) to give a compound (VI). This reaction is the same as ordinary substitution reaction, and may be effected in no solvent or in an inert organic solvent such as that mentioned above, at room temperature or under heating, or even under heating for reflux, optionally in the presence of an inorganic base such as that mentioned above. When P is a hydrogen atom, a similar substitution reaction is further carried out by using chloropyridine, etc. to synthesize a compound (VI) where P is a pyridyl group. If desired, an amino-protecting group may be introduced into the compound formed herein, in any suitable method to give a compound (VI) where P is the amino-protecting group. Method 2: This is to obtain an amine compound (VII) from the nitro compound (VI). This reaction may be ordinary reduction, for which, for example, employed is method of using a metal such as zinc, tin or the like; a method of using a metal hydride such as LiAlH 4 or the like; or a catalytic reduction method of using palladium-carbon or the like. These methods may be effected in an inert solvent such as that mentioned above, at room temperature or under heating. Method 3: This is ordinary N-alkylation. (i) Where the compound (VIII) is an alkyl halide or alkyl sulfonate: The reaction is effected by stirring the compound (VII) and a reaction-corresponding amount of a compound (VIII) in an inert solvent such as that mentioned above with cooling or under heating. To promote the reaction, it is desirable to add a base such as that mentioned above. (ii) Where the compound (VIII) is an aldehyde: The reaction is reductive amination of reacting the compound (VII) with a corresponding aldehyde (VIII) and a reducing agent. As the reducing agent, for example, employable is any of sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, etc. This reaction may be effected in an alcohol or an inert solvent such as that mentioned above while stirring with cooling or under heating (for reflux). Method 4: Starting compounds (III) can be produced according to any of the methods (a) to (c) mentioned below. (a) Method for producing amide compounds (IIIa): Of the starting compounds (III), amide compounds (IIIa) where X is CO can be synthesized through acylation of an amine (IX) with an active derivative of a carboxylic acid (for example, acid chloride, etc.). Alternatively, amide compounds (IIIa) can also be synthesized through acylation of an amine (IX) and a carboxylic acid in the presence of a condensing agent. As the condensing agent, for example, favorably employed is any of N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1-ethyl-3-(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide, carbonyldi-imidazole, etc. In general, the reaction may be effected in an inert solvent such as that mentioned above, with cooling or at room temperature and depending on the type of the acylation, the reaction is effected under anhydrous conditions.

The excellent activity of the compounds of the invention to inhibit the activated blood coagulation factor X was confirmed by the test methods mentioned below. 1) Method of measuring the time for blood coagulation with the human activated blood coagulation factor X: The human activated blood coagulation factor X (Cosmo-Bio Co.) was dissolved in 0.05 M tris-HCl buffer (pH7.40) to prepare its solution of 0.05 units/ml. Blood was collected in 3.8% sodium citrate to be 1/10 by volume, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate human plasma therefrom. 90 l of the thus-prepared human plasma, 10 l of a test compound as diluted with physiological saline, and 50 l of the solution of the activated blood coagulation factor X were kept warmed at 37 C. for 3 minutes, to which was added 100 l of a solution of 20 mM CaCl 2 , and the time for blood coagulation in the system was measured. To measure the coagulation time, used was Amelungs KC4A. The dose of the test compound for 2-time prolongation of the coagulation time (hereinafter referred to as CT2) was calculated on the basis of the coagulation time for the control to which was added 10 l of physiological saline with no test compound. The results are shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 Test for measuring coagulation time with the human Example No. activated blood coagulation factor X, CT2 (M) 17 0.092 22 0.111 23 0.110 24 0.152 32 0.089 33 0.098 36 0.069 72 0.119 73 0.224 75 0.095 84 0.134 Control compound 0.590 *) Control compound: A compound of Example 52 of JP-A-5-208946 It has been verified that the compounds of the invention specifically inhibit the human activated blood coagulation factor X, and, while prolonging the coagulation time even at low concentrations, exhibit an excellent anticoagulation activity. 2) Method of measuring the coagulation time for mice in exo vivo (intravenous administration): To test animals of male ICR mice (20 to 30 g, SLC Co.) that had been fed with nothing for 12 hours or longer, a solution of a test compound having been dissolved in physiological saline was intravenously administered only once through their tail vein. One minute after the administration, 0.6 ml of blood was collected from the animals which were anesthetized with diethyl ether, through their posterior artery in 3.8% sodium citrate to be 1/10 by volume, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate plasma therefrom. The extrinsic coagulation time (PT) and the intrinsic coagulation time (APTT) for this plasma were measured according to the following methods a) and b), respectively. a) Extrinsic coagulation time (PT): Tissue thromboplastin (54 mg/vial, freeze-dried powder by Ortho Co.) was dissolved in 2.5 ml of distilled water, and pre-warmed at 37 C. 50 l of the plasma prepared in the above was kept warmed at 37 C. for 1 minute, to which was added 50 l of the thromboplastin solution, and the coagulation time was measured. To measure the coagulation time, used was Amelungs KC4A. The coagulation time for the control to which had been applied 50 l of physiological saline with no test compound was also measured. Based on the value of the coagulation time for the control of being 1, obtained was the relative activity of the test compound. b) Intrinsic coagulation time (APTT): 50 l of active thrombofacs (Ortho Co.) and 50 l of the plasma prepared in the above were kept warmed at 37 C. for 3 minutes, to which was added 50 l of a solution of 20 mM CaCl 2 having been previously warmed at 37 C., and the coagulation time was measured. To measure the coagulation time, used was Amelungs KC4A. The coagulation time for the control to which had been administered physiological saline with no test compound was also measured. Based on the value of the coagulation time for the control of being 1, obtained was the relative activity of the test compound. The dose dependency of the anticoagulation activity of the compounds of the invention and also the time-dependent change in the activity thereof were also studied in the same manner as above, in which the dose and the time for blood collection were varied. The data obtained in those experiments verified that the intravenous administration of the compounds of the invention well prolongs the coagulation time. 3) Method of measuring the coagulation time for mice in exo vivo (oral administration): The same test animals as in 2) were further tested in the same manner as above, except that the solution of a test compound was orally administered in a forced manner through a gastric tube inserted thereinto, in place of the single intravenous administration in 2), and that blood was collected from each test animal in 30 minutes after the oral administration. The test data obtained herein verified that the oral administration of the compounds of the invention well prolongs the coagulation time. 4) Method of measuring the coagulation time for crab-eating macaque in exo vivo (oral administration): To test animals of male cynomolgus monkey (3 to 6 kg, Hamri Co.) that had been fed with nothing for 12 hours or longer, a solution or suspension of a test compound having been dissolved in physiological saline or suspended in a solution of 0.5% methyl cellulose was orally administered in a forced manner through a gastric tube inserted thereinto. 3 ml of blood was collected from the thus-treated animals not being anesthetized, through their femoral vein at predetermined time intervals, in 3.8% sodium citrate to be 1/10 by volume, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate human plasma therefrom. The extrinsic coagulation time (PT) and the intrinsic coagulation time (APTT) for this plasma were measured according to the same methods as in 2). The test data obtained herein verified that the oral administration of the compounds of the invention exhibits good bioavailability and has a superior function for prolonging the coagulation time. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as the active ingredient, one or more of the compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the invention can be formulated along with ordinary pharmaceutical carriers, vehicles and other additives into tablets, powders, fine granules, granules, capsules, pills, liquid preparations, injections, suppositories, ointments, cataplasms, and the like, and are administered orally or parenterally. The clinical dose of the compounds of the invention may be suitably determined, depending on the conditions, the body weight, the age and the sex of the patients to which they are administered, but is, in general, from 0.1 to 500 mg/adult/day for oral administration, and from 0.01 to 100 mg/adult/day for parenteral administration. This may be administered to the patients all at a time, or may be divided into a few portions for administration in different times. Since the dose may vary depending on various conditions, a smaller dose than the defined range may well be employed, as the case may be. As the solid composition for oral administration of the compounds of the invention, employed are tablets, powders, granules, etc. The solid composition of those types comprises one or more active substances along with at least one inert diluent, such as lactose, mannitol, glucose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, meta-silicic acid, and magnesium aluminate. In an ordinary manner, the composition may contain any other additives except the inert diluents noted above, for example, a lubricant such as magnesium stearate, a disintegrator such as calcium cellulose glycolate, a stabilizer such as lactose, and a solubilizer or dissolution promoter such as glutamic acid or aspartic acid. If desired, the tablets and pills may be coated with a film of gastric or enteric substances such as sucrose, gelatin, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate, etc. The liquid composition for oral administration includes, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, elixirs, and the like, which contain ordinary inactive diluents such as purified water and ethyl alcohol. In addition to the inert diluents, those compositions may further contain pharmaceutical aids such as solubilizers, dissolution promoters, wetting promoters, suspension promoters, and also sweeteners, flavorings, aromas, and preservatives. The injection for parenteral administration includes, for example, germ-free, aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions and emulsions. The diluent for the aqueous solutions and suspensions includes, for example, distilled water and physiological saline for injections. The diluent for the non-aqueous solutions and suspensions includes, for example, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, alcohols such as ethyl alcohol, Polysolvate 80 (trade name), etc. Those compositions may further contain additives such as isotonicating promoters, preservatives, wetting promoters, emulsifiers, dispersants, stabilizers (e.g., lactose), solubilizers, dissolution promoters, etc. The compositions are sterilized by filtering them through bacteria-trapping filters, or by adding microbicides thereto, or by exposing them to radiations. The germ-free, solid compositions thus produced may be dissolved in germ-free water or in germ-free solvents for injection, before using them. Where the compounds of the invention have low solubility, they may be processed for solubilization. For the solubilization treatment, employable are any known methods applicable to pharmaceutical preparations. For example, employed are a method of adding surfactants (e.g., polyoxyethylene-hardened castor oils, etc.) to the compounds; and a method of forming solid dispersions comprising the compounds and solubilizers (for example, water-soluble polymers, e.g., hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, etc., and enteric polymers, e.g., carboxymethylethyl cellulose). If desired, further employed are a method of forming soluble salts, and a method of forming clathrate compounds with cyclodextrin or the like. The solubilizing means may be suitably modified depending on the chemicals to be processed therewith (Recent Pharmaceutical Techniques and Their Applications, in the Journal of Medicines , 157-159, 1983; and Pharmacological Monograph No. 1, Bioavailability, published by Soft Science Co., 78-82, 1988). Of those, preferred is the method of forming solid dispersions of chemicals and solubilizers to improve the solubility of the chemicals (JP-A-56-49314; FR 2,460,667).

This application is the national phase under 35 U.S.C. 371 of prior PCT International Application No. PCT/JP97/00789 which has an International filing date of Mar. 13, 1997 which designated the United States of America, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Technical Field The present invention relates to a nitrogen-containing tricyclic compound useful as a medicine, a medicine containing the same and processes for producing the same. More particularly, it relates to a novel nitrogen-containing tricyclic compound useful as a medicine for diseases against which the effect of inhibiting the binding of IgE receptor to a tyrosine kinase of 72 kDa is efficacious. 2. Prior Art The bronchial asthma and the atopic diseases in human beings appear in consequence of highly intriacate vital reactions. It is suspected that most of these conditions are caused because various chemical mediators liberated from mast cells and basophils, as triggered by antigen-antibody reactions, induce vital disturbances as by contracting such smooth muscles as bronchial muscles and vessels of the pulmonary circulation or enhancing permeability of blood vessels. As the chemical mediators liberated from mast cells and basophils, histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, TNF, etc. have been known. It is well known that histamine, among other substances mentioned above, is the most significant chemical mediator for the allergic rhinitis and the urticaria in human beings. The leucotrienes comprise leucotrienes B 4 , C 4 , and D 4 and the relation thereof with the asthmatic convulsion has been attracting attention. Heretofore, the development of medicines for the prevention, alleviation, or elimination of the crisis of symptoms of allergic diseases has been aimed at repressing the creation and liberation of such chemical mediators or antagonizing the effects thereof. Sodium cromoglycate (Intal) having been marketed since 1969 is a typical example of these drugs. However, the conventional antiallergic agents typified by Intal show difference in the chemical mediator liberation inhibitory concentration between in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, sensitivities to these drugs widely vary from patient to patient and their action mechanisms still remain unknown in many points. Mast cells and basophils closely relating to allergic diseases have a highly affinitive receptor, FcERI, for the IgE antibody on the cell membrane thereof. IgE antibodys binding to this receptor forms a cross-linkage with the corresponding polyvalent antigen, the intracellular signal transmission mechanism is activated. Then histamine is liberated or leukotrienes and prostaglandins are formed and liberated, thus inducing the onset of the so-called allergic symptoms. It is further more considered that the cytokines such as TNF and interleukins thus produced interact with other cells and thus make the diseases chronic. Under these circumstances, the present inventors have paid their attention to the activation of a non-receptor type tyrosine kinase located at the early stage in the activation of the intracellular signal transmission mechanism upon liberation of chemical mediators from mast cells or basophils. It is known that this tyrosine kinase is activated when it binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine activation motif (TAM) region in the IgE receptor chain. By inhibiting this binding to thereby inhibit the activation of the tyrosine kinase of 72 kDa, the activation of the intracellular signal transmission mechanism depending on the IgE antibody in mast cells or basophils can be inhibited. As a result, also the liberation of the above chemical mediators can be inhibited. The present inventors have found out that desired objects can be achieved by using nitrogen-containing tricyclic compounds represented by the following formula (I), thus completing the present invention. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a novel acridone derivative and a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof which is efficacious in preventing or treating asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, hay fever, gastrointestinal allergy, food allergy, etc. Another object of the present invention is to provide a medicine containing as the active ingredient the compound, a hydrate thereof or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof.

Ind., 238 (1966). is reacted in the presence of a base with a compound represented by the formula (III) having leaving groups at both ends to thereby give a phenothiazine derivative represented by the formula (IV). Preferable examples of the base usable herein include sodium hydride, n-butyllithium and t-butoxypotassium. Preferable examples of the leaving groups include halogeno and sulfonate. Any reaction solvent may be used therefor, so long as it remains inert during the reaction. Next, the leaving group L in the compound (IV) is substituted by phthalimide. The resulting phthalimide compound represented by the formula (V) is then treated with hydrazine hydrate to give an amine compound represented by the general formula (VI). Next, this amine compound (VI) is condensed under dehydration with an aldehyde compound (VII: wherein R represents alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl or heteroaryl). The Schiff base thus obtained is then treated with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride to give an alkylamine compound represented by the formula (VIII). Any reaction solvent may be used therefor, so long as it remains inert during the reaction. Alternatively, the phthalimide compound (V) serving as an intermediate may be synthesized in the following manner. Namely, the compound (II) is reacted with a compound having a leaving group L at one end and a protected hydroxyl group at another end to give a compound represented by the formula (IV). Subsequently, the compound (IV) is deblocked in a conventional manner to give an alcohol (IV), which is then reacted with phthalimide under the conditions of the Mitsunobu reaction to give a phthalimide compound. ii) The compound (IV) is treated with a primary or secondary amine, or the compound (VI) is treated with a compound having a leaving group L (IX and/or X) to give a compound represented by the formula (X). iii) A sulfoxide compound (XI) and a sulfonyl compound (XII) can be produced by oxidizing the sulfur atoms in the compounds (VIII) and (IX) or oxidizing the sulfur atom in the stage of the intermediate (IV) or (VI) in the process of the above i) or ii) followed by appropriate reactions. Production Process 2 Compounds of the formula (I) wherein Z is C(NOR 12 ) or C(NNR 13 R 14 ) and Q is NR 20 R 21 can be produced by the following process. An acridone compound (XIII) synthesized by a publicly known method (for example, the one described in JP-A 7-3161359) is reacted with a compound (III) to give a compound (XIV). Next, this compound (XIV) is reacted with potassium phthalimide to give a compound (XV). Then the compound (XV) is reacted with oxalyl chloride.

Next, this product is treated in the same manner as the one described in the production process 1 ii) to give an amine compound represented by the formula (IX). Production Process 4 Compounds represented by the formula (I) wherein Z is C(O)N(R 15 ) or N(R 15 C(O) and Q is NR 20 R 21 can be produced by the following process. The procedure of the step i) or ii) in the production process 1 was repeated while replacing the phenothiazine derivative represented by the formula (II) employed in the production process 1 by a dibenzodiazepine derivative (XX or XX) produced by a publicly known method Indian J. Chem., 23B, 85 (1984). or Production Example 13 or 14. Thus a compound represented by the formula (XXI or XXI) can be obtained. Production Process 5 Compounds of the formula (I) wherein Q is heteroaryl can be produced by the following process. The compound represented by the formula (XXII) obtained by the production processes 1, 2, 3 and 4 and having a leaving group L is treated with magnesium to give a Grignard reagent. Next, this Grignard reagent is reacted with an optionally substituted heteroaryl halide derived from, e.g., pyridine or pyrimidine in the presence of 1,3-bis (diphenylphosphino)propane nickel dichloride Ni(dppp)Cl 2 to give a compound represented by the formula (XXIV). Production Process 6 Compounds of the formula (I) wherein Q is optionally substituted carbamoyl, acyl or optionally protected carboxy can be produced by the following process. The compound represented by the formula (XXII) obtained by the production processes 1, 2, 3 and 4 and having a leaving group L is treated with a reagent for cyanation such as sodium cyanide in the presence of a base to give a nitrile compound (XXV), which is then hydrolyzed to give an unsubstituted carbamoyl compound (XXVI) or an ester or carboxylic acid represented by the formula (XXVII). A substituted carbamoyl compound (XXVIII) can be obtained by alkylating or aralkylating the unsubstituted carbamoyl compound (XXVI) or reacting the ester or a reactive derivative (acid halide, reactive ester, etc.) derived from the carboxylic acid in a conventional manner with a primary or a secondary amine. A protected carboxyl compound can be obtained by reacting the reactive derivative derived from the carboxylic acid with an alcohol derivative.

Pharmacological Experimental Examples (1) Inbihitory Effects on Various Mediators Release From Rat Basophilic Leukemia Cell Line (RBL-2H3) i) Experimental Method IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells (i.e., a cell line originating in rat cells) release and produce not only histamine and serotonin but also cytokines such as TNF and prostaglandins which are inflammatory mediators after stimulation with IgE sepecific antibody. In this experimental system, inhibitory effects on various mediators release were examined by using serotonin as an indication. The cells were beforehand labeled with 3 H-labeled serotonin and, at the same time, sensitized with the IgE antibody. After incubating with the compounds of the present invention, the cells were stimulated with the specific antigen. Then the inhibitory activity of each compound was calculated from the amount of the 3 H-labeled serotonin thus liberated into the medium and the amount of 3 H-labeled serotonin liberated when no compound of the present invention was added. ii) Results of the Experiment The results are shown in Tables 1 to 3.

(2) Inhibitory Effects on Various Mediators Release from Human Basophils i) Experimental Method 6 ml of 6% dextran (for separating leukocytes, having a high molecular weight) was added to 20 ml of heparinized blood. After stirring well, the resulting mixture was allowed to stand at 37 C. for 30 min and thus erythrocytes were precipitated. The upper layer was taken up and phosphate buffered saline (D-PBS) was added thereto followed by centrifugation at 185 g for 8 minutes to give a crude leukocyte fraction. These cells were subjected to hypotonic hematolysis and then suspended in D-PBS() containing 0.1%-BSA. The resulting suspension was used in the subsequent experiment as the leukocyte fraction containing basophils. 0.4 ml of this cell suspension was preliminarily heated to 37 C. for 5 min and then 0.05 ml of a specimen solution was added thereto followed by a pretreatment at 37 C. for 15 min. Next, 0.05 ml of a mite antigen solution was added thereto to induce an antigen-antibody reaction. After 10 min, the reaction was ceased by ice-cooling. Then the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 185 g for 10 min and histamine and peptide leukotrienes in the resulting supernatant were determined by using enzyme immunoassay kits. From the results of the assay, the activities of the acridone derivatives of inhibiting the liberation of histamine and peptide leukotriene were determined. ii) Results of the Experiment The results are given in Tables 4 to 7 wherein the term leukotriene means peptide leukotriene.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide in the tyrosine activation motif (TAM) region in the IgE receptor chain was synthesized by Peptide Institute. In the experiment, cell lysates or cytosolic fraction of RBL-2H3 cells were used. Cell lysates were prepared by solubilizing 110 7 to 510 7 cells with a solution containing various protease inhibitors and 1%-NP-40 as a solubilizer. Separately, the cells were homogenized in a Downs homogenizer and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 1 hr, and the resulting supernatant was used as the cytosol fraction of the cells. The concentration of the lysate or cytosol was adjusted to 1 mg protein/ml with an isotonic buffer. The phosphorylation experiment of the 72 kDa tyrosine kinase contained in the lysate or cytosol was carried out in the following manner. An assay buffer 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 0.6 mM MnCl 2 , 0.5 mM EGTA, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate containing the lysate or cytosol in an amount corresponding to 10 mg of protein was incubated together with the compound 101 at 30 C. for 3 min. After adding 50 mM of the peptide in the TAM region containing the phosphorylated tyrosine and 50 mM of ATP, the incubation was further effected at 30 C. for 15 min. After the completion of the reaction, the sample was electrophoresed on a 10% agarose gel and a tyrosine kinase of 72 kDa was separated. The activation of this kinase was confirmed by examining the phosphorylation of the tyrosine moiety in the kinase per se by western blotting with the use of anti-tyrosine phosphorylation antibody. Then the extent of the phosphorylation was numerically expressed by using an image analyzer and thus the tyrosine kenase phosphorylation inhibitory ratio of the compound 101 was determined. ii) Results of the Experiment The results are given in Table 8.

Next, the cells were reacted with an antigen specific for the IgE receptor for 10 min. After the completion of the antigenic stimulation, the cells were allowed to stand in ice for 1 hr in a 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing a lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, 50 g/ml eupeptin, 10 unit/ml aprotonin) and 0.1% of NaN 3 followed by centrifugation to give a cell lysate. This lysate was diluted with a buffer for electrophoresis, heated (95 C., 5 min) and then electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After the electrophoresis, the sample was electrically transcribed onto a 0. 2 m nitrocellulose membrane and treated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody for 1 hr. Then the inhibitory activity was evaluated by the coloring analysis through chemiluminescence. ii) Results of the Experiment The results are given in Table 9.

amount of triethylammonium iodide and 410 mg of potassium carbonate were added to 5 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide followed by stirring at 90 C. for 4 hr. Then the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. After adding water, the liquid reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with brine and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After evaporating the solvent under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography to give 430 mg of the title compound. 1 H-NMR,(400 MHz, CDCl 3 ) 7.78(m, 1H), 7.58(d, J8, 1H), 7.52-7.49(m, 2H), 7.21-7.16(m, 1H), 7.13(d, J8, 1H), 4.26(m, 1H), 4.08(m, 1H), 3.57(t, J5, 4H), 2.39(s, 3H), 2.37(s, 3H), 2.32-2.15(m, 6H), 1.71(m, 2H).

formaldehyde followed by stirred under reflux for 3.5 hr. After adding water, the reaction mixture was basified by adding a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate. Then it was extracted with methylene chloride and the organic layer was washed with a saturated aqueous solution and dried over sodium sulfate. After evaporating the solvent under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography to give 120 mg of the title compound. 1 H-NMR,(400 MHz, CDCl 3 ) 7.79-7.77(m, 1H), 7.57(d, J8, 1H), 7.52-7.50(m, 2H), 7.21-7.12(m,3H), 6.89(dd, J1, 8, 1H), 6.81(dd, J1, 8, 1H), 6.77-6.73(m, 1H),4.35-4.23(m, 1H), 4.02-3.94(m, 1H), 3.59(d, J14, 1H), 3.51(d, J14, 1H), 2.46-2.34(m, 2H), 2.39(s, 3H), 2.37(s, 3H), 2.11(s, 3H), 1.84-1.75(m, 2H).

This appln is a 371 of PCT/JP99/01547 filed Mar. 26, 1999. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to novel compounds having an antiviral activity, in detail indole derivatives having an inhibitory activity against viral integrase, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them, especially anti-HIV drugs. BACKGROUND ART Among viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a kind of retrovirus, is known to cause acquired immunodleficiency syndrome (AIDS). The drug for treatment of AIDS is mainly selected from the group of reverse transcriptase inhibitors (AZT, 3TC, and the like) and protease inhibitors (Indinavir and the like), but they are proved to be accompanied by side effects such as nephropathy and the emergence of resistant virus. Thus, the development of anti-HIV drugs having the other mechanism of action has been desired. In the above circumstance, integrase has recently been thought to be noteworthy, which is an enzyme relating to the site-specific insertion of viral DNA into chromosome in animal cells, and the research for anti-HIV drugs based on said enzyme inhibition activity is performed ((1) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 61 (3), 1013-1020 (1968), KOURILSKY P et al.; (2) J. VIROL. METHODS (NETHERLANDS), 17/1-2(55-61) (1987), F Barin et al.; (3) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 2399 (1993), Fesen. MR (1993); (4) CDC AIDS Weekly Pagination:P2 (1990). DeNoon, D J). Some integrase inhibitors has recently been reported, for example, peptide derivatives described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,573, tetrahydronaphthyl derivatives described in GB 2306476A, and acrydone derivatives described in WO 97/38999. Additionally, in the literature, Khim. Geterotsikl. Soedin. 1973, (11), 1519, some kind of indole derivatives are described, but their therapeutic activity is not described. Moreover, in U.S. Pat. No. 5.475,109, non-condensed heterocyclic compounds substituted with dioxobutanoic acid are described to be useful as an anti influenza viral drug, whose mechanism of the action is the inhibition of cap-dependent endonuclease.

After the mixture was stirred for 5 hours at room temperature, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was acidified with 1 N hydrochloric acid and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, and then dried. The solvent was evaporated and the residue was recrystallized from ethyl acetate/ether to give 63 mg of the titled compound. Yield: 79%. m.p.: 245 C.

After coating each well of microtiter plates (obtained from NUNC) with 50 l of the above solution at 4 C. over night, each well was washed twice with PBS (composition: 13.7 mM NaCl, 0.27 mM KCl, 0.43 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 0.14 mM KH 2 PO 4 ) and blocked with 300 l of 1% skim milk in PBS for 30 min. Additionally, each well was washed twice with PBS and added 50 l of substrate DNA solution (2 pmol/l). The microtiter plates were kept at room temperature for 30 min. Then, each well was washed twice with PBS and once with H 2 O. Subsequently, in the each well prepared above were added 45 l of the reaction buffer prepared from 12 l of the buffer (composition: 150 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 75 mM MnCl 2 , 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 25% glycerol, 500 g/ml bovine serum albumin-fraction V), 1 l of target DNA, and 32 l of the distilled water. Additionally, 6 l of either a tkst compound in DMSO or DMSO for positive control(PC) was mixed with the above reaction buffer, then 9 l of integrase solution (30 pmol) was added and mixed well. In the well of negative control (NC) was added 9 l of integrase dilution buffer (composition: 20 mM MOPS (pH7.2), 400 mM potassium glutamete, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40, 20% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 4M urea). The microtiter plates were incubated at 30 C. for 1 hour. After incubation, the reaction solution was removed and each well was washed twice with PBS. Subsequently, each well of the microtiter plates was filled with 100 l of anti-(Ugoxigenin antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase (Lamb Fab fragment: obtained from Boehringer) and incubated at 30 C. for 1 hour. Then, each well was washed twice with 0.05% Tween20 in PBS and once with PBS. Next, 150 l of the Alkaline phosphatase reaction buffer (composition: 10 mM p-Nitrophenylphosphate (obtained from Vector Laboratories), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.5))was added in each well. The microtiter plates were incubatecl at 30 C. for 2 hours and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 l of 1 N NaOH solution. The optical density (OD) at 405 nm of each well was measured and the percent inhibition was determined by the following expression. The percent inhibition (%)1001( C abs. NC abs.)/( PC abs. NC abs.)

The compound of the present invention is useful as a medicament for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of MMP- or TNF-mediated diseases. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to new compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. More particularly, it relates to new compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which are useful as inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (hereinafter to be referred to as MMP) or the production of tumor necrosis factor (hereinafter to be referred to as TNF), to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same, to use of the same as medicaments, and to methods for using the same therapeutically in the treatment and/or the prevention of MMP- or TNF-mediated diseases. BACKGROUND ART Some piperazine compounds to be useful as metalloproteinase inhibitors, or the like are known (WO 97/20824, etc.). DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION One object of the present invention is to provide new and useful compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and to provide a process for preparing said new compound and salts thereof, which have pharmacological activities such as MMP- or TNF-inhibitory activity and the like. Another object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an active ingredient, said compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. A further object of the present invention is to provide use of said compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as medicaments for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of MMP- or TNF-mediated diseases. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a method for using the same for the treatment and/or the prevention of MMP- or TNF-mediated diseases in mammals, especially humans. The compounds of the present invention have inhibitory activity on MMP or the production of TNF, and are useful for the treatment and/or prevention of diseases such as stroke, arthritis, cancer, tissue ulceration, decubitus ulcer, restenosis, periodontal disease, epidermolysis bullosa, scleritis, psoriasis and other diseases characterized by matrix metalloproteinase activity, as well as AIDS, sepsis, septic shock and other diseases caused by the production of TNF. There are a number of structurally related metalloproteases which effect the breakdown of structural proteins. Matrix-degrading metalloproteases, such as gelatinase (MMP-2, MMP-9), stromelysin (MMP-3) and collagenase (MMP-1, MMP-8, MMP-13), are involved in tissue matrix degradation and have been implicated in many pathological conditions involving abnormal connective tissue and basement membrane matrix metabolism, such as arthritis (e.g., osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis), cerebral disease (e.g., stroke, etc.), tissue ulceration (e.g., corneal, epidermal and gastric ulcerations), abnormal wound healing, periodontal disease, bone disease (e.g., Pagets disease and osteoporosis), tumor metastasis or invasion and HIV-infection.

No. 09/484,638 filed Jan. 18, 2000 which claim benefit to provisional application 60/116,400 filed Jan. 19, 1999. TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to methods of treating certain cytokine mediated diseases or conditions using novel aromatic heterocyclic compounds of the formula(I) wherein Ar 1 , Ar 2 ,L,Q and X are described herein: BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) are important biological entities collectively referred to as proinflammatory cytokines. These, along with several other related molecules, mediate the inflammatory response associated with the immunological recognition of infectious agents. The inflammatory response plays an important role in limiting and controlling pathogenic infections. Elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines are also associated with a number of diseases of autoimmunity such as toxic shock syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease (Dinarello, C. A. et al., 1984, Rev. Infect. Disease 6:51). In these diseases, chronic elevation of inflammation exacerbates or causes much of the pathophysiology observed. For example, rheumatoid synovial tissue becomes invaded with inflammatory cells that result in destruction to cartilage and bone (Koch, A. E., et al., 1995, J. Invest. Med. 43: 28-38). An important and accepted therapeutic approach for potential drug intervention in these diseases is the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF (also referred to in its secreted cell-free form termed TNF) and IL-1. A number of anti-cytokine therapies are currently in clinical trials. Efficacy has been demonstrated with monoclonal antibody directed against TNF in a number of autoimmune diseases (Heath, P., CDP571: An Engineered Human IgG4 Anti-TNF Antibody IBC Meeting on Cytokine Antagonists, Philadelphia, Pa., April 24-5, 1997). These include the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis (Rankin E. C. C., et al., 1997, British J. Rheum. 35: 334-342 and Stack, W. A., et al. 1997, Lancet 349: 521-524). The monoclonal antibody is thought to function by binding to both soluble TNF and to membrane bound TNF. A soluble TNF receptor has been engineered that interacts with TNF. The approach is similar to that described above for monoclonal antibodies directed against TNF; both agents bind to soluble TNF, thus reducing its concentration. One version of this construct, called Enbrel (Immunex, Seattle, Wash.) recently demonstrated efficacy in a Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (Brower et al., 1997, Nature Biotechnology 15: 1240). Another version of the TNF receptor, Ro 45-2081 (Hoffman-LaRoche Inc., Nutley, N.J.) has demonstrated efficacy in various animal models of allergic lung inflammation and acute lung injury. Ro 45-2081 is a recombinant chimeric molecule constructed from the soluble 55 kDa human TNF receptor fused to the hinge region of the heavy chain IgG1 gene and expressed in eukaryotic cells (Renzetti, et al., 1997, Inflamm. Res. 46: S143). IL-1 has been implicated as an immunological effector molecule in a large number of disease processes. IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) had been examined in human clinical trials. Efficacy has been demonstrated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (Antril, Amgen). In a phase III human clinical trial IL-1ra reduced the mortality rate in patients with septic shock syndrome (Dinarello, 1995, Nutrution 11, 492). Osteoarthritis is a slow progressive disease characterized by destruction of the articular cartilage. IL-1 is detected in synovial fluid and in the cartilage matrix of osteoarthritic joints. Antagonists of IL-1 have been shown to diminish the degradation of cartilage matrix components in a variety of experimental models of arthritis (Chevalier, 1997, Biomed Pharmacother. 51, 58). Nitric oxide (NO) is a mediator of cardiovascular homeostatis, neurotransmission and immune function; recently it has been shown to have important effects in the modulation of bone remodeling. Cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF are potent stimulators of NO production. NO is an important regulatory molecule in bone with effects on cells of the osteoblast and osteoclast lineage (Evans, et al., 1996, J Bone Miner Res. 11, 300). The promotion of beta-cell destruction leading to insulin dependent diabetes mellitis shows dependence on IL-1. Some of this damage may be mediated through other effectors such as prostaglandins and thromboxanes. IL-1 can effect this process by controlling the level of both cyclooxygenase II and inducible nitric oxide synthetase expression (McDaniel et al., 1996, Proc Soc Exp Biol Med. 211, 24). Inhibitors of cytokine production are expected to block inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) expression. COX-2 expression has been shown to be increased by cytokines and it is believed to be the isoform of cyclooxygenase responsible for inflammation (M. K. OBanion et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1992, 89, 4888). Accordingly, inhibitors of cytokines such as IL-1 would be expected to exhibit efficacy against those disorders currently treated with COX inhibitors such as the familiar NSAIDs. These disorders include acute and chronic pain as well as symptoms of inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Elevation of several cytokines have been demonstrated during active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A mucosal imbalance of intestinal IL-1 and IL-1ra is present in patients with IBD. Insufficient production of endogenous IL-1ra may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD (Cominelli, et al., 1996, Ailment Pharmacol Ther. 10, 49). Alzheimer disease is characterized by the presence of beta-amyloid protein deposits, neurofibrillary tangles and cholinergic dysfunction throughout the hippocampal region. The structural and metabolic damage found in Alzheimer disease is possibly due to a sustained elevation of IL-1 (Holden, et al., 1995, Med Hypootheses 45, 559). A role for IL-1 in the pathogenic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been identified. IL-1ra showed a clear relationship to acute inflammatory events as well as to the different disease stages in the pathophysiology of HIV infection (Kreuzer, et al., 1997, Clin Exp Immunol. 109, 54). IL-1 and TNF are both involved in periodontal disease. The destructive process associated with periodontal disease may be due to a disregulation of both IL-1 and TNF (Howells, 1995, Oral Dis. 1, 266). Proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 are also important mediators of septic shock and associated cardiopulmonary dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure. TNF has also been implicated in cachexia and muscle degradation, associated with HIV infection (Lahdiverta et al., 1988, Amer. J. Med., 85, 289). Obesity is associated with an increase incidence of infection, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Abnormalities in TNF expression have been noted for each of the above conditions (Loffreda, et al., 1998, FASEB J. 12, 57). It has been proposed that elevated levels of TNF are involved in other eating related disorders such as anorexia and bulimia nervosa. Pathophysiological parallels are drawn between anorexia nervosa and cancer cachexia (Holden, et al., 1996, Med Hypotheses 47, 423). An inhibitor of TNF production, HU-211, was shown to improve the outcome of closed brain injury in an experimental model (Shohami, et al., 1997, J Neuroimmunol. 72, 169). Atherosclerosis is known to have an inflammatory component and cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF have been suggested to promote the disease. In an animal model an IL-1 receptor antagonist wash shown to inhibit fatty streak formation (Elhage et al., 1988, Circulation, 97, 242). The abnormal expression of inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) has been associated with hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (Chou et al., 1998, Hypertension, 31, 643). IL-1 has a role in the expression of iNOS and therefore may also have a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension (Singh et al., 1996, Amer. J. Hypertension 9, 867). IL-1 has also been shown to induce uveitis in rats which could be inhibited with IL-1 blockers. (Xuan et al., 1988, J. Ocular Pharmacol. and Ther., 14, 31). Cytokines including IL-1, TNF and GM-CSF have been shown to stimulate proliferation of acute myelogenous luekemia blasts (Bruserud, 1996, Leukemia Res. 20, 65). IL-1 was shown to be essential for the development of both irritant and allergic contact dermatitis. Epicutaneous sensitization can be prevented by the administration of an anti- IL-1 monoclonal antibody before epicutaneous application of an allergen (Muller, et al., 1996, Am J Contact Dermat. 7, 177). Data obtain from IL-1 knock out mice indicates the critical involvement in fever for this cytokine (Kluger et al., 1998, Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 25, 141). A variety of cytokines including TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 initiate the acute-phase reaction which is stereotyped in fever, malaise, myalgia, headaches, cellular hypermetabolism and multiple endocrine and enzyme responses (Beisel, 1995, Am J Clin Nutr. 62, 813). The production of these inflammatory cytokines rapidly follows trauma or pathogenic organism invasion. Other proinflammatory cytokines have been correlated with a variety of disease states. IL-8 correlates with influx of neutrophilis into sites of inflammation or injury. Blocking antibodies against IL-8 have demonstrated a role for IL-8 in the neutrophil associated tissue injury in acute inflammation (Harada et al., 1996, Molecular Medicine Today 2, 482). Therefore, an inhibitor of IL-8 production may be useful in the treatment of diseases mediated predominantly by neutrophils such as stroke and myocardial infarction, alone or following thrombolytic therapy, thermal injury, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ injury secondary to trauma, acute glomerulonephritis, dermatoses with acute inflammatory components, acute purulent meningitis or other central nervous system disorders, hermodialysis, leukopherisis, granulocyte transfusion associated syndromes, and necrotizing entrercolitis. Rhinovirus triggers the production of various proinflammatory cytokines, predominantly IL-8, which results in symptomatic illnesses such as acute rhinitis (Winther et al., 1998, Am J Rhinol 12, 17). Other diseases that are effected by IL-8 include mycardial ischemia and reperfusion, inflammtory bowel disease and many others. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been implicated with the acute phase response. IL-6 is a growth factor in a number in oncological diseases including multiple myeloma and realted plasma cell dyscrasias (Treon, et al., 1988, Current Opinion in Hematology 5:42). It has also been shown to be an important mediator of inflammation within the central nervous system. Elevated levels of IL-6 are found in several neurological disorders including AIDS dememtia complex, Alzheimers disease, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupis erythematosus, CNS trauma and viral and bacterial meningitis (Gruol, et al., 1997, Molecular Neurobiology 15: 307). IL-6 also plays a significant role in osteoporosis. In murine models it has been shown to effect bone resorption and to induce osteoclast activity (Ershler et al., 1997, Development and Comparative Immunol. 21:487). Marked cytokine differences, such as IL-6 levels, exist in vivo between osteoclasts of normal bone and bone from patients with Pagets disease (Mills, et al., 1997, Calcif Tissue Int. 61, 16). A number of cytokines have been shown to be involved in cancer cachexia. The severity of key parameters of cachexia can be reduced by treatment with anti IL-6 antibodies or with IL-6 receptor antagonists (Strassmann, et al., 1995, Cytokins Mol Ther. 1, 107). Several infectious diseases, such as influenza, indicate IL-6 and IFN alpha as key factors in both sympton formation and in host defense (Hayden, et al., 1998, J Clin Invest. 101, 643). Overexpression of IL-6 has been implicated in the pathology of a number of diseases including multiple myeloma, rheumatoid arthritis, Castlemans disease, psoriasis and post-menopausal osteoporosis (Simpson, et al., 1997, Protein Sci. 6, 929). Compounds that interfered with the production of cytokines including IL-6, and TNF were effective in blocking a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis in mice (Scholz et al., 1998, J. Med. Chem. 41, 1050). GM-CSF is another proinflammatory cytokine with relevance to a number of therapeutic diseases. It influences not only proliferation and differentiation of stem cells but also regulates several other cells involved in acute and chronic inflammation. Treatment with GM-CSF has been attempted in a number of disease states including burn-wound healing, skin-graft resolution as well as cytostatic and radiotherapy induced mucositis (Masucci, 1996, Medical Oncology 13: 149). GM-CSF also appears to play a role in the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in cells of macrophage lineage with relevance to AIDS therapy (Crowe et al., 1997, Journal of Leukocyte Biology 62, 41). Bronchial asthma is characterised by an inflammatory process in lungs. Involved cytokines include GM-CSF amongst others (Lee, 1998, J R Coll Physicians Lond 32, 56). Interferon (IFN ) has been implicated in a number of diseases. It has been associated with increased collagen deposition that is a central histopathological feature of graft-versus-host disease (Parkman, 1988, Curr Opin Hematol. 5, 22). Following kidney transplantation, a patient was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia. Retrospective analysis of peripheral blood cytokines revealed elevated levels of GM-CSF and IFN. These elevated levels coincided with a rise in peripheral blood white cell count (Burke, et al., 1995, Leuk Lymphoma. 19, 173). The development of insulin-dependent diabetes (Type 1) can be correlated with the accumulation in pancreatic islet cells of T-cells producing IFN (Ablumunits, et al., 1998, J Autoimmun. 11, 73). IFN along with TNF, IL-2 and IL-6 lead to the activation of most peripheral T-cells prior to the development of lesions in the central nervous system for diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and AIDS dementia complex (Martino et al., 1998, Ann Neurol. 43, 340). Atherosclerotic lesions result in arterial disease that can lead to cardiac and cerebral infarction. Many activated immune cells are present in these lesions, mainly T-cells and macrophages. These cells produce large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1 and IFN . These cytokines are thought to be involved in promoting apoptosis or programmed cell death of the surrounding vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in the atherosclerotic lesions (Geng, 1997, Heart Vessels Suppl 12, 76). Allergic subjects produce mRNA specific for IFN following challenge with Vespula venom (Bonay, et al., 1997, Clin Exp Immunol. 109, 342). The expression of a number of cytokines, including IFN has been shown to increase following a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction thus indicating a role for IFN in atopic dermatitis (Szepietowski, et al., 1997, Br J Dermatol, 137, 195). Histopathologic and immunohistologic studies were performed in cases of fatal cerebral malaria. Evidence for elevated IFN amongst other cytokines was observed indicating a role in this disease (Udomsangpetch et al., 1997, Am J Trop Med Hyg. 57, 501). The importance of free radical species in the pathogenesis of various infectious diseases has been established. The nitric oxide synthesis pathway is activated in response to infection with certain viruses via the induction of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN (Akaike, et al., 1998 Proc Soc Exp Biol Med. 217, 64). Patients, chronically infected with hepatitus B virus (HBV) can develop cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Viral gene expression and replication in HBV transgenic mice can be suppressed by a post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by IFN , TNF and IL-2 (Chisari, et al., 1995, Springer Semin Immunopathol. 17, 261). IFN can selectively inhibit cytokine induced bone resorption. It appears to do this via the intermediacy of nitric oxide (NO) which is an important regulatory molecule in bone remodeling. NO may be involved as a mediator of bone disease for such diseases as: the rheumatoid arthritis, tumor associated osteolysis and postmenopausal osteoporosis (Evans, et al., 1996, J Bone Miner Res. 11, 300). Studies with gene deficient mice have demonstrated that the IL-12 dependent production of IFN 65 is critical in the control of early parasitic growth. Although this process is independent of nitric oxide the control of chronic infection does appear to be NO dependent (Alexander et al., 1997, Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 352, 1355). NO is an important vasodilator and convincing evidence exits for its role in cardiovascular shock (Kilbourn, et al., 1997, Dis Mon. 43, 277). IFN is required for progression of chronic intestinal inflammation in such diseases as Crohns disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) presumably through the intermediacy of CD4 lymphocytes probably of the TH1 phenotype (Sartor 1996, Ailment Pharmacol Ther. 10 Suppl 2, 43). An elevated level of serum IgE is associated with various atopic disease such as bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis. The level of IFN was negatively correlated with serum IgE suggesting a role for IFN in atopic patients (Teramoto et al., 1998, Clin Exp Allergy 28, 74). Compounds which modulate release of one or more of the aforementioned inflammatory cytokines can be useful in treating diseases associated with release of these cytokines. For example, WO 98/52558 discloses heteroaryl urea compounds which are indicated to be useful in treating cytoline mediated diseases. U.S. Pat. No. 5,162,360 discloses N-substituted aryl-N-heterocyclic substituted urea compounds which are described as being useful for treating hypercholesterolemia and atheroclerosis. The work cited above supports the principle that inhibition of cytokine production will be beneficial in the treatment of various disease states. Some protein therapeutics in late development or have been approved for use in particular diseases. Protein therapeutics are costly to produce and have bioavailability and stability problems. Therefore a need exists for new small molecule inhibitors of cytokine production with optimized efficacy, pharmacokinetic and safety profiles.

The mixture is poured onto cold water and extracted with a non-protic solvent. The combined extracts are dried with agents such as MgSO 4 and Na 2 SO 4 . Removal of the volatiles provides the nitro-pyrrole which which may be carried forward without further purification or purified by recrystallization or silica gel chromatography. The nitro-pyrrole is reduced to the amine with iron in acetic acid or by catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on activated carbon. The aminopyrrole (XXVIII) may be carried forward without further purification or purified by recrystallization or silica gel chromatography. In an analogous fashion, a mixture of amine XXIX and 3-aryl-2,5-dioxoalkane (XXX) in acetic acid is heated between 80-110 C. for 2-24 hr. The reaction is diluted with water and extracted with an organic solvent. The combined extracts are dried with agents such as MgSo 4 or Na 2 SO 4 and the volatiles removed.

A mixture of substituted N-(3-aminothioacryloyl)-formamidine (XLI) and substituted bromide (XLII) in a protic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol, is heated, preferably at a reflux temperature, for 5-30 min and cooled below room temperature. The product thiophene-imine is filtered and dried. The thiophene-imine XLIII is converted to the thiophene-amine (XLIV) by treatment with aqueous acid. The synthesis of 1,4-disubstituted-2-aminopyrroles (XLVIII) may be accomplished in a manner analogous to Brodrick et al. ( J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I, 1975, 1910), and as illustrated in Scheme XII. The potassium salt of formylnitrile XLV in water is treated with amine XLVI and acetic acid and the mixture heated at 50-90 C. for 5-30 min. The aminonitrile XLVII is collected by filtration upon cooling and then is stirred at room temperature with a base such as ethanolic potassium ethoxide for 2-5 hr and the volatiles removed. The residue is diluted with water and extracted with an organic solvent. The combined extracts are dried with agents such as MgSO 4 and Na 2 SO 4 and the volatiles removed.

Chem. Soc., 1954, 616) describe an imidazo1,2-apyridin-2-yl amine (LXII). METHODS OF THERAPEUTIC USE The compounds of the invention effectively block inflammatory cytokine production from cells. The inhibition of cytokine production is an attractive means for preventing and treating a variety of disorders associated with excess cytokine production, e.g., diseases and pathological conditions involving inflammation. Thus, the compounds of the invention are useful for the treatment of such conditions. These encompass chronic inflammatory diseases including, but not limited to, osteoarthritis, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, graft versus host disease, systemic lupus erythematosus and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The compounds of the invention can also be used to treat other disorders associated with the activity of elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as responses to various infectious agents and a number of diseases of autoimmunity such as rheumatoid arthritis, toxic shock syndrome, diabetes and inflammatory bowel diseases unrelated to those listed above are discussed in the Background of the Invention. In addition, the compounds of the invention being inhibitors of cytokine production are expected to block inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) expression. COX-2 expression has been shown to be increased by cytokines and it is believed to be the isoform of cyclooxygenase responsible for inflammation (M. K. OBanion et al., Proc. Nalt. Acad. Sci. U.S.A, 1992, 89, 4888.) Accordingly, the present novel compounds would be expected to exhibit efficacy against those disorders currently treated with COX inhibitors such as the familiar NSAIDs. These disorders include acute and chronic pain as well as symptoms of inflammation and cardiovascular disease. As discussed in the Background of the Invention, IL-8 plays a role in the influx of neutrophils into sites of inflammation or injury. Therefore, in a yet further aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of diseases mediated predominantly be neutrophils such as stroke and myocardial infarction, alone or following thrombolytic therapy, thermal injury, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ injury secondary to trauma, acute glomerulonephritis, dermatoses with acute inflammatory components, acute purulent meningitis or other central nervous system disorders, hemodialysis, leukopherisis, granulocyte transfusion associated syndromes, and necrotizing entrerocolitis. For therapeutic use, the compounds of the invention may be administered in any conventional dosage form in any conventional manner. Routes of administration include, but are not limited to, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intrasynovially, by infusion, sublingually, transdermally, orally, topically or by inhalation. The preferred modes of administration are oral and intravenous. The compounds of this invention may be administered alone or in combination with adjuvants that enhance stability of the inhibitors, facilitate administration of pharmaceutic compositions containing them in certain embodiments, provide increased dissolution or dispersion, increase inhibitory activity, provide adjunct therapy, and the like, including other active ingredients. Advantageously, such combination therapies utilize lower dosages of the conventional therapeutics, thus avoiding possible toxicity and adverse side effects incurred when those agents are used as monotherapies. Compounds of the invention may be physically combined with the conventional therapeutics or other adjuvants into a single pharmaceutical composition. Advantageously, the compounds may then be administered together in a single dosage form. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions comprising such combinations of compounds contain at least about 5%, but more preferably at least about 20%, of a compound of formula (I) (w/w) or a combination thereof. The optimum percentage (w/w) of a compound of formula(I) may vary and is within the purview of those skilled in the art. Alternatively, the compounds may be administered separately (either serially or in parallel). Separate dosing allows for greater flexibility in the dosing regime. As mentioned above, dosage forms of the compounds of this invention include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and adjuvants known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These carriers and adjuvants include, for example, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, buffer substances, water, salts or electrolytes and cellulose-based substances. Preferred dosage forms include, tablet, capsule, caplet, liquid, solution, suspension, emulsion, lozenges, syrup, reconstitutable powder, granule, suppository and transdermal patch. Methods for preparing such dosage forms are known (see, for example, H. C. Ansel and N. G. Popovish, Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 5th ed., Lea and Febiger (1990)). Dosage levels and requirements are well-recognized in the art and may be selected by those of ordinary skill in the art from available methods and techniques suitable for a particular patient. In some embodiments, dosage levels range from about 10-1000 mg/dose for a 70 kg patient. Although one dose per day may be sufficient, up to 5 doses per day may be given. For oral doses, up to 2000 mg/day may be required. As the skilled artisan will appreciate, lower or higher doses may be required depending on particular factors. For instance, specific dosage and treatment regimens will depend on factors such as the patients general health profile, the severity and course of the patients disorder or disposition thereto, and the judgment of the treating physician.

All cells and reagents were diluted in RPMI 1640 with phenol red and L-glutamine, supplemented with additional L-glutamine (total: 4 mM), penicillin and streptomycin (50 units/ml each) and fetal bovine serum (FBS, 3%) (GIBCO, all conc. final). Assay was performed under sterile conditions; only test compound preparation was nonsterile. Initial stock solutions were made in DMSO followed by dilution into RPMI 1640 2-fold higher than the desired final assay concentration. Confluent THF.1 cells (210 6 cells/ml, final conc.; American Type Culture Company, Rockville, Md.) were added to 96 well polypropylene round bottomed culture plates (Costar 3790; sterile) containing 125 l test compound (2 fold concentrated) or DMSO vehicle (controls, blanks). DMSO concentration did not exceed 0.2% final. Cell mixture was allowed to preincubate for 30 min., 37 C., 5% CO 2 prior to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 g/ml final; Siga L-2630, from E. coli serotype 0111.B4; stored at 1 mg/ml stock in endotoxin screened distilled H 2 O at 80 C.). Blanks (unstimulated) received H 2 O vehicle; final incubation volume was 250 l. Overnight incubation (18-24 hr) proceeded as described above. Assay was terminated by centrifuging plates 5 min, room temperature, 1600 rpm (400 x g); supernatants were transferred to clean 96 well plates and stored 80 C. until analyzed for human TNF by a commercially available ELISA kit (Biosource KHC3015, Camarilo, Calif.). Date was analyzed by non-linear regression (Hill equation) to generate a dose response curve using SAS Software System (SAS institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.). The calculated IC50 value is the concentration of the test compound that caused a 50% decrease in the maximal TNF production. Representative compounds from the synthetic examples above and Table 1 were evaluated and all had IC 50 10 M in this assay. By similar methods using peripheral blood monocytic cells, appropriate stimuli, and commercially available ELISA kits for a particular cytokine, inhibition of IL-1, GM-CSF, IL-6 and IL-8 was demonstrated by representatives from the synthetic examples and Table 1.

The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/183,372 file Feb. 18, 2000. The present invention relates to the use of a compound of the general formula I for preparing a drug for treatment of MS (multiple sclerosis). MS is a chronic disease with its origin in the central nervous system (CNS) that often leads to severe consequences. MS can be mild with minor symptoms to severe paralysis and loss of vision. The diagnosis is most common between the ages of 20 to 40 and thereafter the disease continues the remaining life span. Sometimes MS develops rapidly, while in other cases the afflicted persons can live for many decades only with some disabilities. MS is more frequent at northern latitudes. Depending on region in the western world the prevalence varies with 50-150 cases per 100,000. In the US only, some 250,000-350,000 have the MS diagnosis. Females have a double risk, compared to males, to develop MS. It is generally accepted that the immune defense of a patient with MS attacks the CNS, while the exact mechanisms are unknown. Due to inflammation of the nerve isolation (myeline) there are dysfunctions and short-circuits of nerve fibers and thereby effects on the muscles controlled by these nerves. The treatment of MS is focused on the reduction of symptoms. To cure or stop the MS disease is not possible with todays knowledge. Consequently there does not exist any drug to cure or delay onset of the disease. Treatments used are: Transplantation of bone marrow and treatment of cytostatics and lifelong administration of immunosupressive drugs. This method could work for some patients but it is very expensive and includes several risks for the patient. Administration of cytostatics is still considered to be controversial in treatment of MS since the effects are unclear and potential side- effects are severe. There are two drugs used with the aim to cure or delay the MS disease; Interferon-beta (trademarks Avonex and Betaseron) can reduce the symptoms among certain groups of patients and is therefore administered to most patients for ethical reasons. The effect is unclear for the population of MS patients and it is a very expensive treatment. Glatiramer acetate (trademark Copaxone) can for some patients reduce the frequence of attacks, but the side effects are substantial and there is a problem to distinguish the symptoms of the MS disease and side effects. Today there does not exist an effective treatment for MS. The treatment is focused on reducing symptoms. Tests with transplantation and different drug treatments to cure the disease have so far not shown any solutions. It can work for some patients, although there are risks, side effects and very high costs involved. MS is a rather common disease that appears early in life. In addition it is a life long disease with severe symptoms. The demand for drugs that can protect the MS patients for the severe development of the disease is therefore of high priority. According to the present invention it has surprisingly been found that a substituted indolo-quinoxaline of the following general formula I can be used for preparing a drug for treatment of MS. The compound which according to the present invention is to be used for preparing a drug for treatment of MS is a compound of the following general formula I wherein R 1 represents hydrogen or one or several, preferably 1 to 4, similar or different substituents in the positions 1-4 and/or 7-10, selected from halogen, preferably Br, lower alkyl/alkoxy group having not more than 4 carbon atoms, trifluoromethyl group, trichloromethyl group; and in one of the positions 7-10 R 1 can be a hydroxyl group; X is a group (CH 2 ) n R 2 , wherein R 2 represents a nitrogen containing basic residue such as NH 2 , NHR 4 or NR 5 R 6 , wherein R 4 , R 5 and R 6 independently are lower alkyl or cycloalkyl and n is an integer of from 1 to 4 and R 3 represents hydrogen, lower alkyl/cycloalkyl group having not more than 4 carbon atoms, and the physiologically acceptable addition products of the compounds with acids and halogen adducts, preferably adducts with iodine, iodine monochloride or iodine monobromide. R 1 is preferably selected from hydrogen and lower alkyl groups, especially methyl. More preferably R 1 is methyl in positions 2 and 3 and hydrogen in the other positions. Suitable compounds are such compounds wherein R 1 is hydroxy in one of the positions 7-10, especially in position 9. The compounds used according to the present invention and their preparation are described in EP patent 0238459 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,990,510 which are incorporated herein by reference. A compound which has proven to be especially effective is the compound of the following formula II BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows the results obtained in an EAE model test. FIG. 2 shows the results obtained in an EAE rat model test with different doses of a compound used according to the present invention. FIG. 3 shows the effect of pre-treatment with a compound used according to the present invention. FIG. 4 shows the effect of after-treatment with a compound used according to the present invention. The EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) model is a generally accepted animal model for the acute MS symptoms ((1)Ruuls et al, J. Immunology, 1996, 157, 5721-5731; (2)van der Medide et al, J. Neuroimmunology, 1998, 84, 14-23; (3)Smith et al, Nature Medicine,2000, 6, 1, 62-66). The model is based on Lewis rats that day 0 are induced by 20 g myeline peptide (MBP 68-86) och 2 mg of Myobacterium tuberculosis. After one week severe CNS symptoms appear that are by double blind examination given a valuea clinical score. The higher value, the more severe effect. The scale is 0-5. After some 14 days there is a peak in symptoms followed by a decline back to the normal situation. The negative control has no treatment except the immunization (day 0) to induce the acute MS response. In FIG. 1 the results from the negative control, Interferon-beta and a compound used according to the present invention, 2,3-dimethyl(dimethylaminoethyl)-5H-indolo-(2,3-b)quinoxaline, (B-220) are shown. From the figure it can be seen that Interferon-beta has no reducing effect of the CNS symptoms The lower curve represents the tested substance used according to the present invention, which substance surprisingly and unexpectedly reduces the CNS symptoms with 2/3. In the test Interferon-beta was administered daily with 310 5 U/animal which is a medium dose (2). The tested substance(B-220), was administered daily with 6 mg/animal, a dose that can be increased since the margin to toxic effects is wide and most likely further reduce the symptoms. It is to be noted that the acute toxicity of the tested substance used according to the present invention is low, which is exemplified with the following: LD 50 , oral, rat; 800 mg/kg bw LD 50 , intravenous, rat; 100 mg/kg bw NOEL, intravenous, rat; 12.5 mg/kg bw NOEL, cutaneous, rabbit; 200 mg/kg bw (NOELNo Observable Effect Level) The chronic toxicity has been tested up to 270 days on mice and the substance has not induced toxicity, on the contrary the substance has protected the animals for different health effects. In the well established EAE rat model for multiple sclerosis (MS) a compound used according to the present invention, B-220, was shown to down-regulate the clinical symptoms (clinical score) in a dose dependent manner. The results are shown in FIG. 2 . At the highest dose, 12 mg/animal, (lower curve) the onset is delayed approximate 4 days, the recovery starts approximate 3 days earlier and the total effect is dramatically lowered. A majority of the animals do not show any symptoms at all in this group. Symptom grading 1 is thus a very weak and mild effect while grading 3 is a severe paralysis. The intermediate curve illustrates a dose of 6 mg/animal and the onset is delayed approximate 2 days, the recovery starts approximate 2 days earlier and the total effect is substantially lower as compared to the control, highest curve, where no B-220 is added. In FIG. 3 pre-treatment with B-220 before the onset of the disease is shown. The highest curve is illustrating the control without any added B-220 while the lower curve is after administration of B-220 of 6 mg/animal. As seen from the Figure the pre-treatment results in a clear lowered and delayed MS effect. Administration of B-220 was from 7 to 7 days in relation to the onset of disease (day 0). In FIG. 4 after-treatment with B-220 starting from day 7 from the time point when the disease was initiated (day 0) and throughout the experiment is shown wherein the highest curve is a control without any addition of B-220 and the lower curve is representing a dose of 6 mg/animal of B-220. As seen from the Figure the after-treatment with B-220 lowered the MS effect in the rats. The vertical lines in both FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 represent meanstandard deviation. A suitable dosage range for humans is 1 to 50 mg/kg body weight. What is claimed is: 1.

This application is a divisional of Ser. No. 09/298,952 filed Apr. 26, 1999. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel and known benzoxazole derivatives, more particularly to a serotonin5-HT 3 receptor antagonist or a serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor partial activator, which has been developed on the basis of the effective and selective action of said derivatives upon serotonin 5-HT 3 receptors that are distributed in smooth muscles such as of digestive organs and the like and in central nervous system, intestinal nervous system and the like. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It has been revealed that serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists can inhibit nausea and emesis as side effects caused by the use of cisplatin and the like carcinostatic agents and by radiation treatments, and several compounds thereof are now used in the clinical field. In addition to this, development on their use as digestive organ function controlling drugs has recently been examined. The inventors of the present invention have already found that certain benzoxazole derivatives are possessed of serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor antagonism (JP-A-6-345744; the term JP-A as used herein means an unexamined published Japanese patent application). When a compound having only serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor antagonism is administered as a digestive organ function controlling drug, it can inhibit diarrhea but poses a problem of frequently causing constipation as a side effect. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the above, it therefore becomes an object of the present invention to provide a serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor partial activator which is possessed of not only serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor antagonism but also serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor activating action and is useful in getting rid of constipation side effect. Using an evaluation test system in which serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor antagonizing and activating actions are judged by a guinea pig excised ileum contraction action which can be used as an index of the serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor activating action upon digestive organs, the inventors of the present invention have found that certain compounds among the benzoxazole derivatives disclosed in JP-A-345744 are possessed of serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor partial activity. As a result of subsequent synthesis and evaluation studies, it was found that certain novel or known benzoxazole derivatives are possessed of not only serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor antagonism but also serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor activating action and are useful as strong serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor partial activators. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of these findings. Accordingly, the gist of the present invention resides in the compounds of the following formulae (1) to (3): wherein R 1 to R 4 may be the same or different from one another and each represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkenyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted amino group, or optional two groups of R 1 to R 4 may be linked together to form a ring structure which is a 5- or 6-membered ring composed of carbon atoms alone or carbon atoms and 1 to 2 hetero atoms, selected from a cyclohexane ring, a benzene ring, a pyridine ring, a piperidine ring and a pyrrolidine ring; and Y represents a saturated or unsaturated, substituted or unsubstituted 4- to 8-membered hetero ring containing 1 to 3 nitrogen atoms as the ring constituting atoms and carbon atoms as the remaining atoms, which is selected from the group consisting of an azetidine ring, a pyrrolidine ring, a piperidine ring, a pyridine ring, an imidazole ring, a pyrazinyl ring, a pyridazinyl ring, a triazole ring, a homopiperidine ring, a 1,4-diazacyclooctanyl ring and a 1,5-diazacyclooctanyl ring; wherein R 1 to R 4 may be the same or different from one another and each represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkenyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted amino group, or two groups of R 1 and R 2 may be linked together to form a ring structure, namely a benzene ring, with the proviso that compounds in which all of R 1 to R 4 are hydrogen atoms are excluded; R 5 represents a hydrogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkenyl group; and m is an integer of 1 to 4; and wherein R 1 to R 4 may be the same or different from one another and each represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkenyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted amino group, or two groups of R 1 and R 2 may be linked together to form a ring structure, namely a benzene ring, with the proviso that compounds in which all of R 1 to R 4 are hydrogen atoms are excluded; R 5 and R 6 may be the same or different from each other and each represents a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkenyl group; m is an integer of 1 to 4; and X represents a halogen ion.

Test Example 2 5-HT 3 Receptor Activating Action Test Of the novel and known benzoxazole compounds according to the present invention, typical compounds and the compounds disclosed in JP-A-6-345744, namely 5-methoxy-2-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)benzoxazole (A) and 2-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)naphtho2,3-doxazole (B), were measured for their serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor antagonism and serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor activating action by the following method, with the results shown in Table 1. Test compounds of the present invention are shown by the Inventive Example numbers. Longitudinal muscle samples of about 20 mm were prepared from the ileum of Hartley male guinea pigs (500 to 800 g). Each of the thus prepared samples was hung down in a Magnus tube with a resting tension of about 0.5 g to measure the isometric contraction reaction. Serotonin 5-HT was applied with a concentration of from 0.1 to 30 M to the sample which has been subjected twice in advance to 1 hour of treatment with 0.3 M serotonin 5-HT to effect desensitization of serotonin 5-HT 4 receptor. When the concentration-dependent contraction reaction mediated by the serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor was observed in this manner, the maximum reaction was found at 10 M. The i.a. value was expressed as the ratio of the maximum reaction of each compound when the maximum contraction reaction obtained by 10 M of serotonin 5-HT was defined as 1. The pD 2 value was expressed as the negative logarithmic value of concentration (molar concentration) by which 50% of the maximum contraction reaction of each test compound can be obtained. Also, antagonism of each test compound against the serotonin 5-HT 3 receptor was calculated as the inhibition ratio of the contraction obtained by applying 10 M of serotonin 5-HT (manufactured by Sigma) to a sample which has been treated with 10 mM of each test sample to the contraction obtained by applying 10 M of serotonin 5-HT to the sample before treatment.

Field of the Invention This invention relates to 6-(4-arylalkylpiperazin-1-yl)benzodioxanes and 6-(4-arylalkylpiperazin-1-yl)chromanes and pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds. It also relates to the use of such compounds in the treatment or prevention of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and other central nervous system diseases. 2. Description of the Related Art The therapeutic effect of conventional antipsychotics, known as neuroleptics, is generally believed to be exerted through blockade of dopamine receptors. However, neuroleptics are frequently responsible for undesirable extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) and tardive dyskinesias, which are attributed to blockade of D 2 receptors in the striatal region of the brain. The dopamine D 4 receptor subtype has recently been identified (Nature, 350: 610 (Van Tol et al., 1991); Nature, 347: 146 (Sokoloff et al., 1990)). Its unique localization in limbic brain areas and its differential recognition of various antipsychot:ics indicates that the D 4 receptor plays a major role in the etiology of schizophrenia. Selective D 4 antagonists are considered effective antipsychotics free from the neurological side effects displayed by conventional neuroleptics. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention provides novel compounds of Formula I which interact with dopamine subtypes. Accordingly, a broad embodiment of the invention is directed to a compound of Formula I: or pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts thereof wherein: A is C 1 -C 4 alkylene optionally substituted with C 1 -C 2 alkyl; R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 and R 5 independently represent hydrogen, halogen, C 1 -C 6 alkyl, C 1 -C 6 alkoxy, C 1 -C 6 alkylthio, hydroxy, amino, mono- or di(C 1 -C 6 )alkylamino, cyano, nitro, perfluoroalkyl or perfluoroalkoxy; and R 6 , R 7 , R 8 , and R 9 independently represent hydrogen or C 1 -C 6 alkyl; and X is oxygen, a bond, C 1 -C 2 alkylene, or methyleneoxy. Dopamine D 4 receptors are concentrated in the limbic system (Science, 265: 1034 (Taubes, 1994)) which controls cognition and emotion. Therefore, compounds that interact with these receptors are useful in the treatment of cognitive disorders. Such disorders include cognitive deficits which are a significant component of the negative symptoms (social withdrawal and unresponsiveness) of schizophrenia. Other disorders include those involving memory impairment or attention deficit disorders. Compounds of the present invention demonstrate high affinity and selectivity in binding to the D 4 receptor subtype. These compounds are therefore useful in treatment of a variety of neuropsychological disorders, such as, for example, schizophrenia, psychotic depression and mania. Other dopamine-mediated diseases such as Parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesias can also be treated directly or indirectly by modulation of D 4 receptors. Compounds of this invention are also useful in the treatment of depression, memory-impairment or Alzheimers disease by modulation of D 4 receptors since they exist selectively in areas known to control emotion and cognitive functions. Thus, in another aspect, the invention provides methods for treatment and/or prevention of neuropsychochological or affective disorders including, for example, schizophrenia, mania, dementia, depression, anxiety, compulsive behavior, substance abuse, memory impairment, cognitive deficits, Parkinson-like motor disorders, e.g., Parkinsonism and dystonia, and motion disorders related to the use of neuroleptic agents. In addition, the compounds of the invention are useful in treatment of depression, memory-impairment or Alzheimers disease. Further, the compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment of other disorders that respond to dopaminergic blockade, e.g., substance abuse and obsessive compulsive disorder. These compounds are also useful in treating the extrapyramidal side effects associated with the use of conventional neuroleptic agents. In yet another aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds of Formula I. In another aspect, the invention provides intermediates useful in the preparation of compounds of Formula I.

The sterile injectable preparation may also be sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parentally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringers solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono-or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. The compounds of general formula I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. Compounds of general formula I may be administered parenterally in a sterile medium. The drug, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants such as local anesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. Dosage levels of the order of from about 0.1 mg to about 140 mg per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions (about 0.5 mg to about 7 g per patient per day). The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.

The leaving group (Z) on alkylating agent V may be a halide, sulphonate ester or the like. Where they are not commercially available, the compounds of general structure V may be prepared by procedures analogous to those described in literature. The compounds of general structure V are either known or capable of being prepared by the methods known in the art. Those having skill in the art will recognize that the starting material may be varied and additional steps employed to produce compounds encompassed by the present invention.

The following processes are illustrative of the general synthetic procedures which may be adopted in order to obtain the compounds of the invention: 1. Compounds of formulae IA and IB may be prepared by cyclization of corresponding compounds of formulae IIA and IIB, respectively: wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 and A are as defined previously for compounds of formulae IA and IB. This cyclization may be accomplished under basic, neutral or acidic conditions using known methods for pyrimidone ring formation. Preferably, the cyclization is performed under basic conditions using an alkali metal salt of an alcohol or amine, such as potassium tert-butoxide or potassium bis(trimethylsilyl) amide, in the presence of a suitable solvent is (e.g. an alcohol), for example at elevated (e.g. reflux) temperature (or, if a sealed vessel is employed, at above reflux temperature). The skilled person will appreciate that, when an alcohol is selected as solvent, an appropriate alcohol of formula R 3 OH, or a sterically hindered alcohol, e.g. iso-propanol or 3-methyl pentan-3-ol, may be used if it is intended to mitigate alkoxide exchange at either the 2-position of the pyridin-3-yl, or the phenyl, substituent. Compounds of formulae IIA and IIB may be prepared by reaction of corresponding compounds of formulae IIIA and IIIB, respectively: wherein R 1 and l 2 are as defined previously for compounds of formulae IIA and IIB, with a compound of formula IV or a carboxylic acid derivative thereof: wherein R 3 , R 4 and A are as defined previously for compounds of formulae IIA and IIB. This coupling reaction may be achieved by conventional amide bond forming techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, an acyl halide (e.g. chloride) derivative of a compound of formula IV may be reacted with a compound of formula IIIA or IIIB in the presence of an excess of a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine or pyridine, optionally in the presence of a suitable catalyst, such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine, in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane, at a temperature of about 0 C. to room temperature. A variety of other amino acid coupling methodologies may be used to couple the compound of formula IIIA or IIIB with the compound of formula IV. For example, the acid of formula IV or a suitable salt thereof (e.g. sodium salt) may be activated with an appropriate activating reagent, e.g. a carbodiimide, such as 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride optionally in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate and/or a catalyst such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine; a halotrisaminophosphonium salt such as bromotris(pyrrolidino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate; or a suitable pyridinium salt such as 2-chlorol-1-methyl pyridinium chloride. Either type of coupling reaction may be conducted in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran, optionally in the presence of a tertiary amine such as N-methylmorpholine or N-ethyldiisopropylamine (for example when either the compound of formula IIIA or IIIB, or the activating agent is presented in the form of an acid addition salt), at from about 0 C. to about room temperature. Preferably, from about 1 to 2 molecular equivalents of the activating reagent and from 1 to 3 molecular equivalents of any tertiary amine present may be employed. Alternatively, the carboxylic acid function of IV may be activated using an excess of a reagent such as N,N-carbonyldiimidazole in an appropriate solvent, e.g. ethyl acetate, dichloromethane or butan-2-one, at from about room temperature to about 80 C., followed by reaction of the intermediate imidazolide with a compound of the formula IIIA or IIIB at from about 20 C. to about 90 C. In a further variation, a compound of formula IA or IB in which A is CH may be formed in a one-pot procedure by coupling a compound of formula IIIA or IIIB with an acyl chloride derivative of a compound of formula IV and by cyclising the resultant intermediate compound of formula IIA or IIB, using the methods as described previously. The one-pot procedure may further involve an in-situ coupling and cyclization reaction to form a compound of formula IA or IB. Preferably, pyridine may serve as an acid scavenger and as the solvent for the in-situ coupling and cyclization reaction. 2.

This reduction may be performed under a variety of reaction conditions, for example by catalytic hydrogenation (e.g. using 10% Pd/C in an alcohol, such as ethanol, at 60 psi (415 kpa) H 2 pressure and room temperature) or by transition metal catalyzed reduction (e.g. at around room temperature in the presence of iron powder (e.g. 7 eq.) in acetic acid, or TiCl 3 (e.g. 9 eq.) in acetic acid).

The skilled person will appreciate that compounds of formulae IA and IB in which R 2 represents lower alkyl that is branched, but not unsaturated, at the carbon atom that is attached to the rest of the molecule may be prepared by in this way, provided that the corresponding compound of formula IA or IB in which the corresponding R 2 group is unsaturated is subsequently hydrogenated under conditions known to those skilled in the art. Compounds of formulae XXIIA and XXIIB may be prepared by cyclization of corresponding compounds of formulae XXIVA and XXIVB, respectively: in which R 1 , R 3 , R 4 , A and Hal are as hereinbefore defined, for example under analogous reaction conditions to those described hereinbefore for compounds of formulae IIA and IIB. Compounds of formulae XXIVA and XXIVB may be prepared analogously to methods described herein, for example coupling of a compound of formula IV, as hereinbefore defined, to an appropriate 4-amino-3-halopyrazole-5-carboxamide, which pyrazole compound may, in turn, be prepared by halogenation of a corresponding 4-aminopyrazole-5-carboxamide, under conditions which are well known to those skilled in the art. Compounds of formulae XXIIA and XXIIB may alternatively be prepared from corresponding compounds of formulae XXVA and XXVB, respectively: wherein A, Hal, R 1 and R 3 are as hereinbefore defined, for example as described hereinbefore for preparation of compounds of formulae IA and IB from compounds of formulae XA and XB (see process 4 above). Compounds of formulae XXVA and XXVB may be prepared via routine techniques (for example for compounds of formulae XXVA and XXVB in which A represents N, reduction of corresponding nitropyridine compounds of formulae XIIID and XIIIE as defined herein, respectively, for example as described herein). 7. Compounds of formulae IA and IB in which R 2 represents N(H)C(O)R 12 may be prepared by acylation of a corresponding compound of formula IA or IB in which R 2 represents NH 2, using a compound of formula XXVI, L 1 C(O)R 12 XXVI in which L 1 and R 12 are as hereinbefore defined under conditions that are known to those skilled in the art. 8. Compounds of formulae IA and IB in which R 2 represents NR 12 R 13 in which one of R 12 and R 13 does not represent H may be prepared by alkylation of a corresponding compound of formula IA or IB in which R 2 represents NH 2 using an appropriate alkylating agent under conditions that are known to those skilled in the art. 9. Compounds of formulae IA and IB in which R 2 represents NR 12 R 13 in which one of R 12 and R 13 does not represent H may be prepared by reductive amination from a compound of formula IA or IB in which R 2 represents NH 2 , using an appropriate carbonyl compound under conditions that are known to those skilled in the art. 10. Compounds of formulae IA and IB in which R 2 represents NH 2 may be prepared by reduction of corresponding compounds of formulae XXVIIA or XXVIIB, respectively: wherein A, R 1 , R 3 and R 4 are as hereinbefore defined under conditions is that are well known to those skilled in the art. Compounds of formulae XXVIIA and XXVIIB may be prepared by nitration of corresponding compounds of formulae XXVIIIA or XXVIIIB, respectively: wherein A, R 1 , R 3 and R 4 are as hereinbefore defined, using conventional techniques. For example, nitration may be performed at or around room temperature using 1.5 to 3 eq. of ammonium nitrate in the presence of trifluoroacetic anhydride. Compounds of formulae XXVIIIA and XXVIIIB may be prepared analogously to methods described herein in respect of the preparation of compounds of formulae IA and IB. Compounds of formulae IIA and IIIB, IV, VIIA and VIIB, IX, XIII, XIIIF and XIIIG, XVA and XVB, XVIIA and XVIB, XVIII, XXA and XXB, XXIA and XXIB and XXVI, and compounds of formulae HNR 12 R 13 , R 2a M, R 1 L 1 and R 1 OH, and derivatives thereof, when not commercially available or not subsequently described, may be obtained either by analogy with the processes described hereinbefore, or by conventional synthetic procedures, in accordance with standard techniques, from readily available starting materials using appropriate reagents and reaction conditions. Substituents on aryl and Het/Het 1 groups in the above-mentioned compounds may be introduced, removed and interconverted, using techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, compounds of formulae IA and IB as described hereinbefore, in which R 1 represents an aryl or alkylaryl group, may be prepared by dehalogenating corresponding compounds of formula IA or IB, in which R 1 represents an aryl or alkylaryl substituted with a halo group, such as a bromo or iodo. The reaction may be performed using methods which are well known to those skilled in the art, for example using a suitable palladium catalyst, such as palladium (0) tetrakis(triphenyl)phosphine, a suitable hydrogen donor (e.g. sodium formate), and a suitable base (e.g. triethylamine), in a suitable solvent (e.g. acetonitrile and/or dimethylsulphoxide). The skilled person will also appreciate that various standard substituent or functional group interconversions and transformations within certain compounds of formulae IA and IB will provide other compounds of formulae IA and IB. For example, alkoxide exchange at the 2-position of the 5-phenyl and the pyridin-3-yl substituents. Moreover, certain compounds of formulae IA and IB, for example those in which R 14 and R 15 , together with the nitrogen to which they are attached, form a 4-R 16 -piperazinyl group, in which R 16 does not represent H, may be prepared directly from the corresponding piperazine analogues in which R 16 represents H, using standard procedures (e.g. alkylation). The compounds of the invention may be isolated from their reaction mixtures using conventional techniques. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, in the course of carrying out the processes described above, the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by protecting groups. Functional groups which it is desirable to protect include hydroxy, amino and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl and diarylalkylsilyl groups (e.g. tert-butyldimethylsilyl, tert-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl) and tetrahydropyranyl. Suitable protecting groups for amino include tert-butyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include C 1-6 alkyl or benzyl esters. The protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or after any of the reaction steps described hereinbefore. Protecting groups may be removed in accordance with techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art. The use of protecting groups is fully described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, edited by J W F McOmie, Plenum Press (1973), and Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2 nd edition, T W Greene P G M Wutz, Wiley-Interscience (1991). Persons skilled in the art will also appreciate that, in order to obtain compounds of formula I in an alternative, and, on some occasions, more convenient, manner, the individual process steps mentioned hereinbefore may be performed in a different order, and/or the individual reactions may be performed at a different stage in the overall route (i.e. substituents may be added to and/or chemical transformations performed upon, different intermediates to those mentioned hereinbefore in conjunction with a particular reaction). This will depend inter alia on factors such as the nature of other functional groups present in a particular substrate, the availability of key intermediates and the protecting group strategy (if any) to be adopted. Clearly, the type of chemistry involved will influence the choice of reagent that is used in the said synthetic steps, the need, and type, of protecting groups that are employed, and the sequence for accomplishing the synthesis. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of formulae IA and IB which contain a basic centre may be prepared in a conventional manner. For example, a solution of the free base may be treated with the appropriate acid, either neat or in a suitable solvent, and the resulting salt may then be isolated either by filtration or by evaporation under vacuum of the reaction solvent. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be obtained in an analogous manner by treating a solution of a compound of formula IA or IB with the appropriate base. Both types of salt may be formed or interconverted using ion-exchange resin techniques. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that certain protected derivatives of compounds of formula I, which may be made prior to a final deprotection stage, may not possess pharmacological activity as such, but may, in certain instances, be administered orally or parenterally and thereafter metabolised in the body to form compounds of the invention which are pharmacologically active. Such derivatives may therefore be described as prodrugs. Further, certain compounds of formula I may act as prodrugs of other compounds of formula I. All protected derivatives, and prodrugs, of compounds of formula I are included within the scope of the invention. Medical Use The compounds of the invention are useful because they possess pharmacological activity in animals, especially mammals, including humans. They are therefore indicated as pharmaceuticals, as well as for use as animal medicaments. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided the compounds of the invention for use as pharmaceuticals, and for use as animal medicaments. In particular, compounds of the invention have been found to be potent and selective inhibitors of cGMP PDEs, such as cGMP PDE5, for example as demonstrated in the tests described below, and are thus useful in the treatment of medical conditions in humans, and in animals, in which cGMP PDEs, such as cGMP PDE5, are indicated, and in which inhibition of cGMP PDEs, such as cGMP PDE5, is desirable. By the term treatment, we include both therapeutic (curative) or prophylactic treatment. Thus, according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided the use of the compounds of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a medical condition in which a cGMP PDE (e.g. cGMP PDE5) is indicated. There is furter provided the use of the compounds of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a medical condition in which inhibition of a cGMP PDE (e.g. cGMP PDE5) is desirable. The compounds of the invention are thus expected to be useful for the curative or prophylactic treatment of male erectile dysfunction (MED), female sexual dysfunction (FSD), premature labor, dysmenorrhoea, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), bladder outlet obstruction, incontinence, stable and unstable variant (Prinzmetal) angina, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, conditions of reduced blood vessel patency (e.g. post transluminal coronary angioplasty (post-PTCA)), chronic asthma, bronchitis, allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, glaucoma and diseases characterised by disorders of gut motility (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)). Other conditions which may be mentioned include pre-eclampsia, Kawasakis syndrome, nitrate tolerance, multiple sclerosis, peripheral diabetic neuropathy, stroke, Alzheimers disease, acute respiratory failure, psoriasis, skin necrosis, cancer metastasis, baldness, nutcracker oesophagus, anal fissure and hypoxic vasoconstriction. Particularly preferred conditions include MED and FSD. Thus the invention provides a method of treating or preventing a medical condition for which a cGMP PDE5 inhibitor is indicated, in an animal (e.g. a mammal, including a human being), which comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention to a mammal in need of such treatment. Pharmaceutical Preparations The compounds of the invention will normally be administered orally or by any parenteral route, in the form of pharmaceutical preparations comprising the active ingredient, optionally in the form of a non-toxic organic, or inorganic, acid, or base, addition salt, in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form. Depending upon the disorder and patient to be treated, as well as the route of administration, the compositions may be administered at varying doses. The compounds of the invention may also be combined with any other drugs useful in the inhibition of cGMP-PDEs, such as cGMP-PDE5. In human therapy, the compounds of the invention can be administered alone but will generally be administered in admixture with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient diluent or carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. For example, the compounds of the invention can be administered orally, buccally or sublingually in the form of tablets, capsules, ovules, elixirs, solutions or suspensions, which may contain flavouring or colouring agents, for immediate-, delayed- or controlled-release applications. The compounds of invention may also be administered via intracavernosal injection. Such tablets may contain excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dibasic calcium phosphate and glycine, disintegrants such as starch (preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch), sodium starch glycollate, croscarmellose sodium and certain complex silicates, and granulation binders such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl behenate and talc may be included. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules. Preferred excipients in this regard include lactose, starch, a cellulose, milk sugar or high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. For aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs, the compounds of the invention may be combined with various sweetening or flavouring agents, colouring matter or dyes, with emulsifying and/or suspending agents and with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol and glycerin, and combinations thereof. The compounds of the invention can also be administered parenterally, for example, intravenously, intra-arterially, intraperitoneally, intrathecally, intraventricularly, intrasternally, intracranially, intramuscularly or subcutaneously, or they may be administered by infusion techniques. They are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), if necessary. The preparation of suitable parenteral formulations under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well-known to those skilled in the art. For oral and parenteral administration to human patients, the daily dosage level of the compounds of the invention will usually be from 10 to 500 mg/kg (in single or divided doses). Thus, for example, the tablets or capsules of the compound of the invention may contain from 5 mg to 250 mg of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a time, as appropriate. The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for any individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited and such are within the scope of this invention. The compounds of the invention can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation and are conveniently delivered in the form of a dry powder inhaler or an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurised container, pump, spray or nebuliser with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluorometane, dichlorotetrafluoro-ethane, a hydrofluoroalkane such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134A or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFA 227EA), carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurised aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The pressurised container, pump, spray or nebuliser may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound, e.g. using a mixture of ethanol and the propellant as the solvent, which may additionally contain a lubricant, e.g. sorbitan trioleate. Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. Aerosol or dry powder formulations are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or puff contains from 1 to 50 mg of a compound of the invention for delivery to the patient. The overall daily dose with an aerosol will be in the range of from 1 to 50 mg, which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, in divided doses throughout the day. Alternatively, the compounds of the invention can be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. The compounds of the invention may also be transdermally administered, for example, by the use of a skin patch. They may also be administered by the ocular route, particularly for treating diseases of the eye. For ophthalmic use, the compounds of the invention can be formulated as micronised suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, optionally in combination with a preservative such as a benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, they may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum. For application topically to the skin, the compounds of the invention can be formulated as a suitable ointment containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture with one or more of the following: mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, they can be formulated as a suitable lotion or cream, suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture of one or more of the following: mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, a polyethylene glycol, liquid paraffin, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. The skilled person will also appreciate that, in the treatment of certain conditions (including MED and FSD), compounds of the invention may be taken as a single dose on an as required basis (i.e. as needed or desired). Generally, in humans, oral administration of the compounds of the invention is the preferred route, being the most convenient and, for example in MED, in avoiding the well-known disadvantages associated with intracavernosal (i.c.) administration A preferred oral dosing regimen in MED for a typical man is from 25 to 250 mg of compound when required. In circumstances where the recipient suffers from a swallowing disorder or from impairment of drug absorption after oral administration, the drug may be administered parenterally, e.g. sublingually or bucally. For veterinary use, a compound of the invention is administered as a suitably acceptable formulation in accordance with normal veterinary practice and the veterinary surgeon will determine the dosing regimen and route of administration which will be most appropriate for a particular animal. Thus, according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation including a compound of the invention in admixture with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. In addition to the fact that compounds of the invention inhibit cyclic guanosine 3,5-monophosphate phosphodiesterases (cGMP PDEs) and in particular, are potent and selective inhibitors of cGMP PDE5, compounds of the invention may also have the advantage that they may be more efficacious than, be less toxic than, have a broader range of activity than, be more potent than, produce fewer side effects than, be more easily absorbed than, or they may have other useful pharmacological properties over, compounds known in the prior art. The biological activities of the compounds of the present invention were determined by the following test methods. Biological Tests Phosphodiesterase (PDE) Inhibitory Activity In vitro PDE inhibitory activities against cyclic guanosine 3, 5-monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic adenosine 3,5-monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterases were determined by measurement of their IC 50 values (the concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition of enzyme activity). The required PDE enzymes were isolated from a variety of sources, including human corpus cavernosum, human and rabbit platelets, human cardiac ventricle, human skeletal muscle and bovine retina, essentially by the method of W. J. Thompson and M. M. Appleman (Biochem., 1971, 10, 311). In particular, the cGMP-specific PDE (PDE5) and the cGMP-inhibited cAMP PDE (PDE3) were obtained from human corpus cavernosum tissue, human platelets or rabbit platelets; the cGMP-stimulated PDE (PDE2) was obtained from human corpus cavernosum; the calcium/calmodulin (Ca/CAM)-dependent PDE (PDE1) from human cardiac ventricle; the cAMP-specific PDE (PDE4) from human skeletal is muscle; and the photoreceptor PDE (PDE6) from bovine retina. Assays were performed using a modification of the batch method of W. J. Thompson et al. (Biochem., 1979, 18, 5228). Results from these tests show that the compounds of the present invention are potent and selective inhibitors of cGMP-specific PDE5. Functional Activity This was assessed in vitro by determining the capacity of a compound of the invention to enhance sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation of precontracted rabbit corpus cavernosum tissue strips, as described by S. A. Ballard et al. (Brit. J. Pharmacol., 1996, 118 (suppl.), abstract 153P). In Vivo Activity Compounds may be screened in anaesthetised dogs to determine their capacity, after i.v. administration, to enhance the pressure rises in the corpora cavernosa of the penis induced by intracavernosal injection of sodium nitroprusside, using a method based on that described by Trigo-Rocha et al. (Neurourol. and Urodyn., 1994, 13, 71). Safety Profile Compounds of the invention may be tested at varying i.v and p.o. doses in animals such as mouse and dog, observing for any untoward effects.

TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to substituted O 6 -benzylguanines, O 6 -benzyl-8-azaguanines, and 6(4)-benzyloxypyrimidines, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, and methods of using such compounds. The subject compounds are particularly useful in inactivating the human DNA repair protein O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The inactivation of the human DNA repair protein O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) by O 6 -benzylguanine leads to a dramatic enhancement in the cytotoxic response of human tumor cells and tumor xenografts to chemotherapeutic drugs whose mechanism of action involves modification of DNA guanine residues at the O 6 -position (Dolan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 87, 5368-5372 (1990); Dolan et al., Cancer Res., 51, 3367-3372 (1991); Dolan et al., Cancer Commun., 2, 371-377 (1990); Mitchell et al., Cancer Res., 52, 1171-1175 (1992); Friedman et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 84, 1926-1931 (1992); Felker et al., Cancer Chem. Pharmacol., 32, 471-476 (1993); Dolan et al., Cancer Chem. Pharmacol., 32, 221-225 (1993); Dolan et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 46, 285-290 (1993)). The AGT inactivating activity of a large number of O 6 -benzylguanine analogs have been compared with the aim of obtaining information about the types of substituent groups and the sites at which they could be attached to O 6 -benzylguanine without significantly lowering its AGT-inactivating activity (Moschel et al., J. Med. Chem., 35, 4486-4491 (1992); Chae et al., J. Med. Chem., 37, 342-347 (1994)). While these studies led to the production of a variety of analogs that were as potent or somewhat less potent than O 6 -benzylguanine, none of the analogs were better than O 6 -benzylguanine. Thus, there remains a need for additional compounds which are capable of enhancing the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumor cells in a mammal with an antineoplastic alkylating agent which causes cytotoxic lesions at the O 6 -position of guanine. The present invention provides such compounds and associated pharmaceutical compositions and treatment methods. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention, as well as additional inventive features, will be apparent from the description of the invention provided herein. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides 7- and 8-substituted O 6 -benzylguanine derivatives, 7,8-disubstituted O 6 -benzylguanine derivatives, 7,9-disubstituted O 6 -benzylguanine derivatives, 8-aza-O 6 -benzylguanine derivatives, and 4(6)-substituted 2-amino-5-nitro-6(4)-benzyloxypyrimidine and 2-amino-5-nitroso-6(4)-benzyloxypyrimidine derivatives which have been found to be effective AGT inactivators, as well as pharmaceutical compositions comprising such derivatives along with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The present invention further provides a method of enhancing the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumor cells in a mammal with an antineoplastic alkylating agent which causes cytotoxic lesions at the O 6 -position of guanine, by administering to a mammal an effective amount of one of the aforesaid derivatives, 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxy-s-triazine, 5-substituted 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxypyrimidines, or 8-aza-O 6 -benzylguanine, and administering to the mammal an effective amount of an antineoplastic alkylating agent which causes cytotoxic lesions at the O 6 -position of guanine.

The present invention additionally provides treatment methods, which are generally administered via pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more of the O 6 -substituted compounds of the present invention. In particular, the present invention provides a method of enhancing the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumor cells in a mammal with an antineoplastic alkylating agent that causes cytotoxic lesions at the O 6 -position of guanine, which method comprises administering to a mammal an effective amount of one or more of the aforedescribed present inventive compounds of formulas I-V, and administering to the mammal an effective amount of an antineoplastic alkylating agent that causes cytotoxic lesions at the O 6 -position of guanine. The present invention also includes the method of enhancing the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumor cells in a mammal with an antineoplastic alkylating agent that causes cytotoxic lesions at the O 6 -position of guanine, which method comprises (i) administering to a mammal an effective amount of (a) 8-aza-O 6 -benzylguanine (b) a compound of the formula VI wherein R is a substituent selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halo, C 1 -C 4 alkyl, C 1 -C 4 hydroxyalkyl, thiol, C 1 -C 4 alkylthio, trifluoromethylthio, C 1 -C 4 thioacyl, hydroxy, C 1 -C 4 alkoxy, trifluoromethoxy, methanesulfonyloxy, trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy, C 1 -C 4 acyloxy, amino, C 1 -C 4 aminoalkyl, C 1 -C 4 alkylamino, C 1 -C 4 dialkylamino, trifluoromethylamino, ditrifluoromethylamino, aminomethanesulfonyl, amino C 1 -C 4 alkylcarbonyl, aminotrifluoromethylcarbonyl, formylamino, nitro, nitroso, C l -C 4 alkyldiazo, C5-C 6 aryldiazo, trifluoromethyl, C 1 -C 4 haloalkyl, halomethyl, cyanomethyl, C l -C 4 cyanoalkyl, cyano, C 1 -C 4 alkyloxycarbonyl, C 1 -C 4 alkylcarbonyl, phenyl, phenylcarbonyl, formyl, C l -C 4 alkoxymethyl, phenoxymethyl, C 2 -C 4 vinyl, C 2 -C 4 ethynyl, and SO n R wherein n is 0, 1, 2, or 3 and R is hydrogen, C 1 -C 4 alkyl, amino, or phenyl, or (c) 2,4-diamino-O 6 -benzyl-s-triazine, and (ii) administering to the mammal an effective amount of an antineoplastic alkylating agent which causes cytotoxic lesions at the O 6 -position of guanine. Several O 6 -substituted compounds were tested for their ability to inactivate the human DNA repair protein, O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT, alkyltransferase). Two classes of compounds were identified as being significantly better than O 6 -benzylguanine (the prototype low-molecular-weight inactivator) in inactivating AGT in human HT29 colon tumor cell extracts. These were 8-substituted O 6 -benzylguanines bearing electron-withdrawing groups at the 8-position and 5-substituted 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxypyrimidines bearing electron-withdrawing groups at the 5-position. The latter derivatives were also more effective than O 6 -benzylguanine in inactivating AGT in intact HT29 colon tumor cells. Both types of compounds were as effective or more effective than O 6 -benzylguanine in enhancing cell killing by 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) of colon, breast and prostate cancer cells grown in culture. Provided 8-substituted O 6 -benzylguanine derivatives bearing electron-withdrawing substituents at the 8-position and 5-substituted 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxypyrimidines bearing electron-withdrawing substituents at the 5-position do not exhibit undesirable toxicity, they should be superior to O 6 -benzylguanine as chemotherapeutic adjuvants for enhancing the effectiveness of antitumor drugs whose mechanism of action involves modification of the O 6 -position of DNA guanine residues. The specific compounds surveyed for AGT inactivating activity are illustrated below. Preparations of the 8-substituted O 6 -benzylguanine derivatives 8-amino-O 6 -benzylguanine (1a) and O 6 -benzyl-8-methylguanine (1b) were accomplished by treating 2,8-diamino-6-chloropurine and 2-amino-6-chloro-8-methylpurine, respectively, with sodium benzyloxide in benzyl alcohol. O 6 -Benzyl-8-oxoguanine (O 6 -benzyl-7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine, 1c) was prepared by reacting 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole with 2,4,5-triamino-6-benzyloxypyrimidine (Pfleiderer et al., Chem. Ber., 94, 12-18 (1961)). For convenience, the compound is illustrated in the 8-hydroxy tautomeric form although it most probably exists in solution in the 8-keto form with a hydrogen attached to the 7-nitrogen atom. O 6 -Benzyl-8-bromoguanine (1d) was prepared by bromination of O 6 -benzylguanine. O 6 -Benzyl-8-trifluoromethylguanine (1e) was prepared by reacting 2-amino-6-chloro-8-trifluoro-methylpurine with sodium benzyloxide in benzyl alcohol. 8-Aza-O 6 -benzylguanine (2) was prepared through nitrous acid treatment of 2,4,5-triamino-6-benzyloxypyrimidine. Compound 2 had been prepared previously by another route (Shealy et al., J. Org. Chem., 27, 4518-4523 (1962)). With respect to the pyrimidine derivatives (3a-f), 4-amino-6-benzyloxy-5-nitropyrimidine (3a) was prepared by treating 4-amino-6-chloro-5-nitropyrimidine (Boon et al., J. Chem. Soc., 96-102 (1951)) with sodium benzyloxide in benzyl alcohol. Derivatives 3b-d were prepared by the method of Pfleiderer et al. ( Chem. Ber., 94, 12-18 (1961)). 2,4-Diamino-6-benzyloxy-5-nitropyrimidine (3e) and 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxy-5-bromopyrimidine (3f) were prepared previously by Kosary et al. ( Acta Pharm. Hung., 49, 241-247 (1989)). The purines, O 6 -benzylxanthine (4a) and O 6 -benzyluric acid (4b) were prepared by nitrous acid deamination of O 6 -benzylguanine and O 6 -benzyl-8-oxoguanine, respectively. N 2 -Acetyl-O 6 -benzyl-8-oxoguanine (N 2 -acetyl-O 6 -benzyl-7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine) (4d ) was prepared through acetylation of O 6 -benzyl-8-oxoguanine (1c). O 6 -Benzyl-2-fluorohypoxanthine (4c) was prepared previously by Robins and Robins ( J. Org. Chem., 34, 2160-2163 (1969)). This material was treated with methylamine and dimethylamine to produce O 6 -benzyl-N 2 -methylguanine (4e) and O 6 -benzyl-N 2 ,N 2 -dimethylguanine (4f), respectively. Compounds 5a (2-amino-4-benzyloxy-5-nitropyrimidine) and 5b (2-amino-4-benzyloxy-6-methyl-5-nitropyrimidine) were prepared by treating 2-amino-4-chloro-5-nitropyrimidine and 2-amino-4-chloro-6-methyl-5-nitropyrimidine (Boon et al., J. Chem. Soc., 96-102 (1951)), respectively, with sodium benzyloxide in benzyl alcohol. Compound 6 (2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxy-s-triazine) was prepared previously under similar conditions (Wakabayashi et al., Nippon Dojo-Hiryyogaku Zasshi, 41, 193-200 (1970)). O 6 -Benzyl-8-trifluoromethyl-9-methylguanine (7) was prepared by treating the anion of 1e with methyl iodide in N,N-dimethylformamide. Compound 8a was prepared by methylating the sodium salt of 8-aza-O 6 -benzylguanine using methyl iodide as the methylating agent. Compounds 8b and 9 were prepared by the reaction of the sodium salt of 8-aza-O 6 -benzylguanine and chloromethyl pivalate. Compound 10a was prepared by direct bromination of O 6 -benzyl-9-methylguanine. Compounds 10b and 11 were prepared by the reaction of the sodium salt of O 6 -benzyl-8-bromoguanine and chloromethyl pivalate. Compound 12 was prepared by the reaction of the sodium salt of O 6 -benzylguanine and chloromethyl pivalate. The ability of these compounds to inactivate the AGT protein in HT29 human colon tumor cell extracts and in intact HT29 cells is summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The data represent the dose of compound required to produce 50% inactivation in cell-free extracts upon incubation for 30 min or in cells upon incubation for 4 hr.

The values for O 6 -benzylguanine are from Moschel et al., J. Med. Chem., 35, 4486-4491 (1992). Within these series of compounds, O 6 -benzyl-N 2 -methyl-and O 6 -benzyl-N 2 ,N 2 -dimethylguanine (4e and 4f) were the least active agents exhibiting ED 50 values for inactivation of AGT in HT29 cell extracts of 160 and 200 mM, respectively. For comparison, the ED 50 value exhibited by O 6 -benzylguanine was 0.2 mM (Table 1). The other 2- and/or 8-substituted 6-benzyloxypurines, N 2 -acetyl-O 6 -benzyl-8-oxoguanine (4d), O 6 -benzylxanthine (4a), O 6 -benzyl-2-fluorohypoxanthine (4c) and O 6 -benzyluric acid (4b), together with the substituted pyrimidines 4-amino-6-benzyloxy-5-nitropyrimidine (3a) and 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxypyrimidine (3b), comprised a group of increasingly more active AGT inactivating agents exhibiting intermediate ED 50 values in the range of 65 to 15 mM. 2,4-Diamino-6-benzyloxy-s-triazine (6) and 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxy-5-bromopyrimidine (3f) were considerably more active than 3b indicating that electron-withdrawing groups at the 5-position of a 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxypyrimidine derivative are positive contributors to efficient AGT inactivation. This is further emphasized by the very high activity exhibited by 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxy-5-nitrosopyrimidine (3d) and 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxy-5-nitropyrimidine (3e), which contain strongly electron-withdrawing nitroso and nitro substituents, respectively. These two derivatives are the most active AGT inactivators tested to date. The observation that 2-amino-4-benzyloxy-5-nitropyrimidine (5a) is much more active than 3a indicates that a 2-amino group is critical for high activity for a 6(4)-benzyloxy-5-nitropyrimidine derivative. An additional alkyl group at the 4(6)-position (e.g., as in 5b) does not enhance activity significantly over that for 5a although an amino group at the 4(6)-position significantly enhances activity. Thus, AGT inactivating activity increases substantially over the series 5a5b3d3e. With these considerations in mind the activity of 2,4,5-triamino-6-benzyloxypyrimidine (3c) seems exceptional and the reasons for its relatively high activity are unclear at present. It is also significant that pyrimidines 5a and 5b are quite active in cells, which is not totally predicted by their corresponding activity in HT29 cell extracts. All the O 6 -benzylguanine analogs 1a-d were much more active than the purines in the series 4a-f and the activity differences among 1a-d also reflect enhancements due to introduction of electron withdrawing groups. Thus, activity increased in the series 8-amino-O 6 -benzylguanine (1a)O 6 -benzyl-8-oxoguanine (1c)O 6 -benzyl-8-methylguanine (1b)O 6 -benzyl-8-bromoguanine (1d)8-aza-O 6 -benzylguanine (2). Indeed, derivatives 1d and 2 were essentially as active as pyrimidines 3d and 3e in cell-free extracts although 1d and 2 were somewhat less active in cells than expected from their activity in cell-free extracts. The compounds listed in Table 2 also had AGT-inactivating activity in cell free extracts and in cells. The activity of 7, 8a, and 10a in cells is significantly higher than their activity in cell-free extracts. Thus the ratio of ED 50 values in cell-free extracts/intact cells is 1.6, 1.6, 1.1, respectively, for derivatives 1d, 1e, and 2 (Table 1). This ratio increases to 7.2, 6.3, and 6.3, respectively, for the corresponding methylated derivatives 10a, 7, and 8a. It is believed that the higher activity of the methylated derivatives in the cells is due to the fact that these compounds do not possess readily dissociable hydrogens in the imidazole portion of the purine ring system and therefore they can readily enter the cells as neutral molecules.

Med. Chem., 37, 342-347 (1994). The ability of increasing concentrations of 1a-d, 2, and 3c-e to enhance the killing of human HT29 colon cancer cells, DU-145 prostate cancer cells, and MCF-71 breast cancer cells by BCNU (40 mM) is shown in Tables 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The data reflect the number of cell colonies that result following exposure to AGT inactivator alone or AGT inactivator 2 hr before exposure to BCNU as described in Dolan et al. ( Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A., 87, 5368-5372 (1990)). Data for O 6 -benzylguanine are included for comparison. As indicated, at 10 mM concentrations, all the 8-substituted purines with the exception of 1a were as effective as O 6 -benzylguanine in enhancing the cytotoxicity of BCNU (40 mM); such treatment killed essentially all the tumor cells. Treatment of the cells with the modified 8-substituted O 6 -benzylguanine alone or BCNU alone had no significant effect on cell colony number. The comparatively low activity of 1a in all but the breast cancer cells may reflect its poor transport into other tumor cell types or its rapid metabolic conversion to an ineffective AGT inactivator. Its ineffective enhancement of BCNU cytotoxicity parallels its relatively poor AGT inactivating ability in colon tumor cells (Table 1). For the pyrimidines tested, 2,4,5-triamino-6-benzyloxypyrimidine (3c) was as effective as the 8-substituted O 6 -benzylguanine derivatives and O 6 -benzylguanine itself in enhancing BCNU toxicity although the nitroso- and nitropyrimidine derivatives (3d and 3e) were similarly effective at a 4-fold lower dose.

This resistance is probably caused by a reduction in the space surrounding the active site of the alkyltransferase, which limits the access to O 6 -benzylguanine. These mutants are produced by single base changes in the alkyltransferase DNA-coding sequence causing changes in one or two amino acids in the alkyltransferase (Crone and Pegg, Cancer Res., 53, 4750-4753 (1993)). Thus, as indicated in Table 6, changing the proline residue at position 140 to alanine (protein P140A) or the glycine residue at position 156 to an alanine (protein G156A) causes a 20-fold and a 240-fold increase in resistance to O 6 -benzylguanine, respectively. The alkyltransferase containing an arginine in place of a proline at residue 138 together with an arginine in place of a proline at residue 140 (protein P138A/P140A) is 88-fold more resistant to inactivation by O 6 -benzylguanine. It is possible that such resistant mutants will arise or be selected for in tumors under the selective pressure generated by treatment with O 6 -benzylguanine plus an alkylating agent. More potent inhibitors and/or those of a smaller size that are better able to fit into the space of the active site of the mutant alkyltransferase can be used to advantage to overcome this resistance. TABLE 6 Inhibition of Mutant Alkyltransferase Proteins by O 6 -Benzylguanine or 2,4-Diamino-6-benzyloxy- 5-nitrosopyrimidine ED 50 value (mM) a 2,4-diamino-6- benzyloxy-5-nitroso- Protein O 6 -benzylguanine pyrimidine Control 0.25 0.05 P140A 5 0.1 P138A/P140A 22 0.3 G156A 60 1 a The concentration needed to inactivate 50% of the activity in 30 minutes. As shown in Table 6, 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxy-5-nitrosopyrimidine (3d) was 50 to 60 times better at inactivating the mutant alkyltransferases than O 6 -benzylguanine. Doses of 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxy-5-nitrosopyrimidine leading to intracellular concentrations greater than 5 mM will therefore be effective at inactivating such resistant alkyltransferases. Concentrations greater than 200 mM of O 6 -benzylguanine would be needed to get such inactivation, and these are much more than can be achieved with this compound in current formulations. However, 8-substituted O 6 -benzylguanine derivatives that are significantly more potent than O 6 -benzylguanine may be useful in inactivating mutant alkyltransferases provided their required intracellular concentrations can be achieved. These data for mutant alkyltransferase inactivation and the data presented earlier indicate that pyrimidine derivatives bearing electron-withdrawing groups at the 5-position as well as substituted O 6 -benzylguanine derivatives bearing electron-withdrawing groups at the 8-position are superior to O 6 -benzylguanine for use as adjuvants in chemotherapy with agents whose mechanism of action, like that of BCNU, involves modification of the O 6 -position of DNA guanine residues. Other 8-substituted O 6 -benzylguanine derivatives bearing electron-withdrawing 8-substituents (e.g., NO 2 ) are readily available. For example, O 6 -benzyl-8-nitroguanine could be prepared by treatment of 8-nitroguanine (Jones and Robins, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 82, 3773-3779 (1960) ) with phosphorus oxychloride to produce 2-amino-6-chloro-8-nitropurine which when treated with sodium benzyloxide in benzyl alcohol would produce the desired O 6 -benzyl-8-nitroguanine. Additional 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxypyrimidine derivatives bearing electron-withdrawing groups other than halogen or nitro groups (e.g., formyl or cyano groups) could also be readily prepared. 2,4-Diamino-5-formyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine, a known compound (Delia and Otteman, Heterocycles, 20, 1805-1809 (1983)), can be treated with phosphorus oxychloride to produce a 2,4-diamino-6-chloro-5-formylpyrimidine intermediate, which on treatment with sodium benzyloxide in benzyl alcohol produces 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxy-5-formylpyrimidine. Treatment of the formyl pyrimidine with hydroxylamine affords 2,4-diamino-6-benzyloxy-5-cyanopyrimidine. The preparation of a large number of 5-substituted 6(4)-benzyloxypyrimidines or 8-substituted O 6 -benzylguanine derivatives is possible for those skilled in the art of synthesis of heterocyclic aromatic compounds (D. J. Brown, The Pyrimidines, in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, Vol. 16, A. Weissberger, Ed., Wiley Interscience, New York, 1962; D. J. Brown, The Pyrimidines, Supplement I, in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, Vol. 16, A. Weissberger and E. C. Taylor, Eds., Wiley Interscience, New York, 1970; J. H. Lister, Fused Pyrimidines Part II Purines, in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, Vol. 24 Part II, A. Weissberger and E. C. Taylor, Eds., Wiley Interscience, New York, 1971). Because many 9-substituted O 6 -benzylguanine derivatives exhibit excellent AGT inactivation properties (Moschel et al., J. Med. Chem., 35, 4486-4491 (1992); Chae et al., J. Med. Chem., 37, 342-347 (1994)), 8,9-disubstituted analogs are expected to be similarly active. These can be readily prepared by reacting the anion of 8-substituted O 6 -benzylguanines (e.g., 1a-e) or the anion of 8-aza-O 6 -benzylguanine (2) with any of the range of compounds already described (Moschel et al., J. Med. Chem., 35, 4486-4491 (1992); Chae et al., J. Med. Chem., 37, 342-347 (1994)) to produce a mixture of isomeric 7,8- and 8,9-disubstituted O 6 -benzylguanine derivatives. The desired 8,9-disubstituted derivative can be isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography as already described (Moschel et al., J. Med. Chem., 35, 4486-4491 (1992); Chae et al., J. Med. Chem., 37, 342-347 (1994)). Compound 7 was prepared by treating the anion of compound 1e with methyl iodide in N,N-dimethylformamide. Compounds 8-12 were prepared using similar procedures. The O 6 -substituted compounds of the present invention can be administered in any suitable manner to a mammal for the purpose of enhancing the chemotherapeutic treatment of a particular cancer. Although more than one route can be used to administer a particular compound, a particular route can provide a more immediate and more effective reaction than another route. Accordingly, the described methods provided herein are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting. Generally, the O 6 -substituted compounds of the present invention as described above will be administered in a pharmaceutical composition to an individual afflicted with a cancer. Those undergoing or about to undergo chemotherapy can be treated with the O 6 -substituted compounds separately or in conjunction with other treatments, as appropriate. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a patient in an amount sufficient to elicit an effective depression of AGT activity thereby potentiating the cytotoxicity of the aforedescribed chemotherapeutic treatment. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as a therapeutically effective dose, which is also an AGT inactivating effective amount. Amounts effective for a therapeutic or prophylactic use will depend on, e.g., the stage and severity of the disease being treated, the age, weight, and general state of health of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The size of the dose will also be determined by the O 6 -substituted compound selected, method of administration, timing and frequency of administration as well as the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that might accompany the administration of a particular O 6 -substituted compound and the desired physiological effect. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that various disease states may require prolonged treatment involving multiple administrations, perhaps using a series of different AGT inactivators and/or chemotherapeutic agents in each or various rounds of administration. Suitable chemotherapeutic agents usefully administered in coordination with the O 6 -substituted compounds of the present invention include alkylating agents, such as chloroethylating and methylating agents. Such agents may be administered using conventional techniques such as those described in Wasserman et al., Cancer, 36, pp. 1258-1268 (1975), and Physicians Desk Reference, 48th ed., Edward R. Barnhart publisher (1994). For example, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (carmustine or BCNU, Bristol-Myers, Evansville, Ind.) may be administered intravenously at a dosage of from about 150 to 200 mg/m 2 every six weeks. Another alkylating agent, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (lomustine or CCNU, Bristol-Myers), may be administered orally at a dosage of about 130 mg/m 2 every six weeks. Other alkylating agents may be administered in appropriate dosages via appropriate routes of administration known to skilled medical practitioners. Suitable doses and dosage regimens can be determined by conventional range-finding techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages that are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. The present inventive method typically will involve the administration of about 0.1 mg to about 50 mg of one or more of the compounds described above per kg body weight of the individual. For a 70 kg patient, dosages of from about 10 mg to about 200 mg of O 6 -substituted compound would be more commonly used, possibly followed by further lesser dosages from about 1 mg to about 1 mg of O 6 -substituted compound over weeks to months, depending on a patients physiological response, as determined by measuring cancer-specific antigens or other measurable parameters related to the tumor load of a patient. It must be kept in mind that the compounds and compositions of the present invention generally are employed in serious disease states, that is, life-threatening or potentially life-threatening situations. In such cases, in view of the minimization of extraneous substances and the relative nontoxic nature of the O 6 -substituted compounds, it is possible and may be felt desirable by the treating physician to administer substantial excesses of these O 6 -substituted compounds. Single or multiple administrations of the compounds can be carried out with dose levels and pattern being selected by the treating physician. In any event, the pharmaceutical formulations should provide a quantity of AGT-inactivating compounds of the invention sufficient to effectively enhance the cytotoxic impact of the chemotherapy. The pharmaceutical compositions for therapeutic treatment are intended for parenteral, topical, oral or local administration and generally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and an amount of the active ingredient sufficient to reduce, and preferably prevent, the activity of the AGT protein. The carrier may be any of those conventionally used and is limited only by chemico-physical considerations, such as solubility and lack of reactivity with the compound, and by the route of administration. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts for use in the present inventive pharmaceutical composition include those derived from mineral acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric and sulfuric acids, and organic acids, such as tartaric, acetic, citric, malic, lactic, fumaric, benzoic, glycolic, gluconic, succinic, p-toluenesulphonic acids, and arylsulphonic, for example. The pharmaceutically acceptable excipients described herein, for example, vehicles, adjuvants, carriers or diluents, are well-known to those who are skilled in the art and are readily available to the public. It is preferred that the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier be one that is chemically inert to the active compounds and one that has no detrimental side effects or toxicity under the conditions of use. Such pharmaceutically acceptable excipients preferably include saline (e.g., 0.9% saline), Cremophor EL (which is a derivative of castor oil and ethylene oxide available from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) (e.g., 5% Cremophor EL/5% ethanol/90% saline, 10% Cremophor EL/90% saline, or 50% Cremophor EL/50% ethanol), propylene glycol (e.g., 40% propylene glycol/10% ethanol/50% water), polyethylene glycol (e.g., 40% PEG 400/60% saline), and alcohol (e.g., 40% t-butanol/60% water). The most preferred pharmaceutical excipient for use in conjunction with the present invention is polyethylene glycol, such as PEG 400, and particularly a composition comprising 40% PEG 400 and 60% water or saline. The choice of excipient will be determined in part by the particular O 6 -substituted compound chosen, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. The following formulations for oral, aerosol, parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, interperitoneal, rectal, and vaginal administration are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting. The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered parenterally, e.g., intravenously, intraarterially, subcutaneously, intradermally, or intramuscularly. Thus, the invention provides compositions for parenteral administration that comprise a solution of the O 6 -substituted compound dissolved or suspended in an acceptable carrier suitable for parenteral administration, including aqueous and non-aqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions. Overall, the requirements for effective pharmaceutical carriers for parenteral compositions are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See Pharmaceutics and Pharmacy Practice, J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, Pa., Banker and Chalmers, eds., pages 238-250 (1982), and ASHP Handbook on Injectable Drugs, Toissel, 4th ed., pages 622-630 (1986). Such solutions can contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. The compound may be administered in a physiologically acceptable diluent in a pharmaceutical carrier, such as a sterile liquid or mixture of liquids, including water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, an alcohol, such as ethanol, isopropanol, or hexadecyl alcohol, glycols, such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, dimethylsulfoxide, glycerol ketals, such as 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol, ethers, such as poly(ethyleneglycol) 400, an oil, a fatty acid, a fatty acid ester or glyceride, or an acetylated fatty acid glyceride with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant, such as a soap or a detergent, suspending agent, such as pectin, carbomers, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, or carboxymethylcellulose, or emulsifying agents and other pharmaceutical adjuvants. Oils useful in parenteral formulations include petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic oils. Specific examples of oils useful in such formulations include peanut, soybean, sesame, cottonseed, corn, olive, petrolatum, and mineral. Suitable fatty acids for use in parenteral formulations include oleic acid, stearic acid, and isostearic acid. Ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate are examples of suitable fatty acid esters. Suitable soaps for use in parenteral formulations include fatty alkali metal, ammonium, and triethanolamine salts, and suitable detergents include (a) cationic detergents such as, for example, dimethyl dialkyl ammonium halides, and alkyl pyridinium halides, (b) anionic detergents such as, for example, alkyl, aryl, and olefin sulfonates, alkyl, olefin, ether, and monoglyceride sulfates, and sulfosuccinates, (c) nonionic detergents such as, for example, fatty amine oxides, fatty acid alkanolamides, and polyoxyethylenepolypropylene copolymers, (d) amphoteric detergents such as, for example, alkyl-b-aminopropionates, and 2-alkyl-imidazoline quaternary ammonium salts, and (e) mixtures thereof. The parenteral formulations typically will contain from about 0.5% to about 25% by weight of the active ingredient in solution. Preservatives and buffers may be used. In order to minimize or eliminate irritation at the site of injection, such compositions may contain one or more nonionic surfactants having a hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) of from about 12 to about 17. The quantity of surfactant in such formulations will typically range from about 5% to about 15% by weight. Suitable surfactants include polyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, such as sorbitan monooleate and the high molecular weight adducts of ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic base, formed by the condensation of propylene oxide with propylene glycol. The parenteral formulations can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampules and vials, and can be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid excipient, for example, water, for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind previously described. Topical formulations, including those that are useful for transdermal drug release, are well-known to those of skill in the art and are suitable in the context of the present invention for application to skin. Formulations suitable for oral administration require extra considerations considering the peptidyl and/or carbohydrate nature of some of the O 6 -substituted compounds of the present invention and the likely breakdown thereof if such compounds are administered orally without protecting them from the digestive secretions of the gastrointestinal tract. Such a formulation can consist of (a) liquid solutions, such as an effective amount of the compound dissolved in diluents, such as water, saline, or orange juice; (b) capsules, sachets, tablets, lozenges, and troches, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as solids or granules; (c) powders; (d) suspensions in an appropriate liquid; and (e) suitable emulsions. Liquid formulations may include diluents, such as water and alcohols, for example, ethanol, benzyl alcohol, and the polyethylene alcohols, either with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant, suspending agent, or emulsifying agent. Capsule forms can be of the ordinary hard- or soft-shelled gelatin type containing, for example, surfactants, lubricants, and inert fillers, such as lactose, sucrose, calcium phosphate, and corn starch. Tablet forms can include one or more of lactose, sucrose, mannitol, corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid, microcrystalline cellulose, acacia, gelatin, guar gum, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, stearic acid, and other excipients, colorants, diluents, buffering agents, disintegrating agents, moistening agents, preservatives, flavoring agents, and pharmacologically compatible excipients. Lozenge forms can comprise the active ingredient in a flavor, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, as well as pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia, emulsions, gels, and the like containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such excipients as are known in the art. The O 6 -substituted compounds of the present invention, alone or in combination with other suitable components, can be made into aerosol formulations to be administered via inhalation. The compounds are preferably supplied in finely divided form along with a surfactant and propellant. Typical percentages of active compound are 0.01%-20% by weight, preferably 1%-10%. The surfactant must, of course, be nontoxic, and preferably soluble in the propellant. Representative of such surfactants are the esters or partial esters of fatty acids containing from 6 to 22 carbon atoms, such as caproic, octanoic, lauric, palmitic, stearic, linoleic, linolenic, olesteric and oleic acids with an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol or its cyclic anhydride. Mixed esters, such as mixed or natural glycerides may be employed. The surfactant may constitute 0.1%-20% by weight of the composition, preferably 0.25-5%. The balance of the composition is ordinarily propellant. A carrier can also be included as desired, e.g., lecithin for intranasal delivery. These aerosol formulations can be placed into acceptable pressurized propellants, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the like. They also may be formulated as pharmaceuticals for non-pressured preparations, such as in a nebulizer or an atomizer. Such spray formulations may be used to spray mucosa. Additionally, the compounds and polymers useful in the present inventive methods may be made into suppositories by mixing with a variety of bases, such as emulsifying bases or water-soluble bases. Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams, or spray formulas containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. The concentration of the O 6 -substituted compounds of the present invention in the pharmaceutical formulations can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 1%, usually at or at least about 10%, to as much as 20% to 50% or more by weight, and will be selected primarily by fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected. Thus, a typical pharmaceutical composition for intravenous infusion could be made up to contain 250 ml of sterile Ringers solution, and 100 mg of the O 6 -substituted compound. Actual methods for preparing parenterally administrable compounds will be known or apparent to those skilled in the art and are described in more detail in, for example, Remingtons Pharmaceutical Science (17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1985). It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that, in addition to the aforedescribed pharmaceutical compositions, the O 6 -substituted compounds of the present inventive method may be formulated as inclusion complexes, such as cyclodextrin inclusion complexes, or liposomes. Liposomes serve to target the compounds to a particular tissue, such as lymphoid tissue or cancerous hepatic cells. Liposomes can also be used to increase the half-life of the O 6 -substituted compound. Liposomes useful in the present invention include emulsions, foams, micelles, insoluble monolayers, liquid crystals, phospholipid dispersions, lamellar layers and the like. In these preparations, the O 6 -substituted compound to be delivered is incorporated as part of a liposome, alone or in conjunction with a suitable chemotherapeutic agent. Thus, liposomes filled with a desired O 6 -substituted compound of the invention can be directed to the site of a specific tissue type, hepatic cells, for example, where the liposomes then deliver the selected chemotherapeutic-enhancement compositions. Liposomes for use in the invention are formed from standard vesicle-forming lipids, which generally include neutral and negatively charged phospholipids and a sterol, such as cholesterol. The selection of lipids is generally guided by consideration of, for example, liposome size and stability of the liposomes in the blood stream. A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in, for example, Szoka et al., Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng., 9, 467 (1980), and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728, 4,837,028, and 5,019,369. For targeting to the cells of a particular tissue type, a ligand to be incorporated into the liposome can include, for example, antibodies or fragments thereof specific for cell surface determinants of the targeted tissue type. A liposome suspension containing an O 6 - substituted compound may be administered intravenously, locally, topically, etc. in a dose that varies according to the mode of administration, the O 6 -substituted compound being delivered, the stage of disease being treated, etc. While the efficacy of the O 6 -substituted compounds of the present invention has been demonstrated with respect to particular types of cancerous cells, e.g., colon, prostate, and breast cancer cells, the present invention has applicability to the treatment of any type of cancer capable of being treated with an antineoplastic alkylating agent which causes cytotoxic lesions at the O 6 -position of guanine. Such cancers include, for example, colon tumors, prostrate tumors, brain tumors, lymphomas, leukemias, breast tumors, ovarian tumors, lung tumors, Wilms tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, multiplemyeloma, stomach tumors, soft-tissue sarcomas, Hodgkins disease, and non-Hodgkins lymphomas. Similarly, in view of the mode of action of the O 6 -substituted compounds of the present invention, such compounds can be used in conjunction with any type of antineoplastic alkylating agent which causes cytotoxic lesions at the O 6 -position of guanine. Such antineoplastic alkylating agents include, for example, chloroethylating agents (e.g. chloroethylnitrosoureas and chloroethyltriazines) and monofunctional alkylating agents such as Streptozotocin, Procarbazine, Dacarbazine, and Temozolomide. Among the chloroethylating agents, the most frequently used chemotherapeutic drugs are 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU, lomustine), 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU, carmustine), 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(4-methylcyclohexyl)-1-nitrosourea (MeCCNU, semustine), and 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(4-amino-2-methyl-5-pyrimidinyl)methyl-1-nitrosourea (ACNU). These agents have been used clinically against tumors of the central nervous system, multiple myeloma, melanoma, lymphoma, gastrointestinal tumors, and other solid tumors (Colvin and Chabner, Alkylating Agents. In: Cancer Chemotherapy: Principles and Practice, Chabner and Collins, eds., Lippincott, Philadelphia, pp. 276-313 (1990); McCormick and McElhinney, Eur. J. Cancer, 26, 207-221 (1990)). Chloroethylating agents currently under development with fewer side effects are 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-nitrosourea (HECNU), 2-chloroethyl-methylsulfonylmethanesulfonate (Clomesone), and 1-N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosoureidoethylphosphonic acid diethyl ester (Fotemustine) (Colvin and Chabner, Alkylating Agents. In: Cancer Chemotherapy: Principles and Practice, Chabner and Collins, eds., Lippincott, Philadelphia, pp. 276-313 (1990); McCormick and McElhinney, Eur. J. Cancer, 26, 207-221 (1990)). Methylating chemotherapeutic agents include Streptozotocin (2-deoxy-2-(3-methyl-3-nitrosoureido)-D-glucopyranose), Procarbazine (N-(1-methylethyl)-4-(2-methylhydrazino)methylbenzamide), Dacarbazine or DTIC (5-(3,3-dimethyl-1-triazenyl)-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide), and Temozolomide (8-carbamoyl-3-methylimidazo5,1-d-1,2,3,5-tetrazine-4-(3H)-one). Temozolomide is active against malignant melanomas, brain tumors, and mycosis fungoides. Streptozotocin is effective against pancreatic tumors. Procarbazine is used to treat Hodgkins disease and brain tumors, and DTIC is used in treatment of melanoma and lymphomas (Colvin and Cabner, Alkylating Agents. In: Cancer Chemotherapy: Principles and Practice, Chabner and Collins, eds., Lippincott, Philadelphia, pp. 276-313 (1990); Longo, Semin. Concol., 17, 716-735 (1990)). The examples set forth below describe the syntheses of the aforedescribed compounds. As regards the methods and materials set forth in these examples, 1 H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian VXR 500S spectrometer equipped with Sun 2/110 data stations or a Varian XL 200 instrument interfaced to an Advanced data system. Samples were dissolved in DMSO-d 6 with Me 4 Si as an internal standard. EI mass spectra were obtained on a reversed geometry VG Micromass ZAB-2F spectrometer interfaced to a VG 2035 data system.

Alternative synthetic methods are provided below for some of these compounds together with spectroscopic data not provided previously. AGT inactivation studies were carried out as described in Moschel et al., J. Med. Chem., 35, 4486-4491 (1992). Cell killing experiments involving various AGT inactivators in combination with BCNU were carried out as in Dolan, et al. ( Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 87, 5368-5372 (1990)). Cells were treated for 2 h with AGT inactivator prior to exposure to BCNU. EXAMPLE 1 2,8-Diamino-6-chloropurine A suspension of 8-aminoguanine (Fischer, Z. Physiol. Chem., 60, 69 (1909); Beaman et al., in Zorbach and Tipson, Synthetic Procedures in Nucleic Acid Chemistry, Vol. 1, pp 41-43, John Wiley Sons, New York, 1968) (3.0 g, 18.1 mmol) in phosphorus oxychloride (90 mL) and N,N-diethylaniline (3 mL) was refluxed for 30 min and the excess phosphorus oxychloride was evaporated under reduced pressure. Ice (20 g) was added slowly to the resulting solution and the pH was adjusted to 6 with a concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. A yellow solid formed and was collected by filtration, washed with water, and dried to give a green solid. Crystallization from water with charcoal treatment produced 2,8-diamino-6-chloropurine as a white solid: yield, 2.11 g (63%); mp275 C. dec.; 1 H NMR d 6.09 (s, 2 H, NH 2 , exchange with D 2 O), 6.71 (s, 2 H, NH 2 , exchange with D 2 O); MS (EI) calcd. m/z for C 5 H 5 N 6 35 Cl 184.0264, found 184.0266; calcd. m/z C 5 H 5 N 6 37 Cl 186.0235, found 186.0237. EXAMPLE 2 8-Amino-O 6 -benzylguanine (1a) 2,8-Diamino-6-chloropurine (0.9 g, 4.9 mmol) was added to the solution of sodium (0.22 g, 10 mmol) in benzyl alcohol (9.0 mL). The solution was heated in a 130 C. oil bath for 5 h, and was poured into water (100 mL) with constant stirring for 10 min. Undissolved solid was removed by filtration and the filtrate was neutralized with glacial acetic acid. The solution was mixed with methanol (100 mL), and half of the aqueous methanol solution was loaded on a 380 cm Sephadex LH-20 column eluted with methanol/water (1:1) at 1 mL/min. Column eluent was continuously monitored at 280 nm and fractions (10 mL) were collected. The remainder of the reaction mixture in MeOH/H 2 O was chromatographed separately under identical conditions. The desired product eluted in fractions 100-130. Evaporation of solvent from the pooled fractions 100-130 from both chromatographic runs afforded analytically pure 1a: yield, 0.26 g (21%); mp 269-271 C. dec.; UV (pH 1) 1 max 241 nm (e0.69910 4 ), 300 (1.10910 4 ); (pH 6.9) 250 (sh) (0.44710 4 ), 292 (1.02710 4 ); (pH 13) 255 (sh) (0.35510 4 ), 295 (0.93210 4 ); 1 H NMR d 5.41 (s, 2 H, ArCH 2 ), 5.70 (s, 2 H, NH 2 , exchange with D 2 O), 6.18 (s, 2 H, NH 2 , exchange with D 2 O), 7.25-7.55 (m, 5 H, ArH), 11.1 (br s, 1 H, NH, exchanges with D 2 O); MS (EI) calcd. m/z for C 12 H 12 N 6 O 256.1072, found 256.1059; Anal.

Soc., 82, 2633-2640 (1960)) (1.0 g, 6.1 mmol) in phosphorous oxychloride (30 mL) and N,N-diethylaniline (1 mL) was refluxed for 3 h. The excess phosphorous oxychloride was evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting brown oil was dissolved in ice-water and was neutralized with a concentrated aqueous NaOH solution. After evaporation of the solvent, the solid residue was suspended in 70 mL of H 2 O.

of the formula I in which R 1 , R 2 , m and k have the meanings indicated in claim 1 , and their salts, novel intermediates and processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention. The compounds of the formula I are potent a receptor ligands and show 5-HT reuptake-inhibiting actions and can be used for the production of medicaments, for example for the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system, of strokes, brain or bone marrow traumata or of ischaemic states. The invention relates to compounds of the formula I in which R 1 is 2- or 3-indolyl which is unsubstituted or mono- or disubstituted by Hal, CN, A, AO, OH, CONH 2 , CONHA, CONA 2 , COOH and/or COOA, or is 5H-1,3-dioxolo-4,5-f-7-indolyl, R 2 is benzyl which is unsubstituted or mono-, di- or trisubstituted by A, AO, OH, Hal, CN, NO 2 , NH 2 , NHA, NA 2 , CF 3 , COA, CONH 2 , COOH, CONHA, CONA 2 , OSO 2 A and/or OSO 2 CF 3 or is phenylhydroxymethyl, Hal is F, Cl, Br or I, A is straight-chain or branched alkyl having 1-10 C atoms, which can be substituted by 1 to 5 F and/or Cl atoms or is cycloalkyl having 3-10 C atoms, k is 0 or 1 and m is 1, 2, 3 or 4 and their physiologically acceptable salts and solvates. Compounds of similar structure are disclosed, for example, in the documents WO 95/02592 or WO 95/33743. The invention is based on the object of finding novel compounds having useful properties, in particular those which can be used for the production of medicaments. It has now been found that the compounds of the formula I and their salts have particularly useful pharmacological properties together with good tolerability. They exhibit actions on the central nervous system and have potent anti-epileptic and especially antiischaemic properties (this was shown in the model of transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats and reduction of the neurological scores). These substances are potent receptor ligands with neuroprotective properties (M. ONeill et al., European J. Pharmacol. 283 (1995), 217-225). Compounds which act as receptor ligands also affect the NMDA ion channel complex (see also H. Yamamoto et al., J. Neuroscience (1995), 15(1), 731-736). Agonists additionally have a favourable effect on age-related memory disorders (cf. Maurice et al., Brain Research 733 (1996), 219-230). Some of the compounds of the formula I furthermore show a strong 5-HT reuptake-inhibiting action. For such compounds, a particularly good antidepressant, anxiolytic action, as well as a positive effect on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), eating disorders such as bulimia, tardive dyskinesias, learning disorders, age-dependent memory disorders and psychoses are to be expected. Compounds of the formula I and their physiologically acceptable acid addition salts have particularly useful pharmacological properties together with good tolerability. The compounds are suitable for the treatment of schizophrenia, cognitive deficits, anxiety, depression, nausea, tardive dyskinesia, gastrointestinal tract disorders or Parkinsonism. They exhibit actions on the central nervous system, especially 5-HT reuptake inhibiting actions. For the ex-vivo detection of serotonin reuptake inhibition, synaptosomal uptake inhibition (Wong et al., Neuropsychopharmacol. 8 (1993), 23-33 and p-chloroamphetamine antagonism (Fuller et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 212 (1980), 115-119) are used. Since these substances, as a ligands, have a neuroprotective action, they are also suitable, in particular, as therapeutics for the treatment of stroke, for the treatment of cerebral and bone marrow traumata, and also for the treatment of ischaemic conditions after a cardiac arrest. The compounds of the formula I are therefore suitable both in veterinary and in human medicine for the treatment of functional disorders of the central nervous system and of inflammations. They can be used for the prophylaxis and for the control of the sequelae of cerebral infarcts (cerebral apoplexia) such as stroke and cerebral ischaemias, and for the treatment of extrapyramidal motor side effects of neuroleptics and of Parksinsons disease, for the acute and symptomatic therapy of Alzheimers disease and also for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. They are also suitable as therapeutics for the treatment of cerebral and bone marrow traumata. However, they are also suitable as pharmaceutical active compounds for axiolytics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, neuroleptics, antihypertensives and/or for positively affecting obsessive-compulsive disorder, sleep disorders, tardive dyskinesias, learning disorders, age-dependent memory disorders, eating disorders such as bulimia and/or sexual function disorders. The invention thus relates to the compounds of the formula I and their physiologically acceptable acid addition salts.

The compounds (d), (e) and (f) are used as intermediates. For all radicals which occur several times, such as, for example, A, it applies that their meanings are independent of one another. The term solvates means for example the hemi- mono- or dihydrates or for example addition compounds with alcohols. The radical A is alkyl and has 1 to 10, preferably 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, in particular 1 or 2, C atoms.

Resulting from this, CONHA is preferably N-methylcarbamoyl or N-ethylcarbamoyl; CONA 2 is preferably N,N-dimethyl-carbamoyl or N,N-diethylcarbamoyl. Hal is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, in particular fluorine or chlorine. k is 0 or 1, preferably 0. If k is 1, intermediates for the synthesis of the actual active compounds are concerned. m is 1, 2, 3 or 4, in particular 3 or 4. The radical R 1 is 2- or 3-indolyl which is preferably unsubstituted or mono- or disubstituted, but in particular monosubstituted, by Hal, CN, A, AO, OH, CONH 2 , CONHA, CONA 2 , COOH and/or COOA, additionally also 5H-1,3-dioxolo4,5-f-7-indolyl, which can likewise be unsubstituted, mono- or disubstituted, preferably by Hal, CN, A, AO or OH, in particular, however, this radical is present in unsubstituted form.

The radical R 2 is preferably benzyl or phenylhydroxymethyl which is unsubstituted or mono-, di- or trisubstituted by Hal, OH, OA, A, NH 2 , NHA, NA 2 , CONH 2 , CONHA, CONA 2 , COOH, COA, CF 3 , CN, OSC 2 A, OSO 2 CF3 and/or NO 2 . Accordingly, R 2 is particularly preferably benzyl, phenylhydroxymethyl or benzyl or phenyl-hydroxymethyl which is monosubstituted by Hal, i.e., for example, p-fluorobenzyl or p-fluorophenylhydroxy-methyl, p-methylbenzyl or p-methylphenylhydroxymethyl, p-chlorobenzyl or p-chlorophenylhydroxymethyl.

For the entire invention, it applies that all radicals which can occur several times in one molecule can be identical or different, i.e. are independent of one another. Accordingly, the invention relates in particular to those compounds of the formula I in which at least one of the radicals mentioned has one of the preferred meanings indicated above. Some preferred groups of compounds can be expressed by the formulae Ia to Ik below, which correspond to the formula I and in which the radicals which are not designated in greater detail have the meaning indicated in the formula I, but in which in Ia R 1 is unsubstituted 3-indolyl; in Ib R 1 is 3-indolyl substituted in the 5-position; in Ic k is 0 and m is 4; in Id k is 1 and m is 3; in Ie R 1 has a meaning indicated in Ib and the substituent is Hal, methoxycarbonyl, CN or carboxyl; in If R 1 is 5H-1,3-dioxolo4,5-findol-7-yl; in Ig R 2 is unsubstituted benzyl; in Ih R 2 has a meaning indicated in Ig, but where the benzyl ring is present in monosubstituted form; in Ii R 2 has a meaning indicated in Ih and the substituent is Hal; in Ij R 2 is unsubstituted or monosubstituted phenyl-hydroxymethyl; in Ik R 2 has a meaning indicated in Ij and the substituent is Hal. The invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of compounds of the formula I and of their salts and solvates, characterized in that a compound of the formula II in which R 2 has the meaning indicated, is reacted with a compound of the formula III R 1 (CH 2 ) m (CO) k L(III) in which L is Cl, Br, I, OH, OCOA, OCOPh, OSO 2 A, OSO 2 Ar, where Ar is phenyl or tolyl and A is alkyl, or is another reactive esterified OH group or easily nucleophilically substitutable leaving group and R 1 , m and k have the meanings indicated in the claims, or in a reductive amination a compound of the formula IV R 1 (CH 2 ) m1 CHO(IV) in which R 1 and m have the meanings indicated in claim 1 , is reacted with a compound of the formula II, or in that a compound otherwise corresponding to the formula I, but which instead of one or more hydrogen atoms contains one or more reducible group(s) such as CO and/or one or more additional CC and/or CN bond(s), is treated with a reducing agent, or in that a compound otherwise corresponding to the formula I, but which instead of one or more hydrogen atoms contains one or more solvolysable group(s), is treated with a solvolysing agent, and/or in that a radical R 1 and/or R 2 is optionally converted into another radical R 1 and/or R 2 by cleaving, for example, an OA group with formation of an OH group and/or derivatizing a CN, COOH or COOA group and/or in that, for example, a primary or secondary N atom is alkylated and/or a base or acid of the formula I obtained is converted into one of its salts by treating with an acid or base. The compounds of the formula I are otherwise prepared by methods known per se, such as are described in the literature (e.g. in standard works such as Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie Methods of Organic Chemistry, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart; Organic Reactions, John Wiley Sons, Inc., New York; DE-A 41 01 686), namely under reaction conditions such as are known and suitable for the reactions mentioned. In this case, use can also be made of variants known per se, but not mentioned here in greater detail. The starting substances for the claimed process can, if desired, also be formed in situ in such a way that they are not isolated from the reaction mixture, but immediately reacted further to give the compounds of the formula I. The compounds of the formula I are preferably obtained by reacting compounds of the formula II with compounds of the formula III. As a rule, the starting substances of the formulae II and III are known; the unknown compounds of the formulae II and III can easily be prepared analogously to the known compounds. The piperidine derivatives of the formula II are for the most part known. If they are not commercially available or known, they can be prepared by methods known per se. The indole derivatives of the formula III are for the most part known and in some cases also commercially available. Furthermore, it is possible to prepare the compounds from known compounds by electrophilic or, in certain cases, also nucleophilic aromatic substitutions. The starting substance used is preferably an appropriate indole-3-alkanoic acid (which can be prepared analogously to a Japp-Klingemann type Fischer indole synthesis, cf., for this, Bttcher et al., J. Med. Chem. 1992, 35 , 4020-4026 or Iyer et al., J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II 1973, 872-878). The acid group is then prepared for the reaction with the piperidine derivative by introduction of the reactive leaving group L, possibly after prior reduction of the acid group according to known methods, e.g. with lithium aluminium hydride in tetrahydrofuran, to the OH group. The reaction of the compounds II and III proceeds according to methods such as are known from the literature for the alkylation or acylation of amines. The components can be fused with one another without the presence of a solvent, if appropriate in a closed tube or in an autoclave. However, it is also possible to react the compounds in the presence of an indifferent solvent. Suitable solvents are, for example, hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene; ketones such as acetone, butanone; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-butanol; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dioxane; amides such as dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP); nitriles such as acetonitrile, and optionally also mixtures of these solvents with one another or mixtures with water. The addition of an acid-binding agent, for example of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate or of another salt of a weak acid of the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, preferably of potassium , sodium or calcium, or the addition of an organic base such as triethylamine, dimethylaniline, pyridine or quinoline or of an excess of piperazine derivative of the formula I, may be favourable. The reaction time, depending on the conditions used, is between a few minutes and 14 days; the reaction temperature is between approximately 0 and 150, normally between 20 and 130. It may be necessary, before carrying out this reaction, to protect other amino groups contained from alkylation or acylation by introduction of suitable protective groups. The expression amino protective group is generally known and relates to groups which are suitable for protecting an amino group from chemical reactions, but which are easily removable after the desired chemical reaction has been carried out at another position in the molecule. Since such protective groups and the introduction and removal of these are well known to the person skilled in the art from numerous literature references and textbooks, these do not have to be gone into in greater detail here. Compounds of the formula I can furthermore be obtained by reductive amination of compounds of the formula IV using compounds of the formula II. The starting substances of the formulae IV and II are known in some cases. If they are not known, they can be prepared by methods known per se. The reductive amination can be carried out in the presence of reducing agents such as, for example, NaBH 3 CN and NaBH(OAc) 3 . It is additionally possible to obtain a compound of the formula I by treating a precursor which, instead of hydrogen atoms, contains one or more reducible group(s) and/or one or more additional CC and/or CN bond(s), with a reducing agent, preferably at temperatures between 80 and 250 in the presence of at least one inert solvent. Reducible (replaceable by hydrogen) groups are, in particular, oxygen in a carbonyl group, hydroxyl, arylsulfonyloxy (e.g. p-toluenesulfonyloxy), n-benzenesulfonyl, n-benzyl or o-benzyl. It is fundamentally possible to convert compounds which only contain one group, or those which next to one another contain two or more of the abovementioned groups or additional bands, reductively to a compound of the formula I; in this case, substituents in the group I which are contained in the starting compound are simultaneously reduced. Preferably, nascent hydrogen or complex metal hydrides are used for this purpose, additionally Wolff-Kishner reduction, and reduction using hydrogen gas with transition metal catalysis. If nascent hydrogen is used as the reducing agent, this can be produced, for example, by treatment of metals with weak acids or with bases. Thus, for example, a mixture of zinc with alkali metal hydroxide solution or of iron with acetic acid can be used. The use of sodium or another alkali metal dissolved in an alcohol such as ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, amyl or isoamyl alcohol or phenol is also suitable. An aluminium-nickel alloy in alkaline-aqueous solution, if appropriate with addition of ethanol, can additionally be used. Sodium or aluminium amalgam in aqueous-alcoholic or aqueous solution is also suitable for the generation of the nascent hydrogen. The reaction can also be carried out in a heterogeneous phase, an aqueous and a benzene or toluene phase expediently being used. Reducing agents which can additionally be employed are particularly advantageously complex metal hydrides, such as LiAlH 4 , NaBH 4 , diisobutylaluminium hydride or NaAl(OCH 2 CH 2 OCH 3 ) 2 H 2 and also diborane, if desired with addition of catalysts such as BF 3 , AlCl 3 or LiBr. Suitable solvents for this purpose are in particular ethers such as diethyl ether, di-n-butyl ether, THF, dioxane, diglyme or 1,2-dimethoxyethane as well as hydrocarbons such as benzene. For reduction with NaBH 4 , first and foremost alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, and additionally water as well as aqueous alcohols, are suitable as solvents. According to these methods, the reduction is preferably carried out at temperatures between 80 and 150, in particular between approximately 0 and approximately 100. It is particularly advantageously possible to reduce CO groups in acid amides to CH 2 groups using LiAlH 4 in THF at temperatures between approximately 0 and 66. It is additionally possible to reduce one or more carbonyl groups to CH 2 groups according to the Wolff-Kishner method, e.g. by treatment with anhydrous hydrazine in absolute ethanol under pressure and at temperatures between approximately 150 and 250. The catalyst used is advantageously sodium alcoholate. The reduction can also be varied according to the Huang-Minlon method, by reacting with hydrazine hydrate in a high-boiling, water-miscible solvent such as diethylene glycol or triethylene glycol, in the presence of alkali, such as sodium hydroxide. As a rule, the reaction mixture is boiled for approximately 3-4 hours. The water is then distilled off and the hydrazone formed is decomposed at temperatures up to approximately 200. The Wolff-Kishner reduction can also be carried out at room temperature in dimethyl sulfoxide using hydrazine. It is moreover possible to carry out certain reductions by use of H 2 gas with catalytic action of transition metals, such as, for example, Raney Ni or Pd. It is also possible in this manner, for example, to replace Cl, Br, I, SH or, in certain cases, also OH groups by hydrogen. Likewise, nitro groups can be converted into NH 2 groups by catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/H 2 in methanol. Compounds which otherwise correspond to the formula I, but instead of one or more H atoms contain one or more solvolysable group(s), can be solvolysed, in particular hydrolysed, to give the compounds of the formula I. It is furthermore possible to convert a compound of the formula I into another compound of the formula I by methods known per se. Compounds of the formula I in which R 1 is a radical substituted by CONH 2 , CONHA or CONA 2 can be obtained by derivatization of corresponding substituted compounds of the formula I by partial hydrolysis. It is additionally possible first to hydrolyse cyano-substituted compounds of the formula I to acids and to amidate the acids with primary or secondary amines. The reaction of the free carboxylic acid with the amine under the conditions of a peptide synthesis is preferred. This reaction preferably takes place in the presence of a dehydrating agent, e.g. of a carbodiimide such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide, additionally propanephosphonic anhydride (cf. Angew. Chem. 92, 129 (1980)), diphenylphosphoryl azide or 2-ethoxy-N-ethoxycarbonyl -1,2-dihydroquinoline, in an inert solvent, e.g. a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, an ether such as THF or dioxane, an amide such as DMF or dimethylacetamide, a nitrile such as acetonitrile, at temperatures between approximately 10 and 40, preferably between 0 and 30. However, it is also particularly convenient to prepare the nitrites in the reverse manner, by elimination of water, starting from the amides, e.g. by means of trichloroacetyl chloride/Et 3 N Synthesis (2), 184 (1985) or with POCl 3 (J. Org. Chem. 26, 1003 (1961)). A base of the formula I obtained can be converted into the associated acid addition salt using an acid. Acids suitable for this reaction are those which yield physiologically acceptable salts. Thus it is possible to use inorganic acids, e.g. sulfuric acid, hydrohalic acids such as hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acids such as orthophosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulfamic acid, additionally organic acids, specifically aliphatic, alicyclic, araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic mono- or polybasic carboxylic, sulfonic or sulfuric acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, pivalic acid, diethylacetic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, pimelic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, 2-phenylpropionic acid, citric acid, gluconic acid, ascorbic acid, nicotinic acid, isonicotinic acid, methane- or ethanesulfonic acid, ethanedisulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenemono- and -disulfonic acids, laurylsulfuric acid. If desired, the free bases of the formula I can be set free from their salts by treatment with strong bases such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate, if no further acidic groups are present in the molecule. In those cases where the compounds of the formula I have free acid groups, salt formation can likewise be achieved by treatment with bases. Suitable bases are alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides or organic bases in the form of primary, secondary or tertiary amines. Compounds of the formula I according to the invention can be chiral as a result of their molecular structure and can accordingly occur in two enantiomeric or a number of diastereomeric forms. As a result of one or more chiral centres, they can therefore be present in racemic or in optically active form. Since the pharmaceutical activity of the racemates or of the stereoisomers of the compounds according to the invention can differ, it may be desirable to use the diastereomers or enantiomers. In these cases, the final product or else even the intermediates can be resolved into enantiomeric compounds, by chemical or physical measures known to the person skilled in the art, or even employed as such in the synthesis. In the case of racemic amines, diastereomers are formed from the mixture by reaction with an optically active resolving agent. Suitable resolving agents are, for example, optically active acids, such as the R and S forms of tartaric acid, diacetyltartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, lactic acid, suitably N-protected amino acids or the various optically active camphorsulfonic acids. Also advantageous is a chromatographic enantiomer separation with the aid of an optically active resolving agent (e.g. dinitrobenzoylphenylglycine, cellulose triacetate or other derivatives of carbohydrates or chirally derivatized methacrylate polymers attached to silica gel). Suitable eluents for this purpose are aqueous or alcoholic solvent mixtures. In the case of racemic acids, it is analogously possible to use optically active bases, such as, for example, the R and S form of 1-phenylethylamine, 1-naphthylethylamine, dihydroabietylamine, cinchonine or cinchonidine. Under particular conditions, however, it is also possible even during the synthesis to employ corresponding enantiomerically pure intermediates which have been prepared by one of the abovementioned processes. In this case, the chirality in the course of the further synthesis is retained. The invention additionally relates to the use of the compounds of the formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts for the production of pharmaceutical preparations, in particular by a non-chemical route. In this context, they can be brought into a suitable dose form together with at least one solid, liquid and/or semi-liquid excipient or auxiliary and, if appropriate, in combination with one or more other active compound(s). The invention additionally relates to compositions, in particular pharmaceutical preparations, comprising at least one compound of the formula I and/or one of its physiologically acceptable salts. These preparations can be employed as pharmaceuticals in human and veterinary medicine. Possible excipients are organic or inorganic substances which are suitable for enteral (e.g. oral) or parenteral administration or topical application and do not react with the novel compounds, for example water, vegetable oils, benzyl alcohols, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, carbohydrates such as lactose or starch, magnesium stearate, talc, petroleum jelly. Tablets, coated tablets, capsules, syrups, juices, drops or suppositories are in particular used for enteral administration, solutions, preferably oily or aqueous solutions, and also suspensions, emulsions or implants for parenteral administration, and ointments, creams or powders for topical application. The novel compounds can also be lyophilized and the lyophilizates obtained used, for example, for the production of injection preparations. The preparations indicated can be sterilized and/or can contain auxiliaries such as lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers and/or wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for affecting the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, colorants, flavourings and/or aromatic substances. If desired, they can also contain one or more further active compounds, e.g. one or more vitamins. The compounds of the formula I and their physiologically acceptable salts can be used in the therapeutic treatment of the human or animal body and in the control of diseases. They are suitable for the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system such as tension states, depression, anxiety states, schizophrenia, gastrointestinal tract disorders, nausea, tardive dyskinesia, Parkinsonism and/or psychoses and of side effects in the treatment of hypertension (e.g. with -methyldopa). The compounds can also be used in endocrinology and gynaecology, e.g. for the therapy of acromegaly, hypogonadism, secondary amenorrhoea, pre-menstrual syndrome, undesired puerperal lactation, and furthermore for the prophylaxis and therapy of cerebral disorders (e.g. migraines), in particular in geriatrics, similarly to certain ergot alkaloids. Particularly preferably, they can also be employed as therapeutics for the control of the sequelae of cerebral infarcts (cerebral apoplexy), such as stroke and cerebral ischaemias, and for the treatment of cerebral and bone marrow traumata. In this case, the substances according to the invention are as a rule administered in analogy to similarly acting known preparations, preferably in doses between approximately 0.1 and 500 mg, in particular between 0.2 and 300 mg per dose unit. The daily dose is preferably between approximately 0.001 and 250 mg/kg of body weight. The specific dose for each specific patient depends, however, on all sorts of factors, for example on the activity of the specific compound employed, on the age, body weight, general state of health, sex, on the diet, on the time and route of administration, on the excretion rate, pharmaceutical combination and severity of the particular disorder to which the therapy relates. Oral administration is preferred. Above and below, all temperatures are indicated in C. In the examples below, customary working up means: water is added, if necessary, the mixture is adjusted, if necessary, depending on the constitution of the final product, to a pH of between 2 and 10, and extracted with ethyl acetate or dichloromethane, the organic phase is separated off, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated and the residue is purified by chromatography on silica gel, a separation of the isomers described below also taking place, and/or by crystallization. R f values were obtained by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel. (M1) values were determined by FAB-MS (Fast Atom Bombardment Mass Spectroscopy). The specific rotations of the optically active compounds indicated were in each case measured on solutions of the free bases. EXAMPLE 1 a) A solution of 4-(5-fluoroindol-3-yl)butanoic acid obtainable, for example, by diazotization of the appropriately substituted aniline, condensation of the diazonium salt with ethyl 1-oxocyclohexane-2-carboxylate by the Japp-Klingemann method to give the corresponding 4-(5-fluoro-2-ethoxycarbonylindol-3-yl)butanoic acid and subsequent hydrolysis and decarboxylation of the ethoxycarbonyl group in THF is subjected to reduction using lithium aluminium hydride. After customary working up 4-(5-fluoroindol-3-yl)butanol is obtained. This is converted by reaction with methanesulfonyl chloride into the reactive 4-(5-fluoroindol-3-yl)-butyl methanesulfonate. b) A mixture of 2.80 g (0.0098 mol) of 4-(5-fluoroindol-3-yl)butyl methanesulfonate, 3.20 g (0.0097 mol) of (S)-()-mandelic acid/3-benzylpiperidine) and 3.80 g (0.0294 mol) of ethyldiisopropylamine is heated on a steam bath for about 96 hours in 100 ml of acetonitrile. The reaction mixture is then filtered and concentrated, and the residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate and extracted with water. The organic phase is worked up, and the residue is chromatographed on a silica gel column in ethyl acetate. The fractions were concentrated, the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and using ethanolic HCl the hydrochloride of 3-4-(3S)-3-benzylpiperidin-1-ylbutyl-5-fluoroindole was precipitated and worked up, m.p. 152.0-153.0 C., D 20 () 9.7 (c 1.0, dimethyl sulfoxide).

OBJECT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION Objects of the present invention are nitrogen heterocyclic aromatic derivatives and their use as anti-gestative, immunosuppressant and anti-tumoral agents. Object of the present invention is also a procedure for the preparation of nitrogen heterocyclic aromatic derivatives. Object of the present invention is again a pharmaceutical composition which contains, as active principle, at least one heterocyclic aromatic according to the present invention. STATUS OF THE TECHNIQUE Chemical classes of compounds endowed with anti-gestative activity are known, more specifically BE 866,728 reports a class of 3,5-diphenyl-1H-1,2,4 triazoles of the following general formula: where R 1 is an alkyl group C 1 -C 4 . EP11129 reports 1,2,4 triazoles derivatives of the following general structure: where R is hydrogen or methyl and R 1 is hydrogen or an alkyl group C 1 -C 4 , or R 1 and R 2 together form an additional bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms. BE 879,732 reports a class of compounds showing the following general structure: where, among the other possible substitutions, R is an hydrogen or a R 5 CO group where R 5 is chosen among alkyl C 1 -C 4 , alkenyl C 2 -C 4 and alkinyl C 2 -C 4 , whereas R 2 is a CH(R 7 )OR 8 where R 7 is an hydrogen or methyl and R 8 is like R 5 CO. In the above mentioned disclosed documents, the pharmacological data show how these compounds display a high anti-gestative activity after repeated parenteral administrations (daily up to 5 consecutive days). The literature describes the compound 3-(2-ethyl-phenyl)-5-(3-methoxy-phenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole, also identified by the code DL 111-IT (Reviews on Drug Metabolism Drug Interactions, Vol. IV, N. 23, 1982, A. Assandri, A: Omodei-Sale, G. Galliani). The mentioned DL 111-IT, reported in BE 879,732, did show an interesting anti-gestative activity in all the investigated animal species including the mouse, the rat, the hamster, the dog and monkeys. DL 111-IT has been proposed as anti-gestative agent for human use. These previously disclosed anti-gestative compounds, including the compound DL 111-IT, when tested according to a protocol which foresee a single dose parenteral treatment, displayed their activity at doses much higher than those required by multiple dose regimens. EP0080053 describes 3,5 diphenyl-1H-1,2,4 triazole derivatives that, as compared to the previously reported derivatives, have been structurally modified in order to obtain a high anti-gestative activity after a single-dose parenteral administration by subcutaneous and intramuscular route. The compounds described in EP0080053 have the following general structure: where, R is chosen between hydrogen and R 5 CO, where R 5 is a saturated or non-saturated aliphatic C 1 -C 20 hydrocarbon chain, R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are chosen among hydrogen and short-chain alkyl or alkoxyl, or R 1 and R 2 together form a methylendioxy group, R 4 is a saturated or non-saturated aliphatic C 1 -C 20 hydrocarbon group. The above mentioned derivatives, when given by single dose to rodents, displayed a high anti-gestative activity. This activity was however shown to be highly species-specific. Actually, while in rodents it was very high, in the higher mammal species, like the dog, the anti-gestative activity markedly decreased, due to a too slow hydrolysis rate of the administered products that undergo metabolism before the active principle become bioavailable. OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION Objective of the present invention is to make available nitrogen heterocyclic aromatic derivatives endowed with high anti-gestative activity when administered as single dose to different animal species including higher mammals and man. Objective of the present invention is also to make available nitrogen heterocyclic aromatic derivatives endowed with high immuno-suppressant activity. Again, objective of the present invention is to make available nitrogen heterocyclic aromatic derivatives endowed with non species-specific anti-gestative, immuno-suppressant and anti-tumour activity. Again, objective of the present invention is to make available nitrogen heterocyclic aromatic derivatives endowed with a sustained duration of action, thus able to display the desired activity by a single-dose treatment (anti-gesative activity) or by multiple dose treatments with wide inter-administration time intervals (immuno-suppressant and anti-tumor acitvities). Objective of the present invention is also to make available a pharmaceutical formulations, containing at least one nitrogen heterocyclic aromatic derivative as active principle, easy to be administered, well tolerated and able to allow a high therapeutic index. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION These and other objectives with further advantages which are clarified in the description below, are obtained by the nitrogen heterocyclic aromatic dervatives having the following general formula: when XY, X, YN; when XY, X, YN, C, CH; R is chosen between hydrogen, COR 8 where R 8 is a saturated or non-saturated C 1 -C 10 aliphatic hydrocarbon, or R represents any other group able to form a bond with nitrogen atom; R 1 has the following genera formula: where R 3 is chosen among hydrogen, halogen, alkyl or alkoxyl C 1 -C 10 , R 4 is chosen among hydrogen, alkyl or alkoxyl C 1 -C 10 , or R 3 and R 4 together form a ethylendioxy group; R 2 has the following general structure: where R 5 is chosen among: where ZOR 7 with R 7 is chosen among a saturated or non-saturated, linear or branched C 1 -C 20 aliphatic hydroacarbon, or is chosen according to the following formula: where R, R 1 , X, and Y are defined as above and R 6 is chosen among hydrogen, halogen, alkyl or alkoxyl C 1 -C 10 , or Z is chosen equal to NHR 8 where R 8 is a linear or branched C 1 -C 10 alkyl chain. Mentioned R 1 and R 2 are never located on two adjacent atoms of the heterocyclic aromatic ring. Namely, the mentioned nitrogen heterocyclic aromatic derivative of formula (I) is a derivative of imidazole and 1H-1,2,4-triazole respectively: According to the present invention, the mentioned derivative of formula (I) is a triazole derivative having the following general formula: where XYN, while the other substituents are defined as for the derivative of formula (I). Of particular interest are those derivatives of formula (IV) where R 6 is hydrogen, R 4 is OCH 3 or OCH 2 CH 3 , R 3 is hydrogen, R 5 is chosen equal to COZ where ZOR 7 with R 7 as a saturated linear aliphatic C 1 -C 12 hydrocarbon. Always according to the present invention, of particular interest were those derivatives having the following formulas: In addition according to the present invention, of particular interest were the two derivatives having the following formulas: As reported in the literature, see Potts K. T, J: Chem. Soc. 3451, (1954) and Potts K. T., Chem. Rew. 61, 99 (1961), Kubota and Uda, Chem. Pharm. Bull. 23(5), 955 (1975), due to the high mobility of the hydrogen atoms of 1,2,4-triazoles, compounds of formula (I) of the present invention where XYN, are to be regarded as a mixture of two tautomeric forms, i.e. those in which the hydrogen atom is located on one or the other of the two adjacent nitrogen atoms of the triazole ring. Depending on the nature of the substitutes at the 3 and 5 positions, a form may predominate on the other one. Consequently, both mentioned tautomeric forms must be considered as part of the present invention. It is known that tautomeric forms rapidly exchange in between and consequently behave as a dynamic equilibrium. Anyway, throughout the whole description and claims relative to the present invention, 3,5 diphenyl-1H-1,2,4-triazoles according to the present invention, will be numbered as reported above for derivative (V). The derivatives of the present invention are provided of anti-gestation, immuno-suppressive and anti-tumour activities. Particularly, the anti-gestative activity is displayed by a single dose regime and it does not requires a prolonged treatment. Furthermore, these derivatives show high therapeutic indexes, since a remarkable efficacy is achieved at doses much lower than the toxic ones able to induce undesirable adverse events. The compounds of the present invention of formula (I) when administered as a single parenteral injection displayed more than one pharmacological activity, namely: (a) they have proven to be highly effective in terminating pregnancy in rodent and non-rodent animal species; (b) they have proven to be highly effective in reducing both the humoural and cellular immunological response in animal models predictive for the pharmacological activity in humans (c) in addition, the compounds of the present invention while lacking of effectiveness in different tumour models, showed a specific marked activity on an model of human chorio-carcinoma transplanted in nude mice. The different pharmacological activities displayed by the derivatives object of the present invention, are attributable to a common mechanism of action. The reference model which explains this multiple pharmacological action is an atypical rapidly poliferating cell system, the placenta. As repcorted Aitken, Beaconsfield and Ginsher in their comprehensive review origin and formation of the placenta this system, during its early stage of development, has strong similarties to tumor (1). Among these in particular, the placenta is tolerated by the maternal host due to an alteration of the immune responsiveness with no inflammatory response to blastocyst and/or throphoblast invasion. Biochemical studies on placental tissue, during the early post-implantation period, demonstrated that the contra-gestational activity of 3,5 diaryl-1H-1,2,4-triazoles occurs through a selective action on the decidual and throphoblastic cells. Reasonably, this selective anti-proliferative action can also account for the activity of 3,5 diaryl-1H-1,2,4-triazoles against a gestational tumour like chorio-carcarcinoma. Finally, the immuno-suppressant response, which closely relates to the contra-gestational potency of 3,5 diaryl-1H-1,2,4-triazoles, may either be the early or the late response of the primary biochemical alterations. The derivatives object of the present invention are characterised by the presence of an easily hydrolysed bond through non species-specific enzymatic reactions occurring on R 5 group; this hydrolysis allows the release of the active principle that can display its in vivo action. The characteristic bond of R 5 group present in the derivatives object of the present invention, is different from the bonds described in the already disclosed derivatives, and it can be hydrolysed according to different mechanisms of reaction. Because of these properties, unlike the compounds already disclosed, the compounds objective of the present invention are also effective in higher mammal species, including humans. With the aim of evaluating whether inter-species difference could exist in the enzymatic reactions of the ester bond, compounds (XV), (XIV, VI) ad some known derivatives described in EP0080053 (compounds A, B and C) have been tested in vitro: where when R 4 is chosen as C 3 H 7 the compound is named A; where when R 4 is chosen as C 7 H 15 the compound is named B; Where when R 4 is chosen as C 8 H 23 the compound is named C; These compounds dissolved in an ethanol mother solution, when incubated in diluted (1:4 v/v, with saline, 0.9% NaCl) rat, dog and human serum at a 10 5 M concentration for 1 hour at 37 C. underwent enzymatic hydrolysis. The hydrolysis rates, expressed as n Moles/hour of the active principle formed, i.e. 3-(2-hydroxymethyl-phenyl)-5-(3-ethoxyphenyl)-1H-1,2,4 triazole, corresponding to the compound described in EP0080053, were measured. The values obtained, reported in Table 1, show how, in the higher species considered, i.e. the dog and man, the known products A, B and C undergo hydrolysis very slowly whereas compounds (XIV), (XV) and (VI), are rapidly metabolised both by rat, dog and human serum. TABLE 1 HYDROLYSIS RATE OF SELECTED 3-(3-ETHOXYPHENYL)- 5-(2-ACYL-CARBOXYMETHYL-PHENYL)-1H-1,2,4 TRIAZOLES, COMPOUNDS (XV), (XIV) and (VI) AND SELECTED 3-(3- METHOXYPHENYL)-5-(2-ACYLOXYMETHYL-PHENYL)-1H-1,2,4 TRIAZOLES, COMPOUNDS (A), (B) AND (C) Rate of Hydrolysis (nmoles/hour) COMPOUND RAT DOG MAN (XV) 120 120 120 A 120 16 12 (XIV) 120 120 120 B 120 3 2 (VI) 120 120 120 C 120 0.5 0.5 Since the metabolic attack (de-alkylation) of these structures, occurring in position meta with respect to the substituent R 1 of structure (II), gives rise to inactive or poorly active metabolites, a too slow hydrolysis of compounds A, B and C will lead to a marked reduction of the activity of these molecules in the higher species. On the contrary, as already mentioned, derivatives of the present invention of formula (I), can be usefully used in higher mammal species including the dog and man. The compounds of the present invention actually represent a class of new non-hormonal, non-prostaglandin, like, post-coital, post-implantation anti-fertility agents particularly useful for terminating pregnancy in mammals following a single dose treatment at very low doses. The pregnancy-terminating activity of the compounds of the present invention has been assessed by carrying out experiments in rats and dogs. In particular, female Sprague Dawley rats weighing 200-230 g. were mated and the presence of sperm was detected, was considered day one of pregnancy. Pregnancy was later confirmed at the time of autopsy by the presence of implantation sites in the uterus. Test compounds dissolved in sesame oil containing 20% benzyl benzoate (or suspended if insoluble), were administered subcutaneously, in a single injection, on day 7 of gestation. The animals were then autopsied on day 16 of pregnancy and the uteri were examined for evidence of pregnancy (implantation sites, foetal resorption or live foetuses), haemorrhage, and evidence of abnormalities of the uterus, placenta or foetuses, for reference see G. Galliani et al. Contraception, 23, 163-180 (198). The compounds were tested at different doses in order to study the dose-activity relationship and their activity, reported below in Table 2, has been expressed as ED 50 values. These values identify the dose levels which terminate pregnancy (absence of live foetuses) in 50% of the treated animals. For comparison purposes, the ED 50 of some related triazoles previously disclosed (Belgian patents 866 , 728 and 879, 732 and European patent application publication No. 11,129), are reported. In particular compound D (active principle), has the following structural formula: and it has been prepared as described in EP 11129, while compound E, prepared as described in BE 879732 and identified as DL111-IT, has the following formula: Table 2: Pregnancy Termination Activity in S.D.

Acute toxicity studies did show as the lethal doses of compounds (VI), LD 50 500 mg/kg, are of three order of magnitude higher than those anti-gestative. In another experiment carried out in Beagle bitches (0.9-4.5 y, 7-12.5 kg), compound (VI), i.e. 3-(2-decanoyl-oxymethylphenyl)-5-(3-ethoxy phenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole, when administered as a single intramuscular dose between the day of mating and the 25th day of gestation was found to be highly effective and very well tolerated. The compound was given intramuscularly in one depot site of the thigh muscle of the right hind leg dissolved in sesame oil at the dose of 5 mg/kg (11.1 moles/kg , 40 mg/mL, 0.2 mL/kg). The anti-gestative effectiveness was ascertained by exploratory laparatomy examining uterine horns where the presence of live or dead foetuses was deduced from the dimension and appearance of each uterine swelling, for methodological reference see G. Galliani et al., J. Small Animal Practice, 25, 211-222 (1984). Table 3: Contragestational Effect of Compound (VI), Given as Single I.M. Doses Between the Day of Mating and the 14 th Day of Gestation.

In experimental models of auto-immunity and skin transplantation they were able to reduce auto-antibody production as well as to prolong the skin graft survival. The immuno-suppressant activity of the compounds of the present invention was assessed by carrying out experiments in mice. In detail, the Antibody Response to Sheep Red Blood Cells (SRBC) and to Lipo-polysaccharide (LPS), was studied in B6D2F1 mice injected intravenously 10 8 SRBC (day 0). Direct (IgM) and indirect (IgG) plaque forming cells (PFC) were evaluated in the spleen 4 and 10 days later, Jerne et al. Science 140, 405 (1963) and Dresser and Wortis, Nature, 208, 859(1965). Indirect PCF were developed with rabbit anti-serum to mouse gamma globulin. B6D2F1 mice were immunised with 20 g LPS intra-peritoneally. Four days later, PCF were determined in the spleen by SRBC coated with LPS, Moller, Nature, 207, 1166(1965).

In particular compound of example 5 was highly effective in inhibiting the growth of a human chorio-carcinoma transplanted into nude mice. The potency of the tested compound was even higher than that displayed by methotrexate, the choice drug in the therapy of chorio-carcinoma. Noteworthy, choriocarcinoma is a gestational tumor derived from trophoblastic cells, which, together with decidual cells, was suggested as the target site of the anti-proliferative action or 3,5 diaryl-s-1,2,4 triazoles (Galliani et al. 1986). For their use in suppressing the immunological response, in terminating pregnancy, and in treating chorio-carcinoma, the compounds of the present invention are embodied into topical, transdermal and injectable dosage forms to be administered epicutaneously or parenterally, i.e. subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously. Such composition are formulated using proper transdermal delivery systems (epicutaneous dosing), aqueous (intravenous dosing) or non-aqueous vehicles (epicutaneous, subcutaneous and intramuscular dosing). As examples of such systems/vehicles, the following can be considered for epicutaneous, subcutaneous and intramuscular dosing: oils of vegetable origin or fatty esters such as sesame oil, corn oil, peanut oil, cotton seed oil, and ethyl oleate can suitably be employed. Other oily vehicles may as well be used provided that they are safe in the volume administered and do not interfere with the therapeutic efficacy of the preparation. As known to the art skilled man, these preparations may also contain anti-microbial agents, to prevent growth of micro-organisms in the preparation, and antioxidants, essentially to prevent the development of rancidity of the oily vehicle. These dosage forms in general contain from 1 to 10% (w/v) of at least one derivative or formula (I) object of the present invention, where the optimum dose/volume ratio depends on the selected dose and the species and size of the animal/subject to be administered. As an example, the compounds of the present invention can be advantageously prepared starting from a derivative (IX) of the following chemical formula: More particularly, when substituents R 1 and R 2 are in position 3 and 5 respectively, the corresponding derivative (XI) has the following chemical formula: The above mentioned derivative of Formula (XI), used as starting materials in the process of the present invention, is prepared according to different procedures already reported by the literature. In particular when XYN, the corresponding derivative (XI a) can be advantageously prepared as described in EP11129. In this case the method. This method consists in the rearrangement of hydrazones of substituted benzaldehydes with 4-hydrazino-1H-2,3-benzoxazines of formula (X) wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are as defined as for the derivatives of formula (I). This rearrangement simply occurs by refluxing the hydrazone III in a high boiling inert organic solvent, such as for instance, xylene, N,N-dimethylformamide, and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, for about 30 minutes and then recovering the compound II by filtration. Another suitable method for the preparation of the 2-hydroxymethyl-phenyl derivatives of formula (XI a), consists in the oxidation of the corresponding 2-methylphenyl triazoles, either directly to the alcohol (XI a) or to the corresponding carboxylic acid followed by a reduction of this latter to the alcohol (XI a). In the former case, ceric ammonium nitrate or silver (II)oxide are the oxidising agents which may be suitably employed, while in the latter, the oxidative step is carried out with any of the several oxidisers known in the art to transform a methyl group on an aromatic ring to a carboxylic group, such as permanganate, nitric acid, and dichromate, and the reductive step in easily performed with a metal hydride. Alternatively, the starting compounds of formula II can be prepared by following the process described in EP80053. Referring to compounds of formula (I), object of the present invention, the procedure for their preparation starting from the corresponding derivative of formula (IX) varies depending whether the substituent R is hydrogen or a group R 8 CO wherein R 8 has the same meaning as above in relation to derivatives of formula (I). When R is hydrogen, the derivative of formula (IX) is prepared according to different procedures already reported by the literature, in equimolar ratio with phosgene (COCl 2 ) and the resulting chloro-carbonate is left to react with a derivative Z where ZOR 7 and R 7 is chosen among a saturated or non-saturated, linear or branched aliphatic hydrocarbon C 1 -C 20 , or is chosen according to the following formula: where R, R 1 , X and Y are defined as above and R 6 is chosen among hydrogen, halogen, alkyl or alkoxyl C 1 -C 10 , or Z is chosen equal to NHR 8 where R 8 is a linear or branched C 1 -C 20 alkyl chain. The derivative of formula (I) where R is chosen as hydrogen, can be successively separated from the possible by-products formed during the reaction with phosgene. Phosgene to use is commercially available already dissolved in appropriate solvents. Following this procedure can be then prepared for example, derivatives (V), (VI) and (VII) of the present invention. Alternatively, when have to be synthesised derivatives of formula (I) where R 7 is chosen as (XII), asymmetric carbonates, or when R 7 is chosen as saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched C 1 -C 20 aliphatic hydrocarbon, derivative of formula (IX) can undergo reaction according to the following general scheme, in detail: both for the intermediates preparation (alcoholate and imidazolide) and for the end carbonate product, an inert solvent is chosen, i.e. chloroform, dichloro-methane, tetrahydrofuran: alcoholate recaratoon is carried out on the selected alcohol using as base NaH or matallic Na either in catalytic or stoichiometric amounts, temperature can be between 0 C. and 60 C. (optimal room temperature), while reaction time ranges between 30 min to 12 hours (optimal 1 hour); the synthesis of the imidazolide of the second alcohol is carried out us na as reagent carbonyl-diimidazole with temperature between 0 C. and 60 C. (optimal, room temperature), while reaction time ranges between 30 min to 12 hours (optimal 1 hour); the synthesis of the end carbonates products is carried out by mixing properly the solutions of the alcoholate and of the imidazolide for a time of 6 to 24 hours (optimal) 12 hours) at a temperature between 0 C. and 60 C. (optimal, room temperature). Merely as an example, not limiting the present invention, a general method for the synthesis of derivatives of formula (I), where R and R 3 are chosen as hydrogens, R 4 is chosen as ethoxyl, R 5 is chosen as COOR 7 where R 7 is a linear or branched C 1 -C 20 alkylic chain, is hereafter described: EXAMPLE 1 A 50 mL solution of 3-(2-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl)-5-(3-ethoxyphenyl)-1H-1,2,4 triazole (3 g, 10 mmoles) in tetrahydrofuran, at room temperature, is added an 80% NaH suspension (310 mg, 10 mmoles) in tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) . The reaction mixture is shacked at room temperature for 1 hour. The resulting solution is then added to a tetrahydrofuran solution containing the imidazolide of the selected alcohol obtained by reacting the alcoholic derivative (10 mmoles) with 1,1-carbonyl-diimidazole (1.65 g, 10 mmoles) in tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) for 1 hour at room temperature. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 12 hours, then solvent is take to dryness under vacuum and the residue re-dissolved in methylene chloride. The organic phase is washed with water, dried by anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 and evaporated under vacuum. The obtained crude material is purified by column chromatography on silica gel (eluent hexane-ethylacetate, 8:2, v/v). After evaporation of the solvents, the solid pure product obtained is re-dissolved in hexane, filtered and dried under vacuum. The compounds described below were prepared according to the procedure reported in Example 1.

In the following example 6, the synthesis of one derivative of formula (I), where the group R 7 is chosen of formula (XII), symmetric carbonates, is described: EXAMPLE 6 Preparation of Di-(2-(5-(3-ethoxyphenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl) phenylmethyl) carbonate (XVII) A 15 mL solution of 3-(2-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl)-5-(3-ethoxyphenyl)-1H-1,2,4 triazole (0.7 g, 2.4 mmoles) in tetrahydrofuran, at room temperature, is added a 80% NaH suspension (35 mg, 1.2 mmoles) in tetrahydrofuran (15 mL). The reaction mixture is shacked at room temperature for 1 hour. The resulting solution is then added 1,1-carbonyl-diimidazole (192 mg, 1.2 mmoles) in tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) for 1 hour at room temperature. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 12 hours. Solvent is taken to dryness under vacuum and the residue re-dissolved in methylene chloride. The organic phase is washed with water, dried by anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 and evaporated under vacuum. The obtained crude material is purified by column chromatography on silica gel (eluent hexane-ethylacetate, 7:3, v/v). After evaporation of the solvents, the solid pure product obtained is re-dissolved in hexane, filtered and dried under vacuum. 212 mg of the compound (XVII) are obtained. Yield 36%; melting point143-145 C. 1 H-NMR: 8.07 (2H, m), 7.69-7.38 (12H, m); 7.03 (2H,d, J8.4 Hz); 5.72 (4H, s) ; 4.12 (4H, q, J7.0 Hz), 1.37 (6H, t, J7.0 Hz);. 13 C-NMR: 158.74, 154.21, 133.59, 129.81 (2C), 128.97 (2C), 128.02 (2C), 118.18 (2C), 115.88, 112.00 (2C), 67.41, 63.13, 14.33. When R is chosen equal to CO R 8 , where R 8 is a saturated or a non saturated C 1 -C 10 aliphatic hydrocarbon, the hydroxy group of derivative (IX), will be protected according to known methods. Protected derivative (IXb) will be also obtained and acylated according to known methods in order to introduce the COR 8 group. Subsequently these acylated derivatives will be de-protected and allowed to react with phosgene as reported above. In the case of XYN, th e acylation reaction could be carried out as described by EP80053. When R 5 is chosen: Derivatives of formula (I) are advantageously prepared starting from derivative s of formula (IX) (eventually submitted to a previous acylation reaction as already described) by reaction with phosphoric acid or equivalents according to known methods. For example, following this procedure derivative (VIII), object of the present invention, is prepared. For derivatives of formula (I) , when XYN and RH, following the acylation procedure described above, both single compounds, where the substituent R is located on one of the two adjacent nitrogen atoms and mixtures of the two possible isomers can be obtained. In this latter case, being established that each isomer retains the same anti-gestative immuno-suppressant and anti tumour activity, the mixture can be separated into the single components by chemico-physical known methods. For example, the way a mixture can be resolved into the single components is a fractionated crystallisation, which take advantage of the different solubility of each compound in various solvents at different temperatures. Suitable solvents that can be used for this method are chosen as an example, among hexane, ethyl-acetate, C 1 -C 4 alkyl ethers, methylen chloride, light petroleum ether and mixtures thereof. A further illustrative example of a method useful for the separation of the isomers mixture is based on column chromatography, performed on non-acid, buffered adsorbents, as silica-gel buffered to ph7. Another example of a method useful for the separation of the isomer mixture is based on the use of preparative high pressure liquid chromatography (PHPLC), carried out on proper columns, for example filled with silica-gel esterified with octyl-silane or octyl-decylsilane. Other obvious procedures useful for resolving a mixture of isomers into the single components are intended to fall within the scopes of the invention. What is claimed is: 1.

RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application, Ser. No. 60/132,546, filed on May 5, 1999. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the field of transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) synthetase inhibitors, their preparation and their use as antimicrobial agents. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS) are a family of essential enzymes that are found in virtually every biological cell and are responsible for maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis. They specifically catalyze the aminoacylation of tRNA in a two step reaction: amino acid (AA)ATPAA-AMPPPi AA-AMPtRNAtRNA-AAAMP The enzyme binds adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and its specific amino acid to catalyze formation of an aminoacyl adenylate complex (AA-AMP) with concomitant release of pyrophosphate (PPi). In the second step, the amino acid is transferred to the 2 or 3 terminus of the tRNA yielding charged tRNA and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). The charged tRNA delivers the amino acid to the nascent polypeptide chain on the ribosome. There are at least twenty essential enzymes in this family for each organism. Inhibition of any of the essential tRNA synthetases disrupts protein translation, ultimately resulting in growth inhibition. Pseudomonic acid A, an antibacterial agent currently used in human therapy, provides clear evidence of the utility of tRNA synthetase inhibitors as useful pharmaceuticals. Pseudomonic acid A binds to one particular tRNA synthetase, isoleucyl tRNA synthetase, and inhibits isoleucyl adenylate formation in several Gram positive bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus , resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis, followed by growth inhibition. Novel synthetic compounds that target tRNA synthetases offer clear advantages as useful therapeutic agents to curb the threat of drug resistance. Drug resistance allows a pathogen to circumvent the biochemical disruption caused by an antimicrobial agent. This resistance can be a result of a mutation that has been selected for and maintained. Pathogens in the environment have had repeated exposure to current therapeutics. This exposure has led to the selection of variant antimicrobial strains resistant to these drugs. Novel synthetic antimicrobial agents, therefore, would be expected to be useful to treat drug resistant pathogens, since the pathogen has never been exposed to the novel antimicrobial agent. The development of compounds or combinations of compounds targeting more than one tRNA synthetase is also advantageous. Accordingly, inhibition of more than one enzyme should reduce the incidence of resistance since multiple mutations in a pathogen would be required and are statistically rare. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention discloses novel compounds which inhibit tRNA synthetases and have efficacy, including whole cell killing, against a broad spectrum of bacteria and fungi. Described herein are compounds that exhibit tRNA synthetase inhibition. The present invention comprises, in one aspect, compounds of Formula I.

Synthesis of N-alkylated hydroxy proline methyl esters (II) To a suspension of hydroxy-L-Proline methyl ester hydrochloride (I,1.1 mmol, 200 mg) in 3 ml dichloromethane in a 16 mm tube with a screw cap lid was added diisopropylethylamine (DIEA, 2.43 mmol, 0.43 ml). The suspension was sonicated for 2 minutes, then aryl chloride (R 1 CH 2 Cl, 1.05 mmol) and tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI, 0.05 mmol, 20 mg) were added. Reaction mixture was heated at 40 C. for 24 hr then cooled to room temperature and diluted with 5 ml of dichloromethane and 5 ml of aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate. The reaction mixture was shaken vigorously and the layers were separated. The organic layer was collected in a clean 16 mm tube and the solvent was evaporated under nitrogen stream to yield crude N-alkylated hydroxy proline II. Each intermediate was characterized by LC/MS and yielded a major peak corresponding to the molecular ion. Trans-3-hydroxy-L-proline methyl ester hydrochloride (I, XZH, YOH) was prepared by dissolving the corresponding trans-3-hydroxy-L -proline (7.6 mmol, 1 g) in 20 ml of methanol and 15 ml of 1M hydrochloric acid in ether.

R 2 Structure MS Data 55 404(M H ) 56 404(M H ) 57 405(M H ) 58 420(M H ) Biological Evaluation Enzymatic Activity IC 50 determinations for the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) isolated from pathogen or HeLa cells were carried out using a modification of the aaRS charging and trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay described previously (see examples: D. Kern et. al., Biochemie, 61, 1257-1272 (1979) and J. Gilbart et. al. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 37(1), 32-38 (1993)). The aaRS enzymes were prepared via standard cloning and expression methods and partially purified or partially purified from pathogen and HeLa cell extracts. The activity of each aaRS enzyme was standardized as trichloroacetic acid precipitable counts (cpm) obtained at 10 minutes reaction time at K m concentrations of substrates. For practical purposes, the minimal acceptable value is approximately 2000 cpm per 10 minute reaction. Preincubations for IC 50 determinations were initiated by incubating partially purified aaRS extracts in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mM dithiothreitol and 2.5% dimethyl sulfoxide with and without test compound (e.g. compound of the invention (preferably a compound of Formula I)) in a final volume of 20 microliters in a microtiter plate for 20 minutes at 25 C. Test compounds were typically present as serial dilutions in concentration ranges of 0.35 nM to 35 M. Test compound solutions were prepared by dissolving test compound in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide and diluting to the final concentration with 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. IC 50 determinations were typically performed in duplicate with each experiment containing 4-8 concentrations of inhibitor along with two no inhibitor controls. IC 50 incubations were initiated by supplementing the preincubation mixture to a final assay concentration of 10 mM MgCl 2 , 30 mM KCl, 10 mM KF, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 M-500 mM ATP, 2-20 M 3 H amino acid, and 90-180 M crude tRNA in a final volume of 35 microliters. The reaction was incubated at 25 C. for 5-20 minutes. At specified time points a 15 microliter aliquot was removed and added to a well of a Millipore filtration plate (Multiscreen-FB, MAFB NOB 10) containing 100 microliters of cold 5% (wt/vol) trichloroacetic acid. Trichloroacetic acid precipitable material was collected by filtration on Millipore Multiscreen filtration station, washed twice with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, twice with water, and dried. Plates were typically allowed to air dry for several hours or they were baked at 50 C. in a vacuum oven for 30 minutes. The radioactivity on the dried plates was quantitated by the addition of Packard Microscint-20 to the wells and counting with a Packard TopCount scintillation counter. Inhibitor activity was typically reported as a percentage of the control aaRS activity. The IC 50 value was determined by plotting per cent activity versus compound concentration in the assay and identifying the concentration at which 50% of the activity was remaining. The IC 50 values (in M) of representative compounds of the present invention are listed in Table 8. Whole Cell Antimicrobial Screens Compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against a panel of organisms according to standard procedures described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS document M7-A3, Vol. 13, No. 25, 1993/NCCLS document M27-P, Vol. 12, No. 25, 1992). Compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO and were diluted to the final reaction concentration (0.1 g/ml-500 g/ml) in microbial growth media. In all cases the final concentration of DMSO incubated with cells is less than or equal to 1%. For minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) calculations, 2-fold dilutions of compounds were added to wells of a microtiter plate containing 110 5 bacteria or fungal cells in a final volume of 200 lambda of an appropriate media (Mueller-Hinton Broth; Haemophilus Test Media; Mueller-Hinton Broth5% Sheep Blood; or RPMI 1690). Plates were incubated overnight at an appropriate temperature (30 C.-37 C.) and optical densities (measure of cell growth) were measured using a commercial plate reader.

J. Clement, et al., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 38 (5), 1071-1078, (1994). As exemplified below, this test is used to show the in vivo efficacy of the compounds of the present invention against bacteria or fungi. The in vivo antimicrobial activity of a compound of the invention (preferably a compound of Formula I) hereinafter referred to as test compound, is established by infecting male or female mice (5 mice/dose group5 doses/compound) weighing 20-25 g intraperitoneally with pathogen inoculum. The inoculum is prepared from a sample of pathogen obtained from the ATCC (for example, ATCC 29213, S. aureus ; ATCC 14154, S.aureus ; ATCC 8668, Strep. pyogenes ; ATCC 25922, E. coli ; ATCC 29212, E. faecalis ; ATCC 25238, M. catarrhalis ; and ATCC 90028, C. albicans ). Each bacterial strain is grown in its appropriate medium at 37 C. for 18 hr, most strains yielding between 10 8 and 10 9 colony forming units (CFU)/ml under these conditions. The overnight culture is serially diluted to an appropriate content and then 0.5 ml of each dilution is added to 4.5 ml of 5% hog gastric mucin to prepare the infecting inoculum. Each mouse is injected with 0.5 ml of the inoculum intraperitoneally (i.p.), five animals per dilution. The 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ) and the minimal lethal dose (MLD, the dose causing 100% death of the animals) is calculated on the basis of the number of mice surviving after 7 days. The MLD established for each of the pathogens is used as inoculum dose in the mouse protection tests. The test compound is dissolved in a sterile vehicle appropriate for its method of delivery (for example, 30% HPB (hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin), pH, 7.4 or 0.05M Tris.HCl). A vehicle group (dose0) serves as a placebo control for each compound and each pathogen. The dose for the test compound is determined based on the MIC data. A series of dilutions of a test compound is prepared in the vehicle. A group of 5 mice are used for each test compound dose and the vehicle. There are 5-6 doses for each compound. Each animal is used for one experiment only. Mice are infected i.p. with 0.5 ml of the MLD of pathogen in 5% hog gastric mucin by one researcher and immediately administered compound (s.c., p.o. or i.v. in volumes indicated above) by a second researcher. The 50% protective dose (PD 50 ) is calculated from the dose response curve established on the basis of the numbers of mice surviving for 7 days after treatment. In each experiment, a group of positive control with a commercially available antibiotic for example, is also included. All of the references, patents and patent publications identified or cited herein are incorporated, in their entirety, by reference. Although this invention has been described with respect to specific embodiments, the details of these embodiments are not to be construed as limitations.

CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 09/028,452, filed Feb. 24, 1998 now abandoned; which claims priority of Federal Republic of Germany Patent Application No. 19707656.4, filed Feb. 26, 1997, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compounds of formula I, in which X1, X2, X3, X4, Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, R(3), R(4) and R(5) have the meanings in the following, their preparation and their use, in particular in pharmaceuticals. The compounds affect the potassium channel opened by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or the I Ks channel and are outstandingly suitable as pharmaceutical active compounds, for example for the prophylaxis and therapy of cardiovascular disorders, in particular arrhythrnias, for the treatment of ulcers of the gastrointestinal region or for the treatment of diarrheal disorders. In pharmaceutical chemistry, in recent years the 4-acylaminochroman derivatives class and their homologs and analogs have been worked on intensively. The most prominent representative of this class is cromakalim of the formula A, an example of a homolog is the compound of the formula B ( J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans . 1 (1991), 2763). Cromakalim and other related 4-acylaminochroman derivatives are compounds having a relaxant action on smooth-muscular organs, such that they are used for lowering raised blood pressure as a result of vascular muscle relaxation and in the treatment of asthma as a result of the relaxation of the smooth musculature of the airways. It is common to all these preparations that they act at the cellular level, for example, of smooth muscle cells and lead there to opening of specific ATP-sensitive K channels. The increase in negative charge in the cell (hyperpolarization) induced by the efflux of K ions counteracts, via secondary mechanisms, the increase in the intracellular Ca 2 concentration and thus cell activation, which leads, for example, to muscle contraction. The compounds of formula I according to the invention differ structurally from these acylainino derivatives, in particular by the replacement of the acylamino group by a sulfonylamino function. While cromakalim (formula A) and the homologs of the formula B and analogous acylamino compounds act as openers of ATP-sensitive K channels, the compounds of formula I according to the invention having the sulfonylamino structure, however, do not show any opening action on this K (ATP) channel, but surprisingly show a strong and specific blocking (closing) action on a K channel which is opened by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and differs fundamentally from the K (ATP) channel mentioned. More recent investigations show that this K (cAMP) channel identified in colonic tissue is very similar, perhaps even identical, to the I Ks channel identified in the cardiac muscle. In fact, it was possible for the compounds of formula I according to the invention to show a strong blocking action on the I Ks channel in guinea-pig cardiomyocytes and on the I Ks channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes. As a result of this blockage of the K (cAMP) channel or of the I Ks channel, the compounds according to tie invention display pharmacological actions of high therapeutic utility in the living body. Beside the abovementioned cromakalim or acylaminochroman derivatives, compounds having 4-sulfonylaminochroman structure are also described in the literature which, however, differ markedly in structure or in biological action from the compounds of formula I according to the invention. Thus, EP-A-315 009 describes chroman derivatives having 4-phenylsulfonylamino structure, which are distinguished by antithrombotic and antiallergic properties. EP-A-389 861 and EP-A-370 901 describe 3-hydroxychroman derivatives having a 4-sulfonylamino group, which are described as K (ATP) channel activators or have CNS actions. Further 4-sulfonylaminochroman derivatives are described in Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett . 4 (1994), 769-773: N-Sulfonamides of Benzopyran-Related Potassium Channel Openers: Conversion of Glyburyde Insensitive Smooth Muscle Relaxants to Potent Smooth Muscle Contractors.

Alkyl radicals and alkylene radicals can be straight-chain or branched. This also applies to the alkylene radicals of the formulae C n H 2n , C m H 2m , C x H 2x and C r H 2r . Alkyl radicals and alkylene radicals can also be straight-chain or branched if they are substituted or are contained in other radicals, e.g. in an alkoxy radical or in an alkylmercapto radical or in a fluorinated alkyl radical. Examples of alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, n-hexyl, 3,3-dimethylbutyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, heptadecyl, octadecyl, nonadecyl, or eicosyl. The bivalent radicals derived from these radicals, e.g. methylene, 1,1-ethylene, 1,2-ethylene, 1,1-propylene, 1,2-propylene, 2,2-propylene, 1,3-propylene, 1,4-butylene, 1,5-pentylene, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propylene, 1,6-hexylene, etc. are examples of alkylene radicals. Examples of acyl radicals are formyl, acetyl, propionyl, n-butyryl or isobutyryl. N-containing heterocycles having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 carbon atoms are in particular the aromatic systems 1-, 2- or 3-pyrrolyl, 1-, 2-, 4- or 5-imidazolyl, 1-, 3-, 4- or 5-pyrazolyl, 1, 2, 3-triazol-1-, -4- or 5-yl, 1,2,4-triazol-1-, -3- or -5-yl, 1- or 5-tetrazolyl, 2-, 4- or 5-oxazolyl, 3-, 4- or 5-isoxazolyl, 1,2,3-oxadiazol-4- or 5-yl, 1,2,4-oxadiazol-3- or 5-yl, 1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl or -5-yl, 2-, 4- or 5-thiazolyl, 3-, 4- or 5-isothiazolyl, 1,3,4-thiadiazol-2- or -5-yl, 1,2,4-thiadiazol-3- or -5-yl, 1,2,3-thiadiazol-4- or 5-yl, 2-, 3- or 4-pyridyl, 2-, 4-, 5- or 6-pyrimidinyl, 3- or 4-pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-indolyl, 1-, 2-, 4- or 5-benzimidazolyl, 1-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-indazolyl, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-quinolyl, 1-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-isoquinolyl, 2-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-quinazolinyl, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-cinnolinyl, 2-, 3-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-quinoxalinyl, 1-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-phthalazinyl. Particularly preferred N-containing heterocycles are pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, quinolyl, pyrazolyl, pyridyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl and pyridazinyl. Thienyl is either 2- or 3-thienyl. Monosubstituted phenyl radicals can be substituted in the 2-, the 3- or the 4-position, disubstituted phenyl radicals in the 2,3-, 2,4-, 2,5-, 2,6-, 3,4- or 3,5-position. Correspondingly, the same also applies analogously to the N-containing heterocycles or the thiophene radical. In the case of disubstitution of a radical, the substituents can be identical or different. If the radicals R(1) and R(2) together are an alkylene chain, these radicals with the carbon atom carrying them form a ring which has a carbon atom in common with the 7-membered ring in the formula I; thus a spiro compound is then present. If R(7) and R(10) together are a bond, a double bond is present between the groups X1 and X2. Correspondingly, if R(5) and R(11) together are a bond, a double bond is present between the group X4 and the carbon atom which carries the radical R(3)SO 2 NR(4). If R(17) and R(18) together are a bond, the group R(17)C x H 2x NR(18) is preferably a nitrogen heterocycle bonded via a nitrogen atom. If R(17) and R(18) together are a bond and the group R(17)C x H 2x NR(18) is a nitrogen heterocycle bonded via a nitrogen atom, this nitrogen heterocycle is preferably a 4-membered ring or a ring larger than a 4-membered ring, e.g. a 5-membered ring, 6-membered ring or 7-membered ring. If Y1 and Y2 together are a sulfur atom, the structural unitY2Y1 is thus S, thus the 7-membered ring in the formula I is in this case fused to a thiophene ring. If the compounds of formula I contain one or more acidic or basic groups or one or more basic heterocycles, the invention also relates to the corresponding physiologically or toxicologically tolerable salts, in particular the pharmaceutically utilizable salts. Thus the compounds of formula I which carry acidic groups, e.g. one or more COOH groups, can be used, for example, as alkali metal salts, preferably sodium or potassium salts, or as alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium or magnesium salts, or as ammonium salts, e.g. as salts with ammonia or organic amines or amino acids. Compounds of formula I which contain one or more basic, i.e. protonatable, groups or contain one or more basic heterocyclic rings, can also be used in the form of their physiologically tolerable acid addition salts with inorganic or organic acids, for example as hydrochlorides, phosphates, sulfates, methanesulfonates, acetates, lactates, maleates, fumarates, malates, gluconates etc. If the compounds of formula I simultaneously contain acidic and basic groups in the molecule, in addition to the salt forms described, the invention also includes internal salts, so-called betaines. Salts can be obtained from the compounds of formula I by customary processes, for example by combination with an acid or base in a solvent or dispersant or alternatively from other salts by anion exchange. When appropriately substituted, the compounds of formula I can be present in stereoisomeric forms. If the compounds of formula I contain one or more centers of asymmetry, these can independently of one another have the S configuration or the R configuration. The invention includes all possible stereoisomers, e.g. enantiomers or diastereomers, and mixtures of two or more stereoisomeric forms, e.g. enantiomers and/or diastereomers, in any desired ratios. The invention thus relates to enantiomers, for example, in enantiomerically pure form, both as levo- and dextrorotatory antipodes, and also in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in different ratios or in the form of racemates. If cis/trans isomerism is present, both the cis form and the trans form and mixtures of these forms are included in the invention. The preparation of individual stereoisomers can be carried out, if desired, by resolution of a mixture according to customary methods or, for example, by stereoselective synthesis. If mobile hydrogen atoms are present, the present invention also includes all tautomeric forms of the compounds of formula I. The compounds of formula I can be prepared by different chemical processes. Thus, for example, a compound of formula I is obtained by a) reacting a compound of formula IIa or of formula IIb in which X1, X2, X3, X4, Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4 and R(5) have the meanings indicated above and L is a nucleofugic leaving group, in particular a customary nucleofugic leaving group such as, for example, F, Cl, Br, I, methanesulfonyloxy or p-toluenesulfonyloxy, in a manner known per se with a sulfonamide or its salts of formula III in which R(3) and R(4) have the meanings indicated above and M is hydrogen or preferably a metal atom, particularly preferably lithium, sodium or potassium, or in the case of a reaction with a compound of formula IIb, also a trialkylsilyl radical, e.g. a trimethylsilyl radical; or by b) reacting a compound of formula IV in which X1, X2, X3, X4, Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, R(4) and R(5) have the meanings indicated above, with a sulfonic acid derivative of the formula V in which R(3) has the meanings indicated above and W is a nucleofugic leaving group, such as, for example, fluorine, bromine, 1-imidazolyl, but in particular chlorine; or by c) reacting a compound of formula VI in which X1, X2, X3, X4, Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, R(3), R(5) and M have the meanings indicated above, in a manner known per se in the sense of an alkylation reaction with an alkylating agent of formula VII: R(4)LVII in which R(4) has the meanings indicated above with the exception of hydrogen and L has the meanings indicated above; or by d) carrying out, in a compound of formula I in which X1, X2, X3, X4, Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, R(3), R(4) and R(5) have the meanings indicate above, an electrophilic substitution reaction in at least one of the positions Y1 to Y4, provided a CH group is present in this position, or carrying out a chemical conversion, e.g. an alkylation or acylation, in at least one of the positions X1 to X4. The procedure a) corresponds to the nucleophilic substitution of a leaving group in a reactive bicyclic system of formula Ia or IIb by a sulfonamide or one of its salts of formula III. Because of the higher nucleophilicity and higher reactivity of a sulfonamide present in the salt form, when using a free sulfonamide (formula III, MH) it is preferred to generate a sulfonamide salt (formula III, Mmetal cation) from this first by the action of a base. If a free sulfonamide (formula III, MH) is employed, the deprotonation of the sulfonamide to the salt can be carried out in situ. Preferably, those bases are used which are not alkylated or only slightly alkylated themselves, such as, for example, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sterically strongly hindered amines, e.g. dicyclohexylamine, N,N-dicyclohexylethylamine, or other strong nitrogen bases with low nucleophilicity, for example DBU (diazabicycloundecene), N,N,N-triisopropylguanidine etc. However, it is also possible to employ other customarily used bases for the reaction, such as potassium tert-butoxide, sodium methoxide, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates, alkali metal hydroxides, such as, for example LiOH, NaOH or KOH, or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, such as, for example Ca(OH) 2 . In the case of a reaction of an epoxide of the formula IIb with a trialkyl- or trimethylsilylsulfonamide of formula III, it is advantageous to carry out the reaction in the presence of a fluoride, e.g. tetrabutylammonium fluoride. The reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent, particularly preferably in polar organic solvents such as, for example, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), tetramethylurea (TMU), hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPT), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethoxyethane (DE) or other ethers, or, for example, alternatively in a hydrocarbon such as toluene or in a halogenated hydrocarbon such as chloroform or methylene chloride, etc. However, the reaction can also be carried out in polar protic solvents, such as, for example, in water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol or its oligomers and their corresponding hemiethers or alternatively their ethers. The reaction can also be carried out in mixtures of these solvents. The reaction can equally be carried out, however, entirely without solvent. The reaction is preferably carried out in a temperature range from 10 to 140 C., particularly preferably in the range from 20 to 100 C. Favorably, procedure a) can also be carried out under the conditions of a phase-transfer catalysis. The compounds of formula Ia are obtained by methods known from the literature, for example from the corresponding alcohols (formula IIa, LOH, R(5)H) by the action of a hydrogen halide of the formula HL (LCl, Br, I) or by the action of an inorganic acid halide (e.g. POCl 3 , PCl 3 , PCl 5 , SOCl 2 , SOBr 2 ), or, for example, by free-radical halogenation of the corresponding compounds of formula IIa where LH and R(5)H with elemental chlorine or bromine or with halogenating agents which can be activated by free radicals, such as, for example, N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) or sulfuryl chloride (SO 2 Cl 2 ). In the case of free-radical halogenation, the reaction is in general carried out in the presence of a radical chain initiator such as energy-rich light of the visible or ultraviolet wave range or using a chemical free-radical initiator such as, for example, azodiisobutyronitrile. The compounds of formula IIa, in which X4 is NR(11) and R(5) together with R(11) is a bond, are obtained, for example, from the corresponding lactams (formula IIa, L and R(5) are together a carbonyl oxygen atom, X4NH) by the action of an inorganic acid halide (e.g. POCl 3 , PCl 3 , PCl 5 , SOCl 2 , SOBr 2 ). The compounds of formula IIb are obtained by methods known from the literature, from the corresponding olefins of the formula IIc in which X1, X2, X3, Y1, Y2, Y3 and Y4 have the meanings indicated above, e.g. by the action of a suitable inorganic or organic peroxide, such as, for example, H 2 O 2 or m-chloroperbenzoic acid, or by base-catalyzed cyclization of the corresponding bromohydrin, which can be obtained from IIc, for example, by reaction with N-bromosuccinimide and water. The epoxides of formula IIb can also be obtained in optically pure form from the olefins of the formula IIc by oxidation in the presence of the chiral Jacobsen catalyst, such as, for example, in Tetrahedron Lett . 32 (1991), 5055. The procedure b) corresponds to the reaction, which is known per se and frequently used, of a reactive sulfonyl compound of formula V, in particular of a chlorosulfonyl compound (WCl), with an amino derivative of formula IV to give the corresponding sulfonamide derivative of formula I. The reaction can also be carried out without solvent, but reactions of this type are in most cases carried out using a solvent. The reaction is preferably carried out using a polar solvent, particularly preferably in the presence of a base, which itself can advantageously be used as a solvent, e.g. using triethylamine or in particular pyridine or its homologs. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, aliphatic alcohols, e.g. methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, sec-butanol, ethylene glycol, monoalkyl- and dialkyl ethers of monomeric and oligomeric ethylene glycol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diallylated amides such as DMF, DMA, and also TMU and HMPT. In this case, the reaction is in general carried out at a temperature from 0 to 160 C., preferably from 20 to 100 C. The amines of formula IV are obtained in a manner known from the literature, preferably from the corresponding carbonyl compounds of formula VIII in which X1, X2, X3, X4, Y1, Y2, Y3 and Y4 have the meanings indicated above and A is oxygen, either with ammonia or an amine of formula IX R(4)NH 2 IX in which R(4) has the meanings indicated, under reductive conditions or reductive catalytic conditions, preferably at elevated temperature and in an autoclave. In this case, by condensation reaction of the ketones of formula VIII (Aoxygen) and of the amines of the formula IX in situ, Schiff bases of formula VIII in which a is R(4)-N are primarily formed, which can be converted directly, i.e. without prior isolation, under reductive conditions into the amines of formula IV. However, the Schiff bases (formula VIII, A is R(4)-N) intermediately formed, in the condensation reaction, from the compounds of formulae VIII and IX can be prepared by methods known from the literature and first isolated in order to then convert them in a separate step with a suitable reducing agent, such as, for example, NaBH 4 , LiAlH 4 , NaBH 3 CN or by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of, for example, Raney nickel or a noble metal such as, for example, palladium, into the compounds of formula IV. The compounds of formula IV in which R(4) is hydrogen can advantageously also be obtained in a manner known from the literature by reduction of oximes or oxime ethers (formula VIII, A is NOR, RH or alkyl) or hydrazones (formula VIII, A is NNR 2 , R, for example H or alkyl), e.g. using a complex metal hydride or by catalytic hydrogenation. The oximes and hydrazones necessary for this purpose are preferably prepared in a manner known per se from the ketones of formula VIII (Aoxygen) with hydrazine or one of its derivatives or, for example, with hydroxylamine hydrochloride under dehydrating conditions. The procedure c) represents the alkylation reaction known per se of a sulfonamide or of one of its salts (formula VI) with an allylating agent (formula VII). Corresponding to the analogy of the reaction to procedure a), the reaction conditions already described in detail under procedure a) apply to procedure c). The preparation of the sulfonamide derivatives of formula VI and their precursors has already been described in procedure b). The preparation of the alkylating agents of formula VII is carried out analogously to procedures in the literature or as described under procedure a), preferably from the corresponding hydroxy compounds (formula VII, Lhydroxyl). The procedure d) corresponds to the further chemical conversion of compounds of formula I according to the invention into other compounds of formula I according to the invention, e.g. by electrophilic substitution reactions in one or in more of the positions marked by Y1 to Y4, if these are CH. Preferred substitution reactions are: 1. Aromatic nitration for the introduction of one or more nitro groups, which in subsequent reactions can in some cases or all be reduced to amino groups. The amino groups can in turn be converted into other groups in subsequent reactions, for example in a Sandmeyer reaction, e.g. for the introduction of cyano groups; 2. Aromatic halogenation, in particular for the introduction of chlorine, bromine or iodine; 3. Chlorosulfonation, e.g. by action of chlorosulfonic acid, for the introduction of a chlorosulfonyl group which can be converted into other groups in subsequent reactions, e.g. into a sulfonamido group; 4. The Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction for the introduction of an acyl radical or of a sulfonyl radical by action of the corresponding acid chlorides in the presence of a Lewis acid as a Friedel-Crafts catalyst, preferably in the presence of anhydrous aluminum chloride. Further chemical conversions of compounds of formula I according to the invention which are possible are, for example, reactions in the positions X1 to X4. Thus, for example, compounds of formula I according to the invention (X4CHOH) can be converted by alkylation or acylation with a compound of formula LR(30), where L has the meanings indicated above and R(30) has the meanings indicated above with the exception of hydrogen, into the corresponding alkyl or acyl derivatives of formula I (X4CHOR(30)). Furthermore, the hydroxyl group, for example, can be eliminated by dehydrating agents, such that a compound of formula I in which R(5) and R(11) together form a bond is obtained. In all procedures, it may be appropriate to temporarily protect functional groups in the molecule in certain reaction steps. Such protective group techniques are familiar to the person skilled in the art. The choice of a protective group for groups coming into consideration and the processes for their introduction and removal are described in the literature and can be adapted to the individual case, if appropriate, without difficulties. The bicyclic precursors required for the above processes are either known from the literature or can be prepared analogously to known processes. Some methods for the preparation of these precursors are described, for example, in the following literature references, which in this regard are in full part of the present disclosure: J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans . 1, 1991, 2763 ; Eur. J. Med. Chem . 30 (1995), 377 ; Ind. J. Chem . 9 (1971), 809 ; J. Heterocyclic Chem . 26 (1989), 1547. It has already been said that the compounds of formula I surprisingly have a strong and specific blocking (closing) action on a K channel which is opened by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and fundamentally differs from the well-known K (ATP) channel, and that this K (cAMP) channel identified in colonic tissue is very similar, perhaps even identical, to the I Ks channel identified in the cardiac muscle. For the compounds according to the invention, it was possible to show a strong blocking action on the I Ks . channel in guinea-pig cardiomyocytes and in the I sK channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes. As a result of this blocking of the K (cAMP) channel or of the I Ks channel, the compounds according to the invention display pharmacological actions of high therapeutic utility in the living body and are outstandingly suitable as pharmaceutical active compounds for the therapy and prophylaxis of various syndromes. Thus the compounds of formula I according to the invention are distinguished as a novel active compound class of potent inhibitors of stimulated gastric acid secretion. The compounds of formula I are thus valuable pharmaceutical active compounds for the therapy and prophylaxis of ulcers of the stomach and of the intestinal region, for example of the duodenum. They are also suitable, on account of their strong gastric secretion-inhibiting action, as excellent therapeutics for the therapy and prophylaxis of reflux esophagitis. The compounds of formula I according to the invention are furthermore distinguished by an antidiarrheal action and are therefore suitable as pharmaceutical active compounds for the therapy and prophylaxis of diarrheal disorders. The compounds of formula I according to the invention are furthermore suitable as pharmaceutical active compounds for the therapy and prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders. In particular, they can be used for the therapy and prophylaxis of all types of arrhythmias, including atrial, ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, especially of cardiac arrhythmias which can be eliminated by action potential prolongation. They can be specifically used for the therapy and prophylaxis of atlial fibrillation and atrial flutter, and for the therapy and prophylaxis of reentry arrhythmias and for the prevention of sudden heart death as a result of ventricular fibrillation. Although numerous substances having antiarrhythmic activity are already on the market, there is nevertheless no compound which is really satisfactory with respect to activity, range of application and side-effect profile, so that there is firthermore a need for the development of improved antiarrhythmics. The action of numerous known antiarrhythmics of the so-called class III is based on an increase in the myocardial refractory period by prolongation of the action potential duration. This is essentially determined by the extent or repolarizing K streams which flow out of the cell via various K channels. Particularly great importance is ascribed to the so-called delayed rectifier I K , of which two subtypes exist, a rapidly activated I Kr and a slowly activated I Ks . Most known class III antiarrhythmics block I Kr predominantly or exclusively (e.g. dofetilide, d-sotalol). It has been shown, however, that these compounds have an increased proarrhythmic risk at low or normal heart rates, arrhythmias which are designated as torsades de pointes in particular being observed (D. M. Roden; Current Status of Class III Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy; Am. J. Cardiol . 72 (1993), 44B-49B). In the case of higher heart rates or stinulation of the -receptors, however, the action potential-prolonging action of the I Kr blockers is markedly reduced, which is attributed to the fact that under these conditions the I Ks contributes more strongly to the repolarization. For these reasons, the substances according to the invention, which act as I Ks blockers, have significant advantages compared with the known I Kr blockers. It has now also been described that a correlation exists between I Ks channel inhibitory action and the suppression of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, such as are elicited, for example, by -adrenergic hyperstimulation (e.g. T. J. Colatsky, C. H. FolImer and C. F. Starmer; Channel Specificity in Antiarrhythmic Drug Action; Mechanism of Potassium Channel Block and its Role in Suppressing and Aggravating Cardiac Arrhythmias; Circulation 82 (1990), 2235-2242; A. E. Busch, K. Malloy, W. J. Groh, M. D. Varnum, J. P. Adelman and J. Maylie; The Novel Class III Antiarrhythmics NE-10064 and NE-10133 Inhibit I sK Channels in Xenopus Oocytes and I Ks in Guinea Pig Cardiac Myocytes; Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commum . 202 (1994), 265-270). Moreover, the compounds of formula I contribute to a marked improvement of cardiac insufficiency, in particular of congestive heart failure, advantageously in combination with contracticin-promoting (positively inotropic) active compounds, for example phosphodiesterase inhibitors. In spite of the therapeutically utilizable advantages which can be achieved by a blockade of the I Ks , hitherto only very few compounds have been described which inhibit this subtype of the delayed rectifier. The substance azimilide which is in development admittedly also has a blocking action on the I Ks , but mainly blocks the I Kr (selectivity 1:10). WO-A-95/14470 claims the use of benzodiazepines as selective blockers of the I Ks . Further I Ks blockers are described in FEBS Letters 396 (1996), 271-275: Specific Blockade of Slowly Activating I sK Channels by Chromanols . . . and Pflgers Arch.Eur. J. Physiol . 429 (1995), 517-530: A New Class of Inhibitors of cAMP-Mediated Cl Secretion in Rabbit Colon, Acting by the Reduction of cAMP-Activated K Conductance. The potency of the compounds mentioned there, however, is markedly lower than that of the compounds of formula I according to the invention. The compounds of formula I according to the invention and their physiologically tolerable salts can thus be used in animals, preferably in mammals, and in particular in humans as pharmaceuticals per se, in mixtures with one another or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The present invention also relates to the compounds of formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts for use as pharmaceuticals, their use in the therapy and prophylaxis of the syndromes mentioned and their use for the production of medicaments therefor and of medicaments with K channel-blocking action. Furthermore, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical preparations which as active constituents contain an effective dose of at least one compound of fonnula I and/or of a physiologically tolerable salt thereof in addition to customary, pharmaceutically innocuous excipients and auxiliaries. The pharmaceutical preparations normally contain 0.1 to 90% by weight of the compounds of formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts. The pharmaceutical preparations can be prepared in a manner known per se. For this purpose, the compounds of formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts, together with one or more solid or liquid pharmaceutical excipients and/or auxiliaries and, if desired, in combination with other pharmaceutical active compounds, are brought into a suitable administration form or dosage form which can then be used as a pharmaceutical in human medicine or veterinary medicine. Pharmaceuticals which contain compounds of formula I according to the invention and/or their physiologically tolerable salts can be administered orally, parenterally, e.g. intravenously, rectally, by inhalation or topically, the preferred administration being dependent on the individual case, e.g. the particular course of the disorder to be treated. The person skilled in the art is familiar on the basis of his expert knowledge with the auxiliaries which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulation. Beside solvents, gel-forming agents, suppository bases, tablet auxiliaries and other active compound carriers, it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, flavor corrigents, preservatives, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, buffer substances or colorants. The compounds of formula I can also be combined with other pharmaceutical active compounds to achieve an advantageous therapeutic effect. Thus in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, advantageous combinations with substances having cardiovascular activity are possible. Possible combination components of this type which are advantageous for cardiovascular disorders are, for example, other antiarrhythmics, i.e. class I, class II or class III antiarrhythmics, such as, for example, I Kr channel blockers, e.g. dofetilide, or furthermore hypotensive substances such as ACE inhibitors (for example enalapril, captopril, ramipril), angiotensin antagonists, K channel activators, and also alpha- and beta-receptor blockers, but also sympathomimetic compounds and compounds having adrenergic activity, and also Na /H exchange inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and other substances having positively inotropic activity, such as, for example, digitalis glycosides, or diuretics. Combinations with substances having antibiotic activity and with antiulcer agents are furthermore advantageous, for example with H 2 antagonists (e.g. ranitidine, cimetidine, famotidine, etc.), in particular when used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. For an oral administration form, the active compounds are mixed with the additives suitable therefor, such as excipients, stabilizers or inert diluents, and brought by means of the customary methods into the suitable administration forms, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions. Inert carriers which can be used are, for example, gum arabic, magnesia, magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate, lactose, glucose or starch, in particular corn starch. In this case the preparation can be carried out both as dry and as moist granules. Suitable oily excipients or solvents are, for example, vegetable or animal oils, such as sunflower oil or cod liver oil. Suitable solvents for aqueous or alcoholic solutions are, for example, water, ethanol or sugar solutions or mixtures thereof. Further auxiliaries, also for other administration forms are, for example, polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols. For subcutaneous or intravenous administration, the active compounds, if desired with the substances customary therefor such as solubilizers, emulsifiers or further auxiliaries, are brought into solution, suspension or emulsion. The compounds of formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts can also be lyophilized and the lyophilizates obtained used, for example, for the production of injection or infusion preparations. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, physiological saline solution or alcohols, e.g. ethanol, propanol, glycerol, in addition also sugar solutions such as glucose or mannitol solutions, or alternatively mixtures of the various solvents mentioned. Suitable pharmaceutical formulations for administration in the form of aerosols or sprays are, for example, solutions, suspensions or emulsions of the active compounds of formula I or their physiologically tolerable salts in a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as, in particular, ethanol or water, or a mixture of such solvents. If required, the formulation can also additionally contain other pharmaceutical auxiliaries such as surfactants, emulsifiers and stabilizers as well as a propellant. Such a preparation customarily contains the active compound in a concentration from approximately 0.1 to 10, in particular from approximately 0.3 to 3% by weight The dose of the active compound of formula I or of the physiologically tolerable salts thereof to be administered depends on the individual case and, as customary, is to be adapted to the conditions of the individual case for an optimum effect. Thus it depends, of course, on the frequency of administration and on the potency and duration of action of the compounds employed in each case for therapy or prophylaxis, but also on the nature and severity of the disease to be treated and on the sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated and on whether the therapy is acute or prophylactic. Customarily, the daily dose of a compound of formula I in the case of administration to a patient approximately 75 kg in weight is 0.001 mg/kg of bodyweight to 100 mg/kg of bodyweight, preferably 0.01 mg/kg of bodyweight to 20 mg/kg of bodyweight. The dose can be administered in the form of an individual dose or divided into several, e.g. two, three or four, individual doses. In particular in the treatment of acute cases of cardiac arrhythmias, for example in an intensive care unit, parenteral administration by injection or infusion, e.g. by an intravenous continuous infusion, can also be advantageous. The compounds of formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts selectively inhibit K (cAMP) channels and I Ks channels. On account of this property, apart from use as pharmaceutical active compounds in human medicine and veterinary medicine, they can also be employed as a scientific tool or as aids for biochemical investigations in which an effect on potassium channels is intended, and also for diagnostic purposes, e.g. in the in vitro diagnosis of cell or tissue samples. They can further be employed, as already mentioned above, as intermediates for the preparation of other pharmaceutical active compounds.

The following were employed for acquiring data and analysis: Geneclamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, USA) and MacLab D/A converter and software (ADInstruments, Castle Hill, Australia). The substances according to the invention were tested by adding them to the bath solution in different concentrations. The effects of the substances were calculated as the percentage inhibition of the I sK control current, which was obtained when no substance was added to the solution. The data were then extrapolated using the Hill equation in order to determine the inhibitory concentrations IC 50 for the respective substances. For the compound of Example 13, an IC 50 value of 3.3 mol/L was determined in the manner described. References A. E. Busch, H.-G. Kopp, S. Waldegger, I. Samarzija, H. Sbrich, G. Raber, K.

Compounds of the class include those of Formula (I): wherein, R 4 is (CR 5 R 6 CR 7 R 8 X 1 ) n CR 9 R 10 R 11 ; n is an integer from 1 to 18; R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 5 , R 6 , R 7 , R 8 , R 9 , R 10 and R 11 , are independently hydrogen or non-hydrogen substituents, with preferred non-hydrogen substituents including alkyls, alkenyls, oxa-alkyls, aralkyls and aryls; and X, X 1 , Y and Z are independently, O, NH or S, with preferred compounds including those in which X, X 1 , Y and Z are each oxygen and R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 5 , R 6 , R 7 , R 8 , R 9 , R 10 and R 11 are each hydrogen. II. Description of the Prior Art Dermal use of alpha hydroxyacids having an all carbon backbone is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,171. Cosmetic compositions using 2-hydroxyalkenoic acid are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,108,751. Such compounds must have an unsubstituted alpha hydoxy group on a carbon backbone and are purportedly used in impart beneficial effects to the skin. However, the trend is away from the use of such alpha hydroxyacids since they necessitate low operational pH ranges that for the most common forms, i.e. glycolic and lactic acids, are known to cause skin irritation. Topical formulations comprising straight, all carbon backbone, dicarboxylic acids have been proposed as replacements for alpha hydroxyacids. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,292,326, 4,386,104 and 5,385,943 describe the use of dicarboxylic acids having 7 to 13 carbon atoms for various skin indications. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 4,885,282 states that a 4 to 18 carbon dicarboxylic acid compound is useful for the treatment of skin disorders. The problem with the use of these dicarboxylic acids is their inherent insolubility in aqueous solutions. Such solutions make up the majority of cosmetic delivery systems. Also, dicarboxylic acids that have all carbon backbones are solid at ambient temperatures, extremely difficult to work with and, if a solution is achieved, the result is an aesthetically unpleasant mixture unsuitable for cosmetic use. Therefore, there is a need for a compound or class of compounds that can be used as mild, exfoliating actives for topical treatment of skin. There is also a need for a mild, exfoliating topical composition that contains a water soluble compound that can be manufactured into an aesthetically acceptable cosmetic or dermatologic products. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a water soluble compound or class of such compounds that can be manufactured into an aesthetically acceptable, mild, exfoliating composition for topical use. It is another object of the present invention to provide topical compositions with such water soluble compounds that have multiple skin care benefits. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a new, dermatologic and cosmetic use for oxa acids. These and other objects will become evident from the following disclosure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The basic compound of this invention is a compound of the following Formula (I): wherein, R 4 is (CR 5 R 6 CR 7 R 8 X 1 ) n CR 9 R 10 R 11 ; n is an integer from 1 to 18; R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 5 , R 6 , R 7 , R 8 , R 9 , R 10 and R 11 are independently hydrogen or non-hydrogen substituents.

Compounds of Formula (I) are described as intermediates useful in the making of curing agents and hardeners for epoxy resins in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,017,675 and 5,319,004, both assigned to Hoechst AG. German Published Application No. DE-A-2936123 describes the preparation of such epoxy resin intermediate compounds. Such compounds are also commercially available from Hoechst AG. Compounds of Formula I can also be prepared from commercially available polamines, polyols and polythiols by routine chemical reactions well known to those skilled in the art such as amidation, catalytic oxidation, esterification and other well known organic chemistry synthetic protocols, as described in organic chemistry textbooks including March, Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, 3rd ed., John Wiley Interscience (1985) and Carey et al. Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd ed., Parts A and B, Plenum Press, N. Y. (1990). The oxa acid compounds useful in the topical compositions of this invention can also be in the form of derivatives that are converted back to an acidic form by action of hydrolytic enzymes in the skin such as glycosidases, phosphatases, esterases and amidases. Examples of suitable derivatives include esters of Formula I compounds with aliphatic alcohols, carbohydrates, amides, lactones and anydrides As defined herein, all compounds of Formula (I), and derivatives thereof, will be referred to collectively as oxa acids and/or oxa compounds and/or oxa acid compounds. A topical application refers to spreading or laying directly onto the surface of skin. A topical composition refers to a composition intended to be directly layed onto or spread on the surface of skin. An effective amountmeans an amount of a compound or a composition sufficient to induce a positive change (e.g. normalization of desquamation) in the skin condition to be treated such as those attributed to, accompanied or exacerbated by abnormal desquamation. A physiologically acceptable vehicle or a suitable topical vehicle refers to drugs, cosmetics, medicaments or inert ingredients that are suitable for use in direct contact with human tissues without undue toxicity. All percentages refer to weight percent based on the total weight of the topical composition. In accordance with the invention, oxa compounds are used as active principals in topical applications to treat various skin conditions attributed to, accompanied by or exacerbated by abnormal desquamation. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, dry skin, ichthyosis, palmar and plantar hyperkeratoses, dandruff, lichen simplex chronicus, Dariers disease, keratoses, lentigines, age spots, melasmas, blemished skin, acne, psoriasis, eczema, pruritis, inflammatory dermatoses, striae distensae (i.e. stretch marks), warts and calluses. The compounds are unexpectedly and surprisingly found to be useful as active agents in topical preparations for treating signs of dermatological aging, both photoaging and intrinsic aging, including skin wrinkles such as fine wrinkling in the eye area or crows feet or fine wrinkles around the mouth area, irregular pigmentation, sallowness, loss of skin resilience and elasticity. Oxa compounds and topical compositions containing them are also useful for treating disorders associated with the nails, cuticles and hair such as ingrown hair, folliculitis and Pseudofolliculitis barbae. The present compounds also soften hair and promote the elimination of hair ingrowths, making the compounds of Formula (I) useful in shaving compositions. The oxa compounds can be incorporated into the compositions as free acids or as corresponding salts derived by neutralization with organic or inorganic bases, such as triethanolamine, arginine, lysine, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide and ammonium hydroxide. When used in combination with a physiologically acceptable vehicle to form a topical composition, the effective amount of the oxa acid compound can be within the range from about 0.1% to about 95%. Both the effective amount and the frequency of application will vary within this range based on the particular skin condition treated, the age and physical condition of the person under treatment, the severity of the condition, the duration of treatment, the nature of concurrent treatments, the specific compound or compositions employed, the particular vehicle utilized to deliver the compound or compositions, and other like factors within the knowledge and expertise of those skilled in the art. The efficacy of the oxa acid compounds in treating skin conditions has been found to be affected by the pH of the composition. Thus, it is believed desirable to maintain the pH of the composition in the acid range pH 7.0, preferably pH 5.0, most preferably in the pH range between 3.5 and 4.0. The pH of the composition can be adjusted by adding water soluble salts formed by strong bases (e.g. KOH, NaOH, NHOH) and weak acids (e.g. phosphoric acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, carbonic acid). Examples of such salts include potassium biphosphate, sodium phosphate, sodium acetate, sodium lactate and the like. Other methods useful for adjusting the pH of topical compositions are known to those skilled in the art. Compositions of the present invention have clear advantages over alpha hydroxyacid formulations, including superior mildness. Formulations containing alpha hydroxyacids, such as glycolic and lactic acids, can cause substantial discomfort to some individuals and symptoms of severe skin irritation in others, upon facial application. While being significantly gentler to skin than glycolic acid formulations, the oxa acid compositions of the present invention are highly effective in normalizing the desquamation of the upper stratum corneum. Such normalization is required to alleviate the skin conditions listed above. The topical compositions of the present invention also have advantages over compositions containing dicarboxylic acids including better water solubility and superior stratum corneum desquamatory activity. Oxa acids easily dissolve in water to concentrations of at least 20 to 30% by weight. Therefore, oxa acids have now been found to allow a much wider range of composition flexibility. Dicarboxylic acids of moderate to long chain length, which have straight, all-carbon backbones, are virtually insoluble in water and other aesthetically acceptable vehicles. This severely limits the choice of delivery vehicles for the dicarboxylic acids. The desquamatory activity of such dicarboxylic acids is also questionable. For example, tests have demonstrated that formulations containing 5% and 10% dodecanedioic acid do not product any normalizing effect on stratum corneum desquamation beyond that of its vehicle alone. Some specific examples of vehicles found to be suitable for use with the oxa acids include: (1) (a) about 2 wt. % to about 10 wt % glycerin, (b) about 1 wt % to about 10 wt % propylene glycol, (c) about 0.1 wt. % to about 2 wt. % hydroxyethyl cellulose, (d) about 0.1 wt. % to about 1 wt. % imidazolidilyl urea, and (e) about 0.01 wt. % to about 2 wt. % disodium-EDTA; (2) (a) about 1 wt. % to about 10 wt. % glycerin, (b) about 1 wt. % to about 10 wt. % propylene glycol, (c) about 1 wt. % to about 10 wt. % octyl palmitate, (d) about 1 wt. % to about 10 wt. % myristyl myristate, (e) about 1 wt. % to about 6 wt. % cetearyl alcohol/Ceteareth-20, (f) about 0.5 wt. % to about 6 wt. % glyceryl monostearate, (g) about 0.1 wt. % to about 2 wt. % hydroxyethyl cellulose, (h) about 0.1 wt. % to about 1 wt. % imidazolidilyl urea, (i) about 0.05 wt. % to about 0.5 wt. % methyl paraben, and (j) about 0.01 wt. % to about 2 wt. % disodium-EDTA; and (3) (a) about 2 wt. % to about 10 wt. % glycerin, (b) about 1 wt. % to about 10 wt. % octyl palmitate, (c) about 1 wt. % to about 10 wt. % myristyl myristate, (d) about 1 wt. % to about 7 wt. % cetearyl alcohol/Ceteareth-20, (e) about 1 wt. % to about 10 wt. % propylene glycol, (f) about 1 wt. % to about 6 wt. % glyceryl monostearate, (g) about 0.1 to about 2 wt. % hydroxyethyl cellulose, (h) about 0.1 wt. % to about 1 wt. % imidazolidilyl urea, (i) about 0.05 wt. % to about 0.5 wt. % methyl paraben, and (j) about 0.01 wt. % to about 2 wt. % disodium-EDTA. The topical compositions of the present invention can be made as lotions. A first or more basic lotion comprises: about 0.1 wt. % to about 90 wt. %, preferably from about 1 wt. % to about 50 wt. %, and most preferably about 5 wt. % to about 20 wt. % of the oxa acid; and, the remainder water. A second lotion has about 0.1 wt. % to about 90 wt. %, preferably about 5 wt. % to about 20 wt. % of the oxa acid; about 0.5 wt. % to about 50 wt. % of an emollient; about 0.1 wt. % to about 30 wt. % of an emulsifier; and, the remainder water. The second lotion may also contain up to about 10 wt. % of a preservative; from about 0.1 wt. % to about 3 wt. % of a fragrance; and up to about 5 wt. % of a dye or a pigment. The topical composition of the invention can also be formulated as a cream. A first or more basic cream comprises about 0.1 wt. % to about 95 wt. %, preferably from about 1 wt. % to about 50 wt. %, and most preferably about 5 wt. % to about 20 wt. % of the oxa acid; from about 0.5 wt. % to about 50 wt. % of an emollient; about 0.1 wt. % to about 6 wt. % of a thickener; and, the remainder water. A second, preferred cream comprises about 0.1 wt. % to about 90 wt. %, preferably from about 1 wt. % to about 50 wt. %, and most preferably about 5 wt. % to about 20 wt. % of the oxa acid; from about 0.5 wt. % to about 50 wt. % of an emollient; about 0.1 wt. % to about 6 wt. % of a thickener; and, the remainder water. The oxa acid can be combined with most conventional emollients including mineral oil, petrolatum, paraffin, ceresin, ozokerite, microcrystraline wax, perhydrosqualene dimethyl polysiloxanes, methylphenyl polysiloxanes, silicone-glycol copolymers, triglyceride esters, acetylated monoglycerides, ethoxylated glycerides, alkyl esters of fatty acids, fatty acids and alcohols, lanolin and lanolin derivatives, polyhydric alcohol esters, sterols, beeswax derivatives, polyhydric alcohols and polyethers, and amides of fatty acids. Other suitable emollients can be found in Sagarin, Cosmetics, Science and Technology, 2nd Ed., vol. 1, pp. 32-43 (1972), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The emulsifiers that can be cationic, anionic, nonionic, amphoteric, or a combination thereof. Nonionic emulsifiers are preferred. Exemplary nonionic emulsifiers are commercially available sorbitans, alkoxylated fatty alcohols and alkyl polyglycosides. Anionic emulsifiers may include soaps, alkyl sulfates, monoalkyl and dialkyl phosphates, alkyl sulphonates and acyl isothionates. Other suitable emulsifiers can be found in McCutcheon, Detergents and Emulsifiers , North American Edition, pp. 317-324 (1986), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The preservatives suitable for use with the present compositions include alkanols, especially ethanol and benzyl alcohol, parabens, sorbates, urea derivatves, and isothiazolinones. While such lotions or creams can be made using conventional homogenization methods known to those skilled in the art, it is also possible to use a process of microfluidization that involves co-mixing the aqueous phase and the oil phase of such creams and lotions in a high-pressure homogenizer that reduces the emulsion particle size dramatically to about 1/400th the size of those in creams and lotions prepared without applying high pressure. Microfluidization allows one to prepare elegant stable creams and lotions containing effective amounts of an oxa acid without the use of traditional emulsifiers and surfactants. The topical compositions of the invention can also be formulated as a micro-emulsion. A first, basic micro-emulsion system comprises about 0.1 wt. % to about 50 wt., preferably from about 1 wt. % to about 30 wt. %, and most preferably about 5 wt. % to about 20 wt. % of the oxa acid; from about 0.5 wt. % to about 20 wt. % of a hydrocarbon; from about 0.5 wt. % to about 20 wt. % of an oil; and, the remainder water. A second, more preferred micro-emulsion system comprises about 1 wt. % to about 20 wt. % of the oxa acid; from about 0.5 wt. % to about 15 wt. % of a hydrocarbon; from about 0.1 wt. % to about 15 wt. % of an oil, from about 0.1 wt. % to about 10 wt. % of a fatty alcohol; up to 30 wt. % of a nonionic surfactant; and, the remainder water. The topical compositions of the present invention can be formulated as oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions, gels, lotions, ointments, sticks, sprays, tapes, patches. The inventive compositions can also be in the form of a multiphase emulsion, such as a water-in-oil-in-water type emulsion as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,254,105, incorporated herein by reference. The compositions of the invention can also be made as a liposomal formulation, for example, according to the methods described in Mezei, J. Pharmaceut. Pharmacol ., vol. 34, pp. 473-474 (1982), or modification thereof. In such compositions, droplets of the oxa acid solution can be entrapped inside the liposomal vesicles with the shell of the liposome being a phospholipid or other suitable lipids (e.g. skin lipids). To form a topical composition, the liposomes can then be added to any carrier system described above according, for example, to the preparation modes, uses and compositions of topical liposomes described in Mezei, Topics in Pharmaceutical Sciences , Breimer et al. Eds., pp. 345-358, Elsevier Science Publishers BV, N. Y. (1985), incorporated herein by reference, or according to the reverse-phase evaporation method described in Szoka et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sciences , vol. 75, pp. 4194-4198 (1978), and Diploses et al., J. Soc. Cosmetic Chemists , vol. 43, pp. 93-100 (1992), each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Solutions of oxa acids can also be entrapped in polymeric vesicles with a shell consisting of a suitable polymeric material, such as gelatin, cross-linked gelatin, polyamide, poylacrylates and the like, to form a vesicle that is then incorporated into the topical composition. The compositions of the present invention may include an oxa acid compound as the only active ingredient, or may use the oxa acid compound in combination with other cosmetic and pharmaceutical actives and excipients. Suitable other cosmetic and pharmaceutical agents include, but are not limited to, antifungals, vitamins, sunscreens, retinoids, antiallergenic agents, depigmenting agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anesthetics, surfactants, moisturizers, exfolients, stabilizers, preservatives, antiseptics, thickeners lubricants, humectants, chelating agents and skin penetration enhancers, as well as the emulsifiers, emollients, fragrances and colorants discussed above. Examples of suitable thickening agents include xanthan gum, xanthan gum brine tolerant, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carbopol and gum acacia, Sepigel 305 (available from Seppic Co., France), vee-gum or magnesium aluminum silicate. In topical compositions, oxa acids are also compatible with, and their utility can be enhanced by, humectants, such as urea, PCA, amino acids, certain polyols and other compounds with hygroscopic properties. Topical compositions can also be formed to contain about 0.1 wt. % to about 90 wt. %, preferably from about 1 wt. % to about 50 wt. %, and most preferably about 5 wt. % to about 20 wt. % of the oxa acid, in combination with a keratolytic agent, such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, and skin lightening agents such as kojic acid benzoquinone, licorice derivatives, ascorbic acid and its derivatives (e.g. magnesium ascorbyl phosphate), and glycerhetinic acid and its derivatives.

BACKGROUND ART Benzodiazepine (Bz) receptors are recently classified into 2 subtypes of central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) located on GABA A receptor/ion channel complex and mitochondrial DBI (diazepam binding inhibitor, Neuropharmacol., 30, 1425-1433 (1991)) receptor (BDR) located on the central nervous system (glial cells) or adrenal glands (Clin. Neuropharmacol., 16, 401-417 (1993)). MDR agonists act indirectly on GABA A /ion channel complex via endogenous neurosteroids and cause an anti-anxiety action. Accordingly, they have a possibility to be usable for diseases (obsessive disorders, panic disorders) on which the previous Bzs do not have a satisfactorily therapeutic effect, and to alleviate side-effects such as excessive sedation or psychic dependence caused by the Bzs. Furthermore, MDR ligands act indirectly on GABA A receptors, and therefore, have a possibility of use as therapeutical agents of sleeping disorders, epilepsy, dyskinesia accompanied by muscle rigidity, feeding disorders, circulation disorders, recognition and learning disability or drug dependence (Progress in Neurobiology, 38, 379-395, 1992, ibid., 49, 73-97, 1996; J. Neurochem., 58, 1589-1601; Neuropharmacol., 30, 1435-1440, 1991). In addition, MDR ligands have a possibility of use as therapeutic agents of cancer (Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1241, 453-470, 1995), lipid metabolism abnormality (Eur. J. Pharmacol., 294, 601-607, 1995), schizophrenia (Neuropharmacology, 35, 1075-1079, 1996), cerebral infarction (J. Neurosci., 15, 5263-5274, 1995), AIDS (Abstracts of the fifth international conference on AIDS, p. 458, 1989), Alzheimers disease (Alzheimer Dis. Assoc. Disotd., 2, 331-336, 1988) or Huntington chorea (Brain Res., 248, 396-401, 1982). Some phenoxyaniline derivatives are reported in WO9533715, JP 61040249 and JP 57208295. However, they have a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group as the substituent on the nitrogen atom of the aniline, but there are not reported the derivatives having a carbonyl group as the substituent. Furthermore, the use of the derivatives of the above-mentioned patent is anti-inflammatory agents based on the action to arakidonic acid series, anti-arteriosclerosis drugs based on an increase of PGI 2 production, or heat sensitive recording materials, but there is not described affinity for MDR and anti-anxiety based on affinity for MDR. An object of the present invention is to provide pharmaceutical compounds which are effective on diseases on which the previous Bzs do not have a satisfactorily therapeutic effect, and have a high affinity for MDR, and therefore, have a therapeutic or preventive effect on the central diseases such as anxiety, related diseases thereto, depression, epilepsy, etc. without side-effects such as excessive sedation or psychic dependence caused by the Bzs. Furthermore, another object of the present invention is to provide therapeutic agents of sleeping disorders, dyskinesia accompanied by muscle rigidity, feeding disorders, circulation disorders, recognition and learning disability, drug dependence, cancer, lipid metabolism abnormality, schizophrenia, cerebral infarction, AIDS, Alzheimers disease or Huntington chorea.

and 3 HPK11195 was used as a 3 H-labeled ligand. A binding assay using the 3 H-labeled ligand was carried out according to the following method as described in Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 262, 971(1992). Preparation of Receptor Sample: Rat cerebral cortex was homogenized using a Teflon-coated homogenizer in a 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.32 M sucrose in ten volumes of the wet weight. The homogenate was centrifuged at 900g for 10 minutes, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 9,000g for 10 minutes. The precipitate was suspended in a HEPES buffer to give a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml, and centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 minutes. The resulting precipitate was suspended in a 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) to give a crude mitochondria fraction. MDR Binding Assay: Mitochondria sample (1.0 mg protein/ml), 3 HPK11195 (2 nM) and the test drug were reacted at 4 C. for 90 minutes. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered with suction through a glass filter (GF/B) treated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine, and the radioactivity on the filter was measured by a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The binding at the reaction in the presence of 10 M PK11195 was defined as non-specific binding of 3 HPK11195, and the difference between total binding and non-specific binding was defined as specific binding. A fixed concentration of 3 HPK11195 (2 nM) was reacted with varied concentrations of the test drug under the above-mentioned conditions to give an inhibition curve, and the concentration (IC 50 ) of the test drug to exhibit 50% inhibition of 3 HPK11195 binding was measured by the inhibition curve, and results are shown in Table 3.

"Process for the synthesis of trisubstituted oxazoles", "abstract": "A process for the preparation of oxazoles of formula (II): by reaction of thiourea with the corresponding diketone ester. The present invention relates to a novel process for the synthesis of oxazoles, in particular trisubstituted oxazoles. Oxazoles are known to be useful for the treatment of inflammation and inflammation-related disorders. Oxazoles are well known in the literature, which describes several possible routes for the synthesis thereof. Oxazles can be prepared by reaction of a diazide with a cyano derivative, in the presence of tungsten as a catalyst. See, for example, Tetrahedron Letters, 1974, 16, 1531, the disclosure of which is specifically incorporated by reference. This process can be illustrated by the following scheme: Trisubstituted oxazoles can also be prepared by using a primary amine as cyclization reactant. See, for example, J.A.C.S., 1943, 65, 2159, the disclosure of which is specifically incorporated by reference. This process can be illustrated by the following scheme: However, the synthesis of trisubstituted oxazoles according to either of these processes can be limited by the starting compound, and some starting materials can be either unavailable commercially or very difficult to synthesize. Consequently, depending on the nature of the substituents, some trisubstituted oxazoles cannot be prepared by either of these processes. Trisubstituted oxazoles have also been prepared by the thermolysis and photolysis of an acylisoxazolone derivative. See, for example, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin, 1997, 2665, the disclosure of which is specifically incorporated by reference. This process can be illustrated by the following scheme: However, this process can require highly specialized equipment, for example to realize the photolysis of the starting materials. Therefore, the process may not easily be carried out industrially. It is also known, by U.S. Pat. No. 5,719,163, the disclosure at which is specifically incorporated by reference, to synthesize certain trisubstituted oxazoles by using ammonium acetate in acetic acid at reflux, according to the following scheme: However, this process can exhibit the disadvantage of being carried out in the presence of acetic acid and thus in an acid medium. An aim of the present invention is to provide a novel process for preparation of trisubstituted oxazoles which can be carried out from starting materials which are relatively easy to synthesize or already commercially available, and/or which does not require highly specialized equipment and/or which can be carried out under reaction conditions, particularly with respect to pH, which are industrially more favorable. A subject-matter of the present invention is thus a process for the preparing a trisubstituted oxazole of formula (II): by reaction of thiourea with a diketone ester of formula (I): in which the R 1 , R 2 and R 3 radicals, which may be identical or different, have the meanings given below. It has been found that the process according to the invention can be carried out at a basic pH value, and even at a pH value close to neutral. Furthermore, the starting materials can be relatively easy to synthesize and this process can be carried out industrially and relatively inexpensively. Moreover, the reaction typically only comprises a single stage, which therefore can also facilitate its implementation on an industrial scale. Finally, it is possible, by virtue of this process, to prepare a large variety of trisubstituted oxazoles.

The R 1 , R 2 and R 3 groups, which may be identical or different, also may each be chosen from: saturated, linear and branched C 1 -C 6 hydrocarbon groups, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, and tert-butyl groups; saturated, linear and branched C 2 -C 6 hydrocarbon groups, substituted by at least one OR group where R is chosen from phenyl and alkylaryl groups, such as (CH 2 ) n -phenyl groups, where n has a value ranging from 1 to 4, such as from 1 and 2; phenyl groups; phenyl groups substituted by at least one group chosen from saturated C 1 -C 4 hydrocarbon groups, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, and tert-butyl groups; phenyl groups substituted by at least one group chosen from NRR groups, wherein R and R, which can be identical or different, are each chosen from saturated C 1 -C 4 hydrocarbon groups, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, and tert-butyl groups; phenyl groups substituted by at least one halogen, such as fluorine; and unsaturated C 5-6 heterocyclic groups comprising a ring having at least one nitrogen atom in the ring. The reaction can be carried out in a dipolar aprotic solvent, such as dipolar aprotic solvents having a boiling point of greater than 130 C., such as greater than 140 C. and further such as greater than 160 C.

hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid of the formula (2): which is characterized by contacting a compound of the formula (1): wherein R 1 and R 2 represent a hydrogen atom or a benzyl group, but R 1 and R 2 do not simultaneously represent a hydrogen atom, and R 3 represents a hydrogen atom or a carboxyl group, with sulfuric acid in the presence of an aromatic hydrocarbon. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for producing hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART Hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid is also called vitamin H (biotin), a compound effective for promoting growth, preventing and curing skin diseases, and the like, and used as a feed additive, and the like. As a method for producing such hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid, there is disclosed a method in which hexahydro-2-oxo-1,3-dibenzylthieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid is treated with alkanesulfonic acid such as methanesulfonic acid (Japanese Patent Application Publication (JP-B) No. 63-8954). However, this method is not always industrially and economically satisfactory since a rather large amount of expensive alkanesulfonic acids is used, and recovery of the used alkanesulfonic acid is a cumbersome process. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present Invention is to provide a industrially advantageous method for producing hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid without using expensive alkanesulfonic acid. The present invention provides a method for producing hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid of the formula (2): which method comprises contacting a compound of the formula (1): wherein R 1 and R 2 represent a hydrogen atom or a benzyl group, provided that R 1 and R 2 do not simultaneously represent a hydrogen atom, and R 3 represents a hydrogen atom or a carboxyl group, with sulfuric acid in the presence of an aromatic hydrocarbon. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention will be illustrated in detail below. In the general formula (1), R 1 and R 2 represent a hydrogen atom or a benzyl group, but R 1 and R 2 do not simultaneously represent a hydrogen atom, and R 3 represents a hydrogen atom or a carboxyl group. Examples of the compound represented by such general formula (1) include hexahydro-2-oxo-1,3-dibenzylthieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid, hexahydro-2-oxo-1-benzyl-3H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid, hexahydro-2-oxo-1,3-dibenzylthieno3,4-dimidazole-4-(4-hydroxycarbonyl)pentanoic acid and the like. The compound of the formula (1) theoretically has optical isomers, and any of the optically active isomers which include an isomer having the same stereochemistry as D-biotin with respect to a thieno3,4-dimidazole moiety, racemates or a mixture containing at least one optical isomer in excess can be used in the present invention. The amount of sulfuric acid is usually 1 mol or more per mol of the compound of the formula (1). The upper limit thereof is not particularly restricted, however, it is preferably 20 moles, and more preferably 10 moles per mole of the compound of the formula (1). The concentration of sulfuric acid is preferably 90% by weight or more in view of yield. Examples of the aromatic hydrocarbon include: an alkylbenzene which is substituted with 1 to 5 (C 1 -C 3 )alkyl group(s) such as toluene, xylene, mesitylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, durene, pentamethylbenzene, cymene, cumene, diisopropylbenzene and the like; and an alkylnaphtalene which is substituted with 1 to 7 (C 1 -C 3 )alkyl group(s) such as methylnaphtalene, dimethylnaphthalene, trimethylnaphthalene, diisopropylnaphthalene and the like; and a mixture containing the above-described alkylbenzenes and/or the alkylnaphthalene. The alkylbenzenes are preferred, and mesitylene is particularly preferred among them. The amount of such aromatic hydrocarbon is 2 moles or more, preferably 5 moles or more per mol of the compound of the formula (1). The upper limit thereof is not particularly restricted, and it is preferably 30 moles, more preferably 20 moles per mol of the compound of formula(1). The compound of the formula (1) is usually contacted with sulfuric acid in the presence of the aromatic hydrocarbon usually at 50 C. or more, preferably 70 C. or more, more preferably 90 C. or more and up to usually 120 C., preferably 100 C. After completion of the treatment, the desired compound of the formula (2) can be usually obtained by a conventional post-treatment. Preferably, a sulfuric layer containing hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid and an aromatic hydrocarbon layer in the reaction mixture are usually separated. A hydrophobic organic solvent such as toluene, xylene and the like may also be added to wash the sulfuric acid layer, if necessary. The separated sulfuric acid layer containing hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid is usually mixed with water by pouring it into water or by adding water thereto to give a crude crystal of the desired compound. The mixing of the sulfuric acid layer with water can be conducted in the presence of a lower carboxylic acid such as C 1 -C 2 carboxylic acid(e.g., formic acid or acetic acid), which results in smooth precipitation of the crystal of the desired compound, which has good filtrability. The lower carboxylic acid may be added to the sulfuric acid layer or to the water. Alternatively, the lower carboxylic acid may be added when the compound of the formula (1) is contacted with sulfuric acid in the presence of the aromatic hydrocarbon. The amount of the lower carboxylic acid to be used is not limited, but is usually 10 moles or less per mol of the compound of the formula (1) from a practical view point. Alternatively, the crude crystal of the desired compound may also be obtained by mixing the sulfuric acid layer with an aqueous alkaline solution followed by activated carbon treatment and crystal precipitation with an acid. Examples of the alkaline solution include those of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. Examples of the acid used to precipitate the crystals of the desired compound of the formula (2) include a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, and a lower carboxylic acid such as formic acid or acetic acid. The presence of the lower carboxylic acid in the precipitation of the crystals of the desired compound with a mineral acid is useful for smooth precipitation of the crystals of the desired compound, which have good filtrability. The crystals obtained by the above-described methods can be further purified by recrystalization in water or the procedure described in the above paragraph may be repeated in a similar manner. Used aromatic hydrocarbons in the separated aromatic hydrocarbon layer can be recovered by a usual treatment such as distillation and the like, and the recovered aromatic hydrocarbons can be used in the present process again. When an optically active compound of the formula (1) is used, an optically active hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid, for example, D-biotin can be obtained. According to the method of the present invention, hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid can be easily obtained from a compound of the formula (1) using inexpensive sulfuric acid. Therefore, this method is advantageous industrially and economically.

Capsaicinoid-like substances represented by the following general formula: and food and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them. FIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates to novel capsaicinoid-like substances with an ester linkage, and to a food and pharmaceutical compositions comprising said substances. PRIOR ART Capsicum annuum L . species, peppers, have been used worldwide as foods, spices and medicines. The major pungent components contained in them are capsaicin, (E)-N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-methyl-8-methyl-6-nonenamide, and dihydrocapsaicin, i.e., 6.7-dihydro derivative of capsaicin. Further, more than 12 other capsaicinoids have been found as minor pungent components such as nordihydrocapsaicin (that contains one less methylene group than dihydrocapsaicin), homocapsaicin (that contains one more methylene group than capsaicin) and homodihydrocapsaicin (that contains one more methylene group than dihydrocapsaicin). Up to now, it has been found that capsaicin has many physiological activities such as promotion of adrenal catecholamine secretion so as to enhance the oxidation of fatty acids and to inhibit obesity (Buck, S. H.; Burks, T. F. , Phamacol. Rev., 1986, 38, 179-226, Suzuki, T.; Iwai, K., Chemistry and Pharmacology, 1984, Vol.23, 1984, Szolcsanyi, J., Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology , Vol.60, 1982). However, since capsaicin has a strong pungency and nociceptive activity, it can not be used in a large amount and its usage as a food additive or a drug is considerably limited. Several studies have reported that several non-pungent capsaicinoids as well as capsaicin have physiological activities such as promotion or enhancement of adrenal catecholamine secretion (Watanabe, T.; Kawada, T.; Kato, T.; Harada,T.; Iwai, K., Life Sci., 1994, 54, 369-374). Since these capsaicinoids have no pungent components, it may be expected that they may be used as food additives and pharmaceutical ingredients. It has been reported that the fruits of a non-pungent fixed variety of pepper, named CH-19 sweet (an introduction number at Kyoto Univ., Agr. Dept., vegetables and horiculture laboratory) which had been selected and fixed from a pungent fixed variety of pepper, CH-19, obtained in Thailand, contain only a small amount of capsaicinoids, but a considerable amount of capsaicinoid-like substances (CLSs) (Yazawa,S.; Suetome,N.; Okamoto,K.; Namiki,T., J. Japan Soc. Hort. Sci., 1989, 58, 601-607). The present inventors have now tried a structural analysis of the capsaicinoid-like substances contained in the CH-19 sweet, and succeeded in their identification to complete the present invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel capsaicinoid-like substances represented by the following general formula: The present capsaicinoid-like substances (Formula I) are characterized in that they consist of a branched non-saturated fatty acid that is combined via an ester linkage with vanillyl alcohol, whereas the prior capsaicinoids consist of a branched non-saturated fatty acid that is combined via an amide linkage with vanillyl alcohol. The present capsaicinoid-like substances (Formula II) are those whose fatty acid moiety has been saturated. In these formulae, the value n is preferably 3, 4 or 5, the structural formulae wherein said value is 4 are shown as follows: DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE INVENTION Since the present capsaicinoid-like substances have no pungency and substantially no cytotoxicity, they may be used as food additives or pharmaceutical ingredients that show a variety of physiological activities such as enhancing energy metabolism and potentiating an immune system. Further, the present capsaicinoid-like substances have a possibility to be used as food additives or pharmaceutical ingredients for enhancing endurance capacity in continuous excises, or as a non-narcotic analgesic. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a food composition comprising said capsaicinoid-like substances. The present food composition may take any form such as solid, liquid, sol, gel, powder and granule, and it may be prepared by any method known in the art. An amount of the present capsaicinoid-like k contained in the food composition may be optionally determined by those skilled in the art, depending on the purpose of their formulation, and the kind, form and purpose of the food composition, and the like. For example, the capsaicinoid-like substances may be comprised in an amount of at least 10 5 % by weight in chocolate. It is not necessary to purify the present capsaicinoid-like substances to be comprised in the food composition. Thus, the food composition may comprise the non-pungent fixed variety of pepper, CH-19 per se, its dried and pulverized material or its extract with various solvents that are conventionally used in the art, for example, ethyl acetate, alcohols such as ethanol, and emulsifiers used for food stuff. The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising said capsaicinoid-like substances as well. The present pharmaceutical composition may take any form known in the art, such as solution buffered with various salts and buffers, suspension, emulsion and the like. Buffering salts include alkali and alkaline earth metal salts, phosphate and sulfate. For example, citrate, phosphate, HEPES, Tris-hydroxy aminomethane may be used in a physiologically acceptable concentration. The present pharmaceutical composition may be formulated in any form in addition to the above liquid ones, such as tablet, powder, sol, gel, granule and an embedded one with liposome. In formulation, any excipients and additives known in the art may be used in a pharmaceutically acceptable amount. The amount of the capsaicinoid-like substances comprised in the pharmaceutical composition may be optionally determined by those skilled in the art, depending on the properties of other ingredients, the purpose of use, the age and weight of a patient, and effects required, and the like. The present pharmaceutical composition may be administered by various routes depending on its formulation, form and the like, such as orally, intraveneously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intraperitonealy, pharyngonasally, etc. SUMMARIZED EXPLANATION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 It shows the effect of the present capsaicinoid-like substances (designated as CLS-B) on IgM antibody production of hybridoma H8.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE PRESENT INVENTION The present capsaicinoid-like substances may be prepared by isolation and purification from the non-pungent fixed variety of pepper, CH-19 sweet, or may be chemically synthesized by a known method based on the structural formulae in this specification. One of the present compound may be easily synthesized by a well-known esterification using 8-methyl nonanoate (8-methyl pelargonoate) and vanillyl alcohol as starting material. The present invention will be illustrated in more detail with the following examples which, however, should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any way. EXAMPLE Example 1 Isolation and Purification of the Present Capsaicinoid-like Substances After fresh fruits (1.00 kg) of CH-19 sweet had been freeze-dried, their seeds and calyces were removed, and the residue was extracted with 1.8 L each of ethylacetate three times by use of a Universal Homogenizer (Nihon Seiki Seisakusho, Japan). The ethylacetate extract was evaporated under reduced pressure to distill out ethylacetate and to afford an oleoresin (7.3 g). The oleoresin was chromatographed on silica gel (Silica gel 60 Merck; 36200 mm) with stepwise elution of n-hexane and ethylacetate. The fraction eluted with ethylacetate was rechromatographed on reversed phase silica gel (Wakosil 25C18 of Wako Pure Chem. Co. Ltd. (Japan): 2050 mm) with 75% MeOH eluent to afford Compound 3 (4.5 mg) On the other hand, the fraction eluted with n-hexane/ethylacetate (80:20) was rechromatographed on reversed phase silica gel (Wakosil 25C18 of Wako Pure Chem. Co. Ltd. (Japan); 2090 mm) with 75% MeOH eluent. And a mixture containing Compound 1 was obtained, and the following fraction gave Compound 2 as a colorless oil (59.7 mg). The mixture containing Compound 1 was rechromatographed on reversed phase silica gel (Wakosil 25C18 of Wako Pure Chem. Co. Ltd. (Japan); 2090 mm) with 75% MeOH containing 0.05M AgNO 3 . The collected eluent was partitioned with CHCl 3 three times, and the CHCl 3 fractions were collected and dried using anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 and then filtered. The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford Compound 1 as a colorless oil (98.5 mg). In the above isolation and purification steps, the presence of Compound 1 and Compound 2 in each fraction was followed and confirmed by an intense blue color developed in a reaction of 2,6-dichloroquinon-4-chloroimide (resolved in 85% methanol) and ammonia on thin-layer chromatography using toluene:chloroform:acetone (55:26:19 v/v) as a developing solvent. Compound 3 was chromatographed using toluene:chloroform:acetone (29:32:39 v/v) as a developing solvent. Example 2 Structural Determination of the Present Capsaicinoid-like Substances Spectroscopic analyses of the present compounds were performed with the following apparatuses. 1 H-NMR (399.65 MHz, CDCl 3 ) and 13 C-NMR (100.40 MHz, CDCl 3 ) spectra (TMS as an internal standard) were recorded on a JEOL alpha-400 instrument. IR spectra were recorded on a Hitachi 270-50 infrared spectrophotometer, and UV spectra were recorded on a Jasco UVIDEC 660 spectrophotometer. HRMS spectra were recorded on a JEOL JMS-700 apparatus. Identification of Compound 1 Spectral data of Compound 1 obtained with the above analytical means were as follows. HRMS m/z z(M ): Calcd. (C 18 H 26 O 4 ): 306.1831 Found: 306.1798. IR max (film) cm 1 : 3450, 1740, 1615, 1610, 1520, 1470, 1435, 1275, 1160, 1120, 1035, 970, 850, 815, 795, 560. UV max (MeOH) nm: 280 (: 2400), 231 (: 6200). 1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR spectra: These data are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below, respectively. The molecular formula of Compound 1 was determined as C 18 H 26 O 4 by HRMS measurement. The IR spectrum showed a hydroxyl absorption (3450 cm 1 ) and an ester carbonyl absorption (1735 cm 1 ). The 1 H-NMR spectrum showed three aromatic protons (6.90 d, 6.86 dd, and 6.87 d), and these coupling constants and patterns indicated a typical 1-, 2-, and 4-substituted phenyl group. The phenyl group gave rise to the signals of 146.5, 145.8, 128.0, 122.0, 114.3 and 111.2 in 13 C-NMR data. In 1 H-NMR data, two olefinic methine protons (5.37 dd and 5.30 dt) coupled to each other with 15.6 Hz indicated the presence of an ethylenic moiety of trans configuration. A methoxyl group (3.90 s) and an isopropyl group (0.95 d, 0.95 d, and 2.21 oct) were observed in 1 H-NMR data. As shown in Table 2, the 13 C-NMR spectrum of Compound 1 was extremely similar to that of authentic capsaicin only except for a methylene carbon at the C-7 position (43.5 of capsaicin and 66.3 of Compound 1). 1 H-NMR spectrum was also similar to that of capsaicin. However, a chemical shift value of the methylene protons (5.03, s) of Compound 1 was different from that of the C-7 position of capsaicin. These NMR signals of the methylene of Compound 1 indicated the existence of a methylene group caught between a phenyl group and oxygen of an ester linkage. These results have suggested that the structure of Compound 1 has an ester moiety instead of an amide moiety of capsaicin. Furthermore, it has suggested that Compound 1 has the same acyl residue as capsaicin, i.e., (E)-8-methyl-6-nonenoyl group, because 1 H- and 13 C-NMR spectrum data for the acyl group of Compound 1 agreed excellently with those of capsaicin. Therefore, it has been concluded that the structure of Compound 1 is 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzyl (E)-8-methylnonenoate as shown in Formula I, and this novel Compound 1 was named capsiate. Identification of Compound 2 Spectral data of Compound 2 obtained with the above analytical means were as follows. HRMS m/z (M ): Calcd. (C 18 H 28 ,O 4 ): 308.1987. Found: 308.2008. IR max (film) cm 1 : 3450, 1740, 1615, 1610, 1520, 1470, 1435, 1275, 1160, 1120, 1035, 970, 850, 815, 795, 560. Uv max (MeOH) nm: 279 (: 3700), 231 (: 8700). 1 H- and 13 C-NMR spectral data: These data are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below, respectively. The molecular formula of Compound 2 was determined as C 18 H 28 O 4 by HRMS measurement. The IR spectral datum of Compound 2 was similar to that of Compound 1. It was therefore presumed that compound 2 has structural resemblance to Compound 1. 1 H- and 13 C-NMR data of Compound 2 were also similar to those of Compound 1. In the 13 C-NMR spectrum of 2, however, the presence of two alkanic methylene carbons (27.2 and 38.9) instead of two olefinic methine carbons of 1 (C-6 and C-7) was observed. The 1 H-NMR datum of Compound 2 also showed no signals of olefinic protons such as observed in Compound 1. These results suggested the structure of Compound 2 to be a 6,7-dihydro derivative of Compound 1, i.e., 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl 8-methylnonanoate. Chemical Synthesis of Compound 2 A mixture of 500 mg (2.9 mmol) of 8-methylnonanoic acid and 3.5 g (2.9 mmol) of thionyl chloride was stirred magnetically overnight at a room temperature under drying with CaCl 2 . After evaporation under reduced pressure, brown oil was obtained. The oil was added dropwise into 5 mL pyridine solution of 893 mg (5.8 mmol) of vanillyl alcohol (Aldrich Chem. Co. Inc. (Milwaukee, Wis.)). The mixture was stirred magnetically at 0 C. for 2 hours. After the addition of water and 2N-HCl to acidify, the mixture was partitioned with 30 mL each of ethylacetate three times, and the ethylacetate fractions collected were washed with water, dried using anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford a residue. The residue was chromatographed on silica gel (Silica gel 60 Merck; 3660 mm). The fraction eluted with n-hexane/ethylacetate (90:10) gave a colorless oil (2,329 mg, 36.8% yield). It was revealed that IR spectrum data, 1 H- and 13 C-NMR spectrum data of the thus synthesized compound were completely the same as those of Compound 2. It has therefore confirmed that Compound 2 is 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl 8-methylnonanoate, and this novel Compound 2 was named dihydrocapsiate. Compound 3 was identified as vanillyl alcohol based on the comparison of the above spectra data between Compound 3 and an authentic reagent.

The present capsaicinoid-like substances obtained in Example 1 (20.5 mg) was mixed with ethyl acetate (66 l) to give 1N solution. The resulting solution (8 l)was resolved into a serum-free ITES ERDF medium containing insulin (5 g/ml), transferrin (35 g/ml), ethanol amino (20 M) and selenium (2.5 nM) to give 200 M solution. By using this solution, culture media containing the present capsaicinoid-like substances in various concentrations were prepared, and the following hybridomas were cultured in these media. A culture medium containing capsaicin was used as a control. TABLE 3 Hybridoma Antibody Production H8 Human monoclonal antibody (IgM) S97 Human monoclonal antibody (IgG) The results shown in FIG. 1 , FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 demonstrate that the capsaicinoid-like substances (designaed as CLS-B in the figures) increased the production of IgM and IgG by the hybridomas more effectively than capsaicin. Further, FIG. 3 shows that the capsaicinoid-like substances have an extremely lower cytotoxicity than capsaicin. Example 4 Energy Metabolism-enhancing Activity of the Present Capsaicinoid-like Substances Energy metabolism-enhancing activity of the present capsaicinoid-like substances was also examined. The dried and pulverized material of CH-19 sweet (ca. 3 g) was wrapped with a medical wafer and eaten by a subject. Seen from the results in FIG. 4 , the temperature of skin rose by 1.4 C. about 30 min after intake. On the other hand, the temperature of eardrum decreased gradually by 0.3 C. about 75 min after intake. In this feeding experiment, no remarkable languidness was observed in the subjet, contrary to the case of feeding of a cultivated pungent variety, Capsium annuum var. parvo-acuninatum . The above results mean that the dried and pulverized material of CH-19 sweet has a temperature-rising activity (energy metabolism-enhancing activity) without causing any stimulation. Further, mice were fed with the present capsaicinoid-like substances to observe the energy metabolism-enhancing activity. As seen from the results in FIG. 5 , the temperature of the mice fed with the present capsaicinoid-like substances became higher than that of non-fed mice.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a thermosensitive cyclotriphosphazene-platinum complex conjugate which can be administered systemically or locally and has an excellent anticancer activity, its preparation method and an anticancer agent containing the same as an active ingredient. More particularly, the compound of the present invention is a biodegradable cyclotriphosphazene-platinum complex conjugate exhibiting thermosensitivity in the temperature range including the body temperature. The present inventors have found that the derivatives obtained by nucleophilic substitution of chlorine atoms in hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene ((NPCl 2 ) 3 ) with a low or high molecular weight hydrophilic poly(alkoxyethylene glycol) and a hydrophobic amino acid ester exhibit thermosensitivity (Korean patent application No. 99-48800). The present inventors have succeeded in the preparation of their platinum complexes by introducing the (diamine)platinum(II) ion to the hydrolyzed amino acid groups of these trimeric derivatives. To our surprise, these novel trimeric platinum complex conjugates also exhibited thermosensitivity in a wide temperature range including the body temperature as well as high anticancer activity. These new thermosensitive platinum complex conjugate anticancer agents showing a controlled release property has never been reported. These compounds can be administered systemically or locally since the targeted drug delivery is possible using their thermosensitivity. We expect, therefore, these new compounds will provide a new and significantly improved therapeutic regimen in the treatment of solid tumors. Thermosensitive polymers in the present invention refer to the polymers that can be solubilized in water at low temperatures but precipitates above a certain critical temperature due to the rapid decrease of their water-solubility. When such a phase transition is reversible, the phase transition temperature is called a lower critical solution temperature(LCST) or a cloud point. Below LCST, the hydrogen bonding between the polymer-water molecules is stronger than the hydrophobic interaction between the polymer-polymer molecules. As the temperature increases, however, the hydrogen bonding between the polymer-water molecules weakens whereas the hydrophobic interaction between the polymer-polymer molecules increases resulting in the precipitation of polymers in aqueous solution. These thermosensitive polymers were widely studied in many fields is including mainly drug delivery systems, medical biomaterials, thin films, the separation process of biochemical reactions, cosmetics and optics. However, most of the conventional thermosensitive organic polymers are known to be hydrolytically non-degradable. In recent years, a few biodegradable polymers were reported (Jeong, B. et. al., Nature, 388, 860 (1997); Song, S.-C. et. al., Macromolecules, 32, 2188(1999); Lee, S. B. et. al., Macromolecules, 32, 7820 (1999)). Up to date, however, no thermosensitive anticancer drug has been reported. Cisplatin, a platinum complex, approved as an anticancer agent in 1979 by FDA in the United States has been used as one of the most effective chemotherapeutic agents to treat a variety of cancers such as testicular, ovarian, bladder, and head and neck cancers. Its use is limited, however, due to its high toxicity (LD 50 13 mg/Kg, M. J. Cleare, Biochimie 60, 835(1978)). Even though the second-generation anticancer agent, carboplatin exhibits much lower toxicity than cisplatin (LD 50 180 mg/Kg, M. J. Cleare, Biochimie 60, 835(1978)), it is not widely used since it is lower in anticancer activity and more expensive than cisplatin. Therefore, there is a great need for a third-generation anticancer agent that has higher and wider anticancer activity with lower toxicity than cisplatin. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Therefore, an object of the present invention is to develop a third-generation anticancer agent having a higher anticancer activity and lower toxicity than the conventionally used cisplatin. To achieve this goal, the present inventors have discovered a novel class of the cyclotriphosphazene-platinum complex conjugate anticancer agents whose LCST can be designed variably for the desired purpose and controlled precisely, by introducing the solubilizing agent and the platinum complex into the biodegradable cyclotriphosphazene. These new cyclotriphosphazene-platinum complex conjugate anticancer agents of the present invention may be administered systemically or locally by using the thermosensitive properties of the drugs. More particularly, an object of the present invention is to provide oligomeric thermosensitive cyclotriphosphazene-platinum complex conjugates having a stereo-specific chemical structure and LCST that can be designed for the desired purpose, by nucleophilic substitution of the chlorine atoms in hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene with a poly(alkoxyethylene glycol) and an amino acid ester, followed by hydrolysis of the substituted amino acid ester and subsequent reaction with a (diamine)platinum salt and the preparation method thereof. Another object of the present invention is to provide an anticancer agent having the thermosensitive cyclotriphosphazene-platinum complex conjugate as an active ingredient. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION To achieve the above-mentioned goals, the present inventors have performed the following experiments. Hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene was reacted first with a hydrophilic poly(alkoxyethylene glycol) having different molecular weights, and then with a variety of hydrophobic amino acid esters to obtain a new class of cyclotriphosphazene derivatives with thermosensitive properties. The substituted amino acid eaters in the trimers were hydrolyzed with alkali, and then reacted with a (diamine)platinum(II) salt to obtain a cyclotriphosphazene-platinum complex conjugate formed by covalent bonding between the carboxylate groups of the amino acid and the platinum(II) cation. Surprisingly, we have found that these trimeric platinum conjugates exhibit thermosensitivity in a wide range of temperature depending on the kinds of substituents and the platinum derivatives. Furthermore, we have found that the LCST of the cyclotriphosphazene-platinum complex conjugates can be designed and controlled for the desired application purpose since the LCST of these cyclotriphosphazene-platinum complex can be varied easily by appropriate choice of different poly(alkoxyethylene glycol), amino acid and platinum derivatives. The preparation method of the novel stereo-specific cyclotriphosphazene-platinum complex conjugates represented by Formula 1 of the present invention is described in detail as follows. wherein, m is an integer selected from 2, 7 and 12; n is an integer selected from 0, 1, 2 and 3; x is an integer selected from 0, 1 and 2; and A 2 is a bidentate chelating diamine selected from the group consisting of 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine (dmpda), trans()-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (dach) and 1,1-diaminomethylcyclohexane (dmach). In the above, m selected from the integer of 2, 7, or 12 is a repeating unit of poly(alkoxyethylene glycol), n selected from the integer of 0 to 3 represents the length of the alkyl chain, x selected from the integer of 0 to 2 represents the length of the anionic amino acid residue. The trimeric amino acid ester derivatives represented by Formula 2 was prepared by reacting hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene first with hydrophilic poly(alkoxyethylene glycol) and then with a variety of hydrophobic amino acid esters. By reacting the trimeric derivatives of Formula 2 with 3 moles of alkali earth metal hydroxide of Formula 3 or with 6 moles of alkali metal hydroxide of Formula 4 in methanol or ethanol for 35 hours, the intermediate cyclotriphosphazene-alkali earth metal salt of Formula 5 or the cyclotriphosphazene-alkali metal salt of Formula 6, respectively, were obtained. With this intermediate, 3 moles of (diamine)platinum sulfate or nitrate of Formula 7 was reacted in distilled water for 37 hours at 15 C., and then the reaction mixture was freeze-dried. M(OH) 2 Formula 3 MOHFormula 4 A 2 PtL 2 Formula 7 In Formulas 2-7, m, n, x and A are as defined as in Formula 1; R is selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl or benzyl groups; M is an alkali earth metal ion such as barium or calcium; M is an alkali metal ion such as lithium, sodium or potassium; and L 2 is selected from sulfate or nitrate ion. The aqueous solution of (diamine)platinum salt of Formula 7 was prepared by reacting (diamine)platinum iodide with an acidic salt of silver according to the method in the literature (R. C. Harrison, Inorg. Chimica Acta 46, L15 (1980)). To the above freeze-dried product was added alcohol with stirring and then the solution mixture was centrifuged. After the supernatant solution was separated and condensed by evaporation at a reduced pressure, an excess amount of ether or hexane was added to precipitate the final product. The precipitation process using a solvent pair of alcohol/ether or hexane was repeated 23 times and the final precipitate was vacuum-dried. To remove small amounts of other isomers in the final product, an appropriate LCST lowering compound (NaCl, KCl, CF 3 CH 2 OH, or CH 3 (CH 2 ) 3 OH) depending on the LCST of the isomeric forms of the trimeric derivatives was added to the aqueous solution of the product to induce precipitation of the purer product. The supernatant aqueous phase was removed by centrifugation to obtain the purified precipitate. This purification process was repeated 23 times and then the final solution was freeze-dried to obtain the thermosensitive cyclotriphosphazene-platinum complex conjugates of Formula 1. The preparation process of the present invention is schematically represented in the following Reaction Scheme 1. The invention will be further illustrated by the following examples, but is not limited to the examples given. Elemental analysis of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen in the compounds of the present invention was performed in the Special Analysis Center at KIST by using carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen analyzer (Perkin Elmer), and phosphorous and platinum analysis was performed using Polyscan 61E ICP. Hydrogen and phosphorous nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were obtained using Varian to Gemini-300, and LCST was measured by using Perkin-Elmer Lamda 18 UV/VIS spectrophotometer. EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of NP(OCH 2 CH 2 ) 2 OCH 3 L-Asp.Pt(dmpda 3 After dissolving NP(OCH 2 CH 2 ) 2 OCH 3 NHCH(CH 2 COOC 2 H 5 )COOC 2 H 5 3 (1.00 g, 0.95 mmol) in methanol(50ml), the temperature of the reaction vessel was controlled to 05 C. by using ice-water bath. To this solution was slowly added with stirring a methanol solution containing an excess amount of Ba(OH) 2 .8H 2 O(1.19 g, 3.78 mmol). After 30 min. the ice-water bath was removed and then the reaction was continued further for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated at reduced pressure until only a small amount of solvent remained. An excess amount of ether or hexane was added to the concentrated reaction mixture to induce precipitation of the hydrolysis product. The precipitate thus obtained was re-dissolved in a small amount of methanol and re-precipitated by adding an excess amount of ether or hexane. After repeating the precipitation process 2-3 times, the final precipitate was dried in vacuum to obtain 0.99 g of cyclotriphosphazene-barium salt (yield, 93%). This trimeric barium salt (0.99 g, 0.87 mmol) was dissolved in 20 ml of distilled water and the temperature of the reaction vessel was controlled to 15 C. by using ice-water bath. To this solution was added drop-wise in 30 min. an aqueous solution prepared by dissolving (dmpda)PtSO 4 (0.87 g, 2.62 mmol) in distilled water. The reaction mixture was reacted for 3 hours and then freeze-dried. An excess amount of methanol or ethanol was added to the dried mixture and stirred to extract the cyclophosphazene-platinum complex conjugate. To increase the purity of the final conjugate product, the purification process comprising dissolution of the conjugate product in a small amount of methanol or ethanol and precipitation by adding an excess amount of ether or hexane has been repeated 23 times. The final precipitate was dried in vacuum to obtain the final product (1.25 g, yield, 81.0%).

Bioassay on the Cyclotriphosphazene-Pt Conjugates of the Present Invention The antitcancer activity of the complexes prepared according to the Examples of the present invention was assayed as follows. 1. Determination of in vitro activity (1) Samples: Example 2, Example 6, Example 7 and Example 11 (2) Cancer cell line: mouse leukemia L1210 cell line (3) Experimental method: The L1210 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and the concentration of the cells were controlled to 110 5 cells/ml. After adding the samples each serially diluted by logarithmic dose to the cells, cells were cultured in an incubator at 37 C. and under 5% CO 2 atmosphere. The viable cell number was determined after 24, 48 and 72 hours by using trypan blue dye exclusion test. By comparing with the cell numbers of the control group (where no chemical treatment was performed), the concentration of each compound exhibiting 50% of cell growth inhibition (ED 50 ) was calculated. The results are shown in Table 1. 2. Determination of in vivo (i.p.) activity (1) Samples: Example 2, Example 6, Example 7 and Example 11 (2) Cancer cell line: mouse leukemia L1210 cell line (3) Experimental method: The leukemia L1210 cells(110 5 cells/0.1 ml) obtained from DBA/2 donor mice were injected intraperitoneally to the BDF1 mice (6-8 weeks old, 8 mice per group). The samples were either dissolved in PBS solution or suspended in 0.5% Tween 80 depending on their solubility. These sample solutions were administered via intraperitoneal injection once a day for 5 consecutive days or at day 1, 5, and 9 after the cancer cell implantation at variable dosages. The survival rate was determined by observing the mice each day. By comparing with the average survival time of the control group (where no chemical treatment was performed), the percent average increase in the survival time(T/C, %) was calculated to determine the anticancer activity. The results are shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 Results of bioassay on the cyclotriphosphazene-Pt conjugates In vitro In vivo (i.p.)

FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to catalytic polymerization of alpha-olefins, and more particularly, to an ultra-high activity non-metallocene pre-catalyst featuring an amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate and a method for catalytic polymerization of alpha-olefin monomers using this pre-catalyst. Currently, there is significant interest relating to methods and systems of catalytic polymerization of alpha-olefin monomers based on a pre-catalyst featuring a metal bound to one or more spectator ligands, where the pre-catalyst may be soluble in a liquid phase solvent, or is adsorbed on a solid surface, and where alpha-olefin monomer reactant may be liquid or gas phase. In such methods and systems, typically, the pre-catalyst is activated by at least one co-catalyst, where the combination of the activated pre-catalyst and the at least one co-catalyst functions as a single chemical entity, or complex catalyst, for polymerization of the alpha-olefin monomer. The field of catalytic polymerization of alpha-olefin monomers is of significant industrial importance, as more than 50 million tons of poly(alpha-olefin) products, such as polyetheylenes and polypropylenes, are produced each year, involving metal based catalytic processes and systems. Hereinafter, the term pre-catalyst refers to a chemical entity, in general, and to a chemical compound, in particular, which, when activated by at least one co-catalyst, becomes part of a catalyst functional for catalytic polymerization of an alpha-olefin monomer, under proper polymerization reaction conditions. Without the presence of at least one co-catalyst, a pre-catalyst is ineffective for catalytic polymerization of an alpha-olefin monomer, and consequently exhibits essentially no catalytic activity for polymerization of an alpha-olefin monomer. Here, when referring to catalytic activity during a polymerization reaction, reference is with respect to the catalytic activity of a pre-catalyst, and it is to be understood that the pre-catalyst is functioning in concert with at least one co-catalyst for effecting catalytic polymerization of an alpha-olefin monomer. Thus, the present invention focuses on a new and novel pre-catalyst compared to pre-catalysts currently used for catalytic polymerization of alpha-olefin monomers. Currently, one of the major goals in this field is to produce a variety of new types of poly(alpha-olefin) products, for example, polymers made from alpha-olefin monomers featuring more than three carbon atoms such as 1-hexene, having well defined physicochemical properties and characteristics, such as mechanical strength, elasticity, melting point, and chemical resistance, applicable for manufacturing a diversity of end products. This may be achieved by polymerizing different types of alpha-olefin monomers, in order to produce a variety of homo-polymers and co-polymers, with varying degrees of monomer incorporation. Typically, degree of monomer incorporation strongly depends upon catalyst activity for polymerization of a given alpha-olefin monomer. Recently, Britovsek, G. J. P., et al., in The Search For New-Generation Olefin Polymerization Catalysts: Life Beyond Metallocenes, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 38, 428-447, 1999, provided a practical quantitative ranking of catalytic activity, with respect to weight of a pre-catalyst, (grams polymer produced)/(mmole-pre-cat. hr), for ethylene polymerization, under one bar pressure, as follows: very low1, low 1-10, moderate 10-100, high 100-1000, very high1000. Their ranking is derived from data of catalytic polymerization of ethylene, which is the easiest alpha-olefin monomer to polymerize. Catalytic activity for polymerization of other larger alpha-olefin monomers, such as 1-hexene and 1-octene, is usually at least one order of magnitude less. Thus, a pre-catalyst for polymerization of 1-hexene, for example, may be considered exhibiting high, and very high, activity in the range of about 10-100, and 100-1000, grams/(mmole-pre-cat. hr), respectively. Physicochemical properties of polymers include, are directly related to, and are controllable by, polymer molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. These values are highly relevant with respect to producing different types of polymers. For example, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), having an average molecular weight above 3,000,000 has the highest abrasion resistance of thermoplastics and a low coefficient of friction. Unlike synthesis of small molecules, however, polymerization reactions involve random events characterized by formation of polymers having a range of molecular weights, rather than a single molecular weight. Typically, polymers are better defined and characterized in relation to narrow molecular weight ranges. The accepted parameter for defining polymer molecular weight distribution is the polydispersity index (PDI), which is the weight average molecular weight, M w , divided by the number average molecular weight, M n , or, M w /M n . Depending upon the actual application, ideally, a catalytic polymerization system features living polymerization in which the rate of initiation is higher than the rate of propagation leading to a PDI of close to 1, and involving a single catalytic active site. This has been achieved in very few systems for catalytic polymerization of alpha-olefin monomers. A PDI of 2.0, signifying non-living polymerization, is often found in metallocene catalytic systems, also involving a single catalytic active site. Classical heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalytic systems usually lead to a broader range of molecular weights with a PDI of about 5. One current challenge is to design alpha-olefin polymerization pre-catalysts, and catalytic systems including such pre-catalysts, leading to poly(alpha-olefin) products with low values of PDI. Metallocene pre-catalysts, featuring a metal complex including a metal atom, for example from Group IV transition elements such as titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, bound to two ligands from the well known cyclopentadienyl (Cp) family of ligands such as pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, indenyl, or fluorenyl, were introduced during the last two decades for the purpose of catalytic polymerization of alpha-olefin monomers. The most common type of metallocene pre-catalyst is a neutral complex including a metal in oxidation state of 4, bound to two anionic ligands in addition to two standard Cp ligands, for example, bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium dichloride, also known as titanocene dichloride. A related group of complexes is constrained geometry pre-catalysts, featuring a metal bound to both a single Cp type ligand and a second anionic group, where the Cp ligand and second anionic group are covalently linked. Using metallocene and metallocene type pre-catalysts in catalytic processes and systems for polymerization of alpha-olefin monomers affords better control of molecular weight and narrower molecular weight distribution, translating to lower values of PDI, relative to the classical Ziegler-Natta family of pre-catalysts such as titanium trichloride using a trialkyl-aluminum co-catalyst. Metallocene and metallocene type pre-catalysts, processes, and systems are well known and taught about in the art. These pre-catalysts, processes and systems are, however, limited in many respects relating to the above discussion. Foremost, with respect to catalytic activity, metallocene type pre-catalysts typically exhibit relatively moderate activity for polymerizing a small variety of alpha-olefin monomers. With respect to poly(alpha-olefin) product types and variety, alpha-olefin monomers polymerized by metallocene pre-catalysts are mostly short chain ethylene and propylene, which are already well taught about. Metallocene pre-catalysts are limited in terms of availability and versatility. With respect to pre-catalyst availability, metallocene type pre-catalysts are relatively difficult to synthesize, a fact which affects the possibility of developing new varieties of metallocene type alpha-olefin polymerization pre-catalysts. Due to continued searching for new poly(alpha-olefin) products exhibiting selected well defined physicochemical properties and characteristics, combined with the above limitations associated with metallocene pre-catalysts, there is growing interest in developing non-metallocene alpha-olefin polymerization pre-catalysts, and related catalytic processes, and systems. The main emphasis is on obtaining new alpha-olefin polymerization pre-catalysts exhibiting higher activity, stability, and availability needed for enabling better control over industrially important polymer parameters such as molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, product type, and variety. The first step towards development of non-metallocene pre-catalysts was taken by the introduction of a half sandwich pre-catalyst, featuring a complex including a Cp type ligand bridging to a heteroatom donor. An example of such a pre-catalyst is a phenolate constrained geometry polymerization pre-catalyst disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,856,258. The pre-catalyst described therein shows relatively high activity of about 1,300 grams/(mmole-pre-cat. hr) for polymerization of alpha-olefin monomers, however monomers polymerized are limited to ethylene, propylene, and styrene. A non-metallocene alpha-olefin polymerization catalytic system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,852,146, and features a bis(hydroxy aromatic nitrogen ligand) transition metal pre-catalyst, functioning with an activating methylaminoxane (MAO) co-catalyst. Relatively high catalytic activity of about 4,000 grams/(mmole-pre-cat. hr) is reported for polymerization of ethylene only. Moreover, MAO is needed in large quantities as co-catalyst, which, in general poses notable limitations relating to cost and containment. MAO used in large quantities is costly, and needs to be properly disposed of with regard to environmental considerations. Living polymerization of 1-hexene is recently described by Schrock, R. R., in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119, 3830, 1997, and is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,889,128. One of the non-metallocene pre-catalyst compositions described therein comprises a dimethyl complex in which the metal atom is chelated to a tridentate spectator ligand, which is activated by a non-MAO boron salt co-catalyst. Catalytic activity under the conditions described was considered high, of about 200 grams/(mmole-pre-cat. hr), and the molecular weight of the obtained poly(1-hexene) product is moderate, of about 50,000 grams/mole. Living polymerization of 1-hexene is also described by McConville, D. H., in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118, 10008, 1996. They describe a moderately active non-metallocene polymerization pre-catalyst, exhibiting activity of about 40 g/(mmole-pre-cat. hr), involving activation of a pre-catalyst featuring a dimethyl metal complex of a bis(amide) ligand, with a non-MAO boron Lewis acid as co-catalyst under room temperature, for producing a moderate molecular weight polymer, of molecular weight of 40,000 grams/mole. The same pre-catalyst, but functioning with MAO as co-catalyst in large excess, under the same reaction conditions, yields significantly higher activity, as reported by McConville, D. H., in Macromolecules V. 29, 5241, 1996. Again, limitations associated with using MAO as co-catalyst are present. Another active non-metallocene living 1-hexene polymerization pre-catalyst functioning with a non-MAO co-catalyst, is reported by Kim, K., in Organometallics 17, 3161, 1998. The described catalyst system exhibits activity of about 400 gramsl(mmole-pre-cat. hr). A non-metallocene non-living 1-hexene polymerization pre-catalyst is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,801. The pre-catalyst exhibits high activity, of on the order of 10 6 g/(mmole-pre-cat. hr), when the pre-catalyst is, again, activated with MAO as co-catalyst, for the polymerization process taking place at 50 C. A non-metallocene bis(phenolate) pre-catalyst is reported by Schaverien, C. J., in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117 3008, 1995. The pre-catalyst described exhibits limited activity, of about 10 g/(mmole-pre-cat. hr), for tactic polymerization of 1 -hexene, yielding high molecular weight isotactic poly(1-hexene). In view of the above discussed limitations, to one of ordinary skill in the art, there is thus a need for, and it would be advantageous to have an ultra-high activity non-metallocene pre-catalyst and corresponding method for catalytic polymerization of alpha-olefin monomers, not limited to activation by large quantities of a co-catalyst such as MAO, and also characterized by high stability, readily obtained or synthesized, and capable of producing different types and varieties of poly(alpha-olefin) products having high molecular weight, and low molecular weight distribution. Moreover, there is a need of such a pre-catalyst and method for producing alpha-olefin polymers other than polyethylenes and polypropylenes, having industrially applicable properties and characteristics.

Preferably, the organic solvent is selected from the group including the alpha-olefin monomer to be polymerized such as 1-pentene, 1-hexene or 1-octene, or, an organic solvent such as pentane, heptane, toluene, methylene chloride, and chlorobenzene. The specific solvent or solvents used for dissolving amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst 1 or 2, and for dissolving the co-catalyst, depend upon the desired poly(alpha-olefin) product distribution, especially with respect to formation of different homo-polymers and co-polymers, each having a different degree of alpha-olefin monomer incorporation. Typically, when the monomer to be polymerized is liquid phase, at least one of the solvents used for dissolving amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst 1 or 2 and/or the co-catalyst is the alpha-olefin monomer targeted as the desired poly(alpha-olefin) product. Molecular weight distribution, measured as PDI, of the product formed is typically affected by the concentration of the alpha-olefin monomer to be polymerized in a solvent including inert diluent, such as pentane or heptane. For example, when the alpha-olefin polymerization is conducted in neat 1-hexene, a temperature rise may occur, due to exothermic reaction, generally resulting in a relatively broad polymer molecular weight distribution, leading to a relatively high PDI value. When the same alpha-olefin polymerization is conducted under similar conditions, but using dilute solution of the target 1-hexene and inert diluent such as heptane, reaction temperature rise is milder, and polymer molecular weight distribution is narrower, yielding a lower PDI value. In Step 3A, the dissolved co-catalyst is added to or combined with the dissolved amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst 1 or 2, for forming a polymerization reaction system. Conditions for performing Step 1 through Step 3 are preferably room temperature, with exclusion of moisture and oxygen in order to prevent hydrolysis or oxidation of either the pre-catalyst or the co-catalyst. As an alternative step for including the alpha-olefin monomer as one of the solvents used for dissolving amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst 1 or 2, or for dissolving the co-catalyst, is Step 3B, where the desired alpha-olefin monomer is separately added as a gas phase reactant, bubbled into and/or through the liquid phase already including dissolved amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst 1 or 2 and co-catalyst, for forming the polymerization reaction system. In Step 4, the polymerization reaction system is stirred for a duration in the range of between about 30 seconds to about 12 hours. Starting from olymerization reaction initiation, and including duration of stirring of the reaction system, heat may be released from the reaction system, accompanied by possible color change of the reaction system. The polymerization may be conducted at different temperatures. External cooling, for example, down to about 0 C., may be used for slowing down the polymerization. Heating, for example, to reflux temperature, speeds up the reaction. In Step 5, the polymerization reaction is finished under one of the following cases: (i) stopping the polymerization reaction by addition of an external quencher such as a protic solvent; (ii) complete consumption of the monomer; (iii) termination of the polymerization reaction due to catalyst deactivation. In Step 6, the polymer product is isolated by the following procedure. Excess pre-catalyst 1 or 2 and/or co-catalyst, may be hydrolyzed. Isolation of the polymer product from the solvent and/or remaining alpha-olefin monomer in solution depends upon the solubility of the polymer product. In the case of an insoluble polymer product, for example, polyethylene, the isolation procedure includes filtration and drying, whereas in the case of a soluble polymer product, volatile species are removed by distillation and the polymer product is then dried. Impurities, such as decomposition products of pre-catalyst 1 or 2 and/or co-catalyst are typically washed away. In Step 7, physicochemical properties and characteristics of the poly(alpha-olefin) products produced from the polymerization reaction system are measured and analyzed by various techniques, including melting point, pectroscopy such as NMR, mechanical strength such as elasticity, etc. Structural information and molecular weight information relating to polymer molecular weight distribution via the polydispersity index (PDI), are also determined. In an alternative preferred embodiment of the method for catalytic polymerization of an alpha-olefin monomer, using amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst 1 or 2 of the present invention, a specific form of chelate pre-catalyst 1 or 2 is adsorbed onto the surface of a solid support such as silica, alumina, or magnesia. A suitable co-catalyst, such as one of the co-catalysts previously described in Step 2, is combined with the adsorbed pre-catalyst on the surface of the solid support. The co-catalyst is brought into contact with adsorbed pre-catalyst by a variety of ways, including by adsorbing co-catalyst on the same surface of the solid support used for adsorbing pre-catalyst, by flowing a solution of dissolved co-catalyst through a catalytic reactor bed housing the solid support featuring the adsorbed pre-catalyst, or by pouring a specified volume of solution of dissolved co-catalyst onto the solid support featuring the adsorbed pre-catalyst. Once in contact, interaction of adsorbed pre-catalyst 1 or 2 and co-catalyst enables activation of pre-catalyst, and the combination of pre-catalyst and co-catalyst results in formation of a combined or complex catalyst for heterogeneous catalytic polymerization of an alpha-olefin monomer. Here, an alpha-olefin monomer reactant is fed to the catalyst as either liquid or gas phase, and the ensuing heterogeneous gas or liquid/solid phase polymerization reaction takes place on the surface of the heterogeneous catalyst at the location of adsorbed activated pre-catalyst 1 or 2. To illustrate the ultra-high catalytic activity exhibited by amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst 1 of the present invention for polymerization of alpha-olefin monomers, highlights of selected polymerization reaction systems described in Examples 7-10 below are herein provided. Amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst 1 in the first exemplary specific form described above, namely, six coordinate dialkyl amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst (CH 3 ) 2 NCH 2 CH 2 Zr(CH 2 Ph) 2 9, is activated by boron Lewis acid co-catalyst, B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 , in the presence of neat 1-hexene at room temperature under nitrogen gas inert atmosphere, where 1-hexene functions as both the target alpha-olefin monomer to be polymerized and as dissolution solvent for pre-catalyst 9 and for the boron co-catalyst. Unexpectedly, the ensuing reaction resulted in dramatic generation of exothermic heat, resulting in boiling of the 1-hexene monomer at 64 C., and extremely rapid formation of poly(1-hexene) product. Consumption of the 1-hexene monomer was essentially complete after only about 2 minutes. Average molecular weight of the poly(1-bexene) product was measured as M w 12,700 grams/mole, and the PDI was 6. The relatively broad molecular weight distribution may be caused by the relatively high temperature of the olymerization mixture arising from a relatively high rate of exothermic heat valved under these reaction conditions. For this catalytic polymerization system, catalytic activity of pre-catalyst 9 was calculated from reaction data as 15,500 (grams poly(1-hexene) produced)/(mmole-pre-cat. hr). This magnitude of catalytic activity of a non-metallocene type pre-catalyst for catalytic polymerization of an alpha-olefin monomer is exceptionally high considering the relatively unfavorable polymerization reaction conditions involving use of a small quantity of a moderately active, non-MAO, boron co-catalyst, and where labile groups in polymerization pre-catalyst 9 are benzyl groups. When the same pre-catalyst (CH 3 ) 2 NCH 2 CH 2 Zr(CH 2 Ph) 2 9 is activated by the same boron Lewis acid co-catalyst, B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 , in 1-hexene diluted with heptane diluent, to an extent of heptane:1-hexene volume ratio of 7:3, at room temperature under nitrogen gas inert atmosphere, a significantly less vigorous polymerization reaction takes place. Catalytic activity calculated from the reaction data in this case is still relatively high at 2000 (grams poly(1-hexene) produced)/(mmole-pre-cat. hr). Compared to catalytic polymerization of 1-hexene monomer using pre-catalyst 9 activated in neat 1-hexene, exothermic heat evolved by the reaction mixture in dilute 1-hexene was significantly milder, resulting in a substantially lower catalytic activity. In this reaction system, consumption of 1-hexene monomer versus time was measured and found to be linear, as shown in FIG. 3 , an illustration of catalytic activity of amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst (CH 3 ) 2 NCH 2 CH 2 Zr(CH 2 Ph) 2 9 for the polymerization of 1-hexene alpha-olefin monomer in dilute 1-hexene. The data of FIG. 3 show that this reaction system is active for at least 8 minutes, after which about 80% of the 1-hexene monomer is consumed, under these conditions. The poly(1-hexene) product had a high molecular weight of M w 170,000 grams/mole, with a low PDI of 2.2. In another example of highly active catalytic polymerization of exemplary alpha-olefin monomer 1-hexene, six coordinate dialkyl amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst 2-Pyridine-CH 2 Zr(CH 2 Ph) 2 13 is activated by boron Lewis acid co-catalyst, B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 , in the presence of neat 1-hexene at room temperature under nitrogen gas inert atmosphere, where again 1-hexene functions as both the target alpha-olefin monomer to be polymerized and as dissolution solvent for pre-catalyst 13 and for the boron co-catalyst. Considerable exothermic beat of reaction is evolved, leading to a catalytic activity calculated from the reaction data of about 10,000 (grams poly(1-hexene) produced)/(mmole-pre-cat. hr). Results of high catalytic activity obtained from this catalytic reaction system, using pre-catalyst 13, are very similar to those obtained when using pre-catalyst 9, for polymerization of 1-hexene alpha-olefin monomer. Catalytic activity of amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst 1 of the present invention, illustrated in part, by specific forms of six coordinate amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate, pre-catalyst (CH 3 ) 2 NCH 2 CH 2 Zr(CH 2 Ph) 2 9, and pre-catalyst 2-Pyridine-CH 2 Zr(CH 2 Ph) 2 13, operating under the above described reaction conditions, is up to several orders of magnitude higher than catalytic activity of currently used non-metallocene pre-catalysts and related catalytic systems. For example, prior art non-metallocene pre-catalysts and catalytic systems activated by a non-MAO co-catalyst for catalytic polymerization of 1-hexene exhibit catalytic activities of about 400, 200, 40, and 10, grams/(mmole-pre-cat. hr), as reported by Kim, K., in Organometallics 17, 3161, 1998, disclosed in U.S. Pat.

The mixture was cooled in a freezer over night and the supernatant solution decanted. The residue was triturated using a triturating solvent such as ice cold methanol, filtered, and washed thoroughly with cold methanol, to give the bis-adduct 10 as a colorless powder (2.7 g, 45.4% yield), which could be further purified by re-crystallization from ethanol. Melting point of 10 was 132 C. HRMS (high resolution mass spectrometry) of 10: calculated, 495.407630, and observed, 495.406458.

EXAMPLE 4 Synthesis of Amine Bis(phenolate) Ligand-metal Chelate Pre-catalyst (CH 3 ) 2 NCH 2 CH 2 Zr(CH 2 Ph) 2 9 A solution of amine bis(2-hydroxyarylmethyl) ligand precursor (CH 3 ) 2 NCH 2 CH 2 7, as synthesized according to Example 1, (200 mg, 0.38 mmol) in toluene (10 mL) was added drop-wise to a solution of zirconium tetra(benzyl) (0.38 mmol) in toluene (10 mL), at room temperature under nitrogen gas inert atmosphere. The reaction mixture was then heated to 65 C. and stirred for two hours. The toluene was removed from the reaction mixture under low pressure to yield pre-catalyst 9, 99% pure, as a yellow solid. Spectroscopic Data of 9. 1 H NMR (C 6 D 6 , 600 MHz) 7.74 (d, J7.1, 2H), 7.62 (d, J2.4, 2H), 7.39 (t, J8.1, 2H), 7.05 (t, J7.3, 1H), 6.95 (d, J2.4, 2H), 6.90 (d, J7.1, 2H), 6.73 (t, J8.0, 2H), 6.55 (t, J7.3, 1H), 3.45 (br d, J13.0, 2H, CH 2 ), 2.70 (s, 2H, PhCH 2 ), 2.60 (d, J13.6, 2H, CH 2 ), 2.57 (s, 2H, PhCH 2 ), 1.88 (s, 18H, CH 3 ), 1.48 (s, 6H, N(CH 3 ) 2 ), 1.40 (br, 4H, CH 2 ), 1.36 (s, 18H, CH 3 ). 13 C NMR (C 6 D 6 , 151.14 MHz) 158.2, 149.3, 147.2, 141.3, 136.5, 129.1, 128.4, 128.3, 127.5, 125.2, 124.8, 122.5, 120.4, 68.1 (PhCH 2 ), 66.1 (PhCH 2 ), 65.2 (ArCH 2 N), 60.2 (NCH 2 ), 51.9 (NCH 2 ), 47.5 (N(CH 3 ) 2 ), 35.7 (CC), 34.4 (CC), 32.0 (CH 3 ), 30.8 (CH 3 ). Crystallographic (X-ray) Data for C 53 H 80 N 2 O 2 Zr 9. M868.41, monoclinic space group P2 1 /c, a18.4520(10), b19.1310(19), c28.2390(10) , 90, U9968.5(8) 3 , Z8, D c 1.157 g/cm 3 , (MoK)0.260 mm 1 , T117 K. Enraf-Nonius Kappa-CCD, 9375 reflections were measured (R int 0.000). The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F 2 . In the crystal, the dimethylamino(ethyl) arm was found to be disordered. The unit cell contain one molecule of pentane. The final refinement converged at R 1 0.1028 and wR 2 0.2636 for observations with I 2(I) and R 1 0.1480 and wR 2 0.2853 for all data. Spectroscopic data of 9 are consistent with a single stereoisomer featuring symmetrically related phenolate rings, two different benzyl groups, and an AX spin system for the two benzylic methylene groups. This points to a rigid chelate of C s symmetry on the NMR time scale, with the benzyl groups in a cis geometry, as required for alpha-olefin polymerization catalysts, and the phenolate groups in a trans geometry. The crystallographic (X-ray) data support the spectroscopic data. The X-ray structure of pre-catalyst N(CH 3 ) 2 CH 2 CH 2 Zr(CH 2 Ph) 2 9, shown in FIG. 1 , indicates a structure featuring a mononuclear zirconium chelate having a slightly distorted octahedral geometry, including a coordinative bond between Zr and each of the two nitrogen atoms. The phenolate groups of the tetradentate ligand fold back toward the pendant (dimethylamino)ethyl arm to an extent the angle between the two planes of the phenolate rings is about 30 degrees, thus leaving a relatively open cleft for the equatorial benzyl group. The small difference between the two coordinative NZr bond lengths may indicate a weaker binding of the outer side arm nitrogen to the metal. EXAMPLE 5 Synthesis of Amine Bis(phenolate) Ligand-metal Chelate Pre-catalyst CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 Zr(CH 2 Ph) 2 11 In addition to serving as another example of a specific form of general amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst 1, the five coordinate dialkyl amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst, CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 Zr(CH 2 Ph) 2 11, was synthesized in order to further understand and measure the influence of the extra heteroatom, in (R n YT) group, in the six coordinate dialkyl amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst, (CH 3 ) 2 NCH 2 CH 2 Zr(CH 2 Ph) 2 9, arising from inclusion of (CH 3 ) 2 NCH 2 CH 2 as (R n YT) group in the amine bis(phenolate) ligand precursor bridging group, CH 2 (R n YT)NCH 2 , for polymerization of alpha-olefin monomers. A solution of amine bis(2-hydroxyarylmethyl) ligand precursor CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 10, synthesized according to Example 2, (200 mg, 0.40 mmol) in toluene (10 mL) was added drop-wise to a solution of zirconium tetra(benzyl) (0.40 mmol) in toluene (10 mL), at room temperature under nitrogen gas inert atmosphere. The reaction mixture was then heated to 65 C. and stirred for two hours. The color of the reaction mixture changed from yellow to colorless. The toluene was removed from the reaction mixture under low pressure to yield pre-catalyst 11, 99% pure, as a colorless solid. Spectroscopic Data of 11. 1 H NMR (C 6 D 6 , 360 MHz) 7.76 (d, J7.5, 2H), 7.57 (d, J2.3, 2H), 7.28 (t, J7.6, 2H), 7.12 (t, J7.3, 1H), 6.94 (d, J2.3, 2H), 6.92 (d, J7.4, 2H), 6.74 (t, J7.4, 2H), 6.62 (t, J7.3, 1H), 3.30 (d, J13.8, 2H, CH 2 ), 2.99 (s, 2H, PhCH 2 ), 2.98 (d, J13.6, 2H, CH 2 ), 2.03 (m, 2H, CH 2 ), 1.95 (s, 2H, PhCH 2 ), 1.79 (s, 18H, CH 3 ), 1.35 (s, 18H, CH 3 ), 1.05 (m, 2H, CH 2 ), 0.03 (t, J7.3, CH 3 ). 13 C NMR (C 6 D 6 , 90.68 MHz) 158.3, 148.3, 142.1, 137.4, 136.8, 131.4, 129.5, 125.8, 125.4, 125.2, 125.1, 122.7, 60.9 (ArCH 2 N, NCH 2 ), 58.9 (PhCH 2 ), 45.5 (PhCH 2 ), 36.1 (CC), 35.0 (CC), 32.6 (CH 3 ), 31.3 (CH 3 ), 14.0 (CH 2 ), 11.2 (CH 3 ). Crystallographic (X-ray) Data for C 54 H 81 NO 2 Zr 11. M867.42, monoclinic space group P2 1 /c, a10.4840(1), b19.2970(4), c24.5940(5) , 91.048(1), U4974.77(15) 3 , Z4, D c 1.158 g/cm 3 , p(MoK)0.259 mm 1 , T116 K. Enraf-Nonius Kappa-CCD, 12508 reflections were measured (R int 0.000). The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F 2 . In the crystal, one of the tert-butyl groups was found to be disordered. The unit cell contains one molecule of heptane. The final refinement converged at R 1 0.0493 and wR 2 0.1295 for observations with I2(I) and R 1 0.0624 and wR 2 0.1377 for all data. Spectroscopic data of 11 are consistent with a single stereoisomer featuring symmetrically related phenolate rings, two different benzyl groups, and an AX spin system for the two benzylic methylene groups. This points to another rigid chelate of C s symmetry on the NMR time scale, with the benzyl groups in a non-trans geometry, as required for alpha-olefin polymerization catalysts, and the phenolate groups in a trans geometry. The crystallographic (X-ray) data support the spectroscopic data. The X-ray structure of pre-catalyst CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 Zr(CH 2 Ph) 2 11, shown in FIG. 2 , indicates a structure featuring a mononuclear zirconium chelate having a pseudo trigonal bi-pyrimidal (TBP) geometry, with axial 0 atoms and equatorial N, C, C atoms. The two benzylic carbon atoms, the nitrogen atom and the metal atom, all lie in the same plane, as the sum of the (CH 2 ) 1 Zr(CH 2 ) 2 angle (117.39), the (CH 2 ) 1 ZrN angle (114.45) and the (CH 2 ) 2 ZrN angle (128.15) equals 360.0. The acute Zr(CH 2 )C(Ar) angle (89.4), as well as the short ZrC(Ar) distance (2.71 ), for one of the benzyl groups, indicate that the pi-system of the benzyl ligand interacts with the metal center, namely, there is a non classical 2 binding of this group to the Zr atom, as taught by Cloke, F. G. N. et al., in J. Organomet. Chem. 506, 343, 1996. EXAMPLE 6 Synthesis of Amine Bis(phenolate) Ligand-metal Chelate Pre-catalyst 2-Pyridine-CH 2 Zr(CH 2 Ph) 2 13 As another example of a specific form of general amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst 1, the six coordinate dialkyl amine bis(phenolate) ligand-metal chelate pre-catalyst, 2-Pyridine-CH 2 Zr(CH 2 Ph) 2 13, was synthesized. A solution of amine bis(2-hydroxyarylmethyl) ligand precursor 2-Pyridine-CH 2 12, synthesized according to Example 3, (150 mg, 0.28 mmol) in toluene (5 mL), was added dropwise to a solution of zirconium tetra(benzyl) (0.28 mmol) in toluene (5 mL), at room temperature under nitrogen gas inert atmosphere. The reaction mixture was then heated to 65 C. and stirred for two hours. The toluene was removed from the reaction mixture under low pressure to yield pre-catalyst 13, 99% pure, as a yellow solid. Spectroscopic Data of 13. 1 H NMR (C 6 D 6 , 200 MHz) 8.17 (d, J5.2, 1H), 7.83 (d, J7.6, 2H), 7.40 (t, J7.6, 2H), 7.35 (d, J2.3, 2H), 7.06 (m, 3H), 6.89 (t, J7.3, 2H), 6.81 (d, J2.3, 2H), 6.65 (t, J7.2, 1H), 6.33 (t, J7.5, 1H), 6.10 (t, J6.1, 1H), 5.59 (d, J7.7, 1H), 3.77 (d, J13.1, 2H, CH 2 ), 3.23 (s, 2H, CH 2 ), 2.92 (s, 2H, CH 2 ), 2.63 (d, J13.1, 2H, CH 2 ), 2.59 (s, 2H, CH 2 ), 2.06 (m, 2H, CH 2 ), 1.70 (s, 18H, CH 3 ), 1.34 (s, 18H, CH 3 ). The spectroscopic data of 13 are consistent with a single stereoisomer featuring symmetrically related phenolate rings, two different benzyl groups, and an AX spin system for the two benzylic methylene groups. This points to another rigid chelate of C s symmetry on the NMR time scale, with the benzyl groups in a cis geometry, as required for alpha-olefin polymerization catalysts, and the phenolate groups in a trans geometry.

FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY This invention relates to 6-fluorobicyclo3.1.0hexane derivatives that are useful as drugs. In particular, it relates to novel 2-amino-6-fluorobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid derivatives that are useful for the treatment and prevention of psychiatric disorders such as, for example, schizophrenia, anxiety and its associated diseases, depression, bipolar disorder and epilepsy; and neurological diseases such as drug dependence, cognitive disorders, Alzheimers disease, Huntingtons chorea, Parkinsons disease, dyskinesia associated with muscular stiffness, cerebral ischemia, cerebral failure, myelopathy, and head trauma. BACKGROUND ART In recent years, with the repeated cloning of glutamate receptor genes, it has become clear that there are surprisingly many subtypes of glutamate receptors. At present, glutamate receptors are roughly classified into two types: the ionotropic type, in which the receptor has an ion channel type structure, and the metabotropic type, in which the receptor is coupled to G-proteins. Ionotropic receptors are classified pharmacologically into three types: N-methyl-D-asparaginic acid (NMDA), -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl isoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA), and kynate (Science, 258, 597-603, 1992). Metabotropic receptors are classified into eight types, type 1 through type 8 (J. Neurosci., 13, 1372-1378, 1993; Neuropharmacol., 34, 1-26, 1995). The metabotropic glutamate receptors are classified pharmacologically into three groups. Of these, group 2 (mGluR2/mGluR3) bind with adenylcyclase, and inhibit the accumulation of the Forskolin stimulation of cyclic adenosine momophosphate (cAMP) (Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 14, 13(1993)), which suggests that compounds that act on group 2 metabotropic glutamate receptors should be useful for the treatment or prevention of acute and chronic psychiatric and neurological diseases. As substances that act on group 2 metabotropic glutamate receptors, ()-(1S,2S,5R,6S)-2-aminobicyclo 3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid has been disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication, First Publication No. Hei 8-188561 1996. And, (1S*,2S*,5R*,6R*)-2-amino-4-oxobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, (1S*,2S*,4S*,5R*,6R*)-2-amino-4-hydroxybicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, and (1S*,2R*,4S*,5S*,6S*)-2-amino-4-flurobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid have been disclosed in EP-A-878,463. Fluorine atoms tend to be strongly electron-attractive and to confer high fat solubility, so that compounds into which fluorine atoms are introduced greatly change their physical properties. Thus introducing fluorine atoms might greatly affect the absorbability, metabolic stability, and pharmacological effects of a compound. But it is by no means easy to introduce fluorine atoms. In fact, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication, First Publication No. Hei 8-188561 1996 does not even discuss the introduction of fluorine atoms into ()-(1S,2S,5R,6S)-2-aminobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid. Further, (1S*,2R*,4S*,5S*,6S*)-2-amino-4-flurobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid which has been disclosed in EP-A-878,463 was prepared by merely a substitution of a hydroxyl group in (1S*,2S*,4S*,5R*,6R*)-2-amino-4-hydroxybicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, by a fluorine atom by use of normal fluorination agents. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION In view of the aforementioned present state of the prior art, the purpose of this invention is to provide drugs that are effective for the treatment and prevention of psychiatric disorders such as, for example, schizophrenia, anxiety and its associated diseases, depression, bipolar disorder and epilepsy; and neurological diseases such as drug dependence, cognitive disorders, Alzheimers disease, Huntingtons chorea, Parkinsons disease, dyskinesia associated with muscular stiffness, cerebral ischemia, cerebral failure, myelopathy and head trauma; especially oral drugs that can act on group 2 metabotropic glutamate receptors. The inventors of the present invention, who made a diligent study of 2-amino-6-fluorobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid derivatives in which a fluorine atom is introduced into the 6position of ()-(1S,2S,5R,6S)-2-aminobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, (1S*,2S*,5R*,6R*)-2-amino-4-oxobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, and (1S*,2S*,4S*,5R*,6R*)-2-amino-4-hydroxybicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, have discovered novel 2-amino-4-flurobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid derivatives that when taken orally can affect group 2 metabotropic glutamate receptors, thereby completed this invention.

The compounds of the present invention may exist as various solvates, but from the standpoint of applicability as a drug, hydrates are preferable. In compounds represented by the formula I, if both of Y 1 and Y 2 represent hydrogen atoms, or together represent an oxygen atom or X(CH 2 ) n X (X is an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom: n is 2 or 3), or if both of Y 1 and Y 2 represent a C 1-10 alkylthio group, a C 3-8 cycloalkylthio group, a C 3-8 cycloalkyl-C 1-5 alkylthio group, a C 1-5 alkoxy group, a C 3-8 cycloalkoxy group or a C 3-8 cycloalkyl-C 1-5 alkoxy group, asymmetric carbon atoms are present in the positions of 1, 2, 5, and 6. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention of the above cases can exist as optically active substances, enantiomers thereof or racemic body thereof. Further, if Y 1 and Y 2 differently represent a hydrogen atom, a C 1-10 alkylthio group, a C 3-8 cycloalkylthio group, a C 3-8 cycloalkyl-C 1-5 alkylthio group, a C 1-5 alkoxy group, a C 3-8 cycloalkoxy group or a C 3-8 cycloalkyl-C 1-5 alkoxy group, or one of Y 1 and Y 2 represents a hydrogen atom and the other represents a hydroxyl group, a C 1-5 alkoxy group, a C 3-8 cycloalkoxy group or a C 3-8 cycloalkyl-C 1-5 alkoxy group, asymmetric carbon atoms are present in the positions of 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention of the above cases can be as optically active substances, enantiomers thereof, racemic body or a mixture of diastereomers based on Y 1 and Y 2 in the 4-position. It is preferable that the compounds represented in the formula I have the following relative stereochemical configuration represented by the formula I: A () or ()-(1R*,2S*,6S*)-2-amino-6-fluoro-4-substituted-bicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid can be cited as a specific example of particularly preferable compounds in the formula I. The other preferable combinations of Y 1 and Y 2 in the compounds represented by the formula I include the cases wherein both of them represent hydrogen atoms, wherein they together represent an oxygen atom, and wherein one of them represents an hydrogen atom and the other represents a hydroxyl group, each of which can be shown by the following formulas II, III and IV, respectively. Further, it is more preferable that the compounds of the above formulas II, III and IV have the following relative stereochemical configurations represented by the formulas II, III and IV, respectively. ()-(1R*,2S*,5R*6R*)-2-amino-6-fluorobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, ()-(1R*,2S*,5S*6S*)-2-amino-6-fluoro-4-oxobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, and () or ()-(1R*,2S*,4S*,5S*,6S*)-2-amino-6-fluoro-4-hydroxybicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, all of which are optically active substances, can be cited as particularly preferable compounds among the compounds represented by the formulas II, III and IV, respectively. If in the formulas I, II, III and IV (including the cases of I, II, III and IV) one or both of R 1 and R 2 represent something other than a hydrogen atom, that is, the ester forms will not have an effect on group 2 metabotropic glutamate receptors. But, these ester forms are hydrolyzed in vivo, and are transformed into a carboxylic acid, which does have an effect on group 2 metabotropic glutamate receptors. In this way, the ester forms of the compounds encompassed in the present invention are very useful because they function as prodrugs. The compounds of the formula I can be manufactured according to the following reactions. In the following reaction formulas, R 1 , R 2 , Y 1 and Y 2 are the same as above, R 3 and R 4 represent R 2 and R 1 other than a hydrogen atom, respectively. X represents a chlorine atom, a bromine atom or an iodine atom. Y 3 and Y 4 together represent X(CH 2) n X (X is an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom: n is 2 or 3), or they identically or differently represent a C 1-10 alkylthio group, a C 3-8 cycloalkylthio group, a C 3-8 cycloalkyl-C 1-5 alkylthio group, a C 1-5 alkoxy group, a C 3-8 cycloalkoxy group or a C 3-8 cycloalkyl-C 1-5 alkoxy group. Ar represents an aryl group such as a phenyl group, a 4-chlorophenyl group and a 4-methoxyphenyl group. Z 1 represents a common protective group for a hydroxyl group. Z 2 represents a common protective group for a hydroxyl group, or represents a hydrogen atom. Z 3 represents a common protective group for an amino group. Common protective groups for hydroxyl and amino groups are described in detail in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, by Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. As shown in the above reaction formula, the racemic ketone (3) or (4), or a mixture of diastereomers of both can be obtained by, first, transforming a carboxylic acid moiety of the Z form (1) or E form (2) of the above fluoroacrylic acid derivative, or a mixture of both into an active form, and then reacting with diazomethane, followed by reaction in an inert solvent under the presence of a metal catalyst. The active form herein means an acid halide or a mixed acid anhydride. The acid halide can be obtained by reacting common halogenation agents for a hydroxyl group in a carboxylic acid, such as, for example, thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride and carbon tetrachloride-triphenylphosphine, with the Z form (1) or the E form (2) of the fluoroacrylic acid derivative, or with a mixture of both. The mixed acid anhydride can be obtained by reacting halo-carbonates such as isobutyl chlorocarbonate and ethyl chlorocarbonate, or organic acid anhydrides such as acetic acid anhydride and trifluoroacetic acid anhydride with the Z form (1) or the E form (2) of the fluoroacrylic acid derivative, or a mixture of both, with or without the presence of organic bases such as triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, diisopropylethylamine and pyridine, or inorganic bases such as potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate and sodium hydride. The metal catalyst can, for example, be copper agents such as copper (I) iodide, copper (II) sulfate, copper (II) acetate, copper (II) bis(acetylacetonate) and copper (II) bis(N-t-butylsalicylaldiimidate); rhodium agents such as rhodium (II) acetate and rhodium (II) trifluoroacetate; and palladium agents such as palladium (II) acetate and bis(benzonitrile)dichloro palladium (II). Examples of the inert solvent can include ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and diethylether; hydrocarbons such as toluene and benzene; halogen type solvents such as methylene chloride, chloroform and 1,2-dichloroethane; N,N-dimethylformamide; and acetonitrile. The racemic ketone (3) or the racemic ketone (4) can be directly optically resolved by use of the HPLC method employing chiral carriers such as cellulose carbamate derivatives and amylosecarbamate derivatives. They can also be optically resolved by being changed into slats with optically active amines such as () or ()-1-phenylethylamine, () or ()-2-amino-1-butanol, () or ()-alaninol, brucine, cinchonidine, cinchonine, quinine, quinidine and dehydroabiethylamine, after an ester moiety of the racemic ketone (3) or the racemic ketone (4) is transformed into a carboxylic acid under normal hydrolysis conditions. Further, they can be resolved after being changed into amido forms by use of a primary or secondary optical active amines such as () or ()-1-phenylethylamine, () or ()-2-amino-1-butanol, () or ()-alaninol, and normal amidation agents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). As shown in the above reaction formula, the ketone (3), which is present as an optically active substance, enantiomer or racemic body, can be transformed into the enone (5), which is present as an optically active substance, enantiomer or racemic body, by reacting it with, for example, silylation agents under the presence of bases to form the silylenolether followed by reacting it with, for example, palladium (II) acetate. The enone (5) can be transformed into the keto-alcohol (7), which is an optically active substance, enantiomer or racemic body, by first being changed into the epoxy form (6) by means of the reaction with peroxides such as t-butylhydroperoxide and m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, and then by being reduced with, for example, diphenyldiselenide under the presence of thiols (J. Org. Chem. 59, 5179-5183 (1994)). Here, amines such as triethylamine and diisopropylethylamine, amide bases such as lithium diisopropylamide and potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, and inorganic bases such as sodium hydride can be used as the bases. Silane compounds such as trimethylsilyl chloride, trimethylsilyl iodide and t-butyldimethylsilyl chloride can be used as the silylation agents. As reaction solvents, inert solvents such as benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran and acetonitrile can be cited. The keto-alcohol (7), which is an optically active substance, enantiomer or racemic body, can be transformed into the compound (9) by changing it into the ketone form (8), which is an optically active substance, enantiomer or racemic body, directly or if necessary after protecting a hydroxyl group of the keto-alcohol (7) with a common protective group for a hydroxyl group, followed by reacting it with, for example, alcohol or thiol under the presence of Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride-diethylether complex. The keto-alcohol (7) and its hydroxyl group-protected type are together represented by the formula (8). Then, it is possible to change it to the ketal or thioketal (9), which is an optionally active substance, enantiomer or racemic body, with Z 2 that is a hydrogen atom, by deprotecting if Z 2 is the common protective group for the hydroxyl group. The ketal or thioketal (9) with Z 2 of a hydrogen atom can be transformed into the compound (10), which is an optically active substance, enantiomer or racemic body, by oxidation of the hydroxyl group. The methods described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora W. G Reene and Peter G. M. Wuts can be employed for the protection and deprotection of the hydroxyl group, and ketalation and thioketalation of the carbonyl group herein. Oxidation means to oxidize with, for example, chromium type oxidants typified by Jones and Collins oxidations; manganese type oxidants such as potassium permanganate and manganese dioxide; dimethylsulfoxide type oxidants using, as an activater, oxalyl chloride, acetic acid anhydride, phosphorus pentoxide, sulfur trioxide-pyridine, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), etc; cerium type oxidants such as cerium diammonium nitrate and cerium sulfate; ruthenium type oxidants such as tetrapropylammonium perrutheniumate and ruthenium oxide; and a Dess-Martin agent (see Oxidations in Organic Chemistry, American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C., 1990, Milos Hudlicky): or to oxidize with oxygen under the presence of a catalyst such as palladium and platinum. For example, it can be performed in inert solvents such as ethers such as tetrahydrofran and diethylether, hydrocarbons such as toluene and benzene, halogen type solvents such as dichloromethane and chloroform, ketone type solvents such as acetone and ethylmethylketone, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, acetic acid, pyridine, water and mixtures thereof. The racemic body (5), (6), (7), (8), (9) or (10) can be directly optically resolved by use of the HPLC method employing chiral carriers such as cellulose carbamate derivatives and amylose carbamate derivatives. They can also be optically resolved by being changed into salts with optically active amines such as () or ()-1-phenylethylamine, () or ()-2-amino-1-butanol, () or ()-alaninol, brucine, cinchonidine, cinchonine, quinine, quinidine and dehydroabiethylamine, after an ester moiety of the racemic body (5), (6), (7), (8), (9) or (10) is transformed into a carboxylic acid by hydrolysis under normal basic or acidic ester hydrolysis conditions. Further, they can be resolved after being changed into amido forms by use of primary or secondary optically active amines such as () or ()-1-phenylethylamine, () or ()-2-amino-1-butanol and () or ()-alaninol, and normal amidation agents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). The ketones (11) including the compounds (3), (7) and (10) are useful as intermediates to synthesize the compounds according to the present invention. The ketones (11), which are optically active substances, enantiomers or racemic bodies, can be made into hydantoin derivatives (12) or amino cyanide derivatives (13) by Strecker Amino Acid Synthesis (Ann., 75, 27 (1850); 91, 349 (1850)), the Bucherer-Bergs Reaction (J. Prakt. Chem., 140, 69 (1934)), or a variation of these. The hydantoin derivatives (12) and the amino cyanide derivatives (13) can be made into the compounds of the present invention, which are optically active substances, enantiomers or racemic bodies, 4-substituted-2-amino-6-fluorobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acids (14), by basic hydrolysis with, for example, sodium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, etc. For instance, in the case wherein Y 1 and Y 2 in the hydantoin derivatives (12) or the amino cyanide derivatives (13) together represent S(CH 2 ) n S, or identically or differently represent a C 1-10 alkylthio group, a C 3-8 cycloalkylthio group or a C 3-8 cycloalkyl-C 1-5 alkylthio group, one of the compounds (14) according to the present invention, 2-amino-6-fluoro-4,4-dialkylthiobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, which is an optically active substance, enantiomer or racemic body, can be made by conducting basic hydrolysis for the compounds (12) or (13) with sodium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, etc. On the other hand, the hydantoin derivatives (12) and the amino cyanide derivatives (13) can be made into one of the compounds (14) according to the present invention, 2-amino-6-fluoro-4-oxobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, which is an optically active substance, enantiomer or racemic body, by hydrolysis under acidic conditions using, for example, sulfuric acid or the like. Incidentally, 2-amino-6-fluoro-4-oxobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, which is an optically active substance, enantiomer or racemic body, can also be obtained by removal of a dialkylthio group from 2-amino-6-fluoro-4,4-dialkylthiobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, which is an optically active substance, enantiomer or racemic body (see Protective Groups in organic Synthesis, Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts). Further, 2-amino-6-fluoro-4-oxobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, which is an optically active substance, enantiomer or racemic body, can also be obtained by, for example, oxidation of a hydroxyl group of 2-amino-6-fluoro-4-hydroxybicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, which is an optically active substance, enantiomer or racemic body, (see Oxidations in Organic Chemistry, American Chemical Society, Washington, D.C., 1990, Milos Hudlicky). During this, it is preferable to protect the carboxyl and amino groups of the compounds (14), if necessary (see, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora W. Greene, John Wilely Sons Inc.). The racemic body of the formula (15) can be directly optically resolved by use of the HPLC method employing chiral carriers such as cellulose carbamate derivatives and amylose carbamate derivatives. The racemic body (15) can also be optically resolved by being changed into salts with optically active amines such as () or ()-1-phenylethylamine, () or ()-2-amino-1-butanol, () or ()-alaninol, brucine, cinchonidine, cinchonine, quinine, quinidine and dehydroabiethylamine, after an ester moiety of the racemic body (15) is hydrolyzed to form a carboxylic acid (16) by hydrolysis under normal basic or acidic ester hydrolysis conditions. Further, it can be resolved after being changed into an amido form by use of primary or secondary optically active amines such as () or ()-1-phenylethylamine, () or ()-2-amino-1-butanol and () or ()-alaninol, and normal amidation agents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). As shown in the above reaction formula, the 4-substituted-2-amino-6-fluorobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (14), which is the compound according to the present invention and is present as an optically active substance, enantiomer or racemic body, can be transformed into the compound according to the present invention represented by the formula (17), the ester form of the 4-substituted-2-amino-6-fluorobicyclo3.1.0hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, which is present as an optically active substance, enantiomer or racemic body, by esterification with common methods using alcohols represented by R 3 OH or R 4 OH; or by transformation into the compound represented by the formula (19) by esterification with common methods using alkylhalides represented by R 3 X or R 4 X or alcohols represented by R 3 OH or R 4 OH after changing it into the compound (18) by protecting an amino group with a protecting group represented by Z 3 , followed by deprotecting of the protecting group Z 3 for the amino group. Protection, esterification and deprotection of an amino group in the above, can be performed in accordance with normal methods (Protective Groups in organic Synthesis, Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts). If the compound (17) is a racemic body, it can be optically resolved by a general optical resolution using an acidic chiral resolving agent. If the compound (18) is a racemic body, it can be optically resolved by a general optical resolution using a basic chiral resolving agent. Here, as the acidic chiral resolving agent, one can use optically active organic acids such as () or ()-di-p-toluoyl tartaric acid, () or ()-dibenzoyl tartaric acid, () or ()-tartaric acid, () or ()-mandelic acid, () or ()-camphoric acid, and () or ()-camphorsulfonic acid. As the basic chiral resolving agent, one can use, for example, optically active amines such as () or ()-1-phenylethylamine, () or ()-2-amino-1-butanol, () or ()-alaninol, brucine, cinchonidine, cinchonine, quinine, quinidine, dehydroabiethylamine, etc. As shown in the above reaction formula, the Z form (1) and E form (2) of the fluoroacrylic acid derivative or a mixture of the Z and E forms represented by the formula (23) can be obtained by making the compound (22) by the reaction of -butyrolactol (20) with the phosphonoacetic acid derivative (21), followed by oxidation of a hydroxyl group to a carboxylic acid directly or after protecting the hydroxyl group. The protection of the hydroxyl group can be performed in accordance with normal protecting methods for a hydroxyl group (Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora W. G Reene and Peter G. M. Wuts). As the specific embodiments of the oxidation, one can cite, for example, direct oxidation to a carboxylic acid by use of chromium type oxidants such as Jones reagent, pyridinium dichromate (PDC) or manganese type oxidants such as potassium permanganate; or stepwise oxidation to a carboxylic acid by, for example, sodium chlorite, etc. after changing it into an aldehyde by oxidation with, for example, dimethylsulfoxide such as Swern oxidation (Oxidations in Organic Chemistry, American Chemical Society, Washington D.C., 1990, Milos Hudlicky). The compounds (22) wherein Z 2 is a t-butyldimethylsilyl group, a t-butyldiphenylsilyl group, or the like, can be divided into two isomers of the Z and E forms by use of silicagel column chromatography, etc. Further, as shown in the above reaction formula, the Z form (1) of the fluoroacrylic acid derivative can be obtained by oxidation with or without deprotecting the protecting group Z 1 of a hydroxyl group, after preparation of the compound (26) by reaction of the halide represented by the formula (24) and the sulfoxide derivative (25). The deprotection of the protecting group Z 1 can be performed in accordance with normal methods (see Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora W. G Reene and Peter G. M. Wuts). As the specific embodiments of the oxidation, one can cite, for example, direct oxidation to carboxylic acid by use of chromium type oxidants such as Jones reagent, pyridinium dichromate (PDC) or manganese type oxidants such as potassium permanganate; or stepwise oxidation to a carboxylic acid by, for example, sodium chlorite, etc. after changing it to an aldehyde by oxidation with, for example, dimethylsulfoxide such as Swern Oxidation. The compounds according to the present invention can be made into pharmaceutical preparations by combining with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, or diluents. Examples of said carriers, excipients and diluents include water, lactose, dextrose, fructose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, starch, gum, gelatin, arginate, calcium silicate, calcium phosphate, cellulose, water syrup, methyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, alkyl parahydroxy benzoate, talc, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glycerin, and oils such as sesame oil, olive oil and soybean oil. The compounds according to the present invention, after being mixed with these carriers, excipients or diluents, and, if necessary, with additives such as generally used fillers, binders, disintegrants, pH regulators and solubilizers, can, by means of usual formulation technology, be prepared as pharmaceutical preparations for oral or parenteral administration, especially as preparations that act on group 2 metabotropic glutamate receptors (group 2 metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists) and that prevent or treat psychiatric or neurological diseases, in such forms as tablets, pills, capsules, granules, powders, liquids, emulsions, suspensions, ointments, injections and skin plasters. The compounds according to this invention can be administered orally or parenterally to an adult patient in a quantity of 0.01-500 mg in a single or in divided doses per day. This dosage can be increased or decreased as appropriate in consideration of the type of disease being treated and the patients age, weight and symptoms. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION In the following, we describe this invention specifically by presenting working examples and experimental examples. However, this invention is not thereby limited to these examples. EXAMPLE 1 Synthesis of (1RS, 5RS, 6RS)ethyl 6-fluoro-2-oxobicyclo3.1.0hexane-6-carboxylate (1) Under a nitrogen flow, with ice-cooling, 78.0 ml of a 1.00M tetrahydrofuran solution of sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide was added dropwise over 40 min to a solution of 18.9 g of ethyl diethylphosphonofluoroacetate in 75 ml of tetrahydrofuran, and then the mixture was further stirred for 45 min. A pre-prepared solution of -butyrolactol (at 78 C., under a nitrogen flow, 70.3 ml of a 1.01 M toluene solution of aluminum diisobutylhydride was added dropwise over 1.5 hours to 6.1 g of -butyrolactone in 75 ml of tetrahydrofuran, and then the mixture was further stirred at this temperature for more 1.5 hours) was added dropwise over 30 min to this reaction solution. The ice-bath was taken off after the addition. The reaction solution was quenched with 120 ml of 6N hydrochloric acid after stirring it for 2 hours at room temperature, and then 3 hours at 30 C. The reaction solution was extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The obtained organic layers were consolidated, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate after being washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride.

The reaction temperature during the reaction of the carboxylic acid with the phosphorus halide cannot be absolutely determined. It is desired that the temperature is usually 0 to 40 C. or so, preferably 10 to 30 C. or so, from the viewpoints of reaction rate and inhibition of ester decomposition. The reaction time cannot be absolutely determined because the reaction time varies depending upon reaction temperature and the like. The reaction time can be until the termination of the reaction, and is usually 1 to 24 hours or so. Incidentally, the termination of reaction can be confirmed by using gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the like. The reaction product thus prepared is a tert-alkyl carboxylic acid ester represented by the formula (III). After the termination of the reaction, for instance, the reaction mixture is added dropwise to water or an aqueous alkali with stirring, or alternatively water or an aqueous alkali is added dropwise to the reaction mixture with stirring, and the mixture is allowed to separate into two layers. The organic layer can be used after the organic layer is washed with water or an aqueous alkali and dried over a desiccant such as magnesium sulfate, or after the organic solvent is distilled off to precipitate crystals. The tert-alkyl carboxylic acid ester prepared according to the present invention can be suitably used, for instance, as intermediates for pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics. In addition, the process of the present invention can be also utilized for a process for protecting carboxyl group in the carboxylic acid.

The process according to the present invention comprises either alkylating a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula wherein R 1 is halogen, or reducing a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula wherein R 1 is as defined above and R 2 is lower alkyl to thereby produce a fluoro benzoic acid represented by the formula wherein R 1 and R 2 are as defined above. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a process for preparing a fluoro benzoic acid. BACKGROUND ART Benzo heterocyclic derivatives represented by the formula (1) shown below have excellent antibacterial activity and are useful as antibacterial agents (Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 96557/1994). In the formula, R 2 is C 1-6 alkyl. R 3 is a 5- to 9-membered saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic ring residue, the heterocyclic ring residue optionally having one or more substituents. R 4 is cyclopropyl which may be substituted by 1 to 3 substituents selected from the group consisting of C 1-6 alkyl and halogen; phenyl which may be substituted by 1 to 3 substituents selected from the group consisting of C 1-6 alkoxy, halogen and hydroxy on the phenyl ring; C 1-6 alkyl which may be substituted by halogen, C 2-6 alkanoyloxy or hydroxy; C 2-6 alkenyl or thienyl. R is hydrogen or C 1-6 alkyl. More specifically, the benzo heterocyclic derivatives of the formula (1) and salts thereof have excellent antibacterial activities against various gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria and are useful for the treatment of various infectious diseases induced by various bacteria in human, other animals and fish and also useful as an external antimicrobial or disinfectant agent for medical instruments and the like. The benzo heterocyclic derivatives of the formula (1) and salts thereof show an excellent antibacterial activity against mycoplasma, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, anaerobic bacteria, resistant cells against various antibacterials, clinically isolated strains, and gram negative and gram positive bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis and Staphyloccocus pyognes and hence are useful as an antibacterial agent for the treatment of diseases induced by these microorganisms. The benzo heterocyclic derivatives of the formula (1) and salts thereof show low toxicity and less side effect and have characteristic features such as good absorbability and sustained activity. Furthermore, the benzo heterocyclic derivatives of the formula (1) and salts thereof are useful for the treatment of urinary infectious diseases because they are highly excreted via urine, and further because of easy excretion via bile, they are useful for the treatment of intestinal infectious diseases. According to Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 96557/1994, the benzo heterocyclic derivatives of the formula (1) and salts thereof are prepared by using a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) wherein R 2 is as defined above and R 1 is halogen. According to Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 96557/1994, as shown below in Reaction Scheme A or B, a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) is prepared by using known starting compounds by a multiple-step process comprising five steps. Thus according to the process described in Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 96557/1994, a complicated reaction procedure must be carried out to prepare the fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2). Furthermore, the desired fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) is obtained only in a low yield of about 8.3%. wherein R 1 is as defined above, R a is hydrogen or C 1-6 alkyl, R b is C 1-6 alkyl, and X 1 is halogen. wherein R 2 is as defined above and R c is C 1-6 alkyl. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications Nos. 243692/1990 and 74167/1992 and EP319906 disclose a process for preparing a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) by using a compound of the formula (A), as shown in the following Reaction Scheme C: The process, however, necessitates undertaking three steps to prepare the desired fluoro benzoic acid by using the compound of the formula (A). Furthermore, the desired fluoro benzoic acid is obtained only in a low yield of about 7.5%, based on the compound of the formula (A). Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications Nos. 502452/1991 and 291959/1998 and J. Heterocyclic Chem., 27, p1610 (1990) disclose a process for preparing a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) by using a compound of the formula (B), as shown in the following Reaction Scheme D: wherein R d is alkyl. The process, however, necessitates undertaking seven steps to prepare the desired fluoro benzoic acid by using the compound of the formula (B). Furthermore, the desired fluoro benzoic acid is obtained only in a low yield of about 45.8%, based on the compound of the formula (B). J. Heterocyclic Chem., 27, p.1611 (1990) and Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1991, vol.34, No.3, p.1156 disclose a process for preparing a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) by using the compound of the formula (C), as shown in the following Reaction Scheme E: wherein R e is methyl or ethyl. The process, however, necessitates undertaking four steps to prepare the desired fluoro benzoic acid by using the compound of the formula (C). Furthermore, the desired fluoro benzoic acid is obtained only in a low yield of about 25 to 30%, based on the compound of the formula (C). DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a single step process for preparing a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) without the necessity of undertaking multiple steps, the fluoro benzoic acid being used as an intermediate for preparing a benzo heterocyclic derivative of the formula (1) which is useful as an antibacterial agent. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing the fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) by a simple and convenient procedure at low costs, using an easily available compound without using any special reagents. A further object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing the fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) in high purity and high yield. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a commercially advantageous process for preparing the fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2). In view of such state, the inventors of the present invention carried out extensive research to achieve the above objects. During the research, the present inventors conceived of using as a starting material a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (3) wherein R 1 is as defined above. The fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (3) is a compound which is unsubstituted at the 5-position with respect to the carboxyl group. Izv. Sib. Otd. Akad. Nauk SSSR, Ser. Khim. Nauk, Vol.5, p100 (1975) discloses a process for preparing a compound of the formula (F) comprising reacting a compound of the formula (D) with a Grignard reagent (E), as shown in the following Reaction Scheme F: The process produces the compound of the formula (F) in a high yield, but it is presumably owing to the chemical structure of the compound of the formula (D) used as a starting material. Stated more specifically, the compound of the formula (D) is a compound wherein all the hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring have been replaced by substituents (fluorine atoms and a carboxyl group). Upon substitution reaction with the Grignard reagent (E), a fluorine atom at one of the ortho-positions with respect to the carboxyl group (i.e., at 2- or 6-position) is substituted by R f . Whether R f replaces either one of the fluorine atoms at the 2- and 6-positions with respect to the carboxyl group, the resulting compound will be a compound represented by the formula (F). Japanese Examined Patent Publications Nos. 502452/1991 and 291959/1998 disclose a process for preparing a compound of the formula (H), which comprises reacting a compound of the formula (G) with alkyllithium, as shown in the following Reaction Scheme G: The process produces the compound of the formula (H) in a high yield, but it is presumably owing to the chemical structure of the compound of the formula (G) used as a starting material. Stated more specifically, the compound of the formula (G) is a compound wherein all the hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring have been replaced by substituents (fluorine atoms and a 2-oxazolyl group). Upon substitution reaction with alkyllithium, a fluorine atom at one of the ortho-positions with respect to the 2-oxazolyl group (i.e., 2- or 6-position) is substituted by R g . Whether R g replaces either one of the fluorine atoms at the 2- and 6-positions with respect to the 2-oxazolyl group, the resulting compound will be a compound represented by the formula (H). From the conventional reactions as described above, it could easily be assumed that when a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (3), which is unsubstituted at the 5-position with respect to the carboxyl group, is alkylated with a Grignard reagent (E) or alkyllithium, the resulting compound would have an alkyl group either at the 2-position or at the 6-position with respect to the carboxyl group. Stated more specifically, it had been considered that the reaction would produce two kinds of compounds, i.e., a compound having an alkyl group at the 2-position, and a compound having an alkyl group at the 6-position, the 2- and 6-positions being ortho positions with respect to the carboxyl group of the fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (3). Surprisingly, however, the reaction produces only a trace or no amount of the compound having an alkyl group at the 6-position, which is one of the ortho positions with respect to the carboxyl group of the fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (3), and selectively produces only the compound having an alkyl group at the 2-position, which is the other ortho position with respect to the carboxyl group of the fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (3). Such finding was surprising and unpredictable even to those skilled in the art having chemical knowledge in the field.

"abstract": "The invention relates to a process for the preparation of trifluoromethylanilines of formula (I) wherein R 1 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, methyl, monochloromethyl, dichloromethyl, or formyl, and R 2 is hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine, with the proviso that when R 1 and R 2 are both hydrogen, the amino group is para to the trifluoromethyl group, comprising (a) nitrating a benzotrichloride of formula (II) wherein R 1 and R 2 are each as defined for formula (I), thereby forming a nitrobenzotrichloride, (b) converting the trichloromethyl group of the nitrobenzotrichloride into a trifluoromethyl group by reaction with anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, thereby forming a nitrobenzotrifluoride, and (c) reducing the nitro groups of the nitrobenzotrifluoride to form a trifluoromethylaniline of formula (I). The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing trifluoromethylanilines starting from benzotrichlorides. Trifluoromethylanilines are important intermediates for preparing pharmaceutically and agrochemically active compounds, for example herbicides, insecticides, infection inhibitors and disinfectants. There is therefore a need for a process for preparing trifluoromethylanilines in a simple and economical manner in industrial quantities in good yields and purities. Existing processes for preparing trifluoromethylanilines are unsuitable for practice on an industrial scale or have other serious disadvantages. The use of sulphur tetrafluoride for preparing trifluoromethylanilines on an industrial scale (see J. Org. Chem. 26, 1477 (1961) and 27, 1406 (1962)) is not advisable on account of its extreme toxicity. The introduction of trifluoromethyl groups by means of sodium trifluoroacetate in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of copper(I) iodide (see J. Chem. Soc. Perk. Trans. 1, 1988, 921) requires costly reagents, and there are problems with the disposal of copper salts. The fluorination of tribromomethylnitrobenzene with antimony trifluoride and the subsequent reduction of the resulting trifluoromethylnitrobenzene by means of tin chloride (see J. Am. Chem. Soc. 69, 2346 (1947)) likewise requires costly reagents and substantial spending on ecological measures. The reaction of chlorobenzotrifluoride with ammonia and copper(I) chloride (see J. Org. Chem. 44, 4731 (1979)) requires drastic reaction conditions and provides only low yields. Nitrating benzotrifluoride and reducing the nitrobenzotrifluoride obtainable provides large amounts of 3-trifluoromethylaniline (around 90%), some 2-trifluoromethylaniline (around 9%) and only little 4-trifluoromethylaniline (around 1%) (see Synthesis 11, 1087 (1992)). The situation is similar with the nitration of substituted benzotrifluorides. The only processes in existence for preparing 3-chloro-6-nitrobenzotrifluoride and 3-fluoro-6-nitrobenzotrifluoride (US-A 2,086,029) provide 3-chloro-4-nitrobenzotrifluoride and 3-fluoro-4-nitrobenzotrifluoride only to a small extent. Frequently, however, the 4-trifluoromethylanilines are the more wanted compounds. Preparing trifluoromethylaniline by catalytic reduction of trifluoromethylnitrobenzene has been known for a long time (see J. Org. Chem. 26, 1477 (1964)), but, as explained above, 4-trifluoromethylnitrobenzene is not conveniently obtainable on an industrial scale. A more recent process for preparing trifluoromethylaniline comprises reacting trichloromethylphenyl isocyanate first with anhydrous hydrofluoric acid and then with water to obtain trifluoromethylaniline hydrofluoride, from which the free aniline is released using a base (see EP-A 639 556). The starting isocyanate has to be prepared first, for example by chlorination of methylphenyl isocyanate. The particular disadvantage of this process is its many stages. Another recent process reacts chlorobenzotrifluoride with ammonia or amine in the presence of a palladium catalyst, a cocatalyst and a strong base (see EP-A 846 676). As well as being complex, the process has the disadvantage that even an isomerically pure starting material will give rise to a product that is a mixture of isomers. This invention now provides a process for preparing trifluoromethylanilines of the formula (I) where R 1 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, methyl, monochloromethyl, dichloromethyl or formyl and R 2 is hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine and for R 1 R 2 hydrogen the amino group is para to the trifluoromethyl group, characterized in that a benzotrichloride of the formula (II) where R 1 and R 2 are each as defined for the formula (I), is nitrated and, in the nitrobenzotrichlorides thus obtainable, the trichloromethyl groups are converted into trifluoromethyl groups by reaction with anhydrous hydrofluoric acid and finally the nitro groups are reduced. In the formulae (I) and (II) R 1 is preferably hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine and R 2 is preferably hydrogen or chlorine. The first step of the process according to the invention, the nitration of benzotrichlorides of the formula (II), is preferably carried out using mixtures of nitric acid and sulphuric acid as nitrating agent, the sulphuric acid preferably being at least 96% strength and the nitric acid being fuming nitric acid containing around 100% HNO 3 . The nitric acid is preferably used in excess, for example 1.2 to 5 mol per mole of benzotrichloride of the formula (II). This amount is preferably 1.8 to 2.5 mol. The weight ratio of nitric acid to sulphuric acid can be for example 0.5 to 2:1. It is also possible first to add just nitric acid and then sulphuric acid. An addition of sulphuric acid without initially charging or simultaneously adding nitric acid to benzotrichlorides of the formula (II) is to be avoided. The nitration can be carried out for example at temperatures in the range 15 to 50 C. It is preferable to use the range from 10 to 35 C. If desired, the nitration may be carried out in the presence of an inert solvent. Examples of useful solvents are dichloromethane and 1,2-dichloroethane. The nitration can be carried out batchwise of discontinuously or else continuously, for example in a tubular reactor. The use of bundle reactors or microreactors is likewise possible. The as-nitrated reaction mixture can be worked up, for example, by discharging it onto ice, extracting with an inert organic solvent, washing the combined extracts acid-free (for example with water and/or aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution), drying and removing the extractant. The second step of the process according to the invention, the reaction with anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, can be carried out using the mixture of isomeric nitrobenzotrichlorides obtained in the first step. However, it is also possible first to separate the isomers, for example by distillation or crystallization, and to react isomerically pure nitrobenzotrichlorides with anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. For example, 3 to 50 mol of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid can be used per mole of nitrobenzotrichloride, in which case the material commercially available under the name anhydrous hydrofluoric acid is sufficiently water-free. The fluorination can be carried out for example at temperatures in the range 0 to 180 C. and pressures in the range 1 to 50 bar. It is preferable to fluorinate at 10 to 160 C. and 1 to 30 bar. If desired, the fluorination can be carried out in the presence of a catalyst and/or an inert solvent. The catalyst used can be for example boron trifluoride, titanium tetrachloride, antimony pentachloride or antimony pentafluoride, while dichloromethane can be used as solvent. The anhydrous hydrofluoric acid can be charged first and the nitrobenzotrichloride added, or vice versa. It is advantageous to combine the hydrofluoric acid and the nitrobenzotrichloride at relatively low temperatures, for example, at up to 50 C., within the framework of the abovementioned temperature ranges, and then to increase the temperature. After the reaction has ended, the reaction mixture can be admixed with a suitable solvent, for example dichloromethane, and the organic phase separated off, washed with water, dried and concentrated or distilled. The fluorination can also be carried out in the gas phase, in which case the reaction temperature can be 200 to 450 C. for example. To prepare very isomerically pure trifluoromethylanilines of the formula (I), it is advantageous to separate the isomers at the nitrobenzotrifluoride stage. For example, this separation of isomers may be effected by final distillation or a combination of final distillation and crystallization. The final distillation is preferably carried out using such pressures that the liquid phase does not have to be heated to temperatures above 200 C. It is advantageous to carry out the final distillation at pressures in the range 50 to 150 mbar and at liquid phase temperatures in the range from 110 to 180 C. A combination of final distillation and crystallization can be carried out for example by first isolating an at least 80% pure product by final distillation and using it to obtain even purer products by crystallization. The crystallization mother liquor can be recycled into the final distillation. This makes it possible for example to obtain 4-nitrobenzotrifluoride in a purity above 99% and to use it to prepare in the third stage a similarly pure 4-trifluoromethylaniline. The crystallization may be carried out for example simply by cooling or by addition of a solvent in which the trifluoromethylanilines are sparingly soluble. If desired, the product obtained by crystallization can be further purified by recrystallization. The third step of the process according to the invention, the reduction, can be carried out in a conventional manner, for example as a chemical reduction using for example hydrazine hydrate, ammonium formate, triethylamine/formic acid, tin(II) chloride, iron, sodium sulphide or sodium hydrogensulphide as reducing agent. However, preference is given to the catalytic reduction with hydrogen in the presence of catalysts, for example Raney nickel or palladium catalysts. The catalytic reduction can be carried out for example at temperatures in the range from 20 to 100 C., pressures in the range from 1 to 50 bar and optionally in the presence of solvents such as alcohols or esters, preferably C 1 -C 4 -alkyl alcohols or acetates thereof The catalytic hydrogenation is generally accompanied by significant isomerization, i.e. in general isomerically pure or substantially isomerically pure trifluoromethylanilines are obtained when a corresponding isomerically pure or substantially isomerically pure nitrobenzotrifluoride has been used. Nitrobenzotrifluorides in the form of isomeric mixtures generally give rise to trifluoromethylaniline isomer mixtures having the same or similar distribution of isomers. To obtain isomerically pure trifluoromethylanilines, it is advantageous to carry out the separation of isomers prior to the reduction stage. The mixture present after a catalytic reduction can be worked up in a simple manner, for example by filtering it and subsequently concentrating the filtrate. A chemical reduction can be worked up in the manner which is known in principle for such reactions. The process of the invention is a simple way of preparing trifluoromethylanilines in good yields and purities in few reaction steps and in customary apparatus. It also provides trifluoromethylanilines containing higher levels of 4-isomers than in the prior art. Problematic reagents such as sulphur tetrafluoride and costly reagents such as bromides or iodides need not be used. There are no special ecological problems. This is surprising, since using benzotrifluorides (instead of benzotrichlorides) as starting materials provides worse results, as is reflected for example in the high fraction of 3-isomers (around 90%). Specifically the separation of the 3- from the 4-isomers is particularly inconvenient because of the small boiling point differences. The significantly smaller quantities of 3-isomers produced in the process of the invention can likewise be obtained in very pure form (after removal of the other isomers at the nitro compound stage) and used as intermediates for active pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. It is also possible to separate off unwanted isomers at the nitrobenzotrichloride stage and to convert them into the corresponding nitrobenzoyl chlorides which are not accessible from the benzotrifluorides. The invention also provides access to compounds previously obtainable only with difficulty, if at all, such as 3,4-dichloro-5-trifluoromethylaniline, 3,4-dichloro-2-trifluoromethylaniline and the corresponding nitro compounds. The invention converts benzotrichlorides of the formula (II) into products that include at least 19% of 4-trifluoromethylanilines (formula (I), N 2 para to CF 3 ).

The reaction mixture was then initially stirred at 30 to 40 C. for 1 hour, then discharged onto ice and extracted with 3100 ml of dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were washed with 100 ml of water, 3100 ml of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and 100 ml of aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulphate and evaporated, leaving a crude product (109 g, purity 100%, 93.4% of theory) which was 92.7% 2,3-dichloro-5-nitro- and 7.3% 2,3-dichloro-6-nitro-benzotrichloride. Example 6 A mixture of 62 g each of 96% by weight sulphuric acid and 100% by weight fuming nitric acid was admixed at 5 C. with a solution of 100 g of 2,3-dichlorobenzotrichloride in 120 ml of dichloromethane added dropwise over 20 minutes. The reaction mixture was initially stirred at 20 to 30 C. for 2 hours and then refluxed for 2 hours. Subsequently the mixture, which had become solid in the meantime, was placed on ice and extracted with 3100 ml of dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were washed with 100 ml of water, 3100 ml of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and 100 ml of aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulphate and evaporated. The crude product (99 g, purity 100%, 84.4% of theory) was recrystallized from ethanol to selectively obtain 80 g (68.1% of theory) of 2,3-dichloro-5-nitro-benzotrichloride (mp. 97 to 99 C.), the other isomers ending up in the residue. Example 7 62 g of fuming nitric acid were added dropwise to 100 g of 2,3-dichlorobenzotrichloride at 10 to 10 C. in the course of 10 minutes, followed by 62 g of 96% by weight sulphuric acid. The reaction mixture was initially stirred at 20 to 30 C. for 2 hours, then cooled down, discharged onto ice and extracted 3 with 100 ml of dichloromethane each time. The combined organic phases were washed with 100 ml of water, 3100 ml of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and 100 ml of aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulphate and evaporated.

Example 8 1138 g of the 3- and 4-nitro-benzotrichloride mixture obtained according to Example 1 were added dropwise to 850 ml of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid at an internal temperature of between 2 and 7 C. in the course of 15 minutes. This was followed by stirring for 17 hours at room temperature and for 8 hours at 150 C. and 25 bar pressure, cooling down to room temperature and distillative removal of excess hydrofluoric acid. The residue was distilled to obtain 695 g of a mixture of 3- and 4-nitrobenzotrifluoride (purity 100%, 76.8% of theory). This mixture was separated by final distillation to obtain 521.6 g of 3-nitrobenzotrifluoride and 110.5 g of 4-nitrobenzotrifluoride each in a purity of above 99%. The nitrobenzotrichloride mixtures obtained according to Examples 2 to 4 were fluorinated and separated by distillation in a similar manner and with similar yields. Example 9 406 g of a 3- and 4-nitrobenzotrifluoride mixture obtained according to Example 8 (prior to the final distillation) and 44 g of Raney nickel were initially charged in 4 l of methanol and subjected to a hydrogen pressure of 5 bar at 20 C. for 65 hours and then of 10 bar at 20 C. for 40 hours. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was filtered and the filtrate evaporated to obtain a product (330 g, purity 87.6%, 84.5% of theory) which was 78% 3- and 22% 4-aminobenzotrifluoride. Example 10 110 g of a 4-nitrobenzotrifluoride (purity above 99%) obtained according to Example 8 (after the final distillation) and 10 g of Raney nickel were initially charged in 1 l of methanol and subjected to a hydrogen pressure of 10 bar at 20 C. for 40 hours.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 2,2-Bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1-binaphthyl (BINAP) has become an important chiral ligand for catalytic asymmetric induction. Its wide application has been somewhat limited due to the scarce supply. The present invention relates to a simple and inexpensive process for the synthesis of BINAP derivatives in which the naphthyl groups are substituted, avoiding the necessity of multistep syntheses and minimizing the formation of secondary products. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A process of synthesizing a compound of formula 1 is disclosed wherein each R is independently selected from the group consisting of: C 1-4 alkyl, hydroxyl, C 1-4 alkoxyl, C 1-4 acyl, carboxyl, C 1-4 alkoxycarbonyl, OP and COOP wherein P is a protecting group, comprising reacting a compound of the formula 2: wherein R is selected from the group consisting of triflate, mesylate and tosylate, and R is as defined above, with diphenylphosphine in the presence of an amine base and a nickel catalyst to produce a compound of formula 1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As used herein, the following terms and definitions apply. The abbreviation Ph refers to phenyl. Diphenylphosphine is abbreviated Ph 2 PH. BINAP stands for the compound 2,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1-binaphthyl which has the structural formula 1: BINAP derivatives as used herein refers to BINAP with substituent groups attached to the naphthyl portions of the molecule. The substituent groups can be selected from the group consisting of: C 1-4 alkyl, hydroxyl, C 1-4 alkoxyl, C 1-4 acyl, carboxyl, C 1-4 alkoxycarbonyl, OP and COOP wherein P is a protecting group. Preferred BINAP derivatives include the following: Such preferred BINAP derivatives are included in pure form as well as mixtures of isomers. Alkyl refers to hydrocarbon radicals having 1-4 carbon atoms, which can be straight or branched for the C 3 and C 4 members of the group. C 1-4 acyl refers to the group: C 1-4 alkylC(O). Carboxyl refers to the group: COOH. C 1-4 alkoxycarbonyl refers to the group: C 1-4 alkyl-OC(O). In OP and in COOP, P represents a protecting group for hydroxyl and carboxyl. These protecting groups are readily removable, i.e., they can be removed, if desired, by procedures which will not cause cleavage or other disruption of the remaining portions of the molecule. Such procedures include chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis, treatment with chemical reducing or oxidizing agents under mild conditions, treatment with fluoride ion, treatment with a transition metal catalyst and a nucleophile, and catalytic hydrogenation. Examples of suitable hydroxyl protecting groups are: t-butylmethoxyphenylsilyl, t-butoxydiphenylsilyl, trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, o-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, t-butyloxycarbonyl, 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxycarbonyl and allyloxycarbonyl. Preferred hydroxyl protecting groups are trimethylsilyl and triethylsilyl. Examples of suitable carboxyl protecting groups are: benzhydryl, o-nitrobenzyl, p-nitrobenzyl, 2-naphthylmethyl, allyl, 2-chloroallyl, benzyl, 2,2,2-trichloroethyl, trimethylsilyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl, phenacyl, p-methoxybenzyl, acetonyl, p-methoxyphenyl, 4-pyridylmethyl and t-butyl. A preferred carboxyl protecting group is p-nitrobenzyl. Many other suitable hydroxyl and carboxyl protecting groups are known in the art. See, e.g., T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley Sons, Inc., (2nd ed. 1991) (Chapters 2 and 5). Triflate (OTf) refers to the leaving group trifluoromethane sulfonate. Mesylate (OMs) refers to the leaving group methanesulfonate. Tosylate (OTs) refers to the leaving group toluenesulfonate. The catalyst which is included herein is a nickel catalyst. Such catalysts are selected from the group consisting of: NiCl 2 .bis(diphenyl)phosphinyl C 1-4 alkanes, NiBr 2 , NiCl 2 , NiCl 2 -bis(diphenyl)phosphinyl ferrocene, abbreviated NiCl 2 /dppf; NiCl 2 -bis(triphenylphosphine), abbreviated NiCl 2 /(Ph 3 P) 2 ; Ni-tetrakis(triphenylphosphine), abbreviated Ni(Ph 3 P) 4 ; Ni-tetrakis(triphenylphosphite), abbreviated Ni(PhO) 3 4 and Ni-dicarbonyl bis(triphenyl)phosphine, abbreviated Ni(CO) 2 (Ph 3 P) 2 . The preferred catalysts for use herein are the NiCl 2 .bis(diphenyl)phosphinyl C 1-4 alkanes. In particular, the C 2-3 alkanes are preferred. Hence, the preferred catalysts are NiCl 2 .bis(diphenyl)phosphinylethane, which is abbreviated NiCl 2 dppe, and NiCl 2 .bis(diphenyl)phosphinylpropane, which is abbreviated NiCl 2 dppp. The most preferred catalyst for use in the process described herein is NiCl 2 dppe. In one embodiment of the invention, an R() isomer of the compound of formula 1 is provided. An R () isomer of a compound of formula 2: wherein R and R are as previously defined, is reacted with diphenylphosphine in the presence of an amine base and a nickel catalyst to produce the R () isomer of a compound of formula 1. In another embodiment of the invention, the S () isomer of a compound of the formula 2: wherein R and R are as previously defined, is reacted with diphenylphosphine in the presence of an amine base and a nickel catalyst to produce the S () isomer of a compound of formula 1. One more preferred process which is described herein directly converts the R () chiral ditriflate of 1,1-bi-2-naphthol to R () chiral BINAP 1. Likewise, another preferred process directly coverts the S() chiral ditriflate of 1,1-bi-2-naphthol to the (S)-chiral BINAP 1. Essentially no racemization occurs in these preferred embodiments. Diphenylphosphine is added in a suitable solvent at a temperature which is effective for allowing the formation of BINAP 1 in the presence of an amine-containing base and the nickel catalyst. Since diphenylphosphine is a good ligand for nickel, the amount of diphenylphosphine present in the reaction medium can significantly effect the reaction rate, slowing the reaction if the amount of diphenylphosphine is too great. When the diphenylphosphine is added stepwise during the reaction, the reaction can be completed in about 2 days. The coupling reaction slows down at later stages, possibly due to product and impurity poisoning. The reaction is typically completed in 34 days if all the diphenylphosphine is added at once. Suitable solvents include those which do not substantially oxidize the diphenylphosphine at the appropriate temperature, while maintaining the desired solubility. Polar solvents are preferred. Illustrative of these solvents are dimethylformamide (DMF), acetonitrile and N-methylpyrrolidinone. The most preferred solvent is DMF. The amine base and amount of base included in the reaction influence the reaction selectivity and reaction rate. Amine bases as used herein include the following: diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane (DABCO), triethylamine (Et 3 N), diisopropylethylamine, tri n-propylamine, and tri n-butylamine. The preferred amine bases are DABCO and Et 3 N. The most preferred base is DABCO. The reaction is typically run at a temperature which allows the reaction to proceed without producing undesirable quantities of side products. The temperature range is from about 80 to about 120 C., with about 100 C. being preferred. The temperature, time and base which are preferred are dependent upon the starting bis naphthol derivative which is used. When a bis naphthol ditriflate is used as the starting material, the reaction proceeds well using DMF as the solvent and DABCO as the base at a temperature of about 100 C. Generally, the isolated product is crystalline, which is contaminated in minor amounts with a mono-oxide of the formula: The exclusion of oxygen from the reaction tends to minimize the formation of this side product. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the known compound 6-methylnaphthol is reacted to form 6,6-bismethyl-1,1-binaphthol (). The racemic mixture of isomers can be resolved to produce the () and () isomers in substantially pure form. Resolution of bisnaphthol and binaphthyl derivatives above can be accomplished using N-benzyl cinchonidinium chloride in CH 3 CN or EtOAc. The 6,6-bismethyl-1,1-binaphthol (in substantially pure isomeric form or in racemic mixture) can then be reacted with triflic anhydride (Tf 2 O) to produce the bis triflate, which in turn is treated with diphenylphosphine in the presence of a nickel catalyst to produce the 6,6-BINAP derivative. This preferred process is shown in detail below in Flow Sheet A. BINAP derivatives have been useful in the preparation of antibiotics, in particular, carbapenems. In many carbapenem antibiotics, a side chain is present at position 2, which contains a hydroxyalkyl-pyrrolidine group. Such hydroxyl groups can be produced by reacting a carbonyl at the appropriate position with a compound of formula 1. This reaction is typically conducted in an alcoholic solvent, and in the presence of an acid. The invention is further described in connection with the following non-limiting examples. Preparative Example 1 6-Methyl-2-Naphthol React 6-bromo-2-naphthol with t-butyl dimethylsilyl chloride and imidazole, followed by adding n-BuLi and CH 3 I. Deprotect the hydroxyl group by reacting with n-Bu 4 F to produce the title compound. Preparative Example 2 6-Carbomethoxy-2-Naphthol A solution of (A) (22.3 g, 100 mmoL) and Pd(OAc) 2 , (1.12 g, 5 mmol) and dppp (2.00 g, 5 mmol) in degassed DMSO (500 mL), MeOH (150 mL) and diisopropylethylamine (77 mL) is reacted with carbon monoxide at 1.5 ATM/80 C. for 3 days. The reaction solution is diluted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (1.0 L) then washed with water (3500 mL). The aqueous layers are back extracted with EtOAc (0.5 L). The EtOAc layers are concentrated to a brown solid, and purified by recrystallization in hexane to yield the product.

"last_name": null, "city": "Tokyo", "state": null, "country": null}], "title": "Styrene derivatives", "abstract": "Styrene derivatives of formula (1) are novel wherein R 1 is H, F, C 1-20 alkyl or fluorinated C 1-20 alkyl, R 2 in cis or trans conformation is F, C 1-20 alkyl or fluorinated C 1-20 alkyl, R 3 is a phenol protecting group, p, q and r are integers in the range of 0p5, 0q5, 0r5, and 0pq5. Polymers obtained by polymerizing the styrene derivatives are useful as the base polymer of resist compositions. This invention relates to novel styrene derivatives which are useful monomers in preparing base polymers for use in chemically amplified resist compositions for microfabrication. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the drive for higher integration and operating speeds in LSI devices, the pattern rule is made drastically finer. The rapid advance toward finer pattern rules is grounded on the development of a projection lens with an increased NA, a resist material with improved performance, and exposure light of a shorter wavelength. In particular, the change-over from i-line (365 nm) to shorter wavelength KrF laser (248 nm) brought about a significant innovation, enabling mass-scale production of 0.18 micron rule devices. To the demand for a resist material with a higher resolution and sensitivity, acid-catalyzed chemical amplification positive working resist materials are effective as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,491,628 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,310,619 (JP-B 2-27660 and JP-A 63-27829). They now become predominant resist materials especially adapted for deep UV lithography. Resist materials adapted for KrF excimer lasers enjoyed early use on the 0.3 micron process, went through the 0.25 micron rule, and currently entered the mass production phase on the 0.18 micron rule. Engineers have started investigation on the 0.15 micron rule, with the trend toward a finer pattern rule being accelerated. A wavelength change-over from KrF to shorter wavelength ArF laser (193 nm) is expected to enable miniaturization of the design rule to 0.13 m or less. Since conventionally used novolac resins and polyvinylphenol resins have very strong absorption in proximity to 193 nm, they cannot be used as the base resin for resists. To ensure transparency and dry etching resistance, some engineers investigated acrylic and alicyclic (typically cycloolefin) resins as disclosed in JP-A 9-73173, JP-A 10-10739, JP-A 9-230595 and WO 97/33198. With respect to F 2 excimer laser (157 nm) which is expected to enable further miniaturization to 0.10 m or less, more difficulty arises in insuring transparency because it was found that acrylic resins are not transmissive to light at all and those cycloolefin resins having carbonyl bonds have strong absorption. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the invention is to provide a novel styrene derivative which is useful in the preparation of a base polymer for a chemical amplification resist composition having a high transmittance to vacuum ultraviolet radiation of up to 300 nm, especially F 2 excimer laser beam (157 nm), Kr 2 excimer laser beam (146 nm), KrAr excimer laser beam (134 nm) and Ar 2 excimer laser beam (126 nm). It has been found that a novel styrene derivative of the following general formula (1) can be obtained by the method to be described later, and that using a resin based on a fluorinated polyhydroxystyrene obtained from the novel styrene derivative, a resist composition having transparency and alkali solubility is formulated. As long as the inventor has confirmed, polyhydroxystyrene is somewhat improved in transmittance near 160 nm, but to an extent far below the practical level, and reducing carbonyl and carbon-to-carbon double bonds is essential for insuring a transmittance. However, phenols are good in etching resistance and alkali solubility, as compared with acrylic compounds. Further, halogen-substituted phenol polymers, and especially fluorine-substituted polymers obtained from the inventive styrene derivatives are improved in transmittance nearly to the practical level. The effect is obtained when the position of fluorine substitution is either on the benzene ring or on the backbone. What becomes a problem as a result of wavelength reduction is a lowering of transparency, and in the case of a positive resist material, a negative working phenomenon that the exposed areas become insoluble as the dose of exposure is increased. Those portions which have turned negative are insoluble not only in alkali developers, but also in organic solvents such as acetone. This indicates that gel forms as a result of crosslinking of molecules together. Radical generation is probably one of the causes of the negative working phenomenon. As a result of wavelength reduction, the exposure energy is increased so that even CC bonds and CH bonds may be excited in the case of F 2 exposure (157 nm). As a result of excitation, radicals are generated with a possibility that molecules are bonded together. Moreover, since oxygen absorption is considerable in the VUV region, exposure is effected under the conditions that oxygen is purged, with an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon, to an oxygen concentration of 1 ppm or lower. Since oxygen is an effective radical trapping agent, this means that the radicals generated have a long lifetime and more crosslinking takes place. Since the energy of CF bonds is greater than the energy of CC bonds and CH bonds, the CF bonds are unsusceptible to scission upon exposure. Therefore, fluorination of the backbone is effective to prevent crosslinking. The invention provides a styrene derivative of the following general formula (1).

Such polymerization may be effected in a conventional manner. The polymer thus obtained is used as a base polymer in formulating a resist composition. The resist composition is generally formulated by adding an organic solvent and a photoacid generator to the polymer. If necessary, a crosslinker, basic compound, dissolution inhibitor and the like are added. The resist composition may be prepared in a conventional way. The resist composition prepared using a polymer obtained by polymerizing the inventive styrene derivative is sensitive to high-energy radiation, has excellent sensitivity and resolution at a wavelength of up to 200 nm, especially up to 170 nm, and excellent plasma etching resistance. The styrene derivative of the invention is an advantageous raw material for a base polymer for formulating a resist composition having a low absorption at the exposure wavelength of a F 2 excimer laser. The resulting resist composition is ideal as a micropatterning material in VLSI fabrication since a finely defined pattern having sidewalls perpendicular to the substrate can easily be formed.

This application is a Continuation application Ser. No. 09/177,573 filed Oct. 23, 1998 now abandoned. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for purifying a specific bromine compound. More specifically, it relates to a method for purifying a specific bromine compound, which is capable of obtaining a bromine compound having high purity and excellent heat stability. PRIOR ART Generally speaking, a bromine compound typified by an ether derivative of tetrabromobisphenol A is widely used due to its excellent performance as a flame retardant for polyolefin-based resins and styrene-based resins. Since the heat stability of the by-product is adversely affected when the bromine compound contains a certain type of a by-product produced during its production process, various means for purifying the bromine compound have been proposed heretofore. For instance, JP-A 49-125348 (the term JP-A as used herein means an unexamined published Japanese patent application) discloses a method comprising dissolving 2,2-bis3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-dibromopropyloxy)phenylpropane (may be abbreviated as TBA-BE hereinafter) in a ketone-based solvent and cooling the mixture to deposit a bromine compound. JP-A 55-111429 discloses a method of adding an aromatic hydrocarbon halide solution of TBA-BE to a mixture of methanol and seed crystals. JP-A 4-234337 discloses a method comprising adding a poor solvent having a higher boiling point than a good solvent dropwise to a solution of TBA-BE dissolved in a good solvent and recovering the TBA-BE as fine powders while the good solvent is distilled out after the completion of the addition, and JP-A 7-316087 discloses a method comprising adding a solution of TBA-BE dissolved in a good solvent dropwise to a heated poor solvent having a higher boiling point than the good solvent while the solution was stirred and dispersing TBA-BE crystals into the poor solvent to recover them while the good solvent is distilled out. JP-A 8-113547 discloses a method of adding a solution of TBA-BE dissolved in a good solvent to heated methanol in the presence of seed crystals while the good solvent was distilled out and crystallized to recover solids having large particle diameters. JP-A 7-291884 discloses a method comprising adding water to an organic solvent solution of TBA-BE in the presence of a surfactant to form an emulsion and removing the organic solvent to recover TBA-BE powders. JP-A 2-286645 discloses a method of adding unpurified TBA-BE to molten TBA-BE. Further, JP-B 57-289 (the term JP-B as used herein means an examined Japanese patent publication) discloses a method comprising adding a poor solvent to a good solvent solution of TBA-BE and stirring the resulting solution with shearing force. However, these methods require complicated operation or a large-scale apparatus, or the purity and heat stability of the obtained solid are not always satisfactory. Therefore, there has been desired a method for obtaining a bromine compound having higher purity and excellent heat stability with a simple apparatus. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The inventors of the present invention have conducted intensive studies to provide a purification method for obtaining a bromine compound having higher purity and excellent heat stability and have found that, in a method for purifying a bromine compound from a crude solution of a bromine compound, a bromine compound having high purity and excellent heat stability can be obtained by crystallizing the bromine compound while crystals contained in a slurry comprising a good solvent, a poor solvent and the crystals of the bromine compound are contained in a specific proportion and the solubility of the bromine compound in the solvents contained in the slurry falls within a certain predetermined range. The present invention has been accomplished by this finding. That is, according to the present invention, there is provided a method for purifying a bromine compound by depositing the bromine compound represented by the following general formula (1) as solid particles from a crude solution containing the bromine compound: wherein Ar 1 and Ar 2 are the same or different and each an aromatic hydrocarbon group having 6 to 10 carbon atoms; Y is an alkylene group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, single bond, sulfone group or ketone group; R 1 and R 2 are the same or different and each a hydrocarbon group having 2 to 5 carbon atoms; m and n are the same or different and each an integer of 1 to 4; and p and q are the same or different and each an integer of 2 or 4, wherein (i) the crude solution is supplied into the slurry containing the particles of the bromine compound to deposit the bromine compound in the slurry under agitation; (ii) the concentration of the particles of the bromine compound in the slurry is maintained at 10 to 50 wt %; (iii) the solvent contained in the slurry is a mixed solvent of a good solvent and a poor solvent for a bromine compound and the solubility of the bromine compound in the mixed solvent is maintained at 0.1 to 5 g/100 g of solvent; and (iv) the slurry is extracted to separate the solid particles of the bromine compound from the slurry. According to the purification method of the present invention, when the obtained bromine compound is mixed with a flame retardant for resins, there will be obtained a high-purity bromine compound that neither reduces the heat stability of a resin nor causes the coloration of the resin. According to the purification method of the present invention, particularly when the bromine compound is mixed with a resin, impurities causing an adverse effect are separated into a mixed solvent, thereby making it possible to obtain a bromine compound of interest as a high-purity solid at a high yield. Further, the purification method of the present invention facilitates a continuous operation and can be carried out with a simple apparatus under mild conditions. Therefore, it is industrially advantageous. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIG. 1 shows an example of an apparatus for purifying a bromine compound in the present invention.

Of these, 2,2-bis3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-dibromopropyloxy)phenylpropane is preferred. The purification method of the present invention comprises depositing a high-purity solid bromine compound from the crude solution containing the bromine compound represented by the above general formula (1). The crude solution contains a bromine compound formed by an addition reaction of bromine (Br 2 ). This addition reaction is a reaction for brominating the unsaturated bromine compound represented by the following general formula (2), and the purification method of the present invention is advantageously used for the solution obtained by this reaction. wherein Ar 1 , Ar 2 , Y, m and n are the same as defined in the above general formula (1), and Q 1 and Q 2 are the same or different and each a hydrocarbon group having 1 or 2 unsaturated groups and 2 to 5 carbon atoms. In the above general formula (2), Ar 1 , Ar 2 , Y, m and n are preferably the same as defined in the above general formula (1). Illustrative examples of the hydrocarbon group represented by Q 1 and Q 2 include vinyl group, allyl group and isobutenyl group. Of these, allyl group is preferred. Illustrative examples of the unsaturated bromine compound represented by the above general formula (2) include 2,2-bis(3,5-dibromo-4-allyloxy)phenylpropane, 2,2-bis(3,5-dibromo-4-isobutenyloxy)phenylpropane, bis(3,5-dibromo-4-allyloxy)phenylmethane, bis(3,5-dibromo-4-isobutenyloxy)phenylmethane, (3,3,5,5-tetrabromo-4,4-diallyloxy)biphenyl, (3,3,5,5-tetrabromo-4,4-divinyloxy)biphenyl, bis(3,5-dibromo-4-allyloxy)phenylsulfone, bis(3,5-dibromo-4-isobutenyloxy)phenylsulfone and the like.

The reaction between the unsaturated bromine compound and bromine is carried out in the presence of a solvent, and the solvent does not have an adverse effect on the reaction and is inactive. The higher the solubility of the solvent for the unsaturated bromine compound the more preferable, but the solvent may be a solvent only part of which is dissolved. The bromine compound produced by the bromination reaction of the unsaturated bromine compound is preferably one that is substantially dissolved in the solvent. The solvent in the above bromination reaction acts not only as a solvent for carrying out a reaction uniformly but also as a solvent for removing reaction heat from a reaction system effectively. Therefore, a solvent having a boiling point of 0 to 100 C., preferably 20 to 90 C., at normal pressure is advantageous. Particularly when reaction heat is removed substantially by the vaporization heat of a solvent, it is desired that the solvent have a boiling point of 20 to 80 C., preferably 20 to 60 C., at normal pressure. Illustrative examples of the solvent include hydrocarbon halides such as methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, bromoethane, butylchloride and chloropropane; ether-based hydrocarbon compounds such as diethyl ether, ethyl isopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane; aromatic hydrocarbon compounds such as toluene; and the like. Bromine can be used as the solvent. Of these solvents, hydrocarbon halides are preferred, and methylene chloride and chloroform are particularly preferred. These solvents may be used alone or in admixture of two or more. These hydrocarbon halides may be used as a mixed solvent with dioxane. As for the amount of bromine used in the above bromination, the molar ratio of bromine to the unsaturated bromine compound must be sufficient to obtain a desired bromine compound. That is, the number of molecules of bromine per unsaturated group of the unsaturated bromine compound is preferably 1 to 5, more preferably 1.1 to 3. In the above bromination, bromine itself or a bromine solution is used. A solvent to be used in the bromine solution is the same as the above solvent. In this case, the concentration of bromine is preferably 10 to 90 wt %. In the above bromination, the unsaturated bromine compound is reacted with bromine by mixing bromine or a bromine solution with a solution of the unsaturated bromine compound dissolved in a solvent which is inactive with bromine. It is preferred to remove the substantial amount of reaction heat of bromination by the vaporization heat of the solvent or bromine during this bromination reaction. The substantial amount of the reaction heat means 80% or more, preferably 85% or more, of the theoretical amount of heat generated by a desired bromination reaction. The reaction temperature of the bromination reaction is preferably a temperature at which the substantial amount of the reaction heat of bromination is removed by the vaporization heat of bromine or the solvent as described above. The bromination reaction can be carried out not only at normal pressure but also at an increased pressure or a reduced pressure. The reaction temperature can be controlled by operation pressure corresponding to the type (or boiling point) of the used solvent and the amount of bromine. The reaction temperature is generally 0 to 60 C., preferably 5 to 55 C., particularly preferably 10 to 50 C. The purification method of the present invention is advantageously used to separate a purified bromine compound from the reaction mixture obtained by the above bromination reaction. Since this reaction mixture is obtained as a crude solution containing a bromine compound, the purification treatment of the present invention can be directly applied to this solution. However, since unreacted bromine (Br 2 ) still remains in the above reaction mixture and adversely affects the purification step or recovery step, it is desired to convert it into another compound by subjecting it to a chemical treatment. This chemical treatment comprises treating the bromine remaining in the reaction mixture with a reducing agent to convert it into hydrobromic acid and neutralizing the hydrobromic acid with an alkaline neutralizing agent. This method is carried out by adding a reducing agent and a neutralizing agent to the above reaction mixture. The reducing agent used in this treatment method is a reducing agent which is used in an ordinary reduction reaction, as exemplified by sodium hydrogen sulfite, sodium dithionite, sodium sulfite, oxalic acid, hydrogen sulfide, sodium nitrite, potassium nitrite, hydroxyamine sulfate, tin, stannous oxide, hydrazine and the like. Of these, sodium hydrogen sulfite, sodium dithionite, sodium sulfite, oxalic acid and sodium nitrite are preferred. These reducing agents may be used as an aqueous solution. These reducing agents may be used alone or in admixture of two or more. Illustrative examples of the alkaline neutralizing agent include alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal carbonates, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal carbonates and the like. Specifically, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate are preferred, and sodium hydroxide is particularly preferred. These alkaline neutralizing agents are preferably used as an aqueous solution. These alkaline neutralizing agents may be used alone or in admixture of two or more. In the above treatment method, the reducing agent is added to the reaction mixture in an amount of 2 moles or more, preferably 2 to 30 moles, more preferably 2.2 to 15 moles, much more preferably 2.5 to 10 moles, based on 1 mol of the residual bromine contained in the reaction mixture. When the amount of the reducing agent to be added is smaller than 2 moles, bromine remains in the mixture with the result that a low-purity bromine compound which is colored brown is obtained disadvantageously. The alkaline neutralizing agent is added to the reaction mixture in an amount of 2 moles or more, preferably 2 to 50 moles, more preferably 2.2 to 30 moles, much more preferably 2.5 to 20 moles, based on 1 mol of the residual bromine contained in the reaction mixture. When the amount of the neutralizing agent to be added is smaller than 2 moles, hydrogen bromide remains in the aqueous solution. This strong acid aqueous solution cannot be discarded directly. Further, part of the hydrogen bromide remains in the mixture, and this readily corrodes a metal and has an irritating smell, which is not preferred from the viewpoint of working environment. The above reducing agent and the above alkaline neutralizing agent are added to the reaction mixture containing a bromine compound and bromine simultaneously or separately. Although the reducing agent and the neutralizing agent may be added separately or as a mixture, they are preferably added separately because the reducing agent can never cause a secondary reaction because of alkali. As for how to add these agent, it is preferred to add the reducing agent first, followed by the neutralizing agent. In the treatment method, the reaction mixture containing the reducing agent and the neutralizing agent is mixed to carry out reduction and neutralization reactions smoothly. The weight ratio of the reaction mixture to a water phase at the time of carrying out the reduction and neutralization reactions is preferably 20:80 to 80:20, more preferably 30:70 to 70:30, particularly preferably 40:60 to 60:40. Within this range, the reduction and neutralization reactions proceed efficiently and bromine is removed in a short period of time. Therefore, water or the solvent is preferably added to the reaction mixture in such an amount that ensures that the weight ratio should fall within the above range before the reduction and neutralization reactions are carried out. The amount of time required to carry out the reduction and neutralization reactions of bromine contained in the reaction mixture is preferably 2 minutes or more, more preferably 2 to 90 minutes, much more preferably 5 to 60 minutes, particularly preferably 10 to 45 minutes. The reaction mixture (organic phase) is separated from the water phase by carrying out the above reduction and neutralization treatments, and this organic phase can be used as a crude solution to be purified by the purification method of the present invention. The crude solution to be purified by the purification method of the present invention preferably contains a bromine compound (1) in an amount of 10 to 80 wt %, preferably 20 to 65 wt %, particularly preferably 25 to 55 wt %. A solvent forming the crude solution of the bromine compound (1) is a good solvent for the bromine compound (1). The good solvent has a solubility for the bromine compound (1) of {fraction (1/100)} g or more of the solvent, preferably {fraction (2/100)} g or more of the solvent, at 250 C. Preferred examples of the good solvent include methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, cyclohexanone, ethyl acetate and toluene. They may be used alone or in admixture of two or more. Of these, hydrocarbon halides such as methylene chloride and chloroform are preferred, and methylene chloride is preferred the most. As described above, the crude solution of the bromine compound (1) can be a solution produced by the above bromination or a reaction mixture derived from the solution. In this case, the solution of a reaction solvent used for the bromination can be used directly or after subjected to a supplementary chemical treatment. In the purification method of the present invention, it is important to supply the crude solution containing the bromine compound (1) as described above into a slurry containing particles of the bromine compound (1) that satisfies the following requirements (a) and (b) and deposit a bromine compound contained in the crude solution. The solvent contained in the slurry is a mixed solvent of a good solvent and a poor solvent for a bromine compound as described in (b). (a) The slurry should contain the particles of the bromine compound in an amount of 10 to 50 wt %, preferably 15 to 40 wt %. (b) The solvent contained in the slurry should be a mixed solvent of a good solvent and a poor solvent for a bromine compound and should have a solubility for the bromine compound of 0.1 to 5 g/100 g of solvent, preferably 0.5 to 4 g/100 g of solvent. The purification method of the present invention is to supply the crude solution containing the bromine compound into a deposition vessel while the above requirements (a) and (b) are satisfied. It is considered that the particles of the bromine compound forming the slurry serve as seed crystals for the bromine compound to be separated out from the solution while the composition of the mixed solvent promotes the deposition of the bromine compound, suppresses the deposition of impurities and keeps them dissolved in the solution. To carry out the method of the present invention, the crude solution is supplied into the deposition vessel, and a poor solvent and the particles of the bromine compound (seed crystals) or a mixture solution thereof is further supplied to the vessel while the requirements (a) and (b) are satisfied. At this point, a good solvent or a mixed solvent of a good solvent and a poor solvent can be supplied as required. The poor solvent for a bromine compound has a solubility for the bromine compound (1) of 0.08/100 g or less of solvent, preferably 0.05/100 g or less of solvent, particularly preferably 0.01/100 g or less of solvent. The term solubility means a value measured at a temperature of 25 C. The solubilities of the good solvent and the mixed solvent also mean values measured at 25 C. Specific examples of the poor solvent include water; saturated monovalent alcohols having 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol and i-propanol; ethylene glycol; glycerin; diethyl ether; dipropyl ether; diisopropyl ether; saturated hydrocarbons having 5 to 10 carbon atoms such as n-pentane, n-hexane and n-octane; and the like. Water, methanol, ethanol, i-propanol and diisopropyl ether are preferred; water, methanol, ethanol and i-propanol are more preferred; and methanol is particularly preferred. These poor solvents may be used alone or in admixture of two or more. The operation of depositing a bromine compound in the purification method of the present invention requires neither cooling nor heating, but it is advantageously carried out generally at a temperature of 5 to 50 C., preferably 10 to 45 C. The particles of the bromine compound as a slurry have an average particle diameter of 0.1 to 0.8 mm, preferably 0.2 to 0.7 mm. Although the purification method of the present invention may be carried out by either a batch or continuous process, it is made suitable for use with a continuous process. Therefore, the continuous process is industrially advantageous. The batch process and the continuous process will be explained in detail hereinafter. To simplify explanation, the following terms are defined as follows. crude solution: a crude solution containing a bromine compound seed crystals: particles of the bromine compound good solvent: a good solvent for the bromine compound poor solvent: a poor solvent for the bromine compound mixed solvent: a mixed solvent of the good solvent and the poor solvent vessel: a vessel equipped with a stirrer for depositing the bromine compound A description is first given of the operation of purification in accordance with the batch process. The batch process can be further classified into the following subprocesses (1) to (4). (1) a subprocess for supplying only the crude solution or both the crude solution and the poor solvent into a vessel filled with a slurry containing the seed crystals and the mixed solvent (2) a subprocess for supplying (i) the crude solution and (ii) the slurry containing the seed crystals and the mixed solvent into the vessel (3) a subprocess for supplying (i) the crude solution, (ii) the slurry containing the seed crystals and the mixed solvent and (iii) the poor solvent into the vessel (4) a subprocess for supplying (i) the crude solution, (ii) the slurry containing the seed crystals and the poor solvent and (iii) the poor solvent into the vessel These steps (1) to (4) are for explaining the batch process, and slight modifications are free to be made. For example, in the subprocess (1), a good solvent may be further supplied into the vessel, or the slurry containing the seed crystals and the mixed solvent may be supplied into the vessel. In the subprocesses (1) to (4), the composition and supply speed of each flow may not be fixed and may be changed. Further, in the batch process, there may be used a subprocess in which part of the slurry in the vessel may be extracted and recycled to the vessel. In the subprocesses (1) to (4), it is desirable that the slurry in the vessel be fully mixed by agitation or the like in order to improve a deposition effect and obtain a high-purity bromine compound. A description is subsequently given of the continuous process. The continuous process comprises depositing a bromine compound in the vessel to extract the slurry from the vessel continuously or intermittently while the crude solution is continuously supplied into the vessel. According to the present invention, the following method is proposed to carry out the method of the present invention continuously. That is, according to the present invention, there is provided a method for continuously purifying a bromine compound by depositing the bromine compound represented by the above general formula (1) as solid particles from a crude solution containing the bromine compound, wherein (i) the crude solution and a poor solvent for the bromine compound are continuously supplied into a vessel containing the slurry that contains the particles of the bromine compound to deposit the bromine compound in the slurry under agitation; (ii) the concentration of the particles of the bromine compound in the slurry contained in the vessel is maintained at 10 to 50 wt %; (iii) the solvent in the slurry contained in the vessel is a mixed solvent of a good solvent and a poor solvent for the bromine compound and the solubility of the bromine compound in the mixed solvent is maintained at 0.1 to 5 g/100 g of solvent; and (iv) the slurry is continuously extracted from the vessel and the solid particles of the bromine compound are separated from the slurry. To carry out the above continuous method, the following modifications may be made. (a) The good solvent may be supplied into the vessel as a supplement. (b) Part of the slurry extracted from the vessel may be recycled to the vessel. (c) The slurry extracted from the vessel may be separated into the wet cake of the bromine compound and a mother liquor by solid-liquid separation, and part of the mother liquor may be supplied into the vessel. The recycling of the mother liquor is preferred because it improves the recovery of the bromine compound of interest. The above modifications may be made independently or in combination as desired. The particles of a high-purity bromine compound of interest can be obtained by separating the slurry containing the particles of the bromine compound obtained by the above batch process or the continuous process into a wet cake and a mother liquor by centrifugation or filtration and drying the wet cake. The dried wet cake may further be ground in some cases. The particles of the bromine compound obtained in the present invention preferably have a weight-based average particle diameter of 0.1 to 0.9 mm, more preferably 0.1 to 0.8 mm, the most preferably 0.2 to 0.7 mm. When the average particle diameter is smaller than 0.1 mm, handling properties deteriorate and a working environment is worsen due to the scattering of dust, disadvantageously. On the other hand, when the average particle diameter is larger than 0.9 mm, the dispersibility of the bromine compound used as a flame retardant into a resin degrades, disadvantageously. According to the purification method of the present invention, a high-purity bromine compound can be obtained industrially advantageously. This bromine compound is useful as a flame retardant for resins, particularly as a high-quality flame retardant for ABS resins, polystyrene resins and polyolefin resins. It has been found that a high-purity bromine compound having extremely high quality can be obtained according to conditions favorable to the method of the present invention. That is, since the bromine compound is obtained by a bromination reaction, it contains not a few bromine ions. The concentration of bromine ions in commercially available bromine compounds is about 10 ppm or more at minimum and 20 ppm or more in most cases. When a bromine compound having a high concentration of bromine ions is added to a resin as a flame retardant, it causes the decomposition, modification and coloration of the resin and further the corrosion of a molding machine. However, under the favorable conditions of the present invention, it is possible to provide a high-quality bromine compound having a bromine ion concentration of 5 ppm or less, preferably 4 ppm or less. It has also been found that the particles of the bromine compound obtained by the purification method of the present invention have a shape characteristic different from that of the prior art. This shape characteristic is that the particles show extremely small compressibility when compressed. When the shape characteristic of the particles is expressed by the compressibility (%) represented by the following equation, the particles of the bromine compound of the present invention have a compressibility of 0.1 to 20% preferably 1 to 15%. compressibility (%)(PA)/P100 wherein A is a loose apparent density (g/cm 3 ) of the particles and P is an hard apparent density (g/cm 3 ) of the particles. Since the bromine compound obtained by the present invention has a high purity and a low compressibility of 0.1 to 20%, it has such advantages that the deformation and powdering of its particles by storage, transfer and blending operations hardly occur and that it is easy to handle. The bromine compound obtained by the purification method of the present invention generally has a purity of 94 wt % or more, preferably 95 wt % or more, particularly preferably 96 wt % or more. Thus, the bromine compound has an extremely high purity and extremely small contents of unfavorable impurities. Further, the particles of the bromine compound obtained by the present invention have an inclination angle, measured by a method which will be described hereinafter, of 5 to 70, preferably 5 to 45. This small inclination angle means that the blocking of the particles hardly occurs and that the particles are very easy to handle. EXAMPLES The following examples are given to further illustrate the present invention. Purity, average particle diameter, solubility, the proportion of crystals contained in the slurry, and specific gravity were measured in accordance with the following methods. (1) Analysis of Purity The purity was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC: SCL-6B of Shimadzu Corporation) in accordance with a method for detecting the absorption of 280 nm. (2) Average Particle Diameter A sample was screened using 200-mesh, 100-mesh, 60-mesh, 20-mesh, 16-mesh, 10-mesh, 5-mesh and 3.5-mesh screens to form a cumulative particle size distribution graph based on weight so as to obtain an average particle diameter. As for particles having an average particle diameter of 0.1 mm or less, since they cannot be screened by any of the above screens, an average particle diameter was obtained from a cumulative particle size distribution graph based on the weight obtained by using the Coalter LS230 particle size distribution measuring instrument. (3) Solubility An excess of sample powders was dissolved in a predetermined solvent at a predetermined temperature and saturated completely at that temperature. Thereafter, a predetermined amount of this solution was measured accurately, the solvent was completely removed from the solution, and the weight of the residue was measured to calculate the solubility of the sample in the solvent. (4) Proportion of Crystals in Slurry A predetermined amount of slurry was filtered to obtain crystals, which were then dried at 80 C. and 5 mmHg for 3 hours. The weight of the crystals was measured to calculate the weight ratio of the crystals to the slurry. (5) Specific Gravity This was measured at 20 C. using a glass pycnometer. (6) Compressibility A TBA-BE particulate sample was slowly added from above to a stainless cylindrical vessel having a diameter of 50 mm and a volume of 100 cm 3 and was leveled with the brim. The weight X (g) of the TBA-BE particulate sample in the vessel was measured to obtain loose apparent density A (g/cm 3 ) X (g)/100 (cm 3 ). Thereafter, an accessory frame (a diameter of 50 mm and a height of 40 mm) having the same diameter as that of the vessel was attached to the vessel, and the TBA-BE particulate sample was further added thereto. After tapping was carried out 180 times at intervals of 1 second using the powder tester of Hosokawa Micron Co., Ltd. at a drop height of 18 mm, the frame was removed and the TBA-BE particulate sample was leveled with the brim of the cylindrical vessel. At this point, the weight Y (g) of the TBA-BE particulate sample in the cylindrical vessel was measured to obtain hard apparent density P (g/cm 3 ) Y (g)/100 (cm 3 ). Compressibility was calculated from the following equation (1). compressibility (%)100 (PA)/P(1) (7) Long-term Storage Stability Test 10 Grams of a TBA-BE particulate sample was charged into a cylindrical cell having an inner diameter of 20 mm and stored in a hot-air circulating drier kept at 40 C. for 3 months with a load of 0.4 kgf applied to the particulate layer from the top of the cell. After three months, the degree of blocking of the particulate sample taken out of the cell was observed. Long-term storage stability was evaluated as when the particulate sample did not change so much in appearance before and after the test, when the particulate sample became solid but easily returned to its original state by touching it with a hand, and X when the particulate layer became hard and was not broken by touching it with a hand. (8) Concentration of Bromine Ions 1 Gram of a sample was dissolved in 10 ml of methylene chloride, and 10 ml of water was added to this solution and mixed thoroughly. The concentration of bromine ions extracted into water was measured by ion chromatography (Series 2000i/SP of DIONEX Co., Ltd.) to calculate the concentration of the bromine ions in the sample. Referential Example A 2,2-bis3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-dibromopropyloxy)phenylpropane having a purity of 93% was recrystallized using ethyl acetate, whereby crystals of 2,2-bis3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-dibromopropyloxy)phenylpropane having a purity of 94% and an average particle diameter of 0.2 mm were obtained (to be referred to as seed crystals A hereinafter). Thereafter, recrystallization was carried out two more time in the same manner as described above to give crystals of 2,2-bis3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-dibromopropyloxy)phenylpropane having a purity of 99% and an average particle diameter of 0.2 mm (to be referred to as seed crystals B hereinafter). Referential Example B 100 Grams (0.160 mole) of commercially available TBA-AE (FG-3200 of Teijin Kasei Co., Ltd.) and 150 g of methylene chloride were charged into a flask equipped with a thermometer, stirrer and reflux cooling tube, and the mixture was molten at 20 C. After 54 g (0.338 mole) of bromine was added dropwise to this solution over 1 hour, the resulting solution was stirred for 1 hour at the same temperature to complete the addition reaction of bromine. Thereafter, the excessive bromine contained in the solution was reduced with 30 ml of a 25 wt % aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen sulfite to produce hydrogen bromide, which was then neutralized with 11 ml of a 24 wt % aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and washed with 150 ml of purified water to give a 50 wt % methylene chloride solution of TBA-BE. A methylene chloride solution was added to this solution to prepare a 33 wt % methylene chloride solution. When part of this solution was extracted and concentrated, the purity of its solid content was 90%.

This solution had a specific gravity of 1.46, and contained 160 ppm of water when measured by a Karl Fischers method. This solution was added to a glass reactor equipped with a stirrer, capacitor and thermometer from its input port at a rate of 5.310 3 l/min and bromine from the input port at a rate of 0.5810 3 l/min continuously (molar ratio of bromine to the raw material (1) was 2.45). The solution mixed in the reactor generated heat due to the reaction heat of bromination, and vapor generated was refluxed to the reactor by the fully cooled capacitor. About 20 minutes from the beginning of adding the solution of the raw material (1) and bromine, a reaction solution began to be output from an output port and continued to be output thereafter (residence time of 20.4 minutes). Part of the reaction solution in the reactor (120 ml) had been recycled to the reactor at a rate of 0.03 l/min using a pump since it began to be output. The excessive bromine contained in the reaction solution output from the reactor was reduced with an aqueous solution of soda disulfide (about 15 wt %) to produce hydrogen bromine, which was then neutralized with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. Thereafter, 1,000 g of ion exchange water was added to this solution, and the resulting solution was stirred to separate a methylene chloride layer.

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an electrophotographic photoconductor comprising a photoconductive layer which contains a bisazo compound. The present invention also relates to above-mentioned bisazo compound which is useful as an organic photoconductive material in the photoconductor and a method of preparing the bisazo compound, and in addition, relates to raw materials for the above-mentioned bisazo compound and the respective preparation methods of those raw materials. 2. Discussion of Background Conventionally, the photoconductive material for use in the electrophotographic process is roughly divided into two groups, that is, an inorganic photoconductive material and an organic photoconductive material. The above-mentioned electrophotographic process is one of the image forming processes, through which the surface of the photoconductor is charged uniformly in the dark to a predetermined polarity, for instance, by corona charge. The uniformly charged photoconductor is exposed to a light image to selectively dissipate the electric charge of the exposed area, so that a latent electrostatic image is formed on the photoconductor. The thus formed latent electrostatic image is developed into a visible image by use of a toner comprising a coloring agent such as a dye or pigment, and a polymeric material. Such an electrophotographic process is called Carlson process. The photoconductor employing the organic photoconductive material is advantageous over that employing the inorganic photoconductive material in terms of the degree of freedom in the wave range of the light to be employed, and the film-forming properties, flexibility, transparency, productivity, toxicity, and manufacturing cost of the photoconductor. In light of the above-mentioned advantages, most of the current photoconductors employ the organic photoconductive material. Such a photoconductor is repeatedly operated in the copying apparatus employing the above-mentioned electrophotographic process or the like, so that the photoconductor is required to have excellent electrostatic properties, with respect to the photosensitivity, acceptance potential, retentivity of charge, potential stability, residual potential, and spectral sensitivity. In recent years, the development of data processing apparatus employing the above-mentioned electrophotographic photoconductor is remarkable. In particular, there is a remarkable improvement in the printing quality and the reliability of the digital printer which is capable of converting data into digital signals and recording the data using a light. Such a digital recording system is applied not only to the printer, but also to the copying machine. Thus, the digital copying machine is actively developed. It is supposed that the demand for the digital copying machine will further increase in line with the addition of various data processing functions. The photoconductor designed for the above-mentioned digital recording system is required to have special characteristics different from those required for the conventional analogue recording system. For instance, a semiconductor laser beam (LD) or a light emitting diode (LED) is widely employed as a light source for the digital recording system because of its compactness, cheapness and high reliability. The wave range of the currently used LD is within the near infrared region, and the wavelength of the currently used LED is 650 nm or more. Therefore, the electrophotographic photoconductors for use with the above-mentioned digital recording system are required to show sufficient sensitivity in the wavelength range from the visible region to the near infrared region. A specific azo compound is conventionally known as a useful organic photoconductive material, in particular, a charge generation material, in the layered photoconductor. In the above-mentioned layered photoconductor, a charge generation layer and a charge transport layer are successively overlaid on an electroconductive support. The charge generation layer comprises a charge generation material capable of generating a charge carrier when exposed to light, and the charge transport layer comprises a charge transport material serving to efficiently inject the charge carrier generated in the charge generation layer into the charge transport layer and transport the charge carrier. A variety of azo compounds for use in the photoconductor are conventionally proposed, for example, benzidine bisazo compounds in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Applications 47-37543 and 52-55643, stilbene bisazo compounds in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 52-8832, diphenyl hexatriene bisazo compounds in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 58-222152, and diphenyl butadiene bisazo compounds in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 58-222153. However, the sensitivity of the electrophotographic photoconductor is slightly decreased when the above-mentioned conventional azo compounds are employed. Therefore, such a photoconductor is not suitable for the high-speed copying machine. Further, the sensitivity of the photoconductor is extremely low in the wavelength range of the LD, so that the photoconductor employing the conventional azo compound cannot be put to practical use in the field of digital recording system. There is an increasing demand for the preparation of an azo compound for use in the electrophotographic photoconductor, that is useful as an organic photoconductive material free of the above-mentioned conventional shortcomings. There is reported 1,4-bis4-(3-nitrophenyl)-1,3-butadienylbenzene in J. Org. Chem. vol. 24, 1969 (1959) by R. N. McDonald and T. W. Campbell. A bisazo compound can be prepared from the above-mentioned 1,4-bis4-(3-nitrophenyl)-1,3-butadienylbenzene. However, the bisazo compound thus obtained does not show any absorption in the wavelength range of the semiconductor laser. This is because each azo group is bonded to phenyl group at the m-position in the large-size conjugated system of 1,4-bis4-phenyl-1,3-butadienylbenzene, so that m-phenylene bonds insulate the conjugation in the molecule. This mechanism is detailed in Nippon Kagaku Kaishi 1986, (3), P.379-386. Therefore, such a bisazo compound is not useful as the organic photoconductive material for use in the photoconductor that is required to show high sensitivity with respect to the wavelength of the currently used semiconductor laser beam. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, a first object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic photoconductor capable of showing flat and high sensitivity over a wide wavelength range from the visible light range to the near infrared range so as to cope with a digital copying machine and a digital printer. A second object of the present invention is to provide a bisazo compound useful as an organic photoconductive material in the electrophotographic photoconductor which has high sensitivity and can be put to practical use in the laser printer as well as the high-speed copying machine. A third object of the present invention is to provide a method of preparing the above-mentioned bisazo compound. A fourth object of the present invention is to provide raw materials for the preparation of the above-mentioned bisazo compound. A fifth object of the present invention is to provide a method of preparing each of the above-mentioned raw materials. The first object of the present invention can be achieved by an electrophotographic photoconductor comprising an electroconductive support, and a photoconductive layer formed thereon which comprises as the effective component at least one bisazo compound of formula (I): wherein Cp 1 and Cp 2 are each a coupler radical which may be the same or different.

The bisazo compound of formula (I) can be obtained by the reaction between a bis(diazonium salt) compound of the following formula (III) and couplers represented by (Cp 1 -H) and (Cp 2 -H). wherein X is an anionic functional group. Examples of the anionic functional group represented by X in formula (III) are Cl , Br , I , BF 4 , PF 6 , B(C 6 H 5 ) 4 , ClO 4 , SO 4 2 , AsF 6 , and SbF 6 . In particular, BF 4 is preferable as the anionic functional group. To synthesize a bisazo compound of formula (I) having different coupler radicals of Cp 1 and Cp 2 , one mole of the previously mentioned bis(diazonium salt) of formula (III) and one mole of one coupler are subjected to coupling reaction, and thereafter, the coupling reaction of one mole of the bis(diazonium salt) compound with one mole of the other coupler is carried out. Alternatively, a corresponding diamine compound is subjected to diazotization, with one amino group of the diamine compound being protected, for example, with acetyl group, followed by the coupling reaction with one of the couplers.

In the case where the layered photoconductor is fabricated, a charge generation layer comprising the bisazo compound is provided on an electroconductive support, and a charge transport layer comprising a charge transport material is overlaid on the charge generation layer. The above-mentioned overlaying order of the charge generation layer and the charge transport layer may be reversed. For the formation of the photoconductive layer in which the above-mentioned bisazo compound is dispersed, the bisazo compound, with a binder resin being optionally added thereto, is dispersed or dissolved in an appropriate solvent, using a ball mill, ultrasonic wave, or a homomixer.

Examples of the reaction solvent used in the above-mentioned reaction are methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, 2-methoxyethanol, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, bis(2-methoxyethyl)ether, diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, xylene, dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone and 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone. The reaction temperature in the reaction may be determined within a wide range from room temperature to about 100 C. depending on (1) the stability of the employed solvent with respect to the employed basic catalyst, (2) the reactivity of the condensed components, and (3) the reactivity of the employed basic catalyst as a condensation agent in the solvent. Further, it is preferable to carry out the reaction in an atmosphere of an inert gas because oxidation of the phosphonium salt compound can be inhibited in the course of the reaction. In the thus obtained dinitro compound, part of a moiety of olefin has a cis-form. By heating the crude product as it is, or after purification, in an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene or xylene together with a catalytic amount of iodine, all the olefin moiety can become trans-form. The thus prepared 1,4-bis4-(4-nitrophenyl)-1,3-butadienylbenzene of formula (V) is reduced in such a manner that 1,4-bis4-(4-nitrophenyl)-1,3-butadienylbenzene is heated to temperature in the range of 70 to 120 C. using a reducing agent such as iron-hydrochloric acid or stannous chloride-hydrochloric acid. Thus, 1,4-bis4-(4-aminophenyl)-1,3-butadienylbenzene of formula (VI) can be obtained. This reaction is terminated in about 0.5 to 3 hours. When the reducing agent of iron-hydrochloric acid is employed, it is preferable to carry out the reaction in an organic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide. According to the present invention, 1,4-bis4-(4-aminophenyl)-1,3-butadienylbenzene of formula (VI) is subjected to diazotization to prepare the bis(diazonium salt) compound of formula (III). Such diazotization is carried out in such a manner that 1,4-bis4-(4-aminophenyl)-1,3-butadienylbenzene of formula (VI) is dispersed in an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid to prepare a dispersion, and sodium nitrite is added to the dispersion at temperature in the range of 10 to 20 C. This reaction is terminated in about 0.5 to 3 hours, thereby obtaining a bis(diazonium salt) compound of formula (III). Further, the bis(diazonium salt) compound of formula (III) can be isolated as a salt from the reaction mixture by adding an aqueous solution of borofluoric acid or sodium borofluoride to the above-mentioned reaction mixture. Of the bisazo compound of formula (I), the following bisazo compound represented by formula (II) is preferable in the present invention: wherein Z is a benzene ring, a naphthalene ring or a carbazole ring, each of which may have a substituent; R is independently a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxyl group or nitro group; n is an integer of 1, 2 or 3. The bisazo compound of formula (II) can be prepared by allowing the previously mentioned bis(diazonium salt) compound of formula (III) to react with a coupler of formula (IV): wherein X is an anionic functional group; and wherein Z is a benzene ring, a naphthalene ring or a carbazole ring, each of which may have a substituent; R is independently a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxyl group or nitro group; and n is an integer of 1, 2 or 3. Specific examples of the halogen atom represented by R in formula (II) or (IV) are fluorine atom, chlorine atom, bromine atom and iodine atom. Specific examples of the lower alkyl group represented by R in formula (II) or (IV) are methyl group, ethyl group, propyl group and butyl group. Specific examples of the lower alkoxyl group represented by R in formula (II) or (IV) are methoxy group, ethoxy group, propoxy group and butoxy group. In formula (II) or (IV), Z represents benzene ring, naphthalene ring or carbazole ring, each of which may have a substituent. As the substituent, there can be employed the same halogen atom, lower alkyl group, lower alkoxyl group, and nitro group as mentioned in the explanation of R. The bisazo compound of formula (II) can be prepared by the following method. The bis(diazonium salt) compound of formula (III) and the coupler of formula (IV) are dissolved in an organic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide to prepare a solution, and an alkaline aqueous solution such as an aqueous solution of sodium acetate is added dropwise to the above prepared solution at temperature in the range of about 10 to 40 C. to carry out the coupling reaction. This coupling reaction is terminated in about 5 minutes to 3 hours. After completion of the coupling reaction, separating crystals are collected by filtration, and purified by washing the crystals with water and/or an organic solvent and carrying out recrystallization. Thus, a desired bisazo compound of formula (II) can be obtained. The bisazo compound of formula (II) can also be prepared by allowing the reaction mixture prepared for diazotization of 1,4-bis4-(4-aminophenyl)-1,3-butadienylbenzene to directly react with the coupler of formula (IV). The bisazo compound of formula (II) can serve as the organic photoconductive material, in particular, the charge generation material in the electrophotographic photoconductor. For example, a single-layered photoconductor can be fabricated by overlaying on an electroconductive support a photoconductive layer comprising the bisazo compound of formula (II) and a binder resin, optionally in combination with a sensitizing agent. The above-mentioned single-layered photoconductive layer may further comprise a charge transport material. Alternatively, a layered photoconductor can be fabricated by providing a charge generation layer comprising the bisazo compound of formula (II) as the main component on an electroconductive support, and overlaying a charge transport layer comprising a charge transport material and a binder resin on the charge generation layer. In the above-mentioned layered photoconductor, the overlaying order of the charge generation layer and the charge transport layer may be reversed. The bisazo compound according to the present invention is useful as the photoconductive material for use in the electrophotographic photoconductor, and in addition, as the electronic device in the solar battery and the optical disk in the field of electronics.

EXAMPLE 2-16 The procedure for fabrication of the electrophotographic photoconductor No. 8 in Example 2-8 was repeated except that -phenyl-4-diphenylaminostilbene serving as the charge transport material for use in the charge transport layer coating liquid in Example 2-8 was replaced by -phenyl-4-bis(4-methylphenyl)aminostilbene of formula (XIII). Thus, an electrophotographic photoconductor No. 16 according to the present invention was fabricated. Each of the electrophotographic photoconductors No. 9 to No. 16 according to the present invention fabricated in Examples 2-9 to 2-16 was negatively charged in the dark under application of 6 kV of corona charge for 20 seconds using a commercially available electrostatic copying sheet testing apparatus Paper Analyzer Model EPA8100 made by Kawaguchi Electro Works Co., Ltd. Then, each photoconductor was allowed to stand in the dark for 20 seconds without applying any charge thereto, and the surface potential Vo (V) of each photoconductor was measured. Each photoconductor was then illuminated by a tungsten lamp in such a manner that the illuminance on the illuminated surface of the photoconductor was 5.3 lux. The exposure E (luxsec) required to reduce the initial surface potential Vo (V) to the initial surface potential Vo (V) was calculated so as to obtain the sensitivity in the visible light range.

Thus, electrophotographic photoconductors No. 17 to No. 20 according to the present invention were fabricated. Each of the electrophotographic photoconductors No. 17 to No. 20 according to the present invention fabricated in Examples 2-17 to 2-20 was negatively charged in the dark under application of 6 kV of corona charge for 20 seconds using a commercially available electrostatic copying sheet testing apparatus Paper Analyzer Model EPA8100 made by Kawaguchi Electro Works Co., Ltd.

Each photoconductor was then illuminated by a tungsten lamp in such a manner that the illuminance on the illuminated surface of the photoconductor was 5.3 lux. The exposure E (luxsec) required to reduce the initial surface potential Vo (V) to the initial surface potential Vo (V) was calculated so as to obtain the sensitivity in the visible light range. The results are shown in TABLE 18.

Each photoconductor was negatively charged in the dark by corona charge using a commercially available eloctrostatic copying sheet testing apparatus Paper Analyzer Model EPA8100 made by Kawaguchi Electro Works Co., Ltd., and then allowed to stand in the dark without applying any change thereto. When the surface potential of the photoconductor reached 800 V, the photoconductor was illuminated by a 780 nm-monochromatic light pf 1 W/cm 2 . The period of time (s) required to reduce the surface potential (800 V) to 2/1 the surface potential (400 V) and the exposure (Wscm 2 ) were obtained. Thus, a photo-induced discharge speed (Ccm 2 /J) was calculated. The results are shown in TABLE 19. TABLE 19 Photoconductor No. S (V cm 2 /J) 3 620 11 930 14 1250 20 1630 15 1120 As can be seen from the above-mentioned results, the photoconductors employing the bisazo compounds according to the present invention can show remarkably high sensitivity not only in the visible region, but also in the near infrared region.

Thus, a charge generation layer with a thickness of about 0.5 m was provided on the electroconductive support. (Formation-of charge transport layer) 64 parts by weight of an electron transport material represented by the following formula (XIV) and 96 parts by weight of a commercially available polycarbonate resin (Trademark IUPILON Z200 made by Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc.) were dissolved in 640 parts by weight of tetrahydrofuran, so that a coating liquid for a charge transport layer was prepared.

EXAMPLE 2-23 The procedure for fabrication of the electrophotographic photoconductor No. 21 in Example 2-21 was repeated except that the electron transport material of formula (XIV) for use in the charge transport layer coating liquid in Example 2-21 was replaced by an electron transport material of the following formula (XVI): Thus, an electrophotographic photoconductor No. 23 according to the present invention was fabricated. EXAMPLE 2-24 Fabrication of Single-layered Photoconductor A mixture of one part by weight of the bisazo compound No. 12 obtained in Example 1-12 and 158 parts by weight of methyl ethyl ketone was dispersed in a ball mill using 5-mm diameter alumina balls for 24 hours. To the above prepared mixture, 12 parts by weight of -phenyl-4-diphenylaminostilbene serving as the charge transport material and 18 parts by weight of a commercially available polycarbonate resin (Trademark IUPILON Z200 made by Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc.) were added, and the resultant mixture was dispersed, so that a coating liquid for a photoconductive layer was prepared. The thus prepared coating liquid was coated on the aluminum-deposited surface of an aluminum-deposited polyester film using a doctor blade, and dried at 100 C. for 30 minutes, so that a photoconductive layer with a thickness of about 15 m was provided on the electroconductive support. Thus, an electrophotographic photoconductor No. 24 according to the present invention was fabricated. Each of the electrophotographic photoconductors No. 21 to No. 24 according to the present invention fabricated in Examples 2-21 to 2-24 was positively charged in the dark under application of 6 kV of corona charge for 20 seconds using a commercially available electrostatic copying sheet testing apparatus Paper Analyzer Model EPA8100 made by Kawaguchi Electro Works Co., Ltd. Then, each photoconductor was allowed to stand in the dark for 20 seconds without applying any charge thereto, and the surface potential Vo (V) of each photoconductor was measured. Each photoconductor was then illuminated by a tungsten lamp in such a manner that the illuminance on the illuminated surface of the photoconductor was 5.3 lux.

Using the comparative photoconductor No. 1, the sensitivity of the photoconductor with respect to the semiconductor laser beam was examined in the following manner. The photoconductor was negatively charged in the dark by corona charge using a commercially available electrostatic copying sheet testing apparatus Paper Analyzer Model EPA8100 made by Kawaguchi Electro Works Co., Ltd., and then allowed to stand in the dark without applying any charge thereto. When the surface potential of the photoconductor reached 800 V, the photoconductor was illuminated by a 780 nm-monochromatic light of 1 W/cm 2 .
