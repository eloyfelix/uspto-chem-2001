hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid of the formula (2): which is characterized by contacting a compound of the formula (1): wherein R 1 and R 2 represent a hydrogen atom or a benzyl group, but R 1 and R 2 do not simultaneously represent a hydrogen atom, and R 3 represents a hydrogen atom or a carboxyl group, with sulfuric acid in the presence of an aromatic hydrocarbon. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for producing hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART Hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid is also called vitamin H (biotin), a compound effective for promoting growth, preventing and curing skin diseases, and the like, and used as a feed additive, and the like. As a method for producing such hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid, there is disclosed a method in which hexahydro-2-oxo-1,3-dibenzylthieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid is treated with alkanesulfonic acid such as methanesulfonic acid (Japanese Patent Application Publication (JP-B) No. 63-8954). However, this method is not always industrially and economically satisfactory since a rather large amount of expensive alkanesulfonic acids is used, and recovery of the used alkanesulfonic acid is a cumbersome process. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present Invention is to provide a industrially advantageous method for producing hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid without using expensive alkanesulfonic acid. The present invention provides a method for producing hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid of the formula (2): which method comprises contacting a compound of the formula (1): wherein R 1 and R 2 represent a hydrogen atom or a benzyl group, provided that R 1 and R 2 do not simultaneously represent a hydrogen atom, and R 3 represents a hydrogen atom or a carboxyl group, with sulfuric acid in the presence of an aromatic hydrocarbon. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention will be illustrated in detail below. In the general formula (1), R 1 and R 2 represent a hydrogen atom or a benzyl group, but R 1 and R 2 do not simultaneously represent a hydrogen atom, and R 3 represents a hydrogen atom or a carboxyl group. Examples of the compound represented by such general formula (1) include hexahydro-2-oxo-1,3-dibenzylthieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid, hexahydro-2-oxo-1-benzyl-3H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid, hexahydro-2-oxo-1,3-dibenzylthieno3,4-dimidazole-4-(4-hydroxycarbonyl)pentanoic acid and the like. The compound of the formula (1) theoretically has optical isomers, and any of the optically active isomers which include an isomer having the same stereochemistry as D-biotin with respect to a thieno3,4-dimidazole moiety, racemates or a mixture containing at least one optical isomer in excess can be used in the present invention. The amount of sulfuric acid is usually 1 mol or more per mol of the compound of the formula (1). The upper limit thereof is not particularly restricted, however, it is preferably 20 moles, and more preferably 10 moles per mole of the compound of the formula (1). The concentration of sulfuric acid is preferably 90% by weight or more in view of yield. Examples of the aromatic hydrocarbon include: an alkylbenzene which is substituted with 1 to 5 (C 1 -C 3 )alkyl group(s) such as toluene, xylene, mesitylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, durene, pentamethylbenzene, cymene, cumene, diisopropylbenzene and the like; and an alkylnaphtalene which is substituted with 1 to 7 (C 1 -C 3 )alkyl group(s) such as methylnaphtalene, dimethylnaphthalene, trimethylnaphthalene, diisopropylnaphthalene and the like; and a mixture containing the above-described alkylbenzenes and/or the alkylnaphthalene. The alkylbenzenes are preferred, and mesitylene is particularly preferred among them. The amount of such aromatic hydrocarbon is 2 moles or more, preferably 5 moles or more per mol of the compound of the formula (1). The upper limit thereof is not particularly restricted, and it is preferably 30 moles, more preferably 20 moles per mol of the compound of formula(1). The compound of the formula (1) is usually contacted with sulfuric acid in the presence of the aromatic hydrocarbon usually at 50 C. or more, preferably 70 C. or more, more preferably 90 C. or more and up to usually 120 C., preferably 100 C. After completion of the treatment, the desired compound of the formula (2) can be usually obtained by a conventional post-treatment. Preferably, a sulfuric layer containing hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid and an aromatic hydrocarbon layer in the reaction mixture are usually separated. A hydrophobic organic solvent such as toluene, xylene and the like may also be added to wash the sulfuric acid layer, if necessary. The separated sulfuric acid layer containing hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid is usually mixed with water by pouring it into water or by adding water thereto to give a crude crystal of the desired compound. The mixing of the sulfuric acid layer with water can be conducted in the presence of a lower carboxylic acid such as C 1 -C 2 carboxylic acid(e.g., formic acid or acetic acid), which results in smooth precipitation of the crystal of the desired compound, which has good filtrability. The lower carboxylic acid may be added to the sulfuric acid layer or to the water. Alternatively, the lower carboxylic acid may be added when the compound of the formula (1) is contacted with sulfuric acid in the presence of the aromatic hydrocarbon. The amount of the lower carboxylic acid to be used is not limited, but is usually 10 moles or less per mol of the compound of the formula (1) from a practical view point. Alternatively, the crude crystal of the desired compound may also be obtained by mixing the sulfuric acid layer with an aqueous alkaline solution followed by activated carbon treatment and crystal precipitation with an acid. Examples of the alkaline solution include those of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. Examples of the acid used to precipitate the crystals of the desired compound of the formula (2) include a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, and a lower carboxylic acid such as formic acid or acetic acid. The presence of the lower carboxylic acid in the precipitation of the crystals of the desired compound with a mineral acid is useful for smooth precipitation of the crystals of the desired compound, which have good filtrability. The crystals obtained by the above-described methods can be further purified by recrystalization in water or the procedure described in the above paragraph may be repeated in a similar manner. Used aromatic hydrocarbons in the separated aromatic hydrocarbon layer can be recovered by a usual treatment such as distillation and the like, and the recovered aromatic hydrocarbons can be used in the present process again. When an optically active compound of the formula (1) is used, an optically active hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid, for example, D-biotin can be obtained. According to the method of the present invention, hexahydro-2-oxo-1H-thieno3,4-dimidazole-4-pentanoic acid can be easily obtained from a compound of the formula (1) using inexpensive sulfuric acid. Therefore, this method is advantageous industrially and economically.

above, with a vinylidene compound represented by the formula (II): wherein R 2 and R 3 are as defined above, in the presence of a phosphorus halide. The tert-alkyl carboxylic acid ester can be used as intermediates for pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for preparing a tert-alkyl carboxylic acid ester. More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for preparing a tert-alkyl carboxylic acid ester having a tert-alkyl moiety which is useful as its protective group. The tert-alkyl carboxylic acid ester is useful for pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics, raw materials for chemicals, intermediates, and the like. 2. Discussion of the Related Art As processes for preparing a tert-alkyl carboxylic acid ester, there have been known 1) a process comprising reacting an acid chloride of a carboxylic acid with a tertiary alcohol in the presence of dimethylaniline Organic Synthesis III, 142, 2) a process comprising treating malonic acid with isobutylene as a vinylidene compound in the presence of sulfuric acid Organic Synthesis IV, 261, and the like. However, in the process 1), there are some defects such that the preparation process is long, and the procedures are complicated since this process necessitates a process for preparing an acid chloride of a carboxylic acid, and that this process is economically disadvantageous since this process necessitates an expensive base such as dimethylaniline. Also, in the process 2), there are some defects that the reaction product is easily hydrolyzed by sulfuric acid used in the reaction, and the vinylidene compound is likely to be polymerized under the given reaction conditions. An object of the present invention is to provide a process for simply, conveniently and industrially advantageously preparing a tert-alkyl carboxylic acid ester in a high yield. The above and other objects of the present invention will be apparent from the following description.

In the vinylidene compound represented by the formula (II), each of R 2 and R 3 is independently an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Concrete examples of the alkyl groups include methyl group, ethyl group, propyl group, isopropyl group, n-butyl group, and the like. Representative examples of the vinylidene compound include isobutylene, 2-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-1-pentene, and the like. Among them, isobutylene can be preferably used. The amount of the vinylidene compound represented by the formula (II) is not limited to specified ones. It is desired that the amount of the vinylidene compound is usually not less than 1.5 moles, preferably not less than 1.8 moles, per one mole of the carboxylic acid represented by the formula (I), from the viewpoint of reactivity, and not more than 10 moles, preferably not more than 3 moles, per one mole of the carboxylic acid represented by the formula (I), from the viewpoint of economics. In the present invention, one of great features resides in that the carboxylic acid is reacted with the vinylidene compound in the presence of a phosphorus halide. Since the phosphorus halide is employed in the reaction, the tert-alkyl carboxylic acid ester can be simply, conveniently and industrially advantageously prepared in a high yield. The phosphorus halide includes, for instance, phosphorus halides such as phosphorus oxytrichloride, phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride and dichlorophosphonic acid. Among those phosphorus halides, phosphorus oxytrichloride, phosphorus trichloride and dichlorophosphonic acid are preferable, from the viewpoint of reactivity. It is desired that the amount of the phosphorus halide is not less than 0.05 moles, preferably not less than 0.15 moles, per one mole of the carboxylic acid, from the viewpoint of reactivity, and not more than 1 mole, preferably not more than 0.4 moles, per one mole of the carboxylic acid, from the viewpoint of economics. During the reaction of the carboxylic acid with the phosphorus halide, a solvent can be used. The solvent is not limited to specified ones, as long as the reaction is not hindered. The solvent includes, for instance, hydrocarbon solvents such as heptane and cyclohexane; aromatic solvents such as benzene, toluene and xylene; halogenated solvents such as dichloroethane and chlorobenzene; ester solvents such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate; ether solvents such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, and the like. Among those solvents, aromatic solvents, especially toluene, are preferable from the viewpoint of economics. It is desired that the amount of the solvent is usually 10 to 2000 parts by weight, preferably 50 to 200 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the carboxylic acid. In addition, during the reaction of the carboxylic acid with the phosphorus halide, it is preferable to use a catalytic amount of water, from the viewpoint of accelerating the reaction. It is desired that the amount of water is usually 0.05 to 0.15 moles, preferably 0.07 to 0.12 moles, per one mole of the carboxylic acid, from the viewpoint of rapidly carrying out the reaction. The reaction temperature during the reaction of the carboxylic acid with the phosphorus halide cannot be absolutely determined. It is desired that the temperature is usually 0 to 40 C. or so, preferably 10 to 30 C. or so, from the viewpoints of reaction rate and inhibition of ester decomposition. The reaction time cannot be absolutely determined because the reaction time varies depending upon reaction temperature and the like. The reaction time can be until the termination of the reaction, and is usually 1 to 24 hours or so. Incidentally, the termination of reaction can be confirmed by using gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the like. The reaction product thus prepared is a tert-alkyl carboxylic acid ester represented by the formula (III). After the termination of the reaction, for instance, the reaction mixture is added dropwise to water or an aqueous alkali with stirring, or alternatively water or an aqueous alkali is added dropwise to the reaction mixture with stirring, and the mixture is allowed to separate into two layers. The organic layer can be used after the organic layer is washed with water or an aqueous alkali and dried over a desiccant such as magnesium sulfate, or after the organic solvent is distilled off to precipitate crystals. The tert-alkyl carboxylic acid ester prepared according to the present invention can be suitably used, for instance, as intermediates for pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics. In addition, the process of the present invention can be also utilized for a process for protecting carboxyl group in the carboxylic acid.

BACKGROUND ART Benzo heterocyclic derivatives represented by the formula (1) shown below have excellent antibacterial activity and are useful as antibacterial agents (Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 96557/1994). In the formula, R 2 is C 1-6 alkyl. R 3 is a 5- to 9-membered saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic ring residue, the heterocyclic ring residue optionally having one or more substituents. R 4 is cyclopropyl which may be substituted by 1 to 3 substituents selected from the group consisting of C 1-6 alkyl and halogen; phenyl which may be substituted by 1 to 3 substituents selected from the group consisting of C 1-6 alkoxy, halogen and hydroxy on the phenyl ring; C 1-6 alkyl which may be substituted by halogen, C 2-6 alkanoyloxy or hydroxy; C 2-6 alkenyl or thienyl. R is hydrogen or C 1-6 alkyl. More specifically, the benzo heterocyclic derivatives of the formula (1) and salts thereof have excellent antibacterial activities against various gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria and are useful for the treatment of various infectious diseases induced by various bacteria in human, other animals and fish and also useful as an external antimicrobial or disinfectant agent for medical instruments and the like. The benzo heterocyclic derivatives of the formula (1) and salts thereof show an excellent antibacterial activity against mycoplasma, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, anaerobic bacteria, resistant cells against various antibacterials, clinically isolated strains, and gram negative and gram positive bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis and Staphyloccocus pyognes and hence are useful as an antibacterial agent for the treatment of diseases induced by these microorganisms. The benzo heterocyclic derivatives of the formula (1) and salts thereof show low toxicity and less side effect and have characteristic features such as good absorbability and sustained activity. Furthermore, the benzo heterocyclic derivatives of the formula (1) and salts thereof are useful for the treatment of urinary infectious diseases because they are highly excreted via urine, and further because of easy excretion via bile, they are useful for the treatment of intestinal infectious diseases. According to Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 96557/1994, the benzo heterocyclic derivatives of the formula (1) and salts thereof are prepared by using a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) wherein R 2 is as defined above and R 1 is halogen. According to Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 96557/1994, as shown below in Reaction Scheme A or B, a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) is prepared by using known starting compounds by a multiple-step process comprising five steps. Thus according to the process described in Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 96557/1994, a complicated reaction procedure must be carried out to prepare the fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2). Furthermore, the desired fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) is obtained only in a low yield of about 8.3%. wherein R 1 is as defined above, R a is hydrogen or C 1-6 alkyl, R b is C 1-6 alkyl, and X 1 is halogen. wherein R 2 is as defined above and R c is C 1-6 alkyl. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications Nos. 243692/1990 and 74167/1992 and EP319906 disclose a process for preparing a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) by using a compound of the formula (A), as shown in the following Reaction Scheme C: The process, however, necessitates undertaking three steps to prepare the desired fluoro benzoic acid by using the compound of the formula (A). Furthermore, the desired fluoro benzoic acid is obtained only in a low yield of about 7.5%, based on the compound of the formula (A). Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications Nos. 502452/1991 and 291959/1998 and J. Heterocyclic Chem., 27, p1610 (1990) disclose a process for preparing a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) by using a compound of the formula (B), as shown in the following Reaction Scheme D: wherein R d is alkyl. The process, however, necessitates undertaking seven steps to prepare the desired fluoro benzoic acid by using the compound of the formula (B). Furthermore, the desired fluoro benzoic acid is obtained only in a low yield of about 45.8%, based on the compound of the formula (B). J. Heterocyclic Chem., 27, p.1611 (1990) and Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1991, vol.34, No.3, p.1156 disclose a process for preparing a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) by using the compound of the formula (C), as shown in the following Reaction Scheme E: wherein R e is methyl or ethyl. The process, however, necessitates undertaking four steps to prepare the desired fluoro benzoic acid by using the compound of the formula (C). Furthermore, the desired fluoro benzoic acid is obtained only in a low yield of about 25 to 30%, based on the compound of the formula (C). DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a single step process for preparing a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) without the necessity of undertaking multiple steps, the fluoro benzoic acid being used as an intermediate for preparing a benzo heterocyclic derivative of the formula (1) which is useful as an antibacterial agent. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing the fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) by a simple and convenient procedure at low costs, using an easily available compound without using any special reagents. A further object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing the fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) in high purity and high yield. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a commercially advantageous process for preparing the fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2). In view of such state, the inventors of the present invention carried out extensive research to achieve the above objects. During the research, the present inventors conceived of using as a starting material a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (3) wherein R 1 is as defined above. The fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (3) is a compound which is unsubstituted at the 5-position with respect to the carboxyl group. Izv. Sib. Otd. Akad. Nauk SSSR, Ser. Khim. Nauk, Vol.5, p100 (1975) discloses a process for preparing a compound of the formula (F) comprising reacting a compound of the formula (D) with a Grignard reagent (E), as shown in the following Reaction Scheme F: The process produces the compound of the formula (F) in a high yield, but it is presumably owing to the chemical structure of the compound of the formula (D) used as a starting material. Stated more specifically, the compound of the formula (D) is a compound wherein all the hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring have been replaced by substituents (fluorine atoms and a carboxyl group). Upon substitution reaction with the Grignard reagent (E), a fluorine atom at one of the ortho-positions with respect to the carboxyl group (i.e., at 2- or 6-position) is substituted by R f . Whether R f replaces either one of the fluorine atoms at the 2- and 6-positions with respect to the carboxyl group, the resulting compound will be a compound represented by the formula (F). Japanese Examined Patent Publications Nos. 502452/1991 and 291959/1998 disclose a process for preparing a compound of the formula (H), which comprises reacting a compound of the formula (G) with alkyllithium, as shown in the following Reaction Scheme G: The process produces the compound of the formula (H) in a high yield, but it is presumably owing to the chemical structure of the compound of the formula (G) used as a starting material. Stated more specifically, the compound of the formula (G) is a compound wherein all the hydrogen atoms on the benzene ring have been replaced by substituents (fluorine atoms and a 2-oxazolyl group). Upon substitution reaction with alkyllithium, a fluorine atom at one of the ortho-positions with respect to the 2-oxazolyl group (i.e., 2- or 6-position) is substituted by R g . Whether R g replaces either one of the fluorine atoms at the 2- and 6-positions with respect to the 2-oxazolyl group, the resulting compound will be a compound represented by the formula (H). From the conventional reactions as described above, it could easily be assumed that when a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (3), which is unsubstituted at the 5-position with respect to the carboxyl group, is alkylated with a Grignard reagent (E) or alkyllithium, the resulting compound would have an alkyl group either at the 2-position or at the 6-position with respect to the carboxyl group. Stated more specifically, it had been considered that the reaction would produce two kinds of compounds, i.e., a compound having an alkyl group at the 2-position, and a compound having an alkyl group at the 6-position, the 2- and 6-positions being ortho positions with respect to the carboxyl group of the fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (3). Surprisingly, however, the reaction produces only a trace or no amount of the compound having an alkyl group at the 6-position, which is one of the ortho positions with respect to the carboxyl group of the fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (3), and selectively produces only the compound having an alkyl group at the 2-position, which is the other ortho position with respect to the carboxyl group of the fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (3). Such finding was surprising and unpredictable even to those skilled in the art having chemical knowledge in the field. The present inventors further found that the object of the invention can also be achieved by reducing a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (4) wherein R 1 and R 2 are as defined above. The present invention has been accomplished based on the above findings. The present invention provides a process (hereinafter referred to as process A) for preparing a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (2) wherein R 1 and R 2 are as defined above, which comprises alkylating a fluoro benzoic acid of the formula (3) wherein R 1 is as defined above.

of the nitrobenzotrichloride into a trifluoromethyl group by reaction with anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, thereby forming a nitrobenzotrifluoride, and (c) reducing the nitro groups of the nitrobenzotrifluoride to form a trifluoromethylaniline of formula (I). The present invention relates to an improved process for preparing trifluoromethylanilines starting from benzotrichlorides. Trifluoromethylanilines are important intermediates for preparing pharmaceutically and agrochemically active compounds, for example herbicides, insecticides, infection inhibitors and disinfectants. There is therefore a need for a process for preparing trifluoromethylanilines in a simple and economical manner in industrial quantities in good yields and purities. Existing processes for preparing trifluoromethylanilines are unsuitable for practice on an industrial scale or have other serious disadvantages. The use of sulphur tetrafluoride for preparing trifluoromethylanilines on an industrial scale (see J. Org. Chem. 26, 1477 (1961) and 27, 1406 (1962)) is not advisable on account of its extreme toxicity. The introduction of trifluoromethyl groups by means of sodium trifluoroacetate in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of copper(I) iodide (see J. Chem. Soc. Perk. Trans. 1, 1988, 921) requires costly reagents, and there are problems with the disposal of copper salts. The fluorination of tribromomethylnitrobenzene with antimony trifluoride and the subsequent reduction of the resulting trifluoromethylnitrobenzene by means of tin chloride (see J. Am. Chem. Soc. 69, 2346 (1947)) likewise requires costly reagents and substantial spending on ecological measures. The reaction of chlorobenzotrifluoride with ammonia and copper(I) chloride (see J. Org. Chem. 44, 4731 (1979)) requires drastic reaction conditions and provides only low yields. Nitrating benzotrifluoride and reducing the nitrobenzotrifluoride obtainable provides large amounts of 3-trifluoromethylaniline (around 90%), some 2-trifluoromethylaniline (around 9%) and only little 4-trifluoromethylaniline (around 1%) (see Synthesis 11, 1087 (1992)). The situation is similar with the nitration of substituted benzotrifluorides. The only processes in existence for preparing 3-chloro-6-nitrobenzotrifluoride and 3-fluoro-6-nitrobenzotrifluoride (US-A 2,086,029) provide 3-chloro-4-nitrobenzotrifluoride and 3-fluoro-4-nitrobenzotrifluoride only to a small extent. Frequently, however, the 4-trifluoromethylanilines are the more wanted compounds. Preparing trifluoromethylaniline by catalytic reduction of trifluoromethylnitrobenzene has been known for a long time (see J. Org. Chem. 26, 1477 (1964)), but, as explained above, 4-trifluoromethylnitrobenzene is not conveniently obtainable on an industrial scale. A more recent process for preparing trifluoromethylaniline comprises reacting trichloromethylphenyl isocyanate first with anhydrous hydrofluoric acid and then with water to obtain trifluoromethylaniline hydrofluoride, from which the free aniline is released using a base (see EP-A 639 556). The starting isocyanate has to be prepared first, for example by chlorination of methylphenyl isocyanate. The particular disadvantage of this process is its many stages. Another recent process reacts chlorobenzotrifluoride with ammonia or amine in the presence of a palladium catalyst, a cocatalyst and a strong base (see EP-A 846 676). As well as being complex, the process has the disadvantage that even an isomerically pure starting material will give rise to a product that is a mixture of isomers. This invention now provides a process for preparing trifluoromethylanilines of the formula (I) where R 1 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, methyl, monochloromethyl, dichloromethyl or formyl and R 2 is hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine and for R 1 R 2 hydrogen the amino group is para to the trifluoromethyl group, characterized in that a benzotrichloride of the formula (II) where R 1 and R 2 are each as defined for the formula (I), is nitrated and, in the nitrobenzotrichlorides thus obtainable, the trichloromethyl groups are converted into trifluoromethyl groups by reaction with anhydrous hydrofluoric acid and finally the nitro groups are reduced. In the formulae (I) and (II) R 1 is preferably hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine and R 2 is preferably hydrogen or chlorine. The first step of the process according to the invention, the nitration of benzotrichlorides of the formula (II), is preferably carried out using mixtures of nitric acid and sulphuric acid as nitrating agent, the sulphuric acid preferably being at least 96% strength and the nitric acid being fuming nitric acid containing around 100% HNO 3 . The nitric acid is preferably used in excess, for example 1.2 to 5 mol per mole of benzotrichloride of the formula (II). This amount is preferably 1.8 to 2.5 mol. The weight ratio of nitric acid to sulphuric acid can be for example 0.5 to 2:1. It is also possible first to add just nitric acid and then sulphuric acid. An addition of sulphuric acid without initially charging or simultaneously adding nitric acid to benzotrichlorides of the formula (II) is to be avoided. The nitration can be carried out for example at temperatures in the range 15 to 50 C. It is preferable to use the range from 10 to 35 C. If desired, the nitration may be carried out in the presence of an inert solvent. Examples of useful solvents are dichloromethane and 1,2-dichloroethane. The nitration can be carried out batchwise of discontinuously or else continuously, for example in a tubular reactor. The use of bundle reactors or microreactors is likewise possible. The as-nitrated reaction mixture can be worked up, for example, by discharging it onto ice, extracting with an inert organic solvent, washing the combined extracts acid-free (for example with water and/or aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution), drying and removing the extractant. The second step of the process according to the invention, the reaction with anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, can be carried out using the mixture of isomeric nitrobenzotrichlorides obtained in the first step. However, it is also possible first to separate the isomers, for example by distillation or crystallization, and to react isomerically pure nitrobenzotrichlorides with anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. For example, 3 to 50 mol of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid can be used per mole of nitrobenzotrichloride, in which case the material commercially available under the name anhydrous hydrofluoric acid is sufficiently water-free. The fluorination can be carried out for example at temperatures in the range 0 to 180 C. and pressures in the range 1 to 50 bar. It is preferable to fluorinate at 10 to 160 C. and 1 to 30 bar. If desired, the fluorination can be carried out in the presence of a catalyst and/or an inert solvent. The catalyst used can be for example boron trifluoride, titanium tetrachloride, antimony pentachloride or antimony pentafluoride, while dichloromethane can be used as solvent. The anhydrous hydrofluoric acid can be charged first and the nitrobenzotrichloride added, or vice versa. It is advantageous to combine the hydrofluoric acid and the nitrobenzotrichloride at relatively low temperatures, for example, at up to 50 C., within the framework of the abovementioned temperature ranges, and then to increase the temperature. After the reaction has ended, the reaction mixture can be admixed with a suitable solvent, for example dichloromethane, and the organic phase separated off, washed with water, dried and concentrated or distilled. The fluorination can also be carried out in the gas phase, in which case the reaction temperature can be 200 to 450 C. for example. To prepare very isomerically pure trifluoromethylanilines of the formula (I), it is advantageous to separate the isomers at the nitrobenzotrifluoride stage. For example, this separation of isomers may be effected by final distillation or a combination of final distillation and crystallization. The final distillation is preferably carried out using such pressures that the liquid phase does not have to be heated to temperatures above 200 C. It is advantageous to carry out the final distillation at pressures in the range 50 to 150 mbar and at liquid phase temperatures in the range from 110 to 180 C. A combination of final distillation and crystallization can be carried out for example by first isolating an at least 80% pure product by final distillation and using it to obtain even purer products by crystallization. The crystallization mother liquor can be recycled into the final distillation. This makes it possible for example to obtain 4-nitrobenzotrifluoride in a purity above 99% and to use it to prepare in the third stage a similarly pure 4-trifluoromethylaniline. The crystallization may be carried out for example simply by cooling or by addition of a solvent in which the trifluoromethylanilines are sparingly soluble. If desired, the product obtained by crystallization can be further purified by recrystallization. The third step of the process according to the invention, the reduction, can be carried out in a conventional manner, for example as a chemical reduction using for example hydrazine hydrate, ammonium formate, triethylamine/formic acid, tin(II) chloride, iron, sodium sulphide or sodium hydrogensulphide as reducing agent. However, preference is given to the catalytic reduction with hydrogen in the presence of catalysts, for example Raney nickel or palladium catalysts. The catalytic reduction can be carried out for example at temperatures in the range from 20 to 100 C., pressures in the range from 1 to 50 bar and optionally in the presence of solvents such as alcohols or esters, preferably C 1 -C 4 -alkyl alcohols or acetates thereof The catalytic hydrogenation is generally accompanied by significant isomerization, i.e. in general isomerically pure or substantially isomerically pure trifluoromethylanilines are obtained when a corresponding isomerically pure or substantially isomerically pure nitrobenzotrifluoride has been used. Nitrobenzotrifluorides in the form of isomeric mixtures generally give rise to trifluoromethylaniline isomer mixtures having the same or similar distribution of isomers. To obtain isomerically pure trifluoromethylanilines, it is advantageous to carry out the separation of isomers prior to the reduction stage. The mixture present after a catalytic reduction can be worked up in a simple manner, for example by filtering it and subsequently concentrating the filtrate. A chemical reduction can be worked up in the manner which is known in principle for such reactions. The process of the invention is a simple way of preparing trifluoromethylanilines in good yields and purities in few reaction steps and in customary apparatus. It also provides trifluoromethylanilines containing higher levels of 4-isomers than in the prior art. Problematic reagents such as sulphur tetrafluoride and costly reagents such as bromides or iodides need not be used. There are no special ecological problems. This is surprising, since using benzotrifluorides (instead of benzotrichlorides) as starting materials provides worse results, as is reflected for example in the high fraction of 3-isomers (around 90%). Specifically the separation of the 3- from the 4-isomers is particularly inconvenient because of the small boiling point differences. The significantly smaller quantities of 3-isomers produced in the process of the invention can likewise be obtained in very pure form (after removal of the other isomers at the nitro compound stage) and used as intermediates for active pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. It is also possible to separate off unwanted isomers at the nitrobenzotrichloride stage and to convert them into the corresponding nitrobenzoyl chlorides which are not accessible from the benzotrifluorides. The invention also provides access to compounds previously obtainable only with difficulty, if at all, such as 3,4-dichloro-5-trifluoromethylaniline, 3,4-dichloro-2-trifluoromethylaniline and the corresponding nitro compounds. The invention converts benzotrichlorides of the formula (II) into products that include at least 19% of 4-trifluoromethylanilines (formula (I), N 2 para to CF 3 ).

The reaction mixture was then initially stirred at 30 to 40 C. for 1 hour, then discharged onto ice and extracted with 3100 ml of dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were washed with 100 ml of water, 3100 ml of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and 100 ml of aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulphate and evaporated, leaving a crude product (109 g, purity 100%, 93.4% of theory) which was 92.7% 2,3-dichloro-5-nitro- and 7.3% 2,3-dichloro-6-nitro-benzotrichloride. Example 6 A mixture of 62 g each of 96% by weight sulphuric acid and 100% by weight fuming nitric acid was admixed at 5 C. with a solution of 100 g of 2,3-dichlorobenzotrichloride in 120 ml of dichloromethane added dropwise over 20 minutes. The reaction mixture was initially stirred at 20 to 30 C. for 2 hours and then refluxed for 2 hours. Subsequently the mixture, which had become solid in the meantime, was placed on ice and extracted with 3100 ml of dichloromethane. The combined organic phases were washed with 100 ml of water, 3100 ml of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and 100 ml of aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulphate and evaporated.

Example 8 1138 g of the 3- and 4-nitro-benzotrichloride mixture obtained according to Example 1 were added dropwise to 850 ml of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid at an internal temperature of between 2 and 7 C. in the course of 15 minutes.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 2,2-Bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1-binaphthyl (BINAP) has become an important chiral ligand for catalytic asymmetric induction. Its wide application has been somewhat limited due to the scarce supply. The present invention relates to a simple and inexpensive process for the synthesis of BINAP derivatives in which the naphthyl groups are substituted, avoiding the necessity of multistep syntheses and minimizing the formation of secondary products.

The preferred catalysts for use herein are the NiCl 2 .bis(diphenyl)phosphinyl C 1-4 alkanes. In particular, the C 2-3 alkanes are preferred. Hence, the preferred catalysts are NiCl 2 .bis(diphenyl)phosphinylethane, which is abbreviated NiCl 2 dppe, and NiCl 2 .bis(diphenyl)phosphinylpropane, which is abbreviated NiCl 2 dppp. The most preferred catalyst for use in the process described herein is NiCl 2 dppe. In one embodiment of the invention, an R() isomer of the compound of formula 1 is provided. An R () isomer of a compound of formula 2: wherein R and R are as previously defined, is reacted with diphenylphosphine in the presence of an amine base and a nickel catalyst to produce the R () isomer of a compound of formula 1. In another embodiment of the invention, the S () isomer of a compound of the formula 2: wherein R and R are as previously defined, is reacted with diphenylphosphine in the presence of an amine base and a nickel catalyst to produce the S () isomer of a compound of formula 1. One more preferred process which is described herein directly converts the R () chiral ditriflate of 1,1-bi-2-naphthol to R () chiral BINAP 1. Likewise, another preferred process directly coverts the S() chiral ditriflate of 1,1-bi-2-naphthol to the (S)-chiral BINAP 1. Essentially no racemization occurs in these preferred embodiments. Diphenylphosphine is added in a suitable solvent at a temperature which is effective for allowing the formation of BINAP 1 in the presence of an amine-containing base and the nickel catalyst. Since diphenylphosphine is a good ligand for nickel, the amount of diphenylphosphine present in the reaction medium can significantly effect the reaction rate, slowing the reaction if the amount of diphenylphosphine is too great. When the diphenylphosphine is added stepwise during the reaction, the reaction can be completed in about 2 days. The coupling reaction slows down at later stages, possibly due to product and impurity poisoning. The reaction is typically completed in 34 days if all the diphenylphosphine is added at once. Suitable solvents include those which do not substantially oxidize the diphenylphosphine at the appropriate temperature, while maintaining the desired solubility. Polar solvents are preferred. Illustrative of these solvents are dimethylformamide (DMF), acetonitrile and N-methylpyrrolidinone. The most preferred solvent is DMF. The amine base and amount of base included in the reaction influence the reaction selectivity and reaction rate. Amine bases as used herein include the following: diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane (DABCO), triethylamine (Et 3 N), diisopropylethylamine, tri n-propylamine, and tri n-butylamine. The preferred amine bases are DABCO and Et 3 N. The most preferred base is DABCO. The reaction is typically run at a temperature which allows the reaction to proceed without producing undesirable quantities of side products. The temperature range is from about 80 to about 120 C., with about 100 C. being preferred. The temperature, time and base which are preferred are dependent upon the starting bis naphthol derivative which is used. When a bis naphthol ditriflate is used as the starting material, the reaction proceeds well using DMF as the solvent and DABCO as the base at a temperature of about 100 C. Generally, the isolated product is crystalline, which is contaminated in minor amounts with a mono-oxide of the formula: The exclusion of oxygen from the reaction tends to minimize the formation of this side product. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the known compound 6-methylnaphthol is reacted to form 6,6-bismethyl-1,1-binaphthol (). The racemic mixture of isomers can be resolved to produce the () and () isomers in substantially pure form. Resolution of bisnaphthol and binaphthyl derivatives above can be accomplished using N-benzyl cinchonidinium chloride in CH 3 CN or EtOAc. The 6,6-bismethyl-1,1-binaphthol (in substantially pure isomeric form or in racemic mixture) can then be reacted with triflic anhydride (Tf 2 O) to produce the bis triflate, which in turn is treated with diphenylphosphine in the presence of a nickel catalyst to produce the 6,6-BINAP derivative. This preferred process is shown in detail below in Flow Sheet A. BINAP derivatives have been useful in the preparation of antibiotics, in particular, carbapenems. In many carbapenem antibiotics, a side chain is present at position 2, which contains a hydroxyalkyl-pyrrolidine group. Such hydroxyl groups can be produced by reacting a carbonyl at the appropriate position with a compound of formula 1. This reaction is typically conducted in an alcoholic solvent, and in the presence of an acid. The invention is further described in connection with the following non-limiting examples. Preparative Example 1 6-Methyl-2-Naphthol React 6-bromo-2-naphthol with t-butyl dimethylsilyl chloride and imidazole, followed by adding n-BuLi and CH 3 I. Deprotect the hydroxyl group by reacting with n-Bu 4 F to produce the title compound. Preparative Example 2 6-Carbomethoxy-2-Naphthol A solution of (A) (22.3 g, 100 mmoL) and Pd(OAc) 2 , (1.12 g, 5 mmol) and dppp (2.00 g, 5 mmol) in degassed DMSO (500 mL), MeOH (150 mL) and diisopropylethylamine (77 mL) is reacted with carbon monoxide at 1.5 ATM/80 C. for 3 days. The reaction solution is diluted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (1.0 L) then washed with water (3500 mL). The aqueous layers are back extracted with EtOAc (0.5 L). The EtOAc layers are concentrated to a brown solid, and purified by recrystallization in hexane to yield the product. Preparative Example 3 7,7-Bis(Methoxy)-2,2-Dihydroxy-1,1-Binaphthyl (()-PE-1) A solution of (D) (10 g, 57.4 mmol) and CuCl 2 (15.44 g, 114.8 mmol) in degassed methanol (350 mL) is stirred while Ar is bubbled through for 15 min. t-butylamine (459 mmol, 150 mL of a 3.08 M freshly prepared solution in MeOH) was added over one hour and the reaction is stirred for 22 hrs. 350 mL of HCl 6 N and 100 mL of HCl 1 N is slowly added and the MeOH evaporated. The residue is taken up in 800 mL of EtOAc and washed with saturated NaHCO 3 (4150 mL), washed with brine and dried over MgSO 4 . The organic layer is concentrated to an oil which is purified by silica gel chromatography using 10% EtOAc/toluene or by crystallization in hexane/toluene (8:2). Preparative Example 4 Using the procedure set forth in Preparative Example 3, the naphol shown in column 1 is reacted to produce the bisnaphthol derivative shown in column 2. TABLE 1 Naphthol derivative Bisnaphthol derivative *Compound isolated by adding water to the solution, whereupon the desired compound formed a precipitate. Coupling reaction required a large excess of t-butylamine (8 eq.) and solvent (CH 3 OH). Due to the insoluble nature of this compound, in almost all solvents except DMSO, the compound was prepared from the BR analog in optically pure form. Alternative Preparative Example 4 Using the procedure set forth in Preparative Example 2, Compound PE-3 can be obtained. Preparative Example 5 Alternative Coupling Reactions The compound in column 1 of Table 2 below can be reacted to form the binaphthyl derivative in column 2 by heating with FeCl 3 .H 2 O (2 eq.) followed by isolation and crystallization.

The reaction was stired for 3 hrs and 300 mL of HCl 1N was added. The aqueous layer was extracted with 800 mL of dichloromethane and the organic layer was washed with saturated NaHCO 3 (2100 mL), washed with brine, dried over MgSO 4 and concentrated to the title compound (12.1 g) as a powder.
