FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a dispersion of a dye in a solvent wherein the dye forms a lyotropic liquid crystalline phase, a method for preparing said dispersions, an imaging element containing said dispersion and a photographic element containing said dispersion. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Radiation-sensitive materials, including light-sensitive materials, such as photographic materials, may utilize filter dyes for a variety of purposes. Filter dyes may be used to adjust the speed of a radiation-sensitive layer; they may be used as absorber dyes to increase image sharpness of a radiation-sensitive layer; they may be used as antihalation dyes to reduce halation; they may be used to reduce the amount or intensity of radiation from reaching one or more radiation-sensitive layers, and they may also be used to prevent radiation of a specific wavelength or range of wavelengths from reaching one or more of the radiation-sensitive layers in a radiation-sensitive element. For each of these uses, the filter dye(s) may be located in any number of layers of a radiation-sensitive element, depending on the specific requirements of the element and the dye, and on the manner in which the element is to be exposed. The amount of filter dyes used varies widely, but they are preferably present in amounts sufficient to alter in some way the response of the element to radiation. Filter dyes may be located in a layer above a radiation-sensitive layer, in a radiation-sensitive layer, in a layer below a radiation-sensitive layer, or in a layer on the opposite side of the support from a radiation-sensitive layer. Photographic materials often contain layers sensitized to different regions of the spectrum, such as red, blue, green, ultraviolet, infrared, X-ray, to name a few. A typical color photographic element contains a layer sensitized to each of the three primary regions of the visible spectrum, i.e., blue, green, and red. Silver halide used in these materials has an intrinsic sensitivity to blue light. Increased sensitivity to blue light, along with sensitivity to green light or red light, is imparted through the use of various sensitizing dyes adsorbed to the silver halide grains. Sensitized silver halide retains its intrinsic sensitivity to blue light. There are numerous applications for which filtration or absorbance of very specific regions of light are highly desirable. Some of these applications, such as yellow filter dyes and magenta trimmer dyes, require non-diffusing dyes which may be coated in a layer-specific manner to prevent specific wavelengths of light from reaching specific layers of the film during exposure. These dyes must have sharp-cutting edges on the bathochromic (long-wavelength) side of the absorbance envelope to prevent light punch through without adversely affecting the speed of the underlying emulsions. In other applications, it is desirable to allow passage of light below a certain wavelength. In these cases it is desirable to have a dye which is very sharp-cutting on the hypsochromic (short-wavelength) edge of the absorbance envelope. Depending on the location of these filter layers relative to the sensitized silver halide emulsion layers, it would also be desirable to have non-diffusing, layer-specific filter dyes with absorption spectra which are sharp-cutting on the hypsochromic edge as well as the bathochromic edge. Such dyes are sometimes known as finger filters. Preferably these dyes should exhibit high extinction coefficients, narrow half bandwidths and sharp cutting hypsochromic and bathochromic absorption envelopes when incorporated into imaging elements including photographic elements. Typically, to achieve these properties, isotropic solutions of dyes have been incorporated. Dyes introduced by this method, however, often wander into adjacent layers causing problems such as speed loss or stain, and cannot be coated in a layer-specific manner without the use of mordants. Solubilized dyes may be mordanted to prevent wandering through adjacent layers. While the use of polymeric mordants can prevent dye wandering, such mordants aggravate the stain problem encountered when the dye remains in the element through processing. Dyes with a high extinction coefficient allow maximum light absorption using a minimum amount of dye. Lower requisite dye laydown reduces the cost of light filtration and produces fewer processing by-products. Lower dye laydowns may also result in reduced dye stain in short duration processes. Finger filters such as described above are highly desirable for other uses such as protecting silver halide sensitized emulsions from exposure by safelights. Such dyes must have absorbance spectra with high extinction coefficients and narrow halfbandwidths, and sharp cutting absorbance envelopes to efficiently absorb light in the narrow safelight-emitting region without adversely affecting the speed of the sensitized silver halide emulsions. This affords protection for the sensitized emulsion from exposure by light in the safelights spectral region. Useful absorbance maxima for safelight dyes include, but are not restricted to 490-510 nm and 590-610 nm. Similar properties are required for infrared absorbing filter dyes. Laser-exposed radiation-sensitive elements require high efficiency light absorbance at the wavelength of laser emission. Unwanted absorbance from broadly absorbing dyes reduces the efficiency of light capture at the laser emission wavelength, and requires the use of larger amounts of dye to adequately cover the desired spectral region. In photographic elements, unwanted absorbance may also cause speed losses in adjacent silver halide sensitized layers if the photographic element has multiple sensitized layers present. Useful finger filter absorbance maxima for absorbing laser and phosphor emissions include but are not restricted to 950 nm, 880 nm, 830 nm, 790 nm, 633 nm, 670 nm, 545 nm and 488 nm. In some radiation sensitive elements, including dry process imaging films, it is necessary to provide light filtration or antihalation at deep cyan and infrared wavelengths. Typically such protection has been achieved using water or solvent soluble dyes or milled solid particle dyes. Typically, water-soluble dyes forming isotropic solutions can provide relatively sharp, high extinction absorbance, but are prone to interlayer wandering. One common use for filter dyes is in silver halide light sensitive photographic elements. If, prior to processing, blue light reaches a layer containing silver halide which has been sensitized to a region of the spectrum other than blue, the silver halide grains exposed to the blue light, by virtue of their intrinsic sensitivity to blue light, would be rendered developable. This would result in a false rendition of the image information being recorded in the photographic element. It is therefore a common practice to include in the photographic element a material that filters blue light. This blue-absorbing material can be located anywhere in the element where it is desirable to filter blue light. In a color photographic element that has layers sensitized to each of the primary colors, it is common to have the blue-sensitized layer closest to the exposure source and to interpose a blue-absorbing, or yellow filter layer between the blue-sensitized layer and the green- and red-sensitized layers. Another common use for filter dyes is to filter or trim portions of the UV, visible or infrared spectral regions to prevent unwanted wavelengths of light from reaching sensitized emulsions. Just as yellow filter dyes prevent false color rendition from the exposure of emulsions sensitized to a region of the spectrum other than blue, filter dyes absorbing in the UV, magenta, cyan and infrared spectral regions can prevent false color rendition by shielding sensitized emulsion layers from exposure to specific wavelength regions. One application of his strategy is the use of green-absorbing magenta trimmer dyes. In one type of typical color photographic element containing a layer sensitized to each of the three primary regions of the visible spectrum, i.e., blue, green, and red, the green-sensitized layer is coated above the red-sensitized layer and below the blue-sensitized layer. Depending on the chosen spectral sensitivity maxima for the sensitized silver halide layers, there may be a region of overlap between the spectral sensitivities of the green and red emulsions. Under such circumstances, green light which is not absorbed by the green-sensitive emulsion can punch through to the red sensitive emulsion and be absorbed by the leading edge of the red spectral sensitizing dye. This crosstalk between the green and red emulsions results in false color rendition. It would, therefore, be highly desirable to find a green-absorbing filter dye which upon incorporation into a photographic element would absorb strongly around the spectral maximum of the green-sensitized emulsion, and possess a sharp cutting bathochromic absorbance such that there is no appreciable absorbance just bathochromic to its absorbance maximum. A sharp-cutting bathochromic edge on a filter or trimmer dye enables excellent color reproduction with minimum speed loss by absorbing light efficiently up to its absorbance maximum, but very little if any just past its absorbance maximum. For example, a yellow filter dye (blue absorber) which is only moderately sharp-cutting on the bathochromic edge may function adequately as a filter dye, but its unwanted absorbance in the green region past its max will rob the green-sensitive emulsion coated below it of green light and hence speed. Though the position of optimal absorption maximum for a magenta trimmer dye will vary depending on the photographic element being constructed, it is particularly desirable in one type of typical color photographic element containing a layer sensitized to each of the three primary regions of the visible spectrum, i.e., blue, green, and red, that a magenta trimmer dye absorb strongly at about 550 nm, and possess a sharp cutting bathochromic absorbance such that there is no appreciable absorbance above about 550 nm. Therefore it would be desirable to provide a filter dye for use in photographic elements that possesses high requisite absorbance in the green region of the spectrum below about 550 nm, but little or no absorbance above about 550 nm, and furthermore does not suffer from incubative or post process stain problems, and furthermore is not prone to migration in the coated film, but is fully removed upon processing. One method used to incorporate solvent or water-soluble filter dyes into photographic film element layers is to add them as aqueous or alcoholic isotropic solutions. Dyes introduced by this method are generally highly mobile and rapidly diffusing and often wander into other layers of the element, usually with deleterious results. While the use of polymeric mordants can prevent dye wandering, such mordants aggravate the stain problem encountered when the dye remains in the element through processing. Filter dyes have also been prepared as conventional dispersions in aqueous gelatin using standard colloid milling or homogenization methods or as loaded latices. More recently, ball-milling, sand-milling, media-milling and related methods of producing fine-particle-size slurries and suspensions of solid filter dyes have become standard tools for producing slurries and dispersions that can readily be used in photographic melt formulations. Solid particle filter dyes introduced as dispersions, when coated at sufficiently low pH, can eliminate problems associated with dye wandering. However, solvent-insoluble solid particle filter dyes (pigments) provide relatively low absorption coefficients, requiring that an excessive amount of dye be coated. In addition, it is very difficult to find classes of solid particle dispersion dyes which consistently yield useful, sharp-cutting bathochromic or hysochromic spectral features due to their microcrystalline nature. In fact the hue of a microcrystalline dye is highly unpredictable and often varies tremendously between similar analogs. In addition many solid particle dyes are not robust under keeping conditions of high heat and humidity experienced in melting and coating operations. Under such conditions, microcrystals of dye can undergo ripening, resulting in a lower optical density post incubation. In addition, the time and expense involved in preparing serviceable solid particle filter dye dispersions by milling techniques are a deterrent to their use, especially in large volume applications. It is therefore desirable to provide dye dispersions that do not necessarily require mechanical milling before use and that do not wander but that wash out easily during processing leaving little or no residual stain. It is also desirable that such filter dye dispersions provide high light absorption efficiencies with sharp-cutting absorbance peaks. One method of obtaining these desirable dye features in solid particle dispersions of oxonol filter dyes was described by Texter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,274,109, U.S. Pat. No. 5,326,687 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,467). Texter describes a process by which pyrazolone oxonol dyes are microprecipitated under strictly controlled pH conditions to produce absorbance spectra which are narrow, bathochromic and sharp cutting on the long wavelength side relative to their corresponding milled solid particle dispersions. This technique, however, is impractical for large volume applications. A specific class of dyes, barbituric acid oxonol dyes, have been disclosed in commonly assigned copending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/565,480 filed Nov. 30, 1995, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,834 to possess sharp-cutting spectral properties when incorporated into gelatin coatings; however no reference is made to suggest that other filter dye classes might possess these useful spectral features. Further, the spectral features of these dyes are limited to a few specific wavelength ranges, and the hue of these sharp-cutting dyes are not tunable over a large useful range. It would be very useful if dye materials were available that were non-wandering, like solid particle dispersions, but were additionally narrowly absorbing and sharp-cutting in spectral features, like fully solvent-soluble dyes, and were additionally available at a wide variety of absorbance maxima useful in imaging elements. PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION It is therefore desirable to have a dye, especially a filter dye, which has a high extinction coefficient, a narrow halfbandwidth, and is sharp cutting on the bathochromic and/or hypsochromic edge, and even more preferably on both the hypsochromic and bathochromic edges. For dyes used in photographic elements, it is additionally desirable that the dye is capable of being substantially completely removed or rendered colorless on process of an exposed radiationsensitive element comprising said dye. It is also desirable that the coated dye be robust in its spectral and physical properties and not prone to migration within the imaging element. It is also desirable to have a method for preparing a dispersion of a filter dye that is suitable for high-volume manufacture. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been discovered that a set of oxonol dye classes may be functionalized with certain substituents, and dispersed in hydrophilic colloids to form lyotropic (solvent-induced) liquid-crystalline dye phases (mesophases). These mesophase-forming dyes possess unique and useful properties superior to those of conventional water or solvent-soluble dyes or solvent-insoluble solid particle dyes with respect to hue, spectral shape, immobility, robustness and process removability. Additionally it has been discovered that for a given dye class, one skilled in the art can optimize dye analogs such that they possess an inherent propensity to form stable liquid-crystalline phases rather than microcrystalline (solid) or isotropic (e.g. solution) phases when dispersed in solvents, including hydrophilic colloids such as aqueous gelatin. Additionally it has been discovered that modifications in the properties of the hydrophilic colloid dye dispersion, such as ionic strength, temperature and pH can improve a given dyes propensity to form a stable liquid-crystalline phase. Additionally it has been discovered that the advantageous spectral and physical properties of the dye liquid crystalline phases formed in the wet hydrophilic colloid (e.g. aqueous gelatin) are largely retained in the dried-down (evaporated) gelatin coatings of an imaging element. This invention relates specifically to amphiphilic dyes, especially filter dyes in photographic elements which are capable of forming practically useful lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases, particularly dyes from the thiphene dioxide oxonol classes. Liquid-crystalline filter dyes afford a host of benefits over conventional state-of-the-art solid particle (microcrystalline)-incorporated dyes or water-soluble (isotropic solution) filter dyes, for photographic imaging applications. Moreover, they provide a combination of spectral and physical properties that is virtually unachievable using either water-soluble or solid particle dyes. The following beneficial spectral and physical properties are inherent to the liquid-crystalline form of the dye. For example, dyes dispersed in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline form exhibit slow collective molecular diffusion (orders of magnitude slower than dye isotropic solution species) affording good layer specificity and immobility, like (microcrystalline) solid particle dyes and unlike unmordanted isotropic solution dyes. Dyes dispersed in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline form exhibit significantly higher extinction coefficients than (microcrystalline) solid particle dyes dispersed at equivalent wet laydowns (concentrations). Dyes dispersed in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline form show processing washout and bleaching rates comparable to, but usually much better than, conventional (microcrystalline) solid particle dyes. Lyotropic liquid-crystalline dye phases are more easily, rapidly and reproducibly formulated than (microcrystalline) solid particle dye phases. Dyes dispersed in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline form, (especially the smectic mesophase form), often exhibit sharper-cutting, more intense spectral absorption features than their (microcrystalline) solid particle counterparts, making them particularly useful as photographic finger filters. Dyes dispersed in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline form often exhibit characteristic bathochromically-shifted excitonic absorption J-bands (sharp, narrow and intense), possessing (long-wavelength) sharp-cutting spectral features, making them particularly useful for many photographic finger-filter applications. So-called J-band (J-aggregate) spectra are not readily afforded by (microcrystalline) solid particle dyes. Dyes dispersed in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline form may also exhibit practically useful hypsochromically-shifted H-band absorption spectra, with (short-wavelength) sharp-cutting spectral features. Dyes dispersed in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline state may also exhibit little or no spectral shift compared with the dyes isotropic solution absorbance state, yet still retain the characteristic immobility of the liquid crystalline phase. The essentially immobile lyotropic liquid-crystalline form (phase) of the preferred amphiphilic filter dyes, exhibiting characteristic and practically useful J-band and H-band absorption spectra, are quite distinct, easily identifiable and readily distinguishable from non-liquid-crystalline (isotropic) rapidly-diffusing dye phases which occasionally exhibit similar absorption spectra. Dyes dispersed in a lyotropic liquid-crystalline state in aqueous, or those dyes passing through a transitory mesophase upon the drying of aqueous gelatin layers, usually retain the useful spectral and physical properties associated with the mesophase in the evaporated (dried-down)state. Dyes initially dispersed as a lyotropic liquid-crystalline form often exhibit good incubation stability in evaporated gelatin layers. This invention comprises a set of oxonol dye classes, derived from thiophene dioxide nuclei, which can form liquid crystals when selectively functionalized as described below. This disclosure further teaches one skilled in the art how to find liquid-crystalline members of a given dye class; it further includes test protocol for determining the presence of a dye mesophase (i.e. liquid crystal phase), and shows the superior features dye liquid crystals possess compared with solid particle dyes or solvent-soluble (solution) dyes. This invention further demonstrates the advantages of dye mesophase properties in imaging elements, especially photographic elements.

Another aspect of the invention comprises a silver halide radiation-sensitive material containing at least one dye in the liquid-crystalline state, dispersed in a hydrophilic colloid layer, which is decolorized by photographic processing and which causes no deleterious effects on the silver halide photographic emulsions before or after processing. A further aspect of the invention comprises a silver halide radiation-sensitive material in which a hydrophilic colloid layer is dyed and exhibits excellent decolorizing properties upon photographic processing. Yet another aspect of the invention comprises a silver halide radiation-sensitive material in which a hydrophilic colloid layer is dyed and exhibits high absorbance in a portion of the spectral region at its absorbance maximum, but possesses comparatively little absorbance around 20 nm above its absorbance maximum. Yet another aspect of the invention comprises a silver halide radiation-sensitive material in which a hydrophilic colloid layer is dyed and exhibits high absorbance in a portion of the spectral region at its absorbance maximum, but possesses comparatively little absorbance around 20 nm below its absorbance maximum. We have now discovered that certain dyes set forth below form stable liquid-crystalline phases when dispersed in wet aqueous media (preferably containing a hydrophilic colloid such as gelatin) and provide the advantages set for in the above objects of the invention. The said liquid-crystalline dye dispersion can be formed by dispersing powdered dye or a milled dye slurry into an aqueous medium, preferably containing gelatin or other hydrophilic colloid, over a specified concentration and temperature range, using the methods set forth herein. One aspect of this invention comprises an aqueous dispersion comprising an aqueous medium having dispersed therein a liquid-crystal forming dye of structural Formula I, II or III: wherein Q 1 and Q 2 represent the non-metallic atoms required to form a substituted or unsubstituted 5 or a 6-membered heterocyclic or carbocyclic ring, preferably a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic or heteroaromatic ring including any fused polycyclic moeity, L 1 to L 7 are substituted or unsubstituted methine groups, (including the possibility of any of them being members of a five or six-membered ring where at least one and preferably more than one of p, q, or r is 1); M is a cation, and p, q and r are independently 0 or 1.; or a liquid-crystal forming dye of Formula II: wherein R 1 to R 4 each individually represent amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, hydroxy, alkylthio, halogen, cyano, alkylsulfone, arylsulfone, or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, or aralkyl, and L 1 to L 7 , M , and p, q and r are defined as described above for Formula I; or preferably a liquid-crystal forming dye of Formula III: wherein R 5 to R 12 each independently represents hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, or cycloalkyl; alkenyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, heteroaryl or aralkyl; alkylthio, hydroxy, hydroxylate, alkoxy, amino, alkylamino, halogen, cyano, nitro, carboxy, acyl, alkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, sulfonamido, sulfamoyl, or groups containing solubilizing substituents as described above for Y. Any adjacent pair of substituents among R 5 through R 12 may together form a fused carbocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic or aliphatic ring.

Useful dye include those absorbing in the UV region (below 400 nm), the visible region (400-700 nm), and the infrared region (above 700 nm). Another preferred embodiment of the invention comprises an imaging element containing a liquid crystal-forming dye of structural Formula I, II, or III. Still another preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a radiation-sensitive element, such as a photographic element, containing a liquid-crystal forming dye of structural Formula 1, II or III. Yet another preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a method of preparing a liquid-crystalline dye dispersion which comprises adding a dye of structural Formulae I-III to an aqueous medium at a temperature of from about 2 C. to about 100 C. and agitating the mixture for about 5 minutes to about 48 hours. ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION This invention provides a dye, useful as a filter dye or light-absorbing compound in an imaging element, and especially in a radiation-sensitive element, such as a photographic element, which when dispersed in an aqueous medium, for example aqueous gelatin, dissolves then spontaneously forms a lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase which constitutes an unusually well-ordered and thermodynamically stable dye state. A dye in the liquid-crystalline state often possesses a coated max which is substantially bathochromic or hypsochromic to that of its monomeric isotropic solution (non-liquid crystalline) state and exhibits exceptionally high covering power at its coating max , Further, the liquid-crystalline dye phase often exhibits sharp-cutting bathochromic and/or hypsochromic spectral features absorbing strongly at its coating max , while absorbing comparatively little light at wavelengths just below or just above its absorbance maximum. Further, the liquid-crystalline dye phase often possesses an unusually narrow halfbandwidth. The dyes of this invention can be formulated for incorporation into a photographic element using, for example, conventional ball-mill or media-mill procedures for producing dye dispersions (SPDs), or more simply as direct gelatin dispersions (DGDs) for incorporation in a photographic element, as discussed more fully below. In the photographic element, dyes in the spontaneously-formed liquid-crystalline state exhibit little, if any tendency to wander, and upon processing many are substantially free of post-process stain problems.

Such techniques are further illustrated, for example, in The Cyanine Dyes and Related Compounds , Frances Hamer, Interscience Publishers, 1964. The liquid-crystalline dye dispersions of this invention may be prepared by well-known methods commonly employed for preparing solid particle dye dispersions. Here, a slurry of the dye in an aqueous medium comprising water and a surfactant or water-soluble polymer is subjected to a milling procedure such as ball-milling, sand-milling, media-milling or colloid-milling (preferably media-milling). The dye slurry can then be mixed with aqueous gelatin at an appropriate concentration (preferably 30% w/w) and at a temperature (preferably 20 to 90 C.)for use in a photographic element. In another preferred embodiment, the liquid-crystalline dye dispersions of this invention may be prepared using a direct gelatin dispersion (DGD) method wherein the finely powdered dye or aqueous slurry thereof is simply mixed or agitated with water or with an aqueous medium containing gelatin (or other hydrophilic colloid) at an appropriate concentration (preferably 30% w/w) and at a temperature (preferably 0 to 100 C.). In either of the preferred methods, the dyes may be subjected to elevated temperatures before and/or after gelatin dispersion, but to obtain desirable results, this heat treatment is carried out preferably after dispersing in gelatin. The optimal temperature range for preparing gelatin-based dispersions is 20 C.-100 C., depending on the concentration of the gelatin, but should remain below the decomposition points of the dyes, and, preferably for the range of 5 minutes to 48 hours. A similar heat treatment may be applied, if so desired, to dyes prepared by milling methodsas solid particle dispersions before and/or after dispersion in aqueous gelatin to obtain effective results. Furthermore, if so desired, pH and/or ionic strength and solvent composition adjustments, for example, may be utilized to control the solubility and liquid crystal-forming properties of dyes prepared using SPD or DGD formulation techniques. The direct gelatin dispersion method is advantageous in that it does not necessarily require the use of organic solvents, surfactants, polymer additives, electrolytes, milling processes, pH control or the like. It is generally simpler, faster, more forgiving and more flexible than milling processes. A related method described by Boettcher for preparing concentrated sensitizing dye dispersions in aqueous gelatin (PCT WO 93/23792) is equally effective when applied to the inventive dyes. The entire disclosure of WO 93/23792 is incorporated herein by reference. The inventive lyotropic liquid-crystalline dye dispersions may be incorporated directly into imaging elements. Solid particle dispersion and direct gelatin dispersion formulations of the compound of Formula (I-III) are useful as general purpose filter dyes, alone or in combination with other filter dyes in photographic elements. The dyes formulated as described above possess a pronounced tendency to form liquid crystal phases spontaneously at a variety of pHs, including typical coating pHs of 6 or less (generally 4-6) such that they do not substantially wander from the layer in which they are coated. However, they are highly soluble at processing pHs of 8 or more (generally 8-12), such that they are often still fully removed during photographic processing. Our invention comprises a set of oxonol dye classes which are functionalized to form liquid crystalline phases in solvents, especially water, and hydrophilic colloids such as aqueous gelatin. These materials would be especially useful as filter dyes in photographic systems as described above, as spectral sensitizers, and in non-photographic imaging applications such as inkjet, barcoding, and thermally-developed imaging systems. There are few teachings addressing dye lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases. Additionally, no teachings are provided that would enable one skilled in the art to design and synthesize dyes capable of forming liquid crystals or to influence their formation in imaging elements. For most materials, it is generally accepted that only three states of matter exist; namely, solids, liquids and gases. However, some materials exhibit a fourth state of matter commonly referred to as a liquid crystal phase (or mesophase). Liquid crystal phases are neither crystalline solids nor isotropic liquids, but exhibit some of the characteristics of both. A liquid crystal phase can be described simply as being a liquid with a certain degree of molecular order. As described below, this molecular order gives rise to measurable anisotropy in the bulk properties of a material that is otherwise much like a liquid. Consequently, the physical properties of liquid-crystalline materials are unique and distinct from those of solids and liquids. These differences can be utilized to advantage in the formulation of photographic elements and also allow detection of the liquid crystal phase by a variety of optical and spectroscopic techniques. Liquid crystals can be classified as thermotropic or lyotropic. The dye compositions of the current invention are of the lyotropic type, however, for puposes of comparision, we first give a brief description the thermotropic type: Some crystalline compounds do not yield an isotropic liquid immediately upon melting, instead, the newly formed melt is a liquid crystal phase (mesophase). In the simple cases, further heating results in the formation of an ordinary isotropic liquid. The phase that exists above the melting point of the crystalline solid but below the formation temperature for the isotropic liquid is known as a thermotropic liquid crystal phase. In some cases, heating the initally formed mesophase does not result in an isotropic liquid, but rather, to one or more intermediate liquid crystal phases, and finally, the last formed of these, upon further heating, yields the isotropic liquid. All of the mesophases formed in this way are conventionally classified as thermotropic. The term thermotropic liquid crystal is also extended to include eutectic mixtures of compounds. Thermotropic liquid crystals are generally colorless organic materials and are typically hydrophobic (water-insoluble) in character. They are commonly employed in electro-optical display devices, for example digital watches and calculators. In contrast, spontaneous formation of lyotropic liquid crystals can be achieved at a fixed temperature by simple addition of a solvent to a suitable solute (mesogen). The solvent is typically (but not necessarily) water and lyotropic mesophases are stable over finite ranges of both concentration and temperature. Typical lyotropic mesogens are amphiphilic. The term amphiphilic acknowledges that both hydrophobic groups (e.g. aliphatic, aromatic, etc.) and hydrophilic groups (e.g. CO 2 M , SO 3 M , SO 4 M , O(CH 2 CH 2 O) x , etc.) are present on the same molecule. Examples include, surfactants, lipids, polymers, dyes, and drugs. The amphiphilic nature and the specific hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance (HHB) of these molecules influences their tendency to form lyotropic mesophases. The structural type(s) and stability with respect to concentration and temperature of the liquid crystalline phase(s) formed are highly mesogen-dependent. For example, Koll et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,309,183, Jan. 5, 1982) teach how a lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase of a particular anionic azo reactive dyestuff can be prepared in water at room temperature and dye concentrations of 12-35%, for the specific use of dyeing and printing natural and synthetic substrates. However, no reference to such dyes for use in imaging elements has been reported. It is part of the purpose of this invention to demonstrate thatthiophene dioxide oxonol chromophores can and do form lyotropic liquid crystals upon suitable manipulation of substituents. It is a further purpose of this work to provide some examples of substituent combinations that are effective in trasforming a quite ordinary set of oxonol dyes classes, that is to say, dye classes for which mesophases have never been reported, into photographically useful lyotropic mesogens. In the preferred embodiment, the amphiphilic filter dye will form any liquid-crystalline phase upon dispersing said dye in the hydrophilic solvent medium, typically, but not limited to, water or aqueous gelatin, at the wet laydown (dye concentration) and temperature of choice (preferably 30% w/w dye, more preferably 10% w/w dye, even more preferably 5% w/w dye and most preferably 0.5% w/w dye, between 0 C. and 100 C.). In the most preferred embodiment, said dye mesophase will possess a layered smectic structure, and in another preferred embodiment the dye mesophase will possess a nematic or hexagonal structure. We have discovered that the liquid-crystalline phase stability of lyotropic amphiphilic (particularly ionic) filter dyes may also be sensitive to the presence of addenda such as gelatin of different types, polymers, organic solvents (such as alcohols, acetone etc.) and surfactants. For example, low-levels of common electrolytes can stabilize ionic dye mesophase formation. Enhanced mesophase stability of ionic filter dyes (with respect to both temperature and concentration) may be realized simply by the judicious choice of photographic gelatin (e.g. so-called regular, deionized or decalcified gelatin grades) which contain different levels and types of electrolyte cations and anions (e.g. calcium, magnesium, sodium, chloride, sulphate etc.) as a by-product of gelatin manufacture. Similarly, the use of non-deionized water or the addition of low salt levels to purified (deionized or distilled) water, can afford enhanced mesophase stability for certain ionic filter dyes. The preferred dyes of this invention are chosen to exhibit stable lyotropic mesophases under the practical conditions generally employed for their formulation, dispersion, coating and drying. It is understood that someone skilled in the art of dyes could, with the guidance provided in this disclosure, systematically optimize dye structure and/or solvent conditions to enhance and control dye mesophase formation and stability for a suitable mesogen-solvent combination. Since mesophase formation is both concentration and temperature dependent, it is understood that some of the preferred amphiphilic filter dyes may initially form an isotropic solution phase which will undergo a transition to a more concentrated and thermally-stable mesophase during the drying process (thermal stability of dye mesophases invariably increases with dye mesophase concentration). Some of the preferred amphiphilic filter dyes initially dispersed in the wet hydrophilic colloid medium (e.g. aqueous gelatin) as a dilute liquid-crystalline dye phase, may remain wholly liquid-crystalline upon drying or undergo a (for example, concentration-dependent or ionic strength-dependent) reversible transition from the liquid-crystalline state to a crystalline, semi-crystalline, or amorphous solid dye state, or a mixture thereof, during the drying process. However, we have found that in such instances the preferred dyes still largely retain the useful spectral and physical properties associated with the originally dispersed dilute dye mesophase (e.g. absorption envelope providing good covering power, layer specificity, incubation stability, rapid processing elution and or bleachability). The final physical form of the gelatin-dispersed dye (liquid-crystalline, crystalline, amorphous solid) will depend on the precise phase behaviour of said dye in relation to the retained moisture (water) content of the evaporated (dried-down) gelatin film under given conditions of temperature and humidity and the presence of other solutes. However, according to the invention, dyes which remain liquid crystalline when formulated and dispersed in the photographic vehicle, or those which pass through a transitory liquid-crystalline phase at any stage during the subsequent coating and drying process, will afford the useful and unique combination of both spectral and physical properties, described herein. It should be emphasized that reference in this disclosure to evaporated or dried coatings refers to coatings of wet aqueous gelatin melts from which excess water or solvent has been allowed to evaporate or has been removed by drying processes, but which still retain an equilibrium moisture level typical of finished imaging elements especially photographic imaging elements. According to the invention, the preferred dye chromophores must possess some added degree of hydrophilicity, imparted by ionic, zwitterionic or nonionic solubilizing groups, to be capable of forming lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases in aqueous-based media. Similarly, if so desired, for non-aqueous (e.g. organic) solvent applications, the dye should possess additional hydrophobic, rather than hydrophilic, solubilizing moieties, such as branched aliphatic chains. Common mesophase structural types, such as layered smectic (e.g. lamellar), columnar hexagonal and nematic, which possess varying degrees of orientational translational molecular order, may be formed by many diverse and disparate lyotropic mesogens. Because of the inherent ordered nature of these anisotropic, thermodynamically stable, supramolecular structures, experimental techniques including, for example, small-angle X-ray (or neutron) scattering, polarized-light optical microscopy and quadrupole (e.g. 23 Na, 2 H, 17 O, 14 N etc.) NMR spectroscopy may be routinely applied to identifying and characterizing the structure and physico-chemical properties of lyotropic mesophases. According to the invention, the preferred dyes can be readily identified using the technique of polarized-light optical microscopy (as described by N. H. Hartshorne in, The Microscopy of Liquid Crystals, Microscope Publications Ltd., London, England, 1974). In order to ascertain the exact quantitative mesophase behaviour of a given dye-solvent combination, a range of sample mixtures of known composition are prepared (typically dyes dissolved in aqueous gelatin) and viewed in polarized light as wet thin films (contained within sealed glass capillary cells of known pathlength) and slowly-evaporated thin films (hand-coated onto glass microscope slides and air-dried) to establish the precise concentration and temperature ranges of dye mesophase stability. These same thin-film preparations may also be used to elucidate and quantify the spectral absorption properties of the dye mesophase, such as absorption wavelength, bandwidth, extinction coefficient etc. using a uv-vis spectrophotometer. Simple observations of the characteristic birefringent type-textures and rheology (flow behaviour under shear) displayed by thin-film mesophase preparations in polarized light are usually sufficient to establish the mesophase structural type (e.g. smectic, nematic, hexagonal depending upon the specific long-range inter-aggregate ordering) as a function of solute-solvent concentration and temperature. Dyes forming lyotropic chromonic nematic mesophases may be identified from a range of fluid, viscoelastic textures including so-called Schlieren, Tiger-Skin, Reticulated, Homogeneous (Planar), Thread-like, Droplet and Homeotropic (Pseudoisotropic). Lyotropic chromonic hexagonal mesophases usually display viscous, birefringent Herringbone, Ribbon or Fan-like textures while lyotropic chromonic smectic mesophases may display Grainy-Mosaic, Frond-like (Pseudo-Schlieren), Spherulitic and Oily-Streak birefringent textures. In some cases where the liquid-crystalline nature of the sample cannot be established unequivocally using polarized-light optical microscopy other well-established experimental techniques may be utilized. For example, lyotropic mesophases exhibit characteristic quadrupole NMR spectroscopy lineshapes and quadrupole splittings, while small-angle and wide-angle X-ray (or neutron) diffraction measurements provide unique and characteristic structured diffraction patterns (refer to Liquid Crystals and Plastic Crystals, eds. G. W. Gray P. A. Winsor, Ellis Horwood Ltd., Chichester, UK, 1974, Vols. 1 and 2). Such phase-dependent properties may be used to differentiate, for example, a liquid-crystalline filter dye dispersion from a conventional microcrystalline (ie.solid) filter dye dispersion. A particular advantage of the inventive dyes is that in the liquid crystalline state, they provide higher covering power at their coating max than comparable known dyes which are insoluble and exist as microcrystalline solid particles in the photographic medium. This advantage is particularly important in modern film formats and processing conditions, as filter dyes with high covering power need not be coated at as high a coverage as dyes with lower covering power in order to achieve the same degree of light filtration. In addition to reducing manufacturing costs, lower levels of coated dyes will reduce the level of unwanted dye stain in the processed photographic element, and will reduce the level of dye residue built up in the processing solutions, and the resulting lower levels of dissolved dye residue removed from photographic elements will have reduced environmental impact. A further advantage of dyes of the invention is that they generally possess absorbance envelopes that are sharper cutting on the bathochromic side than typical solid particle dyes. This feature is especially advantageous when strong light absorbance is required in a spectral region up to a specific max and maximum light transmission is required past the specified max . Such filter or trimmer dyes are especially useful when coated in specific layers of color photographic films to effectively prevent light of a specific wavelength region from exposing radiation-sensitive layers below the light filtration layer containing the dye, but without causing speed losses in the layer below the filter dye. A green filter dye coated directly above a red-sensitive silver halide layer is a particularly advantageous example of such absorbance features, and excellent green/red speed separation can be realized. A sharp-cutting bathochromic edge on a filter or trimmer dye enables excellent color reproduction with minimum speed loss by absorbing light efficiently up to its absorbance maximum, but very little if any just past its absorbance maximum. A magenta trimmer dye (green absorber) which is only moderately sharp-cutting on the bathochromic edge may function adequately as a filter dye, but its unwanted absorbance in the red region past its max will rob the red-sensitive emulsion coated below it of red light and hence speed.In a typical color photographic element, it is desirable to have a green-absorbing filter dye which when coated absorbs strongly at wavelengths close to 550 nm, but which absorbs comparatively little at wavelengths greater than 550 nm. It should be emphasized that the exact envelope of desirable light absorbance for a filter dye, even specifically a green filter dye, varies tremendously from one photographic element to another depending on the intended purpose of the material. Some photographic elements might require a filter dye, such as a green filter dye, which absorbs strongly up to a wavelength somewhat shorter or longer than 550 nm, but is sharp cutting on the bathochromic side, mostly transmitting wavelengths of light past the desired absorbance max . The feature of coated dye absorbance exhibiting a sharp cutting bathochromic and/or hypsochromic characteristic is fundamentally useful for wavelength-specific light filtration, though the exact wavelength of desired spectral shift from absorbance to transmission may be different for different photographic materials. A further advantage of the dyes of the invention is that in the liquid crystalline state, many are much sharper absorbing than in their dissolved isotropic solution state, that is, they possess a much narrower halfbandwidth. Furthermore, unlike a dye in the dissolved, isotropic solution state, the dye in the liquid-crystalline state is essentially immobile and not prone to gross diffusion and thus can be coated layer specifically. The dyes may be located in any layer of the element where it is desirable to absorb light, but in photographic elements it is particularly advantageous to locate them in a layer where they will be solubilized and washed out during processing. Useful amounts of dye range from 1 to 1000 mg/m 2 . The dye should be present in an amount sufficient to yield an optical density at the absorbance D max in the spectral region of interest before processing of at least 0.10 density units and preferably at least 0.50 density units. This optical density will generally be less than 5.0 density units for most photographic applications. The dyes of the invention can be used as interlayer dyes, trimmer dyes, antihalation dyes or light-absorbing elements. They can be used to prevent crossover in X-ray materials as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,900,652 and 4,803,150 and European Patent Application Publication No. 0 391 405, to prevent unwanted light from reaching a sensitive emulsion layer of a multicolor photographic element as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,988,611, and for other uses as indicated by the absorbance spectrum of the particular dye. The dyes can be used in a separate filter layer or as an intergrain absorber. The liquid crystal-forming dyes of Formula (I-III) are useful for the preparation of radiation sensitive materials. Such materials are sensitive to radiation such as visible light, ultraviolet, infrared, or X-ray. The liquid crystal-forming dyes of Formula (I-III) are also useful in non-photographic imaging elements such as thermally-developable elements, or as dye materials for inkjet applications. The non-photographic imaging material may be an optical recording medium, such as a CD or other medium sensitive to a laser, light-emitting diode, or a thermally-developable material. Another aspect of this invention comprises a radiation sensitive element containing a liquid crystal-forming dye of Formula (I-III). Preferably, the radiation sensitive element is a photographic element comprising a support bearing at least one light sensitive hydrophilic colloid layer and at least one other hydrophilic colloid layer. A dye of Formula I-III may be incorporated in a hydrophilic layer of the photographic element in any known way. The support of the element of the invention can be any of a number of well-known supports for photographic elements as discussed more fully below. The photographic elements made by the method of the present invention can be single color elements or multicolor elements. Multicolor elements contain dye image-forming units sensitive to each of the three primary regions of the spectrum. Each unit can be comprised of a single emulsion layer or of multiple emulsion layers sensitive to a given region of the spectrum. The layers of the element, including the layers of the image-forming units, can be arranged in various orders as known in the art. In an alternative format, the emulsions sensitive to each of the three primary regions of the spectrum can be disposed as a single segmented layer. A typical multicolor photographic element comprises a support bearing a cyan dye image-forming unit comprised of at least one red-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer having associated therewith at least one cyan dye-forming coupler, a magenta dye image-forming unit comprising at least one green-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer having associated therewith at least one magenta dye-forming coupler, and a yellow dye image-forming unit comprising at least one blue-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer having associated therewith at least one yellow dye-forming coupler. The element can contain additional layers, such as filter layers, interlayers, overcoat layers, subbing layers, and the like. All of these can be coated on a support which can be transparent or reflective (for example, a paper support). Photographic elements of the present invention may also usefully include a magnetic recording material as described in Research Disclosure , Item 34390, November 1992, or a transparent magnetic recording layer such as a layer containing magnetic particles on the underside of a transparent support as in U.S. Pat. No. 4,279,945 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,523. The element typically will have a total thickness (excluding the support) of from 5 to 30 microns. While the order of the color sensitive layers can be varied, they will normally be red-sensitive, green-sensitive and blue-sensitive, in that order on a transparent support, (that is, blue sensitive furthest from the support) and the reverse order on a reflective support being typical. The present invention also contemplates the use of photographic elements of the present invention in what are often referred to as single use cameras (or film with lens units). These cameras are sold with film preloaded in them and the entire camera is returned to a processor with the exposed film remaining inside the camera Such cameras may have glass or plastic lenses through which the photographic element is exposed. In the following discussion of suitable materials for use in elements of this invention, reference will be made to Research Disclosure , September 1996, Number 389, Item 38957, which will be identified hereafter by the term Research Disclosure I. The Sections hereafter referred to are Sections of the Research Disclosure I unless otherwise indicated. All Research Disclosures referenced are published by Kenneth Mason Publications, Ltd., Dudley Annex, 12a North Street, Emsworth, Hampshire P010 7DQ, ENGLAND. The foregoing references and all other references cited in this application, are incorporated herein by reference. The silver halide emulsions employed in the photographic elements of the present invention may be negative-working, such as surface-sensitive emulsions or unfogged internal latent image forming emulsions, or positive working emulsions of internal latent image forming emulsions (that are either fogged in the element or fogged during processing). Suitable emulsions and their preparation as well as methods of chemical and spectral sensitization are described in Sections I through V. Color materials and development modifiers are described in Sections V through XX. Vehicles which can be used in the photographic elements are described in Section II, and various additives such as brighteners, antifoggants, stabilizers, light absorbing and scattering materials, hardeners, coating aids, plasticizers, lubricants and matting agents are described, for example, in Sections VI through XIII. Manufacturing methods are described in all of the sections, layer arrangements particularly in Section XI, exposure alternatives in Section XVI, and processing methods and agents in Sections XIX and XX. With negative working silver halide a negative image can be formed. Optionally a positive (or reversal) image can be formed although a negative image is typically first formed. The photographic elements of the present invention may also use colored couplers (e.g., to adjust levels of interlayer correction) and masking couplers such as those described in EP 213 490; Japanese Published Application 58-172,647; U.S. Pat. No. 2,983,608; German Application DE 2,706,117C; U.K. Patent 1,530,272; Japanese Application A-113935; U.S. Pat. No. 4,070,191 and German Application DE 2,643,965. The masking couplers may be shifted or blocked. The photographic elements may also contain materials that accelerate or otherwise modify the processing steps of bleaching or fixing to improve the quality of the image. Bleach accelerators described in EP 193 389; EP 301 477; U.S. Pat. No. 4,163,669; U.S. Pat. No. 4,865,956; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,923,784 are particularly useful.

No. 4,912,025); antifogging and anti color-mixing agents such as derivatives of hydroquinones, aminophenols, amines, gallic acid; catechol; ascorbic acid; hydrazides; sulfonamidophenols; and non color-forming couplers. The elements may also contain filter dye layers comprising colloidal silver sol or yellow and/or magenta filter dyes and/or antihalation dyes (particularly in an undercoat beneath all light sensitive layers or in the side of the support opposite that on which all light sensitive layers are located) formulated either as oil-in-water dispersions, latex dispersions, solid particle dispersions, or as direct gelatin dispersions. Additionally, they may be used with smearing couplers (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,366,237; EP 096 570; U.S. Pat. No. 4,420,556; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,543,323.) Also, the couplers may be blocked or coated in protected form as described, for example, in Japanese Application 61/258,249 or U.S. Pat. No. 5,019,492. The photographic elements may further contain other image-modifying compounds such as Developer Inhibitor-Releasing compounds (DIRs).

The silver halide used in the photographic elements may be silver iodobromide, silver bromide, silver chloride, silver chlorobromide, silver chloroiodobromide, and the like. For example, the silver halide used in the photographic elements of the present invention may contain at least 90% silver chloride or more (for example, at least 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% silver chloride). In the case of such high chloride silver halide emulsions, some silver bromide may be present but typically substantially no silver iodide. Substantially no silver iodide means the iodide concentration would be no more than 1%, and preferably less than 0.5 or 0.1%. In particular, in such a case the possibility is also contemplated that the silver chloride could be treated with a bromide source to increase its sensitivity, although the bulk concentration of bromide in the resulting emulsion will typically be no more than about 2 to 2.5% and preferably between about 0.6 to 1.2% (the remainder being silver chloride). The foregoing % figures are mole %. The type of silver halide grains preferably include polymorphic, cubic, and octahedral. The grain size of the silver halide may have any distribution known to be useful in photographic compositions, and may be either polydipersed or monodispersed. Tabular grain silver halide emulsions may also be used. Tabular grains are those with two parallel major faces each clearly larger than any remaining grain face and tabular grain emulsions are those in which the tabular grains account for at least 30 percent, more typically at least 50 percent, preferably 70 percent and optimally 90 percent of total grain projected area. The tabular grains can account for substantially all (97 percent) of total grain projected area. The tabular grain emulsions can be high aspect ratio tabular grain emulsionsi.e., ECD/t8, where ECD is the diameter of a circle having an area equal to grain projected area and t is tabular grain thickness; intermediate aspect ratio tabular grain emulsionsi.e., ECD/t5 to 8; or low aspect ratio tabular grain emulsionsi.e., ECD/t2 to 5. The emulsions typically exhibit high tabularity (T), where T (i.e., ECD/t 2 )25 and ECD and t are both measured in micrometers (mm). The tabular grains can be of any thickness compatible with achieving an aim average aspect ratio andlor average tabularity of the tabular grain emulsion. Preferably the tabular grains satisfying projected area requirements are those having thicknesses of 0.3 mm, thin (0.2 mm) tabular grains being specifically preferred and ultrathin (0.07 mm) tabular grains being contemplated for maximum tabular grain performance enhancements. When the native blue absorption of iodohalide tabular grains is relied upon for blue speed, thicker tabular grains, typically up to 0.5 mm in thickness, are contemplated. High iodide tabular grain emulsions are illustrated by House U.S. Pat. No. 4,490,458, Maskasky U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,353 and Yagi et al EPO 0 410 410. Tabular grains formed of silver halide(s) that form a face centered cubic (rock salt type) crystal lattice structure can have either 100 or 111 major faces. Emulsions containing 111 major face tabular grains, including those with controlled grain dispersities, halide distributions, twin plane spacing, edge structures and grain dislocations as well as adsorbed 111 grain face stabilizers, are illustrated in those references cited in Research Disclosure I , Section I.B.(3) (page 503). The silver halide grains to be used in the invention may be prepared according to methods known in the art, such as those described in Research Disclosure I and James, The Theory of the Photographic Process . These include methods such as ammoniacal emulsion making, neutral or acidic emulsion making, and others known in the art. These methods generally involve mixing a water soluble silver salt with a water soluble halide salt in the presence of a protective colloid, and controlling the temperature, pAg, pH values, etc, at suitable values during formation of the silver halide by precipitation. The silver halide to be used in the invention may be advantageously subjected to chemical sensitization with noble metal (for example, gold) sensitizers, middle chalcogen (for example, sulfur) sensitizers, reduction sensitizers and others known in the art. Compounds and techniques useful for chemical sensitization of silver halide are known in the art and described in Research Disclosure I and the references cited therein. The photographic elements of the present invention, as is typical, provide the silver halide in the form of an emulsion. Photographic emulsions generally include a vehicle for coating the emulsion as a layer of a photographic element. Useful vehicles include both naturally occurring substances such as proteins, protein derivatives, cellulose derivatives (e.g., cellulose esters), gelatin (e.g., alkali-treated gelatin such as cattle bone or hide gelatin, or acid treated gelatin such as pigskin gelatin), gelatin derivatives (e.g., acetylated gelatin, phthalated gelatin, and the like), and others as described in Research Disclosure I . Also useful as vehicles or vehicle extenders are hydrophilic water-permeable colloids. These include synthetic polymeric peptizers, carriers, and/or binders such as poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(vinyl lactams), acrylamide polymers, polyvinyl acetals, polymers of alkyl and sulfoalkyl acrylates and methacrylates, hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetates, polyamides, polyvinyl pyridine, methacrylamide copolymers, and the like, as described in Research Disclosure I . The vehicle can be present in the emulsion in any amount useful in photographic emulsions. The emulsion can also include any of the addenda known to be useful in photographic emulsions. These include chemical sensitizers, such as active gelatin, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, gold, platinum, palladium, iridium, osmium, rhenium, phosphorous, or combinations thereof. Chemical sensitization is generally carried out at pAg levels of from 5 to 10, pH levels of from 5 to 8, and temperatures of from 30 to 80 C., as described in Research Disclosure I , Section IV (pages 510-511) and the references cited therein. The silver halide may be sensitized by sensitizing dyes by any method known in the art, such as described in Research Disclosure I . The dye may be added to an emulsion of the silver halide grains and a hydrophilic colloid at any time prior to (e.g., during or after chemical sensitization) or simultaneous with the coating of the emulsion on a photographic element. The dyes may, for example, be added as a solution in water or an alcohol. The dye/silver halide emulsion may be mixed with a dispersion of color image-forming coupler immediately before coating or in advance of coating (for example, 2 hours). Photographic elements of the present invention are preferably imagewise exposed using any of the known techniques, including those described in Research Disclosure I , section XVI. This typically involves exposure to light in the visible region of the spectrum, and typically such exposure is of a live image through a lens, although exposure can also be exposure to a stored image (such as a computer stored image) by means of light emitting devices (such as light emitting diodes, CRT and the like). Photographic elements comprising the composition of the invention can be processed in any of a number of well-known photographic processes utilizing any of a number of well-known processing compositions, described, for example, in Research Disclosure I , or in T. H. James, editor, The Theory of the Photographic Process , 4th Edition, Macmillan, New York, 1977. In the case of processing a negative working element, the element is treated with a color developer (that is one which will form the colored image dyes with the color couplers), and then with a oxidizer and a solvent to remove silver and silver halide. In the case of processing a reversal color element, the element is first treated with a black and white developer (that is, a developer which does not form colored dyes with the coupler compounds) followed by a treatment to fog silver halide (usually chemical fogging or light fogging), followed by treatment with a color developer. Preferred color developing agents are p-phenylenediamines. Especially preferred are: 4-amino N,N-diethylaniline hydrochloride, 4-amino-3-methyl-N,N-diethylaniline hydrochloride, 4-amino-3-methyl-N-ethyl-N-(b-(methanesulfonamido) ethylaniline sesquisulfate hydrate, 4-amino-3-methyl-N-ethyl-N-(b-hydroxyethyl)aniline sulfate, 4-amino-3-b-(methanesulfonamido)ethyl-N,N-diethylaniline hydrochloride and 4-amino-N-ethyl-N-(2-methoxyethyl)-m-toluidine di-p-toluene sulfonic acid. Development is followed by bleach-fixing, to remove silver or silver halide, washing and drying. Synthesis of Dye 1-1A 6-chloro-benzothiophene dioxide (10 g, 46.3 mmol)and diethoxymethylacetate (7.5 g, 46.3 mmol)were suspended in 150 ml acetonitrile at 25C. Triethylamine (14 g, 139 mmol) was added over 5 min producing a golden yellow solution which was stirred 60 min. The dye solution was poured into excess diethyl ether and the resulting solid was collected by filtration. Isolated 10.7 g (87%) of the dye as a yellow solid. All analytical data were consistent with the structure. Synthesis of Dye 2-1A 6-chloro-benzothiophene dioxide (10 g, 46.3 mmol)and trimethoxypropene (6.1 g, 46.3 mmol) were suspended in 200 ml ethanol at 25C. Triethylamine (14 g, 139 mmol) was added over 5 min. The mixture was heated to reflux and held for 30 min. A red solid precipitated from the hot reaction mixture. The mixture was then allowed to cool to 25 C., and the precipitated dye was collected by filtration and washed with ethanol. The collected solid was suspended in 100 mL acetonitrilel and heated to reflux while 1 mL concentrated HCl was added over 5min. The resulting slurry was heated at reflux for 10 min, then allowed to cool to 25 C. The dye was collected by filtration, washed with acetonitrile and dried. Isolated 7.8 g (72%) of Dye 2-1A as a red/orange solid. All analytical data were consistent with the structure. EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLES Formulation A: Solid Particle Dispersion (SPD) Formulation Procedure Step 1 Dyes were formulated as aqueous dye by ball-milling according to the following procedure. Water (22.0 g) and a 10.0% solution of Triton X-200, an alkyl aryl polyether sulfonate surfactant available from Rohm and Haas, (1.0 g) were placed in a 120 mL screw-capped bottle. A 1.0 g sample of dye was added to this solution. Zirconium oxide beads (60 mL, 1.8 mm diameter) were added and the container with the cap tightly secured was placed in a mill and the contents milled for four days. The resulting mixture was then filtered to remove the zirconium oxide beads. The resulting aqueous dye slurries were dispersed into gelatin as described in Step 2. Step 2 Aqueous gelatin dispersions of the above dye slurries (step 1) were prepared as follows. The vessel containing the dye slurry was removed and a known weight of dye slurry was added to a 12.5% aqueous gelatin solution (18.0 g) at 45-80 C. This mixture was then diluted with water to a weight of 88.87 g., yielding the final dye dispersion. In the subsequent experimental sections gelatin containing dye dispersions prepared in this manner will be referred to as Formulation A. The term SPD is used throughout simply to denote dye dispersions which have been formulated using well known milling techniques normally used for preparing solid particle microcrystalline dye dispersions. This does not imply that the physical state of the dye prepared in this manner is microcrystalline in nature. The dispersions described above may be prepared at a wide variety of dye concentrations ranging from 0.005-30% w/w. The most commonly employed concentrations were 0.01-0.30% dye. Formulation B: Direct Gelatin Dispersion (DGD) Formulation Procedure Nominally 2.000 g H 2 O then 0.12500 g deionized gelatin were weighed into screw-topped glass vials and allowed to soak at 25 C. for at least 30 minutes. The swollen gelatin was then melted at 50 C. for 15 minutes with agitation. The gelatin solution was cooled to 25 C., then refrigerated at 5 C. to set. Nominally 2.870 g H 2 O was then added on top of the set gelatin followed by 0.00500 g of powdered dye. The dye powder was thoroughly wetted and dispersed in the water layer by agitation and then allowed to stand at 25 C. for 17 hours. The samples were then heated to 60-80 C. in a water bath for 1-2 hours and mixed with intermittent agitation. The samples were subsequently cooled to 39.0 C. over a period of approximately 1 hour and maintained at this temperature until measurement. In the subsequent experimental sections dispersions prepared in this manner will be referred to as Formulation B (direct gel dispersions or DGDs). The above formulation corresponds to a dye concentration 0.10% w/w, but the dispersions may be prepared at a wide variety of dye concentrations ranging from 0.005-30% w/w. The most commonly employed dye concentrations were 0.010.30% w/w. In some instances, regular lime-processed photographic gelatin (nondecalcified) was used in preference to deionized (decalcified) gelatin. Example 1 Polarized-Light Optical Microscopy Test for Formation of Dye Lyotropic Liquid Crystalline Phases (Liquid Crystal Phase Test) Direct aqueous gelatin dispersions (DGDs) of known composition were prepared as described for FormulationB for the inventive dyes and the comparitive dyes and allowed to cool to room temperature to set. Small aliquots of the gelled dye dispersions were then removed from the glass vials and sandwiched between a pre-cleaned glass micro slide (Gold Seal Products, USA) and a micro cover glass (VWR Scientific, USA ) to form a thin film. Each slide was then viewed in polarized-light at a magnification of 16 objective using a Zeiss Universal M microscope fitted with polarizing elements. Liquid-crystalline DGDs were readily identified by their birefringent (bright) characteristic type-textures and interference colours when viewed in polarized light. Isotropic DGDs (solution dye, non-liquid crystalline) were readily distinguishable from liquid-crystalline DGDs by their complete lack of birefringency (i.e. black appearance) when viewed in polarized light. Crystalline DGDs (solid dye, non-liquid crystalline) were readily distinguishable from isotropic and liquid-crystalline DGDs due to the presence of finite-sized solid dye particles or crystals, or clumps of such solid particles or crystals, which were not readily deformable with moderate shear when pressure was applied to the cover glass. The gelled DGDs were then heated through the gel to sol transition (40-50 C.) while observing the sample slide microscopically in polarized light. Dyes forming a lyotropic nematic mesophase typically displayed characteristic fluid, viscoelastic, birefringent textures including so-called Schlieren, Tiger-Skin, Reticulated, Homogeneous (Planar), Thread-Like, Droplet and Homeotropic (Pseudoisotropic). Dyes forming a lyotropic hexagonal mesophase typically displayed viscous, birefringent Herringone, Ribbon or Fan-Like textures. Dyes forming a lyotropic smectic mesophase displayed so-called Grainy-Mosaic, Spherulitic, Frond-Like (Pseudo-Schlieren) and Oily-Streak birefringent textures.The most preferred liquid crystal-forming dyes of the invention clearly remained in a liquid-crystalline state at these elevated temperatures as evidenced from their characteristic birefringent type-textures and rheology. In some instances, the dye liquid crystal phase melted reversibly to the isotropic dye solution phase (non-birefringent) on heating. In some instances, the dye liquid crystal phase co-existed with solid dye. By maintaining the sample slide at an elevated temperature, the presence and stability of the dye mesophase(s) could be monitored during peripheral evaporation of the solvent to a more concentrated evaporated (dried-down) state. The most preferred dyes of the invention exhibited microscopic liquid-crystalline textures in the wet gelled state, the wet melt (sol) state and the evaporated (dried-down) state. These states (gelled, sol and evaporated) are denoted in Table 4, column 4 by the letters g, s and e in parenthesis. The dye and gelatin concentrations refer to the samples in the wet gelled and sol states, before evaporation. For some of the inventive dyes, aqueous dye dispersions of known composition (without gelatin) were prepared by mixing the powdered dye into water at 60 C. for 1 hour with agitation, then cooling to room temperature before microscopic examination. Preferred dyes of the invention formed lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases in aqueous media at dye concentrations of 30% w/w, more preferred dyes formed lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases at concentrations of 10% w/w dye, even more preferred dyes formed lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases at concentrations of 5% w/w dye, and the most preferred dyes formed lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases at concentrations of 0.5% w/w.

The extinction coefficients for the isotropic dye solutions and dye wet DGDs were calculated according to Beers Law, and half bandwidths (Hbw) measured. The data are summarized in Table 5.

Moreover, the inventive dyes, when formulated as wet liquid-crystalline DGDs, exhibit higher extinction coefficients and narrower half bandwidths compared to their non liquid-crystalline, isotropic solution states in a solvent such as methanol. Moreover, as wet liquid-crystalline DGDs the inventive dyes are far superior in both Hbw and extinction coefficient to the comparative non liquid-crystalline dyes A-C. Example 3 Spectral Properties of Evaporated Dye DGD Coatings. Direct gelatin dispersions (DGDs) of Dyes 1-1 to 1-5, 2-1, 2-3, 2-4, 2-6, 3-1, and Comparative Dyes A-D were prepared using powdered dye as described for Formulation B. Aliquots of each dispersion, held at 39 C., were then smeared onto standard glass microscope slides (0.8/1.0 mm thickness) to form uniformly thin wet films which were allowed to dry at ambient temperature and humidity for at least 17 hours such that their D max (evap) was less than 4.0 absorbance units. The absorption spectra for these evaporated gelatin films were then measured at 25 C. These samples are referred to in Table 6 as evap DGDs. Solutions for each of the above listed dyes were prepared in a suitable organic solvent (methanol or methanol with added triethylamine unless otherwise noted) and their absorption spectra measured at 25 C. For each dye, the difference in absorbance maxima between the coated dye and the dye dissolved in a solvent ( max ( max Evap DGD max soln )), and the difference in halfbandwidth between the coated dye and the dye dissolved in a solvent (HbwHbw Evap DGDHbw soln) were calculated.

Moreover, the inventive dyes, when formulated as wet liquid-crystalline DGDs, exhibit higher extinction coefficients and narrower half bandwidths compared to their non liquid-crystalline, isotropic solution states in a solvent such as methanol. Moreover, as wet liquid-crystalline DGDs the inventive dyes are far superior in both Hbw and extinction coefficient to the comparative non liquid-crystalline dyes A-D exhibit no comparable advantageous spectral changes relative to their dissolved solution state. Example 4 Spectral Properties of Wet and Evaporated Dye DGDs Direct gelatin dispersions (DGDs) of Dyes 1-1 to 1-5, 2-1, 2-2 to 2-6, 3-1, and Comparative Dyes A-C were prepared u sing powdered dye as described for Formulation B.

The absorption spectra for these evaporated gelatin films were then measured at 25 C. These samples are referred to in Table 7 as Evap DGD. The data are summarized in Table 7.

Example 5 Influence of Substituents on Spectral Properties of Coated Dyes Direct gelatin dispersions (DGDs) of Dyes 1-1A, 1-2, 1-5, 2-1A, 2-3, 2-4 and Comparative Dyes A and B were prepared using powdered dye as described for Formulation B such that the wt % dye in each sample was 0.06-0.30%. Aliquots of each dispersion were smeared onto standard glass microscope slides (0.8/1.0 mm thickness) to form uniformly thin wet films which were allowed to dry at ambient temperature and humidity for at least 17 hours such that their D max (evap) was less than 4.0 absorbance units. These samples are referred to as evap DGDs. For each dye, the absorbance maxima for the monomer band (-M max ), and for the bathochromic band corresponding to the liquid crystalline phase (-lc max ) were measured for the Evap. DGDs, and the optical densities (O.D.) at the max of the monomer band (O.D-M) and for the bathochromic band corresponding to the liquid crystal phase (O.D.-lc) were measured for the Evap. DGDs, then the ratios ((O.D-lc)/(O.D-M)) were calculated. The results are shown in Table 8.

The data shows that the inventive dyes are preferentially substituted as compared with the comparative dyes to favor stable liquid crystal formation, and that the most preferred dyes have excellent ratios between the liquid crystal and monomer bands in the coatings.

Direct gelatin dispersions of the Inventive Dyes 1-1, 1-1A and 2-1 were prepared as described for Formulation B at concentrations equivalent to dye laydowns of 0.064 g/m 2 . Solution aliquots of each dispersion were smeared onto glass microscope slides (0.8/1.0 mm thickness) to form uniformly thin wet films which were then allowed to dry at ambient temperature and humidity for at least 17 hours. The absorption spectra for these dried films were then measured at 25 C. These samples are referred to in Table 9 as Evap. DGDs. The inventive dyes 1-1, 1-1A and 2-1 were also dispersed in aqueous gelatin using the Formulation A procedure. These dispersions were coated on a polyester support according to the following procedure. A spreading agent (Olin 10G, an isononylphenoxy glycidol surfactant available from Olin Corp.) and a hardener (bis(vinylsulfonylmethyl)ether) were added to the dye-gelatin melt prepared as described above. A melt from this mixture was then coated on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) support to achieve a dye coverage of 0.043 to 0.129 g/m 2 , a gelatin coverage of 1.61 g/m 2 , and a hardener level of 0.016 g/m 2 . These samples are referred to in Table 23 as Evap SPDs. The absorption spectrum of the evaporated coating was measured at 25 C. The data are summarized in Table 9. TABLE 9 max Hbw MAX Hbw Evap DGD Evap DGD Evap SPD Evap SPD Dye (nm) (nm) (nm) (nm) 1-1 488 15 488 20 1-1A 487 14 488 22 2-1 610 19 610 22 The data show no significant differences in max or Hbw for the dried gelatin films containing the inventive liquid crystal-forming dyes formulated according to Formulation A (SPD)or Formulation B (DGD) procedures. Thus the advantageous spectral properties of the inventive dyes can be obtained using the simpler procedure (Formulation B) without the need to resort to the more complex milling procedure (Formulation A) commonly used for solid particle dyes. Example 7 Spectral Shape of Evaporated Dye DGDs Direct gelatin dispersions (DGDs) of Dyes 1-1 to 1-5, 2-1 to 2-4, 3-1 were prepared as described for Formulation B. Aliquots of each dispersion were also smeared onto standard glass microscope slides (0.8/1.0 mm thickness) to form uniformly thin wet films which were allowed to dry at ambient temperature and humidity for at least 17 hours such that their D max (evap) was less than 2.5 absorbance units. The absorbance spectrum for each coated DGD was measured. Comparative solid particle dyes D, E and F were prepared as described for Formulation A. Melts for each comparative dye were then coated on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) support to achieve a dye coverage of 0.043 to 0.129 g/m 2 , a gelatin coverage of 1.61 g/m 2 , and a hardener level of 0.016 g/m 2 . The absorption maxima and half bandwidths (Hbw) of the dried coatings were measured at 25 C. The ratio of each dyes optical density at max (D max ) to optical density (O.D.) at max 20 nm was calculated. The ratio of each dyes optical density at max (D max ) to optical density (O.D.) at max 20 nm was also calculated. These ratios are a measure of spectral band sharpness. Dyes with higher ratios possess sharper cutting spectral absorption envelopes which are desirable for light filtration/absorption applications. The data are summarized in Table 10. TABLE 10 max HBW D max /O.D. at D max /O.D. at Dye (nm) (nm) max 20 nm max 20 nm 1-1A 487 14 20 3.36 1-2 476 13 20 2.3 1-2A 477 13 20 3.0 1-3 483 14 20 2.1 1-4 486 21 20 2.3 1-5 476 19 20 2.5 2-1 610 19 20 3.5 2-1A 610 21 20 1.8 2-3 610 18 20 3.2 2-4 609 15 20 7.2 2-6 624 12 20 2.3 3-1 487 24 2.5 4.4 D 676 102 1.8 1.34 E 538 130 1.1 1.04 F 432 100 1.1 1.12 The data clearly demonstrate that the inventive liquid crystal-forming dyes when coated in aqueous gelatin coatings possess absorption spectra with significantly narrower absorbance envelopes and exhibit sharper hypsochromic and bathochromic edges relative to the comparative solid particle dyes. It should also be noted that for the inventive dyes with ratios marked as 20, the O.D20 nm value is sufficiently low that it has no measurable density relative to noise. It should also be noted that when the comparative dyes were formulated using Formulation B, the quality of the resulting coatings was very poor due to the insolubility of the dyes in the melts. The comparative dyes were therefore milled (Formulation A) prior to coating, as is the usual procedure for solid particle dyes. Therefore, the dyes of this invention not only possess spectral properties far superior to the comparative examples, but their superior properties may be obtained without requiring the more complex Formulation A procedure by instead using the simple Formulation B procedure. This example demonstrates a fundamental advantage of the inventive liquid crystal-forming dyes over solid particle dyes. This example also demonstrates that the inventive liquid crystalline dyes provide sharp, narrowly absorbing spectra in coatings that are virtually unachievable using traditional solid particle dyes. Example 8 Covering Power of Liquid Crystalline Dyes Versus Solid Particle (microcrystalline) Analogs Melts of Dyes 1-1, 2-1 were prepared as described for Formulation B. Melts for Comparative Dyes D, E and F were prepared as described as described for Formulation A. (Formulation A was used for the microcrystalline comparative dyes for the same reasons cited in the previous example). Melts for each dye were then coated on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) support to achieve a dye coverage of 0.043 to 0.129 g/m 2 , a gelatin coverage of 1.61 g/m 2 , and a hardener level of 0.016 g/m 2 . The absorption maxima and half bandwidths (Hbw) of the dried coatings were measured at 25 C. The covering power for each of the coated dyes was calculated by dividing the optical density (O.D.) at max by the dye laydown in mg/ft2. The data are summarized in Table 11. TABLE 11 max coating Dye (nm) Covering power of coated dye 1-1 488 0.23 2-1 610 0.48 D 670 0.11 E 538 0.15 F 432 0.09 It is clear from the above data that coated inventive dyes possess far superior covering power relative to those of the comparative solid particle dyes. It is also evident from this data that the inventive liquid crystalline dyes allow for much smaller quantities of coated materials to be used to achieve a required optical density level at D max versus those of the comparative dyes. This example demonstrates another fundamental advantage of the inventive liquid crystal-forming dyes over solid particle dyes. This example also demonstrates that the inventive liquid crystalline dyes provide sharp, narrowly absorbing spectra in coatings that are virtually unachievable by traditional solid particle dyes. Example 9 Dye Wandering Properties Direct gelatin dispersion melts (Wet DGDs) were prepared for Dyes 1-1, 1-2 and Comparative Dyes A and B as described for Formulation B (wt % dye 0.06-0.1). Aqueous gelatin melts containing no dye were prepared as a receiver layer and chill set detail formulation specs, i.e. 2.5 wt % gel). The set gelatin receiver pads were allowed to equilibrate at 25C. The wet DGD melts (held at 39C) were pipeted atop the gelatin receiver pads and allowed to sit for 24 hr. Observed color in the bottom layer representing solubilized, mobile dye was recorded after 2 hours and 24 hours on a scale of 0 to 5 with 0 being no color observed migrating and 5 meaning that the upper and lower layers appeared identical in color (full equilibration). Observations are recorded in Table 12. TABLE 12 Liquid crystal phase Observed Color Observed Color (microscopy) after 1 hour after 24 hours Dye (from Table 1) (0 to 5) (0 to 5) 1-1 smectic 1 2 1-2 smectic 1 2 A none 2 3 B none 2 5 The above data clearly demonstrate that the inventive liquid crystal-forming dyes remain largely immobile when coated, and do not appreciably migrate from the layer in which they are coated. By contrast, the comparative dyes migrate freely from the layer in which they are coated to adjacent layers. This example demonstrates a fundamental advantage of the inventive liquid crystal-forming dyes over soluble dyes widely used in the art. Example 10 Process Removability of Dyes The inventive Dyes 1-1, 1-1A, 1-2, 1-2A, and 2-1 were formulated according to Formulation B. These dye dispersions were coated on a polyester support according to the following procedure. A spreading agent (surfactant 10G) and a hardener (bis(vinylsulfonylmethyl)ether) were added to the dye-gelatin melt prepared as described above. A melt from this mixture was then coated on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) support to achieve a dye coverage of 0.043 to 0.161 g/m 2 , a gelatin coverage of 1.61 g/m 2 , and a hardener level of 0.016 g/m 2 . The absorption spectrum of the dried coating was measured at 25 C. Identical elements were subjected to Kodak E-6 processing (which is described in British Journal of Photography Annual , 1977, pp. 194-97) and the absorbance was measured for each. The results are shown in Table 13. TABLE 13 max SPD dry D max Dye (nm) D max after E-6 Processing 1-1 488 1.0 0.0 1-1A 488 1.0 0.0 1-2 476 1.0 0.0 1-2A 476 1.0 0.0 2-1 610 2.0 0.0 In spite of the inordinately high optical densities (D max s) for such low dye laydowns of the aggregated coated dyes, no residual deleterious dye stain (optical density) could be detected after processing. Example 11 Dye Immobility and Thermal Stability The inventive Dyes 1-1, 1-1A, and 2-1 were formulated using the Formulation B and coated on a polyester support as outlined in Example. Each dye was coated at a laydown such that the measured D max was less than 2.0. For each example, the absorbance spectrum for the dyed gelatin coating was measured both before and after incubation for seven days at 120 C./50% relative humidity. The results are summarized in Table 14. TABLE 14 D max SPD Dye laydown max SPD before D max SPD after Dye (g/m 2 ) (nm) incubation incubation 1-1 0.043 488 0.9 0.9 1-1A 0.043 488 0.6 0.6 2-1 0.129 610 1.9 1.8 It is clear from the data that the liquid crystal-forming dyes in the inventive examples show an excellent robustness toward high heat and humidity as evidenced by the fact that little or no density loss at the bathochromic max is observed as a result of incubation. Furthermore, the absence of any detectable optical density at the monomeric max of the inventive dyes following incubation demonstrates that little or no mobile monomeric dye species is produced under these conditions. Consequently, the inventive dyes exhibit excellent robustness and fastness to diffusion at high temperature and humidity. In summary, the above examples demonstrate that the inventive dyes successfully solve the problems inherent in the filter dyes of the prior art. Soluble dyes typically migrate in coatings unless mordanted. Solid particle dyes typically do not migrate, but their spectral envelopes are generally very broad, low in covering power, and not sharpcutting. Furthermore, solid particle dyes require specialized milling procedures for incorporation into coated elements. Our examples demonstrate that our inventive liquid crystal-forming dyes possess the combination of superior spectral characteristics of high extinction, narrow bandwidth, and sharp-cutting edges and furthermore remain immobile and therefore allow layer-specific dyeing without the use of mordants. Moreover, many of the liquid crystal-forming dyes of this invention are readily decolorized or removed from the photographic element upon processing, leaving little or no post-process dye stain. The invention has been described in detail with particular reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, but it will be understood that variations and modifications can be effected within the spirit and scope of the invention.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel cationic lipids which contain a five- or six-member nitrogen containing ring and attached fatty acid chains which are stable to hydrolysis. The lipids are useful in the preparation of liposomes and other lipid vesicle carriers of nucleic acids and other substances, for delivery to cells. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The introduction of genetic material into a cell can facilitate expression of an encoded protein to complement a deficient or defective protein. The use of such technology allows for the treatment of disease as well as production of certain proteins in an in vitro application. One method of introducing nucleic acids into a cell is mechanically, using direct microinjection. However this method is labor-intensive and, therefore, only practical for transfecting small numbers of cells such as eukaryotic germline cells for the production of transgenic systems. To be effective in treating a disease, a nucleic acid-based therapy typically must enter many cells. Gene transfer entails distributing nucleic acids to target cells and then transferring the nucleic acid across a target cell membrane intact and, typically, into the nucleus in a form that can function in a therapeutic manner. In vivo gene transfer is complicated by serum interactions, immune clearance, toxicity and biodistribution, depending on the route of adminstration. The in vivo gene transfer methods under study in the clinic consist almost entirely of viral vectors. Although viral vectors have the inherent ability to transport nucleic acids across cell membranes and some can integrate exogenous DNA into the chromosomes, they can carry only limited amounts of DNA and also pose risks. One such risk involves the random integration of viral genetic sequences into patient chromosomes, potentially damaging the genome and possibly inducing a malignant transformation. Another risk is that the viral vector may revert to a pathogenic genotype either through mutation or genetic exchange with a wild-type virus. More recently, cationic lipids have been used to deliver nucleic acids to cells, allowing uptake and expression of foreign genes both in vivo and in vitro. While the mechanism by which cationic lipid carriers act to mediate transfection is not clearly understood, they are postulated to act in a number of ways with respect to both cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking. Some of the proposed mechanisms by which cationic lipids enhance transfection include: (i) compacting the DNA, protecting it from nuclease degradation and enhancing receptor-mediated uptake, (ii) improving association with negatively-charged cellular membranes by giving the complexes a positive charge, (iii) promoting fusion with endosomal membranes facilitating the release of complexes from endosomal compartments, and (iv) enhancing transport from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where DNA may be transcribed. When used for in vivo delivery, the role of the cationic lipid carriers is further complicated by the interactions between the lipid-nucleic acid complexes and host factors, e.g., the effects of the lipids on binding of blood proteins, clearance and/or destabilization of the complexes. Typically, cationic lipids are mixed with a non-cationic lipid, usually a neutral lipid, and allowed to form stable liposomes, which liposomes are then mixed with the nucleic acid to be delivered. The liposomes may be large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) or small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). The liposomes are mixed with nucleic acid in solution, at concentrations and ratios optimized for the target cells to be transfected, to form cationic lipid-nucleic acid transfection complexes. Alterations in the lipid formulation allow preferential delivery of nucleic acids to particular tissues in vivo. PCT patent application numbers WO 96/40962, WO 96/40963. Certain preformed cationic liposome compositions are available, such as LIPOFECTIN and LIPOFECTAMINE. Another method of complex formation involves the formation of DNA complexes with mono- or poly-cationic lipids without the presence of a neutral lipid. These complexes are often not stable in water. Additionally, these complexes are adversely affected by serum (see, Behr, Acc. Chem. Res. 26:274-78 (1993)). An example of a commercially available poly-cationic lipid is TRANSFECTAM. While the use of cationic lipid carriers for transfection is now well established, structure activity relationships are not well understood. It is postulated that different lipid carriers will affect each of the various steps in the transfection process (e.g., condensation, uptake, nuclease protection, endosomal release, nuclear trafficking, and decondensation) with greater or lesser efficiency, thereby making the overall transfection rate difficult to correlate with lipid structures. Thus, alterations in either the cationic or neutral lipid component do not have easily predictable effects on activity. For the most part, therefore, improvements to known cationic lipid-mediated delivery systems are dependent on empirical testing. When intended for in vivo transfection, new lipids and lipid formulations should be screened in vivo to accurately predict optimal lipids and formulations for transfection of target cells. More recently, new cationic lipids have been prepared which exhibit excellent transfection properties when formulated with nucleic acids. See WO 95/14380, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The compositions provided in WO 95/14380 are metabolizable in animal cells to components that are typically endogenous to the cells. Despite the properties associated with the novel cationic lipids, there exists a need for cationic lipids which are more hydrolytically stable and which can be formulated into suitable transfection compositions. The present invention provides such cationic lipids, along with methods for their preparation and use in lipid-based compositions. Relevant Literature Cationic lipid carriers have been shown to mediate intracellular delivery of plasmid DNA (Felgner et al., (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci . ( USA ), 84:7413-7416); mRNA (Malone et al., (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci . ( USA ) 86:6077-6081); and purified transcription factors (Debs et al., (1990) J. Biol.

As a result, these lipids are useful in the preparation of lipid vesicle carriers, or lipid-nucleic acid complexes which are used for transfection of cells. The cationic lipids of the present invention are represented by Formula (I): In this formula, R 1 and R 2 each independently represent a C 8 -C 24 saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon chain, which is optionally interrupted by from 1 to 3 heteroatom moieties, such as O, S, NH and NR. In preferred embodiments, R 1 and R 2 each independently represent a C 8 -C 24 saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon chain. Examples of suitable saturated hydrocarbon chains include those chains derived from fatty acids or alcohols, for example, lauryl (C12:0), myristyl (C14:0), palmityl (C16:0), stearyl (C18:0), arachidyl (C20:0), and behenyl (C22:0). Examples of suitable unsaturated hydrocarbon chains include, for example, oleyl (C18:1,cis-9), linoleyl (C18:2,cis-9,12), elaidyl (C18:1,trans-9), linolelaidyl (C18:2,trans-9,12), eicosenyl (C20:1,cis-11), and the like. In each of the above, the configuration is provided as, for example, (C20:1,cis-11), indicating a twenty carbon chain having a single cis double bond between the eleventh and twelfth carbon atoms (when counting the carbon atoms in the conventional manner for fatty acids). While examples are provided for saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon chains having an even number of carbon atoms, the invention is not so limited. A variety of methods are available to the skilled chemist for a one-carbon homologation or degradation to provide hydrocarbon chains having an odd number of carbon atoms. Additionally, due to the synthetic scheme provided in FIG. 1 and discussed below, R 2 will have an odd number of carbon atoms when synthesis is carried out using commercially available fatty acids such as oleic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, and the like. Still further, R 1 will typically have an odd number of carbon atoms when synthesis (according to FIG. 1 ) is carried out beginning with a fatty alcohol having an even number of carbon atoms (to produce compounds of Formula (I) in which X is CH 2 ). In one group of preferred embodiments, R 1 and R 2 will each independently be a C 12 -C 20 saturated hydrocarbon chain. In another group of preferred embodiments R 1 and R 2 will each independently be a C 12 -C 20 unsaturated hydrocarbon chain. Particularly preferred embodiments, within the group of unsaturated hydrocarbon chains, are those which contain a single double bond in the cis orientation (e.g., oleyl, elaidyl, and those having one more or one less carbon atoms). R 3 and R 4 are each independently H or a C 1 -C 5 saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon chain. Examples of hydrocarbon chains having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, cyclopropyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, t-butyl, pentyl, cyclopentyl, cis-2-pentene, trans-2-pentene and the like. In some embodiments, various groups, known to those of skill in the art, may be added to the compounds to enhance properties such as water solubility, targetting of particular cell surfaces, or fusogenicity. For example, poly(ethyleneglycol) can be attached to a hydroxyl group at R 5 . In Formula (I) above, X 1 represents a linking group such as CH 2 , O, S, NH or NR 7 . Preferably, X is CH 2 or O, more preferably CH 2 . The compounds of the invention comprise both 5- and 6-membered ring heterocycles. Thus, the subscript n in Formula (I) is either 0 or 1, preferably, 0. Additionally, the dashed arc and sign within the nitrogen heterocycle are meant to indicate the presence of a double bond between either of the nitrogen atoms in the ring and the single carbon atom which joins the two nitrogen atoms. As a result, a positive charge () is associated with one or the other of the nitrogen atoms, depending on the position of the double bond (i.e., the positive charge is associated with the nitrogen atom which forms one end of the double bond). X 2 is a linking group which is either CH 2 , O, S, NH or NR 8 . Preferably, X is CH 2 or O, more preferably O. R 5 is H, R 9 or CH 2 ) m Y, preferably H. Y is OH, or an amino or alkylamino group such as NH 2 , NHR 10 , NR 11 R 12 , preferably OH. The alkyl substituents on the amino groups, R 6 , R 7 , R 8 , R 9 , R 10 , R 11 and R 12 , each independently represent an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples of hydrocarbon chains having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, cyclopropyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, t-butyl and cyclobutyl. The alkyl groups can be either saturated or unsturated. In preferred embodiments, the alkyl groups are methyl or ethyl, more prefereably methyl. In addition, in some embodiments, these amines can be quaternized for example, by methylation. The symbol A represents an anion, preferably a pharmaceutically acceptable anion. As used herein, the term pharmaceutically acceptable anion refers to anions of organic and inorganic acids which provide non-toxic salts in pharmaceutical preparations. Examples of such anions include, but are not limited to, chloride, bromide, sulfate, phosphate, acetate, benzoate, citrate, glutamate, and lactate. The preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts is described in Berge, et al., J Pharm. Sci. 66:1-19 (1977), incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, A is chloride, bromide or citrate. In one group of particularly preferred embodiments, R 1 and R 2 each independently represent a C 12 -C 18 unsaturated hydrocarbon chain, X 1 is O, X 2 is OH or CH 2 ) 2 OH and n is 0. In another group of particularly preferred embodiments, R 1 represents a C 18 -unsaturated hydrocarbon chain, R 2 represents a C 17 unsaturated hydrocarbon chain, X 1 is O, X 2 is OH and n is 0. In another group of particularly preferred embodiments, X 1 is CH 2 . Within this group of embodiments, R 1 will preferably have an odd number of carbon atoms and contain one double bond having a cis configuration. Also preferred are those embodiments in which R 2 is a saturated hydrocarbon chain having an odd number of carbon atoms, or an unsaturated hydrocarbon chain having an odd number of carbon atoms with one double bond having a cis configuration. Most preferred in this group of embodiments are the compounds of Formulas (II) and (III). Preparation of the Imidazolinium Lipids Preparation of lipids of Formula (I) can be carried out according to the outline provided in FIG. 1 . Briefly, a fatty alcohol is converted to a sulfonate ester (an activated leaving group) by treatment with, for example, methanesulfonyl chloride or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride to provide a compound a. Reaction of compound a with 2-(2-aminoethylamino)ethanol provides compound b. Protection of each of the amino groups as their t-butyl carbamate can be accomplished with reagents such as (t-Boc) 2 O or BOC-ON (from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis., USA) to provide compound c. Following protection of the amino groups, the hydroxyl group can be acylated with an appropriate acid chloride, typically a fatty acid chloride to provide compound d which is then deprotected to provide compound e. Heating compound e in a suitable polar solvent (e.g., ethylene glycol) produces an imidazolinium ring (or the related six-member ring) with concomitant loss of water, and provides target compound f. As can be seen from FIG. 1 , the limitations on R 1 and R 2 in Formula (I) will depend only on the availability of fatty alcohols and fatty acids. Accordingly, compounds of Formula (I) are readily formed in which R 2 has an odd number of carbon atoms, optionally with one or more sites of unsaturation. Similarly, for those compounds of Formula (I) in which X is CH 2 , R 1 will have an odd number of carbon atoms when the starting material is one of the readily available fatty alcohols (e.g., stearyl alcohol and oleyl alcohol). Preparation of compounds in which R 1 or R 2 have an even number of carbon atoms can be accomplished by suitable conversion of the starting fatty acids or alcohols to their longer or shorter homologs. Additionally, position and geometry (cis or trans) of any double bonds present can also be altered in the starting materials using known methods for isomerization of double bonds as well as positional transfer of double bonds. The salt formed using the procedures in FIG. 1 is a chloride salt. Replacement of the chloride ion with another anion can be accomplished using, for example, ion exchange resins which are equilibrated with the desired anion. Other compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared by methods outlined in FIG. 2 . As outlined in FIG. 2 , compounds of Formula (I) in which X is O can be prepared from fatty alcohols, fatty acids, and N,N-di(2-hydroxyethyl)-ethylene diamine. Briefly, the amino groups of N,N-di(2-hydroxyethyl)-ethylene diamine are protected as their Boc carbamates to provide compound g, which is then monoalkylated with an activated fatty alcohol sulfonate ester (compound a) to form compound h. Acylation of the remaining alcohol moiety is accomplished by treatment of compound h with a fatty acid chloride to provide compound i. Conversion of compound i to target compound k is carried out by first removing the Boc protecting groups then heating the resultant compound j in a polar solvent to effect the cyclization to compound k. Lipid Vesicle Compositions In another aspect, the present invention provides lipid vesicle compositions which contain a lipid of Formula (I), above. The lipid vesicle compositions will typically be in the form of liposomes (e.g., unilammelar vesicles, multilammelar vesicles), or other lipid bilayer forms. The cationic lipids described above can be used alone or combined with other lipids in the preparation of compositions useful in intracellular delivery systems (e.g., transfection systems), or other conventional drug delivery systems. A variety of other lipids are suitable for use in the present compositions. As used herein, the term lipid refers to any suitable material resulting in a bilayer in aqueous solution such that a hydrophobic portion of the lipid material orients toward the bilayer while a hydrophilic portion orients toward the aqueous phase. Hydrophilic characteristics derive from the presence of phosphate, carboxylic, sulfato, amino, sulfhydryl, nitro, and other like groups. Hydrophobicity is conferred by the inclusion of groups that include, but are not limited to, long chain saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups, with such groups being optionally substituted by one or more aromatic, cycloaliphatic or the preferred lipids for use in conjunction with the cationic lipids of Formula (I) are phosphoglycerides, sphingolipids and sterols (e.g. cholesterol), representative examples of which include diacyl derivatives of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidic acid (e.g., palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, distearoylphosphatidylcholine and dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine) and the related lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine. Still other lipids are useful, such as sphingolipid and glycosphingolipid families. Additionally, the lipids described above may be mixed with other lipids (co-lipids) including triglycerides and sterols (e.g., cholesterol). When the lipid vesicle compositions are in the form of liposomes, the compounds of Formula (I) will typically be combined with other lipids, including neutral lipids, zwitterionic lipids, anionic lipids or other cationic lipids known to those of skill in the art. Preferably, the compositions will comprise other neutral lipids or zwitterionic lipids (e.g., cholesterol, dilaurylphosphatidylethanolamine). Particularly preferred co-lipids include DOPE, DLPE and cholesterol. For systemic delivery of nucleic acids, cholesterol is the preferred co-lipid. In general, less saturated lipids are more easily sized, particularly when the liposomes must be sized below about 0.3 microns. In one group of embodiments, lipids containing saturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths in the range of C 14 to C 22 are preferred. In another group of embodiments, lipids with mono- or di-unsaturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths in the range of C 14 to C 22 are used. Additionally, lipids having mixtures of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid chains can be used. A number of methods are available for preparing liposome compositions (see, for example, Szoka et al., Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 9:467 (1980), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728, 4,837,028, the text Liposomes, Marc J. Ostro, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1983, Chapter 1, and Hope, et al., Chem. Phys. Lip. 40:89 (1986), all of which are incorporated herein by reference). One method produces multilamellar vesicles of heterogeneous sizes. In this method, the vesicle-forming lipids are dissolved in a suitable organic solvent or solvent system and dried under vacuum or an inert gas to form a thin lipid film. If desired, the film may be redissolved in a suitable solvent, such as tertiary butanol, and then lyophilized to form a more homogeneous lipid mixture which is in a more easily hydrated powder-like form. This film is covered with an aqueous buffered solution and allowed to hydrate, typically over a 15-60 minute period with agitation. The size distribution of the resulting multilamellar vesicles can be shifted toward smaller sizes by hydrating the lipids under more vigorous agitation conditions. Following liposome preparation, the liposomes may be sized, for example, by extrusion, sonication, filtration or emulsification to achieve a desired size range and a relatively narrow distribution of liposome sizes, which is particularly desirable for in vivo delivery of nucleic acids. A size range of about 0.2-0.4 microns allows the liposome suspension to be sterilized by filtration through a conventional filter, typically a 0.22 micron filter. The filter sterilization method can be carried out on a high through-put basis if the liposomes have been sized down to about 0.2-0.4 microns. Techniques for sizing liposomes to a desired size, include sonication (see, U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,323, incorporated herein by reference), extrusion through small-pore polycarbonate membranes or an asymmetric ceramic membrane, and homogenization. Homogenization relies on shearing energy to fragment large liposomes into smaller ones. In a typical homogenization procedure, multilamellar vesicles are recirculated through a standard emulsion homogenizer until selected liposome sizes, typically between about 0.1 and 0.5 microns, are observed. In any of the methods, the liposome size distribution can be monitored by conventional dynamic laser light scattering. The lipid vesicle compositions will, in some embodiments, have an attached targeting moiety. For example, a ligand binding specifically to a receptor on a particular target cell type can be used to target delivery of the lipid carrier (with, e.g., the DNA or antibiotic of interest) to the desired target cells. Alternatively, the active compound may be a peptide or other small molecule designed to regulate intracellular trafficking of the delivered substance, e.g., triggering endosomal release or transport into the nucleus using a nuclear localizing sequence. The active compounds bound to the lipid mixture can vary widely, from small haptens (molecular weights of about 125 to 2000) to antigens (molecular weights ranging from around 6000 to 1 million). Of particular interest are proteinaceous ligands that bind to and are internalized by specific complementary binding partners on cell surfaces. Illustrative active compounds include cytokines, interferons, hormones, asialeglycoprotein antibodies to cell surface receptors or other molecules, and fragments of such compounds that retain the ability to bind to the same cell surface binding partners that bind the original (non-fragment) molecules. The number of active compounds bound to a lipid carrier will vary with the size of the complex, the size of the compound, the binding affinity of the molecule to the target cell receptor or ligand, and the like. Usually, the bound active molecules will be present in the lipid mixture in from about 0.001 to 10 mole percent, more usually from about 0.01 to 5 mole percent based on the percent of bound molecules to the total number of molecules available in the mixture for binding. Lipid-Nucleic Acid Compositions In another aspect, the present invention provides lipid-nucleic acid compositions in which the lipid portion comprises at least one cationic lipid of Formula (I). Preferably, the cationic lipids of Formula (I) are those in which X is CH 2 . Other preferred embodiments for the cationic lipid and, optionally, co-lipids are as described above. The nucleic acids which are useful in the present invention are typically nucleotide polymers having from 10 to 100,000 nucleotide residues. Typically, the nucleic acids are to be administered to a subject for the purpose of replacing or enhancing the expression of a cellular protein and may also encode an RNA molecule, e.g. antisense RNA or ribozyme, which will inhibit an undesired cellular activity, e.g. in a virus-infected cell or tumor cell. Additionally, the nucleic acid can carry a label (e.g., radioactive label, fluorescent label or calorimetric label) for the purpose of providing clinical diagnosis relating to the presence or absence of complementary nucleic acids. Accordingly, the nucleic acids, or nucleotide polymers, can be polymers of nucleic acids including genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA or oligonucleotides containing nucleic acid analogs, for example, the antisense derivatives described in a review by Stein, et al., Science 261:1004-1011 (1993) and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,264,423 and 5,276,019, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Still further, the nucleic acids may encode transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences including promoter sequences and enhancer sequences. The nucleotide polymers can be single-stranded DNA or RNA, or double-stranded DNA or DNA-RNA hybrids. Examples of double-stranded DNA include structural genes including control and termination regions, and self-replicating systems such as plasmid DNA. Single-stranded nucleic acids include antisense oligonucleotides (complementary to DNA or RNA), ribozymes and triplex-forming oligonucleotides. In order to increase stability, some single-stranded nucleic acids will preferably have some or all of the nucleotide linkages substituted with stable, non-phosphodiester linkages, including, for example, phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenate, or O-alkyl phosphotriester linkages. The nucleic acids used in the present invention will also include those nucleic acids in which modifications have been made in one or more sugar moieties and/or in one or more of the pyrimidine or purine bases. Examples of sugar modifications include replacement of one or more hydroxyl groups with halogens, alkyl groups, amines, azido groups or functionalized as ethers or esters. Additionally, the entire sugar may be replaced with sterically and electronically similar structures, including aza-sugars and carbocyclic sugar analogs. Modifications in the purine or pyrimidine base moiety include, for example, alkylated purines and pyrimidines, acylated purines or pyrimidines, or other heterocyclic substitutes known to those of skill in the art. Multiple genetic sequences can also be used in the present methods. Thus, the sequences for different proteins may be located on the same or separate plasmids. The gene of interest will be linked to appropriate regulatory elements to provide constitutive or inducible expression and/or tissue specific expression. Additional elements such as antibiotic-sensitive or nutrient-sensitive regions, may be included as required. Non-coding sequences may also be present for various purposes including, for example, regulatory elements to achieve appropriate expression or replication in host cells, or to provide convenient cloning sites. The nucleic acids used in the present invention can be isolated from natural sources, obtained from such sources as ATCC or GenBank libraries or prepared by synthetic methods. Typically, the nucleic acids will be plasmid DNA, which can be grown and purified in large quantities from bacterial cells. Synthetic nucleic acids can be prepared by a variety of solution or solid phase methods. Generally, solid phase synthesis is preferred. Detailed descriptions of the procedures for solid phase synthesis of nucleic acids by phosphite-triester, phosphotriester, and H-phosphonate chemistries are widely available. See, for example, Itakura, U.S. Pat. No. 4,401,796; Caruthers, et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,458,066 and 4,500,707; Beaucage, et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 22:1859-1862 (1981); Matteucci, et al., J. Am.

The compositions in this aspect of the invention can be in the form of liposome-encapsulated nucleic acids, lipid-bilayer coated nucleic acids, or complexes formed between lipids and nucleic acids. Preparation of Lipid-Nucleic Acid Compositions Various lipid-nucleic acid compositions, wherein the lipid portion is typically in the form of liposomes, can be prepared using methods well known in the art. Still other compositions are contemplated by the present invention such as those which are described as lipid particles in WO 96/40964, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. For those compositions in which the lipid portion is in the form of liposomes, the lipid vesicle can be prepared by standard methods such as those described above. The resulting liposomes are mixed with a nucleic acid solution with constant agitation to form the cationic lipid-nucleic acid transfection complexes. The preferred size will vary depending on use. For example, smaller transfection complexes are preferred for aerosol administration, thereby reducing shear caused by the aerosolization process. Preferred transfection complex size for aerosol administration is less than 5000 nm, most preferably from 50 to 300 nm. Preferred transfection complex size for intravenous administration is from 50 to 5000 nm, most preferably from 100 to 700 nm. Cationic lipid-nucleic acid transfection complexes can be prepared in various formulations depending on the target cells to be transfected. See, e.g., WO 96/40962 and WO 96/40963. Helper lipids used in these compositions can be substituted and evaluated for concentration, DNA-lipid ratio, etc. For example, if DLPE is substituted for cholesterol, resulting in changes in the physical characteristics of the lipid carrier, it is preferred that additional formulations be tested empirically to obtain optimal results. While a range of lipid-nucleic acid complex formulations will be effective in cell transfection, optimum conditions are determined empirically in the desired experimental system. Lipid carrier compositions may be evaluated by their ability to deliver a reporter gene (e.g. CAT which encodes chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, luciferase, or -galactosidase) in vitro, or in vivo to a given tissue in an animal, such as a mouse. For in vitro transfections, the various combinations are tested for their ability to transfect target cells using standard molecular biology techniques to determine DNA uptake, RNA and/or protein production. Typically, in vitro cell transfection involves mixing nucleic acid and lipid, in cell culture media, and allowing the lipid-nucleic acid transfection complexes to form for about 10 to 15 minutes at room temperature. The transfection complexes are added to the cells and incubated at 37 C. for about four hours. The complex-containing media is removed and replaced with fresh media, and the cells incubated for an additional 24 to 48 hours. In vivo, particular cells can be preferentially transfected, depending on the route of administration, by the use of particular cationic lipids for preparation of the lipid carriers, or by altering the cationic lipid-nucleic acid formulation to preferentially transfect the desired cell types (WO 96/40962). Thus, for example, in circumstances where a negatively charged complex is desired, relatively less cationic lipid will be complexed to the nucleic acid resulting in a higher nucleic acid: cationic lipid ratio. Conversely, in circumstances where a positively charged complex is desired, relatively more cationic lipid will be complexed with the nucleic acid, resulting in a lower nucleic acid: cationic lipid ratio. To avoid precipitation, which generally occurs around charge neutrality, net positively charged complexes are generally prepared by adding nucleic acid to the liposomes, and net negatively charged complexes are prepared by adding liposomes to the nucleic acid, in either case with constant agitation. The lipid mixtures are complexed with DNA in different ratios depending on the target cell type, generally ranging from about 6:1 to 1:20 g DNA:nmole cationic lipid. For transfection of airway epithelial cells, e.g., via aerosol, intratracheal or intranasal administration, net negatively charged complexes are preferred. Thus, preferred DNA:cationic lipid ratios are from about 10:1 to about 1:20, preferably about 3:1. For intravenous administration, preferred DNA:cationic lipid ratios range from about 1:3.5 to about 1:20 g DNA: nmole cationic lipid, most preferably, about 1:6 to about 1:15 g DNA: nmole cationic lipid. Additional parameters such as nucleic acid concentration, buffer type and concentration, etc., will have an effect on transfection efficiency, and can be optimized by routine experimentation by a person of ordinary skill in the art. Preferred conditions are described in the Examples that follow. Non-lipid material, (such as biological molecules being delivered to an animal or plant cell or target-specific moieties) can be conjugated to the lipid carriers through a linking group to one or more hydrophobic groups, e.g., using alkyl chains containing from about 12 to 20 carbon atoms, either prior or subsequent to vesicle formation. Various linking groups can be used for joining the lipid chains to the compound. Functionalities of particular interest include thioethers, disulfides, carboxamides, alkylamines, ethers, and the like, used individually or in combination. The particular manner of linking the compound to a lipid group is not a critical part of this invention, as the literature provides a great variety of such methods. Alternatively, some compounds will have hydrophobic regions or domains which will allow their association with the lipid mixture without covalent linking to one or more lipid groups. Administration of Lipid-Nucleic Acid Compositions to a Host Following formation of the lipid-nucleic acid compositions, the compositions (or complexes) can be contacted with the cells to be transfected. Contact between the cells and the lipid-nucleic acid complexes, when carried out in vitro, will take place in a biologically compatible medium. The concentration of complexes can vary widely depending on the particular application, but is generally between about 1 mol and about 10 mmol. Treatment of the cells with the lipid-nucleic acid complexes will generally be carried out at physiological temperatures (about 37 C.) for periods of time of from about 1 to 48 hours, preferably of from about 2 to 4 hours. For in vitro applications, the delivery of nucleic acids can be to any cell grown in culture, including primary cell and immortalized cell lines, whether of plant or animal origin, vertebrate or invertebrate, and of any tissue or type. In preferred embodiments, the cells will be animal cells, more preferably mammalian cells, and most preferably human cells. In one group of preferred in vitro embodiments, a lipid-nucleic acid composition suspension is added to 60-80% confluent plated cells. The concentration of the suspension added to the cells is preferably of from about 0.01 to 0.2 g/mL, more preferably about 0.1 g/mL. Typical applications include using well known transfection procedures to provide intracellular delivery of DNA or mRNA sequences which code for therapeutically useful polypeptides. However, the compositions can also be used for the delivery of the expressed gene product or protein itself. In this manner, therapy is provided for genetic diseases by supplying deficient or absent gene products (i.e., for Duchennes dystrophy, see Kunkel, et al., Brit. Med. Bull. 45(3) 2 630-643 (1989), and for cystic fibrosis, see Goodfellow, Nature 341:102-103 (1989)). Other uses for the compositions of the present invention include introduction of antisense oligonucleotides in cells (see, Bennett, et al., Mol. Pharm. 41:1023-1033 (1992)). The compositions of the present invention can also be used for the transfection of cells in vivo, using methods which are known to those of skill in the art. In particular, Zhu, et al., Science 261:209-211 (1993), incorporated herein by reference, describes the intravenous delivery of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression plasmid using DOTMA-DOPE complexes. Hyde, et al., Nature 362:250-256 (1993), incorporated herein by reference, describes the delivery of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene to epithelia of the airway and to alveoli in the lung of mice, using liposomes. In one group of embodiments, the in vivo administration of the pharmaceutical compositions is carried out parenterally, e.g., intraarticularly, intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly. More preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intravenously by a bolus injection for delivery to vascular endothelial cells, by intraperitomal injection for delivery to peritoneal macrophages or cells lining the peritoneal cavity, or by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection for delivery to antigen-presenting cells for purposes of eliciting an immune response. For example, see Stadler, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,286,634, which is incorporated herein by reference. Intracellular nucleic acid delivery has also been discussed in Straubringer, et al., METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY, Academic Press, New York. 101:512-527 (1983); Mannino, et al., Biotechniques 6:682-690 (1988); Nicolau, et al., Crit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst. 6:239-271 (1989), and Behr, Acc. Chem. Res. 26:274-278 (1993). In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical preparations described herein may be contacted with the target tissue by direct application of the preparation to the tissue. The application may be made by topical, open or closed procedures. By topical, it is meant the direct application of the pharmaceutical preparation to a tissue exposed to the environment, such as the skin, oropharynx, external auditory canal, and the like. Open procedures are those procedures that include incising the skin of a patient and directly visualizing the underlying tissue to which the pharmaceutical preparations are applied. This is generally accomplished by a surgical procedure, such as a thoracotomy to access the lungs, abdominal laparotomy to access abdominal viscera, or other direct surgical approach to the target tissue, for example, heart tissue and/or associated vasculature may be transfected with a gene of interest in conjunction with heart surgery, as an adjunct therapy. Closed procedures are invasive procedures in which the internal target tissues are not directly visualized, but accessed via inserting instruments through small wounds in the skin. For example, the preparations may be administered to the peritoneum by needle lavage or to the vasculature using a balloon catheter. Likewise, the pharmaceutical preparations may be administered to the meninges or spinal cord by infusion during a lumbar puncture followed by appropriate positioning of the patient as commonly practiced for spinal anesthesia or metrazamide imaging of the spinal cord. Alternatively, the preparations may be administered through endoscopic devices. In yet other embodiments, the lipid-nucleic acid complexes can be administered in an aerosol inhaled into the lungs (see, U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,662). For a general review of applicable techniques, see Culver, HUMAN GENE THERAPY, MaryAnn Liebert, Inc., Publishers, New York. pp.70-71 (1994). The methods of the present invention may be practiced in a variety of hosts. Preferred hosts include mammalian species, such as humans, non-human primates, dogs, cats, cattle, horses, sheep, and the like.

Example 3 This example illustrates the derivatization of the free alcoholic hydroxyl group present in the certain of the compounds of the invention. This derivatization proceeds as displayed in Scheme 1. Briefly, the final cyclized product is reacted with methane sulfonate to afford a reactive intermediate. This intermediate is then reacted with an amine, such as ethanolamine to provide derivatives analogous to that shown in Scheme 1. Example 4 This example provides an evaluation of the cationic lipid prepared in Example 1. Experimental Protocol Two mice studies have been performed for the evaluation of cationic lipids of the present invention, in comparison with DOTIM (see, Liu, et al., Nature Biotechnology 15:167-173 (1997)). In brief, the lipid combinations were tested as carriers for gene transfer by intravenous delivery in ICR female mice (25 g), and expression was determined using the plasmid p4119 containing the CAT reporter gene under the control of the HCMV promoter. The lipids were dissolved in a mixture of chloroform and methanol (1:1). Lipid films of cationic and neutral lipid (either cholesterol or DLPE) at a 1:1 molar ratio were formed with a rotary evaporator. The films were hydrated with 5% dextrose in water (D5W) at room temperature and extruded through a series of membranes having pore sizes of 400 nm, 200 nm, and 50 nm. DNA-liposome complexes were prepared at a 1:6 DNA:cationic lipid ratio (mg DNA per mole cationic lipid) by adding the DNA, in a solution at 0.625 mg/mL concentration in D5W to the solution of liposomes, in an equal volume, with constant stirring, using a Hamilton Dilutor 540B (Hamilton, Reno, Nev.). DOTIM:cholesterol was used at a 1:6 DNA:cationic lipid ratio. The DNA solution was 0.3125 mg/mL DNA in D5W. The resulting complexes were sized using a Submicron Particle Sizer 370 (Nicomp, Santa Barbara, Calif.). Zeta potential was determined by a Zeta Plus, Zeta Potential Analyzer (Brookhaven Instrurtents Corp.). A total of 5 mice were tested per group. A dose of 62.5 g p4119 plasmid DNA in 200 L D5W was injected by tail vein per mouse. The lungs were harvested after 24 hours and assayed for CAT protein by ELISA assay. Each organ was homogenized in 1.0 mL of 5 mM EDTA/0.25M Tris-HCl pH 7.8 containing 5 g/mL Aprotinin (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.), 5 g/mL Leupeptin (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.), and 5 mM PMSF (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.). The resulting extracts were centrifuged and aliquots of the supernatant were removed for protein analysis, utilizing a bicinchoninic acid based reagent kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.). The remaining supernatant was heat treated at 65 C. for 15 min. The CAT activity assay was performed using 5 L of heat treated supernatant, 25 L of 125 g/mL n-Butyryl CoA (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), 50 L of 5 Ci/mL 14 C-chloramphenicol (DuPont NEN, Boston, Mass. ) and 50 L of 0.25 M Tris-HCl/5 mM EDTA. Samples were incubated at 37 C. for 2 h. An addition of 300 L of mixed xylenes (Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wis.) was made followed by vortexing and centrifugation at 14K rpm for 5 min. The xylene layer was then transferred into 750 L of 0.25 M Tris-HCl/5 mM EDTA, vortexed, and centrifuged at 14K rpm for 5 min. The upper organic phase was then transferred into scintillation vials containing 5 mL of Ready Safe Liquid Scintillation Cocktail (Beckman, Fullerton, Calif.). Samples were counted for 1 min each. Results Results for evaluation of Compound 1, Compound 2, and DOTIM versus control (D5W) are provided in Table 1. TABLE 1 Composition DNA/Lipid Ratio Number Expressed D5W (Control) 1:6 0/2 DOTIM/CHOL 1:6 5/5 Compound 1/CHOL 1:6 5/5 Compound 1/DLPE 1:6 3/5 Compound 2/CHOL 1:6 0/5 Compound 1/Chol showed similar lung CAT expression (2693.94 pg CAT/mg soluble protein) compared to that of DOTIM/Chol (2072.15 pg CAT/mg soluble protein). However, in a repeated protocol, the lung expression of Compound 1/Chol was 400.22 pg CAT/mg soluble protein. This difference may be due to the variation among different animal studies. These results indicate that Compound 1 retained the in vivo activity of DOTIM. Both cholesterol and DLPE were used as additional lipids in the mice protocols since both have previously been shown to be useful helper lipids for delivery to lung endothelium by IV delivery. Compound 1/Chol compositions showed better activity than Compound 1/DLPE in both protocols. Therefore, for IV administration, cholesterol is the preferred helper lipid for Compound 1. Compound 2 is the stearoyl derivative of DOTIM, which contains no double bond. No significant lung expression was observed for Compound 2/Chol in mice, indicating that the double bonds of oleoyl derivatives can increase the in vivo activity. Example 3 This example provides an evaluation of Compound 1 as a suitable lipid in DNA:lipid complexes for transfection in rabbits. 3.1 Protocol Pilot studies were conducted to assess the suitability of rabbits as a development model for delivery of lipid:DNA complexes. The study confirmed that rabbits offer the ability to express transfected genes as well as display some anticipated toxicity endpoints. Under suitable conditions, the rabbit was found to develop a dose-responsive vascular leak syndrome with the added advantage of expressing the CAT reporter protein. The lung was found to be the target organ for the complexes following IV delivery. 3.1a. Dosing for evaluation of Compound 1 A dosing scheme for 4 rabbits is provided in Table 2. TABLE 2 Rabbit Material Dose Route/Delivery 1 Compound 1/CAT 2.0 mg/kg IV/0.5 mL/min 2 Compound 1/CAT 1.5 mg/kg IV/0.5 mL/min 3 Compound 1/CAT 0.5 mg/kg IV/0.5 mL/min 4 Compound 1 highest vol. IV/0.5 mL/kg A 2 mL blood sample is collected immediately prior to dose delivery for serum collection and another 2 mL for a CBC/clinical chemistry screen. Sufficient blood is also collected at necropsy to perform a CBC and clinical chemistry screen and preserve serum (minimum of 8 mL). Approximately 24 hours after dosing the animals are euthanized using a barbiturate overdose. Following euthanasia, body weights are determined and an examination is made for the presence of pleural fluid. Any fluid present is harvested while avoiding blood contamination. Total protein and albumin levels are determined on the pleural fluid. Tissues are collected and preserved as follows: lung tissue (8 vials in liquid nitrogen, 2 lobes infused with formalin, and optionally 2 Whirlpaks in dry ice); liver tissue (multiple sites in formalin); kidney tissue (multiple sites in formalin); spleen tissue (multiple sites in formalin); heart tissue (multiple sites in formalin); and multiple serum samples (6 mL minimum in dry ice). 3.2 Results Animals received the doses provided in Table 2 with no indication of distress. No lesions were noted in animals receiving just the lipid (Compound 1). The animal receiving just the lipid had diffusely red lungs which failed to collapse and no airway foam or excessive pleural fluid was noted. Very scant (normal) levels of pleural fluid were present in all animals. Small amounts of this fluid were collected from rabbits 1 and 3 for routine protein determinations. Example 4 The compound of Formula III (Compound 2) was compared to Compound 1 for the ability to transfect lung cells according to the methods described in Example 2. Both compounds were formulated with cholesterol as the neutral lipid and plasmid p4119, and complexes injected IV into five mice each as described in Example 2. The CAT ELISA showed a mean CAT expression level of 853.20 (pg/mg) (/571.52) for Compound 2, compared to a mean of 306.09 (pg/mg) (/252.610 for Compound 1. CAT ELISA (pg/mg or mL) for each of the rabbits was as follows: Rabbit 1, 10244.7 lung and 6665.9 serum; Rabbit 2, 963.8 lung and 1637.1 serum; Rabbit 3, 88.5 lung and 0 serum; Rabbit 4, 0 lung and 0 serum.

PREPARATION EXAMPLES Example 1 (Process (a)) For 45 minutes, ozone is introduced into a mixture of 8.7 g (22 mmol) of 1-4-cyano-2-fluoro-5-(2-methoxycarbonyl-ethenyl)-phenyl-3,6-dihydro-2,6-di oxo-3-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-1(2H)-pyrimidine and 600 ml of methylene chloride which had been cooled to 70 C. The cooling bath is then removed and the mixture is admixed with 10 ml of dimethyl sulphide. Once the mixture has warmed to room temperature (approximately 20 C.), the phases are separated and the organic phase is washed with water, dried with sodium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated under water pump vacuum, the residue is digested with diethyl ether and the crystalline product is isolated by filtration with suction. This gives 7.4 g (99% of theory) of 1-(4-cyano-2-fluoro-5-formyl-phenyl)-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-3-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-1(2H)-pyrimidine of melting point 177 C. Example 2 (Process (b)) At room temperature (approximately 20 C.), a mixture of 1.0 g (2.9 mmol) of 1-(4-cyano-2-fluoro-5-formyl-phenyl)-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-3-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-1(2H)-pyrimidine, 0.25 g (3.0 mmol) of 0-methyl-hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 0.25 g (3.0 mmol) of sodium acetate and 20 ml of ethanol is stirred for approximately 90 minutes. The mixture is concentrated under water pump vacuum and the residue is taken up in water, admixed with 2N hydrochloric acid and extracted with diethyl ether. The organic phase is dried with sodium sulphate and filtered. The solvent is then carefully distilled off from the filtrate under water pump vacuum. This gives 0.8 g (74% of theory) of 1-(4-cyano-2-fluoro-5-methoximinomethylphenyl)-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-3-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-1(2H)-pyrimidine of melting point 80 C. Example 3 (Process c)) At approximately 10 C., 0.28 g of hydrogen peroxide (30% strength) and 0.59 g of conc. sulphuric acid are mixed, stirred at approximately 20 C. for about 2 hours and then added to a mixture of 1.0 g (2.9 mmmol) of 1-(4-cyano-2-fluoro-5-formyl-phenyl)-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-3-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-1(2H)-pyrimidine and 20 ml of methanol. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature (approximately 20 C.) for about 15 hours, and the crystalline product is isolated by filtration with suction. This gives 0.70 g (62% of theory) of 1-(4-cyano-2-fluoro-5-dimethoxymethylphenyl)-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-3-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-1(2H)-pyrimidine of melting point 164 C. By the methods of Preparation Examples 1 to 3 and in accordance with the general description of the preparation processes according to the invention, it is also possible to prepare, for example, the compounds of the formula (I) listed in Table I below.

The reaction mixture is then allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred at this temperature for 18 hours. The mixture is subsequently, after addition of 20 ml of 1N hydrochloric acid, extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic phase is dried with sodium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated and the residue is worked up by column chromatography. This gives 2.8 g (65% of theory) of 1-4-cyano-2-fluoro-5-(2-chloro-2-methoxycarbonyl-ethyl)-phenyl-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-3-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-1(2H)-pyrimidine of melting point 46 C. 0.22 g of sodium hydride (60% strength) are added with stirring to a mixture of 2.0 g (4.6 mmol) of 1-4-cyano-2-fluoro-5-(2-chloro-2-methoxycarbonyl-ethyl)-phenyl-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-3-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl- 1 (2H)-pyrimidine and 30 ml of N,N-dimethyl-formamide which had been cooled to 0 C., and the reaction mixture is stirred initially at 0 C. for 15 minutes, then at 20 C. for approximately 60 minutes and finally at 60 C. for 6 hours. The mixture is then concentrated under water pump vacuum, the residue is stirred with diisopropyl ether and the crystalline product is isolated by filtration with suction. This gives 1.1 g (60% of theory) of 1-4-cyano-2-fluoro-5-(2-methoxycarbonyl-ethenyl)-phenyl-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-3-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-1(2H)-pyrimidine of melting point 154 C.

The mixture is then concentrated under water pump vacuum, the residue is shaken with 1N hydrochloric acid/ethyl acetate and the organic phase is separated off, dried with sodium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated under water pump vacuum and the residue is worked up by column chromatography (silica gel, chloroform/ethyl acetate, vol.: 1:1). In addition to unreacted 1-(4-cyano-2-fluoro-5-trifluoroacetylamino-phenyl)-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-3-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-1(2H)-pyrimidine (first fraction: 0.30 g), 0.2 g (50% of theory) of 1-(4-cyano-2-fluoro-5-amino-phenyl)-3,6-dihydro-2,6-dioxo-3-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl-1(2H)-pyrimidine is obtained as second fraction.

arylalkylsulfonylamino, each of which is optionally substituted. The invention further relates to methods for producing said compounds and their use as herbicides. TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to novel substituted iminoalkoxy-phenyluracils, to processes for their preparation and to their use as herbicides. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Certain substituted aryluracils, such as, for example, the compound 3-4-chloro-2-fluoro-5-(2-oxo-propoxy)-phenyl-1-methyl-6-trifluoromethyl-(1H,3H)-pyrimidine-2,4-dione, are already known from the (patent) literature (cf. EP 255047). However, these compounds have hitherto not obtained any particular importance. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention, accordingly, provides novel substituted iminoalkoxy-phenyluracils of the general formula (I) in which R 1 represents hydrogen, amino or optionally substituted alkyl, R 2 represents carboxyl, cyano, carbamoyl, thiocarbamoyl or represents in each case optionally substituted alkyl or alkoxycarbonyl, R 3 represents hydrogen, halogen or optionally substituted alkyl, R 4 represents hydrogen, cyano, thiocarbamoyl or halogen, R 5 represents cyano, thiocarbamoyl or halogen, R 6 represents hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl, R 7 represents optionally substituted alkyl, and R 8 represents hydroxyl, amino or represents in each case an optionally substituted radical from the group consisting of alkyl, alkoxy, alkylamino, dialkylamino, alkylcarbonylamino, alkoxycarbonylamino, alkylsulphonylamino, alkenyl, alkinyl, alkenyloxy, alkinyloxy, aryl, aryloxy, arylamino, arylcarbonylamino, arylsulphonylamino, arylalkyl, arylalkylamino, arylalkylcarbonylarnino or arylalkylsulphonylamino. The novel substituted iminoalkoxy-phenyluracils of the general formula (I) are obtained when substitued oxoalkoxy-phenyluracils of the general formula (II) in which R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 and R 7 are as defined above, are reacted with amino compounds of the general formula (III) H 2 NR 8 (III) in which R 8 is as defined above or with acid adducts of compounds of the general formula (III) if appropriate in the presence of a reaction auxiliary and if appropriate in the presence of a diluent, and electrophilic or nucleophilic substitution reactions or addition reactions within the scope of the definition of the substituents are subsequently carried out, if appropriate. The compounds of the general formula (I) can be converted by customary methods into other compounds of the general formula (I) in accordance with the above definition, for example by amination or alkylation (for example R 1 : HNH 2 , HCH 3 ), reaction with dicyanogen or hydrogen sulphide (for example R 5 : BrCN, CNCSNH 2 , cf. the Preparation Examples). The novel substituted iminoalkoxy-phenyluracils of the general formula (I) have strong and selective herbicidal activity. In the definitions, the saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon chains, such as alkyl, alkenyl or alkinyl, are in each case straight-chain or branched. Halogen generally represents fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably fluorine, chlorien or bromine, in particular fluorine or chlorine. The invention preferably provides compounds of the formula (I) in which R 1 represents hydrogen, amino or optionally cyano-, fluorine-, chlorine- or C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy-substituted C 1 -C 6 -alkyl, R 2 represents carboxyl, cyano, carbamoyl, thiocarbamoyl or represents in each case optionally cyano-, fluorine-, chlorine- or C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy-substituted C 1 -C 4 -alkyl or C 1 -C 4 -alkoxycarbonyl, R 3 represents hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine or optionally fluorine- or chlorine-substituted C 1 -C 4 -alkyl, R 4 represents hydrogen, cyano, thiocarbamoyl, fluorine, chlorine or bromine, R 5 represents cyano, thiocarbamoyl, fluorine, chlorine or bromine, R 6 represents hydrogen or optionally cyano-, fluorine-, chlorine- or C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy-substituted C 1 -C 6 -alkyl, R 7 represents optionally cyano-, fluorine-, chlorine- or C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy-substituted C 1 -C 6 -alkyl, and R 8 represents hydroxyl, represents amino or represents in each case optionally carboxyl-, cyano-, halogen-, C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy- or C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy-carbonyl-substituted alkyl, alkoxy, alkylamino, dialkylamino, alkylcarbonylamino, alkoxycarbonylamino or alkylsulphonylamino having in each case 1 to 6 carbon atoms, R 8 furthermore represents in each case optionally halogen-substituted alkenyl, alkinyl, alkenyloxy or alkinyloxy having in each case 3 to 6 carbon atoms, or R 8 furthermore represents in each case optionally nitro-, cyano-, carboxyl-, halogen-, C 1 -C 4 -alkyl-, C 1 -C 4 -halogenoalkyl-, C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy- or C 1 -C 4 -halogenoalkoxy-substituted aryl, aryloxy, arylamino, arylcarbonylamino, arylsulphonylamino, arylalkyl, arylalkylamino, arylalkylcarbonylamino or arylalkylsulphonylamino having in each case 6 or 10 carbon atoms in the aryl moiety and optionally 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety. The invention in particular relates to compounds of the formula (I) in which R 1 represents hydrogen, represents amino or represents in each case optionally cyano-, fluorine-, chlorine-, methoxy- or ethoxy-substituted methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl, n-, i-, s- or t-butyl, R 2 represents carboxyl, cyano, carbamoyl, thiocarbamoyl or represents in each case optionally cyano-, fluorine-, chlorine-, methoxy- or ethoxy-substituted methyl, ethyl, methoxycarbonyl or ethoxycarbonyl, R 3 represents hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine or represents in each case optionally fluorine- or chlorine-substituted methyl or ethyl, R 4 represents hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine, R 5 represents cyano, thiocarbamoyl, chlorine or bromine, R 6 represents hydrogen or represents in each case optionally cyano-, fluorine-, chlorine-, methoxy- or ethoxy-substituted methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl, n-, i-, s- or t-butyl, R 7 represents in each case optionally cyano-, fluorine-, chlorine-, methoxy- or ethoxy-substituted methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl, n-, i-, s- or t-butyl, and R 8 represents hydroxyl, represents amino, or represents in each case optionally carboxyl-, cyano-, fluorine-, chlorine-, methoxy-, ethoxy-, n- or i-propoxy-, methoxycarbonyl-, ethoxycarbonyl-, n- or i-propoxycarbonyl-substituted methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl, n-, i-, s- or t-butyl, methoxy, ethoxy, n- or i-propoxy, n-, i-, s- or t-butoxy, methylamino, ethylamino, n- or i-propylamino, n-, i-, s- or t-butylamino, dimethylamino, diethylamino, acetylamino, propionylamino, methoxycarbonylamino, ethoxycarbonylamino, methylsulphonylamino or ethylsulphonylamino, or R 8 furthermore represents in each case optionally fluorine-, chlorine- or bromine-substituted propenyl, butenyl, propinyl, butinyl, propenyloxy, butenyloxy, propinyloxy or butinyloxy, or R 8 furthermore represents in each case optionally nitro-, cyano-, carboxyl-, fluorine-, chlorine-, bromine- methyl-, ethyl-, n- or i-propyl-, n-, i-, s- or t-butyl-, trifluoromethyl-, methoxy-, ethoxy-, n- or i-propoxy-, n-, i-, s- or t-butoxy-, difluoromethoxy-, trifluoromethoxy-substituted phenyl, phenoxy, phenylamino, benzoylamino, phenylsulphonylamino, benzyl, benzylamino, benzylcarbonylamino or benzylsulphonylamino. The abovementioned general or preferred radical definitions apply both to the end products of the formula (I) and, correspondingly, to the starting materials or intermediates required in each case for the preparation. These radical definitions can be combined with each other as desired, i.e. including combinations between the given preferred ranges. Using, for example, 3-4-chloro-2-fluoro-5-(2-oxo-propoxy)-phenyl-1-methyl-6-trifluoromethyl-(1H,3H)-pyrimidine-2,4-dione and O-methylhydroxylamine as starting materials, the course of the reaction in the preparation process according to the invention can be illustrated by the following scheme: The formula (II) provides a general definition of the oxoalkoxy-phenyluracils to be used as starting materials in the process according to the invention for preparing compounds of the formula (I). In the formula (II), R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 and R 7 preferably or in particular have those meanings which have already been mentioned above, in connection with the description of the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention as being preferred or as being particularly preferred for R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 and R 7 . The starting materials of the general formula (II) are known and/or can be prepared by known processes (cf. EP 255047, Preparation Examples). The formula (III) provides a general definition of the amino compounds further to be used as starting materials in the process according to the invention. In the formula (III), R 8 preferably or in particular has that meaning which has already been mentioned above, in connection with the description of the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention, as being preferred or as being particularly preferred for R 8 . It is also preferably possible to use adducts of compounds of the formula (III) with strong acids, in particular with mineral acids, such as, for example, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide or sulphuric acid, in the process according to the invention.

PREPARATION EXAMPLES Example 1 A mixture of 1.5 g (3.31 mmol) of 3-4-bromo-2-fluoro-5-(1-methyl-2-oxo-propoxy)-phenyl-1-methyl-6-trifluoromethyl-(1H,3H)-pyrimidine-2,4-dione, 0.30 g (3.31 mmol) of O-methyl-hydroxylamine, 0.30 g of sodium acetate and 20 ml of ethanol is stirred at room temperature (approximately 20 C.) for one hour and then concentrated under water-pump vacuum. The residue is taken up in water, adjusted to a pH between 2 and 3 using 1N hydrochloric acid and shaken with diethyl ether. The organic phase is washed with water, dried with sodium sulphate and filtered. The solvent is then carefully distilled off from the filtrate under water pump vaccum. This gives 1.5 g (94% of theory) of 3-4-bromo-2-fluoro-5-(1-methyl-2-methoximino-propoxy)-phenyl-1-methyl-6-trifluoromethyl-(1H,3H)-pyrimidine-2,4-dione as an amorphous residue. Example 2 Under an atmosphere of argon, a mixture of 0.90 g (1.86 mmol) of 3-4-bromo-2-fluoro-5-(1-methyl-2-methoximino-propoxy)-phenyl-1-methyl-6-trifluoromethyl-(1H,3H)-pyrimidine-2,4-dione, 0.11 g of zinc(II) cyanide, 0.08 g of tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0) and 10 ml of N,N-dimethyl-formamide is heated at 80 C.-90 C. for 8 hours. After addition of a further 0.1 g of zinc(II) cyanide and 0.07 g of tetrakis-(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0), the mixture is heated at 80 C.-90 C. for a further 30 hours. The mixture is then shaken with 1N hydrochloric acid and ethyl acetate, and the organic phase is separated off and concentrated under water pump vaccum. The residue is purified by column chromatography (silica gel, hexane/ethyl acetate, vol. 4/1). This gives 0.40 g (50% of theory) of 3-4-cyano-2-fluoro-5-(1-methyl-2-methoximino-propoxy)-phenyl-1-methyl-6-trifluoromethyl-(1H,3H)-pyrimidine-2,4-dione as an amorphous product.

The mixture is subsequently shaken with 1N hydrochloric acid, and the organic phase is separated off, dried with sodium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated under water pump vacuum, the residue is digested with petroleum ether and the resulting crystalline product is isolated by filtration with suction. This gives 30.4 g (90% of theory) of N-(4-bromo-2-fluoro-5-ethoxycarbonyloxyphenyl) O-ethyl carbamate of melting point 79 C.

After cooling, the mixture is shaken with 1N hydrochloric acid/ethyl a cetate, and the organic phase is separated off, dried with sodium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated under water pump vacuum and the residue is purified by column chromatography (silica el, chloroformethyl acetate, vol. 7/3). This gives 12.6 g (37% of theory) of 3-(4-bromo-2-fluoro-5-hydroxy-phenyl)-6-trifluoromethyl-(1H,3H)-pyrimidine-2,4-dione as an amorphous product. Precursor 3 A mixture of 3.0 g (8.13 mmol) of 3-(4-bromo-2-fluoro-5-hydroxy-phenyl)-6-trifluoromethyl-(1H,3H)-pyrimidine-2,4-dione, 1.06 g (10 mmol) of 3-chloro-2-butanone, 2.34 g of potassium carbonate and 50 ml of acetonitrile is heated under reflux for 3 hours and subsequently concentrated under water pump vacuum. The residue is stirred with 1N hydrochloric acid/petroleum ether and the resulting crystalline product is isolated by filtration with suction.

apoptosis even on the apoptosis-resistant cancer cells, there are obtained polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin represented by the following general formula (I) wherein R denotes a hydroxyl group for polyoxypeptin, or R denotes a hydrogen atom for deoxypolyoxypeptin, by cultivation of Streptomyces sp. MK498-98F14 strain. Polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin are physiologically active substances which have an activity of inducing apoptosis on a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell, AsPC-1 cell. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to novel physiologically active substances, polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin, which have each an anti-cancer activity and an antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. Polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin according to this invention are physiologically active substances which have an activity of inducing apoptosis not only on such human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells of a type susceptible to apoptosis and capable of causing apoptosis by treatment with an anti-cancer drug, but also have an activity of inducing apoptosis on such human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells of a type resistant to apoptosis even upon the treatment with the anti-cancer drug, for example, on AsPC-1 cell, whereby polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin possess anti-cancer or anti-tumor activities. This invention also relates to a process for the production of polyoxypeptin and/or deoxypolyoxypeptin. This invention further relates to an anti-tumor or anti-cancer composition containing polyoxypeptin or deoxypolyoxypeptin as active ingredient. Further, this invention embraces, as a novel microorganism, Streptomyces sp. MK498-98F14 strain which has a characteristic nature capable of producing the physiologically active substances above-mentioned. BACKGROUND ART Apoptosis is such a schemed death of cells, of which a particular feature is an immediate death of cells. In 1970s, apoptosis was reported as a new conception for the death of cells see Int. Rev. Cytol., 68, 251(1980). As compared with a necrosis which was an old conception for the death of cells already known in the art, apoptosis is characterized in that the period of time lapsed between the time of impartment of a stimulus of causing the death of cells by apoptosis and the time of occurrence of the death of cells by apoptosis is shorter than that for the necrosis, and also that apoptosis does involve no inflammation in the peripheral tissues of the cancer region, and so on. Afterwards, there have been reported that many anti-cancer drugs such as adriamycin and cisplatin have the activities of inducing the apoptosis on some of incubated cancer cells Cancer Res., 53, 1845 (1993) and Exp. Cell Res., 211, 231 (1994). However, it has become clear now that adriamycin or cisplatin as the anti-cancer drug can have an activity of inducing the apoptosis of cells on the leukemia cells and on the experimental cancer cells which were artificially generated by carcinogen virus and the like, but that adriamycin or cisplatin does not induce apoptosis on many of the spontaneously generated human solid cancer cells see Rinsho Igaku, 21, No.9, 42-45 (1995). That is to say, there exist such human solid cancer cells which possess such property of not inducing the apoptosis by the anti-cancer drugs known and utilized in the art, and which are of the apoptosis-resistant type. An human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell, AsPC-1 cell, is a cancer cell described in In Vitro, 18, 24 (1982), and AsPC-1 cell exhibits a very strong apoptosis-resistance against such anti-cancer drugs as adriamycin, etc. While, another human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell, BxPC-3 cell described in Cancer Investigation, 4, 15 (1986), is susceptible to apoptosis. For example, it is already known that adriamycin can induce apoptosis on BxPC-3 cell within 24 hours from the start of treatment with adriamycin at the concentration of 3 g/ml, but adriamycin does not induce apoptosis on AsPC-1 cell even at the concentration of 30 g /ml of adriamycin. In the past, nothing was known about such investigations which seek for the drugs capable of inducing the apoptosis on the apoptosis-resistant cancer cells such as the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell, AsPC-1 cell. In the clinical applications of conventional anti-cancer drugs of the type which can exhibit a cytotoxicity against cancer cells, it is considered that the in vivo contact time between the conventional anti-cancer drug and the cancer cells is a limited one. Thus, it is deducible that a more effective agent would be such an anti-cancer drug which is capable of inducing the apoptosis of cancer cells and thereby capable of making the cell death to be caused on the cancer cells in a shorter time than the conventional anti-cancer drug. It is further demanded to explore such a novel anti-cancer drug which is capable of inducing apoptosis and which is effective to cause apoptosis to effect even on such type of cancer cells insusceptible to induction of immediate death of cells by apoptosis, as long as they are treated by the known anti-cancer drug. It is therefore demanded now to provide such novel compounds which have an activity of inducing apoptosis effectively even on cancer cells of such type insusceptible to induction of apoptosis (immediate death of cells) when treated with the known anti-cancer drugs. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION We, the present inventors, have now made our investigations with the intention of providing some novel compounds which have activities to induce apoptosis strongly on cancer cells and which are thus useful to treat therapeutically the cancer. In this connection, we have an expectation that such physiologically active substance capable of inducing the apoptosis even on the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell, AsPC-1 cell, can exhibit a usefully effective anti-cancer activity, seeing that the AsPC-1 cell cannot induce apoptosis by the treatment with the conventional anti-cancer drug. Thus, we have made investigations to detect novel compound(s) having an activity of inducing the apoptosis on the AsPC-1 cell out of the metabolic products of microorganisms. As a result, we have now found that when such a strain of microorganism belonging to genus Streptomyces which we have newly isolated from a soil sample and we have allotted a strain No. MK498-98F14 is incubated, said strain has produced in the resulting culture broth such a substance which is capable of inducing apoptosis on the AsPC-1 cells. Then, we have successfully isolated this substance having the apoptosis-inducing activity and have studied on the physico-chemical properties and physiological activities of said substance, to find out that this substance be a novel compound. Thus, we have designated this compound as polyoxypeptin. We have further found that a second substance capable of inducing apoptosis on the AsPC-1 cells was also produced and present in the culture broth of the MK498-98F14 strain above-mentioned. We have successfully isolated the second compound, too. Then, we have studied on the physico-chemical properties and physiological activities of the second substance to find out that the second substance be a novel compound. Further, we have succeeded in deciding the chemical structures of polyoxypeptin firstly obtained, as well as the second substance subsequently obtained. We have then designated the second substance as deoxypolyoxypeptin. We further have confirmed that deoxypolyoxypeptin has an apoptosis-inducing activity. Further, we have recognized that polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin can be represented collectively by a general formula (I) as shown below. It has further been found that polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin can be reacted at the site of acidic group thereof with an inorganic base or an organic base to form a salt, for example, sodium salt, potassium salt and an alkylamine salt. According to a first aspect of this invention, therefore, there is provided, as the novel physiologically active substance, polyoxypeptin or deoxypolyoxypeptin, which is a compound represented by the following general formula (I) wherein R denotes a hydroxyl group for polyoxypeptin or R denotes a hydrogen atom for deoxypolyoxypeptin, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin according to the first aspect of this invention have the physiological activities given below. (1) Estimation of the Apoptosis-inducing Activity on Human Pancreatic Cancer Cell, AsPC-1 Cell A cell suspension containing the AsPC-1 cells suspended in an RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 10% FBS was prepared, and 500 l-portion each of the cell suspension was placed in a 24-well plastic plate in a proportion of 110 5 cells/well. The cell suspension was incubated at 37 C. under 5% CO 2 for 1 day. The AsPC-1 cells adhered onto the bottom surface of each well. Subsequently, polyoxypeptin or deoxypolyoxypeptin was added to the liquid culture medium present in each well so as to give the substance under test at a concentration of 3, 100 or 300 g/ml. The cells were incubated for 24 hours. Immediately after the incubation for 24 hours, the supernatant liquid (500 l) of the culture medium remaining in each well was removed from each well of said plastic plate and discarded. Then, the plastic plate was washed twice with a PBS buffer solution (each 300 l), and the washings were discharged. Thereafter, a trypsin-EDTA buffer solution (200 l) was added to said plastic plate, and the incubation was effected at 37 C. under CO 2 -free condition so as to peel the cells off from the plate. The cells so peeled were transferred to an Eppendorf tube. The Eppendorf tube was centrifuged (2400 rpm, 10 minutes) to deposit the cells down, and the super-natant was removed and discarded. A fresh amount of the liquid culture medium was added to the cells. An 80 l-portion of the resulting cell suspension as formed in said tube was taken into another Eppendorf tube, to which were then added 20 l of Trypan Blue staining solution (containing 4 mg/ml of Trypan Blue and 9 mg/ml of NaCl). The cell suspension was taken out from the resulting mixture by a pipette, and the cell suspension so pipetted was placed on a hemocytometer (made by Elma Co.). The cell sample was observed under a microscope of 100 magnifications. The number of the dead cells as blue-colored amongst the cells under observation, and the total number of whole cells under observation were counted. The survival rate (%) of the cells was calculated by an equation of 100(number of dead cells total number of tested cells)100. As a result, it was found that polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin each have an IC 50 value of 80 ng/ml, namely the value of such concentration of said compound at which the cell death by apoptosis can be induced at the rate of 50% of the total cell number of the AsPC-1 cells under test. It was also found that polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin each induced the apoptosis on the AsPC-1 cells in approximately 24 hours after the drug treatment. (2) Estimation of the Activity Inhibitory to the Proliferation of Human Pancreatic Cancer Cell, AsPC-1 Cell A cell suspension of AsPC-1 cells suspended in an RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 10% FBS was prepared, and 100 l-portion each of said cell suspension was placed in a 96-well plastic plate in a proportion of 310 3 cells/well. Each plate was then incubated at 37 C. under a 5% CO 2 for 1 day. Subsequently, polyoxypeptin or deoxypolyoxypeptin was added to the liquid culture medium present in each well at a concentration of 1, 3, 10, 30 or 100 ng/ml of said compound. Then the incubation of the cells was effected for 2 days. Then, the number of cells was counted by MTT assay method. As a result, it was found that the concentration each of polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxy -peptin at which the proliferation of AsPC-1 cells was inhibited by 50%, that is, IC 50 value, was amounting to 15 ng/ml. (3) Estimation of the Cytocidal Activity Against Various Cancer Cells Various cancer cells as shown in Table 1 below were incubated for 24 hours on such culture medium as shown in the table which contained polyoxypeptin or deoxypolyoxypeptin added at various concentrations. After staining with Trypan Blue, the number.of the dead cells was counted, and the concentration of polyoxypeptin or deoxypolyoxypeptin required to kill 50% of the total number of cells of the cancer cells under test, namely the value of IC 50 , was calculated therefrom. Both polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin showed a same level of the IC 50 value. The IC 50 values calculated are shown in Table 1. It is found that the above-mentioned compounds so tested have the cyotocidal activities against various cancer cells shown in the following table.

Polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin exhibited an antibacterial activity against a gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus , at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 6.2512.5 g/ml. However, they did not exhibit any antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli. (5) Acute Toxicity Polyoxypeptin of this invention, when administered once to mice(4 mice per group) by intravenous injection, exhibited an LD 50 value of 67.5 g/mouse. Deoxypolyoxypeptin as administered similarly exhibited an LD 50 value of 125 g/ mouse. Further, according to a second aspect of this invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of physiologically active substances, polyoxypeptin and/or deoxypolyoxypeptin, characterized in that the process comprises cultivating a polyoxypeptin- and deoxypolyoxypeptin-producing strain belonging to the genus Streptomyces, and recovering from the resulting culture polyoxypeptin or deoxypolyoxypeptin or both of them. The polyoxypeptin- and deoxypolyoxypeptin-producing strain to be used in the process of this invention may be any one of any species, so far as it has an ability to produce polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin. Said strains can be chosen from a wide variety of microorganisms. Of those micro-organisms, there is exemplified, as one concrete example of preferred polyoxypeptin- and deoxypolyoxypeptin-producing strain, the strain belonging to Actinomycetes which was separated by the inventors of this invention in November, 1995 at Biseibutsu Kagaku Kenkyujo, from a soil sample collected at Mateyama, Shiragami-dake in A-omori Prefecture, Japan, and to which was allotted a strain number MK498-98F14. The microbiological properties of MK498-98F14 strain are shown below. 1. Morphology MK498-98F14 strain has branched substrate mycelia, from which aerial hyphae develop with formation of whirls. Chain of the matured spores is in the form of chain comprising 10 to 50 or more of ovoid spores, measuring about 0. 50.80.813 microns. The surface of the spores is spinny. None of the whirl, mycelial strand, sporangium and motile spore is observed. 2.

Physiological Properties (1) Temperature Range for the Growing MK498-98F14 strain was incubated in a glucose-asparagine-agar medium (containing 1.0% glucose, 0.05% asparagine, 0.05% dipotassium hydrogen phosphate and 2.4% string agar, pH 7.0) at different temperatures of 10 C., 20 C., 24 C., 27 C., 30 C., 37 C. and 50 C. each. The result showed that the MK498-98F14 strain could grow at any of the temperatures except 10, 37 C. and 50 C. The optimum growth temperature seems to be in the vicinity of 30 C. (2) Hydrolysis of Starch (starch-inorganic salt-agar medium, ISP- medium 4 and starch-agar medium, cultured at 27 C. for each medium) No hydrolysis of starch was observed for incubation of 21 days in each medium. (3) Formation of Melanin Pigment (Trypton-yeast-broth, ISP-medium 1; peptone-yeast-iron agar medium, ISP-medium 6; tyrosine-agar medium, ISP-medium 7, cultured at 27 C. for each medium) The formation of melanin was negative in all the media used. (4) Utilization of Carbon Sources (Pridham-Gottlieb agar medium, ISP-medium 9, cultured at 27 C.) D-glucose, D-fructose and rhamnose are utilizable for the growth, but the utilization of L-arabinose and inositol is indefinite, and xylose, sucrose, raffinose and D-mannitol are not utilizable. (5) Reduction of Nitrate (aqueous peptone solution containing 0.1% potassium nitrate, ISP-medium 8, cultured at 27 C.) The reduction is positive. Summarizing the above-mentioned properties, MK498-98F14 strain is characterized in that it has branched substrate, from which aerial hyphae develop with formation of whirls, that the chain of matured spores comprises 10 to 50 or more of spores of oval shape, the surface of which surface is spinny, that on various culture media, aerial hyphae of white to grayish white in color are formed on the growth of pale yellow to pale yellowish brown in color, that soluble pigment tinged faint brown is observed on ISP-medium 5, but no soluble pigment is observed on any other media, that the optimum growth temperature is in the vicinity of 30 C., and that the formation of melannoid pigment is negative. In addition, 2,6-diaminopimelic acid contained in the cell wall is of the LL-form. Menaquinone as the cell component contains MK-9(H 4 ) and MK-9(H 6 ). In view of these properties, it is supposed that MK498-98F14 strain belongs to the genus Streptomyces. When searching the analogous known species with reference to the properties of this strain, there may be mentioned Streptomyces viridodiastatics (Literature: International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, 19, 500 (1969)), Streptomyces ambofaciens (Literature: International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, 18, 290 (1968)), Streptomyces rubiginosus (Literature: International Journal of Syster aLatic Bacteriology, 18, 374(1968)) and Streptomyces albogriseolus (Literature: International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, 18, 289 (1968)). Thus, we intend to actually study and examine by MK498-98F14 strain in direct comparison with the above-mentioned four strains which have been preserved in our Research Laboratory. At this time, MK498-98F14 strain is designated as Streptomyces sp. MK498-98F14. The strain MK498-98F14 was applied to be deposited in the Japanese depository National Institute of Bioscinence and Human-Technology, Agency of Industrial Science Technology, which locates at Tsukuba-City, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, and said strain has been deposited as of Apr. 18, 1997 under FERM P-16200. Further, the strain MK498-98F14 has been deposited since May 25, 1998 under the deposit number of FERM BP-6374 in terms of Budapest Treaty. In practicing the process according to the second aspect of this invention, a polyoxypeptin- and deoxypolyoxypeptin producing strain belonging to the genus Streptomyces, particularly MK498-98F14 strain (deposited under FERM BP-6374), is inoculated to a nutrient culture medium and incubated therein. The nutrient culture medium used here may be one containing carbon source and nitrogen source as the nutrients which are assimilable with the said strain. As the nutrient sources, there may be used such those which are ordinarily used as the nutrient sources of microorganisms, and which are for example, assimilable nutrient sources such as carbon sources, nitrogen sources, norganic salts and the like. For example, there may be used such carbon sources which are carbohydrates, including glucose, maltose, molasses, dextrin, glycerin, starch and the like, as well as oils and fats, including soybean oil, peanut oil and the like. As nitrogen sources, there may be used peptone, meat extract, cotton seed meal, soybean powder, yeast extract, casein, corn steep liquor, NZ-amine, ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride and the like. Further, inorganic salts may be added to the culture medium, such as dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium phosphate, sodium chloride, calcium carbonate, magnesium sulfate, manganese chloride and the like. If necessary, trace amount of metals, for example, cobalt, iron, etc. may also be added. In addition, any other known nutrient source may be used, as long as the strain used is capable of utilizing such nutrient source for the production of polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin. The proportions of the above-mentioned nutrient sources to be incorporated in the culture medium are not particularly limited, but may vary over a wide range. The optimum compositions and proportions of the nutrient sources to be incorporated can easily be determined through simple small-scale experiments by those skilled in the art, depending upon the nature of polyoxypeptin- and deoxypolyoxypeptin-producing strain to be used. The nutrient culture medium comprising the above-mentioned nutrients may be sterilized before the cultivation of the strain is conducted. It is advantageous to adjust the pH of the culture medium to a range f 78, particularly to a range of 7.07.5 before or after the sterilization of the culture medium. The cultivation of the polyoxypeptin- and deoxypolyoxypeptin-producing strain in such a nutrient culture medium may be effected in accordance with any conventional method ordinarily used in the production of antibiotics by the genus Actinomyces. Preferably, the cultivation may be carried out under aerobic conditions, usually under stirring and/or under aeration. As the cultivation method, there may be usable any of stationary cultivation, shaking cultivation and submerged cultivation under aeration and stirring. The submerged cultivation is suitable for the purpose of large scale production of polyoxypeptin and/or deoxypolyoxypeptin. The available cultivation temperature is not specifically limited, so far as it is within the range of temperature at which the growth of the polyoxypeptin- and deoxypolyoxypeptin-producing strain is substantially not prevented and thus polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin can be produced. The cultivation temperature may suitably be chosen depending upon the nature of the strain used, and a particularly preferred cultivation temperature may be in the range of 2530 C. The cultivation may usually be continued until sufficient amount of polyoxypeptin and/or deoxypolyoxypeptin has been accumulated in the culture. The cultivation period of time may vary depending upon the composition of the culture medium, cultivation temperature, the antibiotic-producing strain as used, and so on. Usually, the cultivation for 72150 hours may give the target antibiotics. The accumulated amount of the novel substances, polyoxyvpeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin during the cultivation may be quantitatively determined by using Staphylococcus aureus Smith in accordance with a cup-plate method which is conventionally used for quantitative determination of antibiotics. Polyoxypeptin and/or deoxypolyoxypeptin thus accumulated in the resultant culture is then recovered therefrom. In order to recover the intended substances, the culture broth, after the above-mentioned cultivation, is subjected to a known process of separating the microbial cells, such as filtration, centrifugation, etc. to separate the mycelial cells, when necessary. Thereafter, the resulting broth filtrate or the mycelial cells may be treated by a solvent extraction method with an organic solvent, particularly ethyl acetate, or by a chromatography with utilizing adsorption or ion-exchange, or by a gel filtration or by counter current distribution, singly or in combination, whereby the target substances can be isolated and purified. As a carrier having the adsorbability or ion-exchangeability for use in such chromatography as above, there may be employed silica gel, porous polystyrene-divinylbenzene resin or various ion-exchange resins. The mycelial cells as separated or the disrupted mycelial cells may be treated by a solvent extraction method with a suitable organic solvent for discharging the intercellular components, so that the intended polyoxypeptin and/or deoxypolyoxypeptin can be extracted out from the cells. The target substances so extracted out may then be isolated and purified in the same manner as above. In this way, the novel substances, polyoxypeptin and/or deoxypolyoxypeptin having the above-mentioned characteristics can be obtained. Further, according to a third aspect of this invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising as an active ingredient the polyoxypeptin or deoxypolyoxypeptin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for the active ingredient. The pharmaceutical composition according to the third aspect of this invention may be such an anti-cancer or anti-tumor drug composition which is in the form of a mixture comprising as the active ingredient polyoxypeptin or deoxypolyoxypeptin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as uniformly blended with a conventional, solid or liquid and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, for example, ethanol or starch. Polyoxypeptin or deoxypolyoxypeptin or a salt thereof to be used as the active ingredient in the pharmaceutical composition according to the third aspect of this invention may be administered by orally or by parenterally, for instance by intravenous or intramuscular injection, etc. It may also be administered percutaneously. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition according to the third aspect of this invention may be prepared in the form of various preparations such as tablets, buccal tablets, troaches, capsules, suspensions, syrups and the like, by mixing polyoxypeptin or deoxypolyoxypeptin or a salt thereof as the active ingredient with a conventional solid or liquid carrier or carriers. The proportion of the compound of formula (I) above as the active ingredient present in the pharmaceutical composition according to the third aspect of this invention may vary depending upon the form of preparations. A convenient proportion of the active ingredient may be in the range of about 260% based on the weight of an administration unit of the composition. When the composition of the third aspect of this invention is to be prepared in the form of injection preparations, preferred form of the injectable preparations are, for example, a sterile aqueous dispersion or a sterile lyophilized preparation. As a liquid carrier used here, there may preferably be exemplified water, aqueous ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, vegetable oils and the like. When the composition of the third aspect of this invention is to be prepared in the form of dispersion preparations, the dispersed state of the ingredient active compound in the dispersion preparation can be kept well by giving the active ingredient compound a desired particle size, and by adding a viscosity-regulating agent such as lecithin. Further, it is preferred, in most cases, that the injection preparation contain an isotonic agent such as sugar or sodium chloride. The administration dosage of polyoxypeptin or deoxypolyoxypeptin or a salt thereof used in the pharmaceutical composition of this invention may vary depending upon the nature of diseases to be treated, the purpose of the treatment and the degree of disease symptom. However, the dosage may usually be 0.210 mg per day for adult, which may be administered once or several times. An optimal dose may be decided by those skilled in the art by conducting suitable preliminary tests. Further, according to a fourth aspect of this invention, there is provided a use of polyoxypeptin or deoxypolyoxypeptin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the preparation of the pharmaceutical composition. Furthermore, according to a fifth aspect of this invention, there is provided, as a novel microorganism, Streptomyces sp. MK489-98F14 strain having a characteristic nature capable of producing polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin above-mentioned.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION This invention is now illustrated further in detail by the following Example, but is not limited thereto. EXAMPLE 1 Production of physiologically active substances, polyoxypeptin and deoxypolyoxypeptin One hundred (100) ml-portion of a liquid culture medium comprising 1.0% glucose, 1.0% potato starch, 1.0% glycerol, 0.5% polypepton, 0.5% meat extract, 0.5% sodium chloride and 0.32% calcium carbonate(adjusted to pH 7.4) was poured into each of 500 ml-capacity Erlenmeyer flasks which each were 10 containing 1 drop of a silicone antifoaming agent. The flasks were then sterilized at 120 C. under a pressures of 2 atm. for 20 minutes. To the sterilized culture medium, was inoculated the MK498-98F14 strain (FERM BP-6374)of the genus Streptomyces from a slant culture thereof. The shake cultivation of said strain was effected at 27 C. at 180 r.p.m. under an aerobic condition. Thus, a culture broth was obtained. Four hundred liters of the culture broth so obtained from the cultivation for 96 hours were extracted once with the same volume of ethyl acetate without removal of the mycelia cells from the broth. The culture broth so once extracted was again extracted twice with a half volume of ethyl acetate. The resulting organic phase (the ethyl acetate extracts) was dried under a reduced pressure to yield 1.2 g of an oily substance. The oily substance obtained was dissolved in a small volume of chloroform, and the resulting solution was adsorbed on a small amount of silica gel 60 (a product of Merck Co.), followed by drying under a reduced pressure. The silica gel so dried was then placed on the top of a column of 60 g of silica gel 60 which had been equilibrated with hexane. Then, the silica gel column was eluted successively with mixtures of hexane-ethyl acetate in various ratios (1:0, 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:3, 1:5), while the eluate was collected in 500 ml-fractions. Further, the silica gel column was then eluted with mixtures of chloroform-methanol in various ratios (100:0, 100:2, 100:4, 100:6,100:8, 100:20) successively, while the eluate was collected in 500 ml-fractions. Of the eluate fractions so collected, the active fractions which had been collected upon the elution with the 1:3 mixture of hexane-ethyl acetate and with the 1:5 mixture of hexane-ethyl acetate, were combined and dried under a reduced pressure. The resulting solid obtained here (400 mg) was washed with a small volume of cold methanol and then dried under a reduced pressure. Thus, 330 mg of polyoxypeptin were obtained in the form of colorless crystals. Melting point: 244245 C. Further, the active fractions which had been collected upon the elution with the 100:4 mixture, 100:6 mixture and 100:8 mixture of chloroform-methanol above, were combined together and dried under a reduced pressure. The resulting solid obtained (360 mg) was again placed on the top of a column of silica gel 60 (18 g). This silica gal column was eluted successively with mixtures of toluene-acetone in various ratios (100:0, 20:1, 10:1, 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:5, 1:10, 1:30), while the eluate was collected in 150 ml-fraction each. Of these eluate fractions, the active fraction which was obtained upon eluting with the mixture of toluene-acetone (10:1)was dried under a reduced pressure. Thus, 15 mg of deoxypolyoxypeptin was obtained as colorless powder. Melting point: 157159 C.

In the abovementioned heteroaryl groups, examples of suitable heteroatoms are O, S, and N. Unless otherwise defined, heteroaromatic rings have 1-15 carbon atoms and 1-6 heteroatoms, preferably 1-5 carbon atoms and 1-2 heteroatoms. Examples of the heteroaryl groups mentioned in the above definitions are thiophene, furan, pyridine, pyrimidine, indole, quinoline, oxazole, isoxazole, thiazole, or isothiazole. The term alkyl is to be understood to mean straight-chain or branched hydrocarbon chains. Sugar residues are Be understood to mean compounds derived from aldoses and ketoses having 3 to 7 carbon atoms, which can belong to the D- or L-series; they also include amino sugars, sugar alcohols or sugar acids. Examples which may be mentioned are glucose, mannose, fructose, galactose, ribose, erythrose, glycerinaldehyde, sedoheptulose, glucosamine, galactosamine, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, gluconic acid, galactonic acid, mannonic acid, glucamine, 3-amino-1,2-propanediol, glucaric acid and galactaric acid. Disugars are to be understood as meaning saccharides which are composed of two sugar units. Di-, tri-, or tetrasaccharides are the result of an acetal-like linkage of 2 or more sugars. The linkages may occur in the - or -form. Examples which may be mentioned are lactose, maltose and cellobiose. If the sugar is substituted, then the substitution is preferably on the hydrogen atom of an OH group of the sugar. The following protective groups are essentially suitable for the hydroxyl groups of the sugars: benzyl, acetyl, benzoyl, pivaloyl, trityl, tert-butyidimethylsilyl, benzylidene, cyclohexylidene or isopropylidene protective groups.

W. Greene, P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York 1991). The following were typically used: t-butyloxy-carbonyl (BOC), 9-fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl (Fmoc), benzyloxy-carbonyl (Z), 2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)prop-2-yloxycarbonyl (Ddz), methyl, t-butyl, trityl, S-t-butyl. Pharmaceutically tolerated salts are especially suitable for medicinal applications owing to the fact that their solubility in water is better than the original compounds, or basic compounds. These salts must have a pharmaceutically tolerated anion or cation. Suitable pharmaceutically tolerated acid addition salts of the compounds according to the invention are salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, metaphosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulfonic acid and sulfuric acid, and of organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, benzene-sulfonic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, ethanesulfonic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, glycolic acid, isothionic acid, lactic acid, lactobionic acid, maleic acid, malic acid, methanesulfonic acid, succinic acid, p-toluene-sulfonic acid, tartaric acid and trifluoroacetic acid. The chloride salt is especially preferable for medicinal purposes. Suitable pharmaceutically tolerated basic salts are ammonium salts, alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium salts) and alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium salts). Salts with an anion which is not pharmaceutically tolerated also come within the scope of the invention as useful intermediates for the preparation or purification of pharmaceutically tolerated salts and/or for the use in nontherapeutic applications, for example, in vitro applications. The term physiologically functional derivative used herein designates any physiologically tolerated derivative of a compound of formula I according to the invention, for example an ester, which, upon administration to a mammal, such as, for example, humans, is capable (directly or indirectly) of forming a compound of formula I or an active metabolite thereof. The physiologically functional derivatives also include prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention. Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to give a compound according to the invention. These prodrugs may be active themselves or not. The compounds according to the invention may also exist in various polymorphous forms, for example as amorphous and crystalline polymorphous forms. All polymorphous forms of the compounds according to the invention come within the scope of the invention and are a further aspect of the invention. All references to compound(s) of formula (I) hereinbelow refer to a compound, or compounds, of formula (I) as described hereinabove and to their salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives as described herein. The quantity of a compound of formula (I) required for the achievement of the desired biological effect depends on a series of factors, for example, the specific compound chosen, desired use, the route of administration and the clinical condition of the patient. In general, the daily dose is from 0.1 mg to 100 mg (typically from 0.1 mg to 50 mg) per day per kilogram of body weight, for example 0.1-10 mg/kg/day. Tablets or capsules may contain, for example, 0.01 to 100 mg, typically 0.02 to 50 mg. In the case of pharmaceutically tolerated salts, the above weights relate to the weight of the aminopropanol ion derived from the salt. The compounds of formula (I) themselves can be used for prophylaxis or therapy of the abovementioned conditions in the form of a compound, but they are preferably present together with a tolerated excipient in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Naturally, the excipient must be tolerated in the sense that it is compatible with the other components of the composition and is not harmful to the patient. The excipient can be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably formulated together with the compound as a unit dose, for example a tablet which may contain 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active substance. Other pharmaceutically active substances may also be present, including other compounds of formula (I). The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be prepared by one of the known pharmaceutical methods, which consist essentially in mixing the components with pharmacologically tolerated excipients and/or auxiliaries. Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are those which are suitable for oral and peroral (for example sublingual) administration, even though the most suitable route of administration depends in each individual case on the nature and severity of the condition to be treated and on the nature of the compound used in each case. Sugar-coated formulations and sugar-coated slow-release formulations also fall within the scope of the invention. Acid-resistant and enteric formulations are preferred. Suitable enteric coatings encompass cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate and anionic polymers of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate. Suitable pharmaceutical compounds for oral administration can exist in separate units, for example capsules, wafers, lozenges or tablets, each of which contains a specific quantity of the compound of formula (I); in the form of powder or granules; in the form of a solution or suspension, in an aqueous or nonaqueous fluid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. As has already been mentioned, these compositions are prepared by any suitable pharmaceutical method which encompasses a step in which the active substance and the excipient (which may consist of one or more additional components) are brought into contact with each other. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and homogeneously mixing the active s~stance with a liquid and/or finely divided solid excipient, whereupon the product can be shaped, if so required. For example, a tablet can be prepared by compressing or shaping a powder or granule of the compound, if appropriate together with one or more additional components. Compressed tablets can be prepared by tableting the compound in free-flowing form, such as, for example, a powder or granules, if appropriate as a mixture with a binder, glidant, inert diluent and/or one (or more) surfactant/dispersant, in a suitable machine. Shaped tablets can be prepared by shaping the pulverulent compound with an inert liquid diluent, in a suitable machine. Pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for peroral (sublingual) administration encompass lozenges which comprise a compound of formula (I) together with a flavoring, usually sucrose and gum arabic or tragacanth, and pastilles, which comprise the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerol or sucrose and gum arabic. The invention furthermore also relates to isomer mixtures of formula I and to the pure diastereomers of formula I. The invention furthermore relates to processes for the preparation of propanolamine derivatives of formula I. Shown above is a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I, wherein R 4 -substituted imines are prepared from amines of type II and aldehydes of type III R 4 having the meaning given for formula I. To this end, for example, the amine II and the aldehyde III are reacted in substance or in a suitable solvent such as ethanol, toluene or acetic acid without or with addition of an acid, for example p-toluenesulfonic acid, at temperatures of 20-150 C. (a). Keto compounds of formula VII which are substituted by radicals R 1 and R 2 , where R 1 and R 2 have the meanings given in formula I, are prepared by processes known from the literature or similarly to such processes. For example, picolin derivatives V are metalated with a suitable base, such as n-butyllithium, and reacted in tetrahydrofuran or another suitable solvent with the corresponding carboxylic acid derivatives VI, for example as carboxylic dialkylamides or carboxylic esters (radical X), at temperatures between 80 and 20 C. (b). Compounds of type VIII are obtained by reacting imines of type IV and ketones of type VII, in each case substituted with radicals R 1 , R 2 and R 4 , whereby R 1 , R 2 and R 4 have the meaning given for formula I. This reaction can be carried out, for example, by mixing the two compounds in substance, without solvent, and subsequent heating, or in a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride, ethanol, toluene, diglyme or tetradecane at temperatures from 20 C. to 150 C. (c). The racemic compounds of type VIII are resolved into the pure diastereomers of types IX and X with the aid of a chiral column (for example using camphanic acid, pentaacetylgluconic acid, camphor-10-sulphonic acid, O-methylmandelic acid or lactic acid), by crystallization, or by chromatography (d). The keto compounds of type IX or X are reduced in a suitable solvent, such as, for example, methanol, THF or THF/water, using NaBH 4 or another suitable reducing agent, at temperatures between 30 and 40 C. to give hydroxy compounds of type XI, it being possible for these compounds to be substituted by the radicals R 1 , R 2 and R 4 , R 1 , R 2 and R 4 having the meaning given for formula I (e). The chiral column was cleaved in a suitable solvent such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, THF or THF/water, under basic or acidic conditions, such as, for example, using KOH, NaOH or HCl. The nitro group was subsequently reduced to the amine by processes known from the literature, and compounds of type XII with the radicals R 1 , R 2 and R 4 are obtained (f). The amino compounds of type XII are reacted with the alkyl or acyl radicals R 3 ZY, where Y represents a leaving group, using methods known from the literature, and compounds of the formula I are obtained (g). If XZY, where X is a protective group, is employed as the alkyl or acyl radical, intermediates are obtained which can be reacted with further alkyl or acyl radicals R 3 Y to give compounds of the formula I (h). The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and physiologically functional derivatives are ideal pharmaceuticals for the treatment of disorders of the lipid metabolism, in particular of hyperlipidemia. The compounds of formula I are also suitable for influencing the serum cholesterol level and for the prevention and treatment of arteriosclerotic phenomena. If appropriate, the compounds may also be administered in combination with statins such as, for example, simvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin or atorvastin. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 illustrates the stereochemistry of Example 1h as determined by X-ray crystallography. The following findings confirm the pharmacological efficacy of the compounds according to the invention. The compounds according to the invention were tested in a biotest by determining the inhibition of 3 H-taurocholate uptake in rabbit ileum cuticular layer membrane vesicles. The inhibitory test was carried out as follows: 1. Preparation of Rabbit Ileum Cuticular Layer Membrane Vesicles Cuticular layer membrane vesicles were prepared from ileum cells by the so-called Mg 2 precipitation method. Male New Zealand rabbits (body weight 2 to 2.5 kg) were sacrificed by intravenous injection of 0.5 ml T, an aqueous solution of 2.5 mg of tetracaine HCl, 100 mg of embutramide and 25 mg of mebezonium iodide. The ileum was removed and washed with ice-cold physiological saline. The terminal 7/10th of the ileum (measured in the oral-rectal direction, i.e., the terminal ileum, which contains the active Na -dependent bile acid transport system) were used for preparing the cuticular layer membrane vesicles. The intestines were frozen in polymer bags at 80 C. under nitrogen. To prepare the membrane vesicles, the frozen intestines were defrosted in a water bath at 30 C. The mucosa was scraped off and suspended in 60 ml of ice-cold 12 mM TRIS/HCl buffer (pH 7.1)/300 mM mannitol, 5 mM EGTA/10 mg/l phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/1 mg/l soybean trypsin inhibitor (32 (U/mg)/0.5 mg/l bovine lung trypsin inhibitor (193 U/mg)/5 mg/l bacitracin. After the mixture had been diluted to 300 ml with ice-cold distilled water, it was homogenized in an Ultraturrax (rod 18, IKA Werk Staufen, Germany) for 3 minutes at 75% of maximum speed, with ice-cooling. After 3 ml of 1 M MgCl 2 solution had been added (final concentration 10 mM), the mixture was left to stand at 0 C. for exactly 1 minute. The addition of Mg 2 causes the cell membranes to aggregate and precipitate with the exception of the cuticular layer membranes. After centrifugation for 15 minutes at 3000g (5000 rpm, SS-34 rotor), the precipitate was discarded, and the supernatant, which contains the cuticular layer membranes, was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 48,000g (20,000 rpm, SS-34 rotor). The supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was rehomogenized in 60 ml of 12 mM TRIS/HCl buffer (pH 7.1)/60 mM mannitol, 5 mM EGTA using a Potter Elvejhem homogenizer (Braun, Melsungen, 900 rpm, 10 strokes). After addition of 0.1 ml of 1 M MgCl 2 solution and incubation for 15 minutes at 0 C., the mixture was again centrifuged for 15 minutes at 3000g. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged for a further 30 minutes at 48,000g (20,000 rpm, SS-34 rotor). The precipitate was taken up in 30 ml of 10 mM TRIS/HEPES buffer (pH 7.4)/300 mM mannitol and resuspended to homogeneity by 20 strokes in a Potter Elvejhem homogenizer at 1000 rpm. After centrifugation for 30 minutes at 48,000g (20,000 rpm, SS-34 rotor), the precipitate was taken up in 0.5 to 2 ml of TRIS/HEPES buffer (pH 7.4)/280 mM mannitol (final concentration 20 mg/ml) and resuspended with the aid of a Tuberkulin syringe using a 27-gauge cannula. The vesicles were either used immediately after the preparation for transport tests or stored in 4-mg portions in liquid nitrogen at 1 96 C. 2. Inhibition of Na -dependent 3 Htaurocholate Uptake in Ileum Cuticular Layer Membrane Vesicles The uptake of substrates into the above-described cuticular layer membrane vesicles was determined by means of the so-called membrane filtration technique. 10 l of the vesicular suspension (100 g protein) were pipetted as drops onto the wall of a polystyrol incubation tube (1170 mm), which contained the incubation medium together with the relevant ligands (90 l). The incubation medium contained 0.75 l0.75 Ci 3 H(G)taurocholate (specific activity: 2.1 Ci/mMol), /0.5 l 10 mM taurocholate/8.75 l sodium transport buffer (10 mM TRIS/HEPES, (pH 7.4)/100 mM mannitol/100 mM NaCl) (Na-T-P) or 8.75 l potassium transport buffer (10 mM TRIS/HEPES (pH 7.4)1100 mM mannitol/100 mM KCl) (K-T-P) and 80 of the inhibitor solution in question, dissolved in Na/T buffer or K/T buffer, respectively, depending on the experiment. The incubation medium was filtered through a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane filter (SYHV LO 4NS, 0.45 m, 4 mm , Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). The transport measurement was started by mixing the vesicles with the incubation medium. The taurocholate concentration in the incubation batch was 50 M. After the desired incubation time (normally 1 minute), the transport was stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold quenching solution (10 mM TRIS/HEPES, (pH 7.4)/150 mM KCl). The resulting mixture was removed immediately by suction in a vacuum of 25 to 35 mbar through a cellulose nitrate membrane filter (ME 25, 0.45 m, diameter 25 mm, Schleicher Schuell, Dassell, Germany). The filter was rinsed with 5 ml of ice-cold quenching solution. To measure the uptake of radiolabeled taurocholate, the membrane filter was dissolved in 4 ml of the scintillator Quickszint 361 (Zinsser Analytik GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany), and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation measurement in a TriCarb 2500 (Canberra Packard GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany) apparatus. After the apparatus had been calibrated with the aid of standard samples and any chemiluminescence which may have been present had been corrected, the measured values were obtained as dpm (decompositions per minute). The control values were determined in each case in Na-T-P and K-T-P. The difference between the uptake in Na-T-P and K-T-P represented the Na -dependent transport. The term IC 50 Na was used to designate the inhibitor concentration at which the Na -dependent transport was inhibited by 50% relative to the control. The pharmacological data encompass a test series in which the interaction of the compounds according to the invention with the intestinal bile acid transport system in the terminal ileum was investigated. The results are shown in Table 1. Tables 1 and 2 show measured values (Biolog. Test) of the inhibition of 3 H-taurocholate uptake in rabbit ileum cuticular layer membrane vesicles. The data given are the quotients of the IC 50Na values of the reference substance as taurochenodesoxycholate (TCDC) and the test substance in question. TABLE 1 Empirical formula Bio. Ex.

Materials and Methods 3.1 Animals and Housing The experimental animals used are male C57L mice (Jackson Laboratories) with an average body weight of 25-30 g at the beginning of the adaptation. The animals were randomly divided into 4 groups (n10, groups 2 and 3 n15). Starting at the beginning of the treatment, the mice were either fed a standard rodent feed by Altromin (group 1), or a lithogenic diet by Altromin (groups 2-4); this diet was composed as follows: 15% butter, 1% cholesterol, 50% sugar, 20% casein, 0.5% cholic acid, 5% mineral mix, 2.5% vitamin mix, 2% corn oil, corn starch to 100%. The animals were weighed weekly, and the food consumption was determined by continuous weighings before and after, whereby the dose was calculated. 3.2. Final Examination After 11 and 13 weeks, respectively, the animals of each group were sacrificed and the gallbladders subsequently prepared. Gallstones in the gallbladder were then recorded. The gallbladder was dissected, the weight was determined, and the composition of the bile and the gallstones was analyzed. The results are given in Table 3.

Results The measurement values in Table 3 reveal that the compounds according to the invention efficiently prevent the formation of gallstones. They are therefore suitable both for the prophylaxis and for the treatment of gallstones. Selected examples of Table 1, full structure The examples which follow are intended to illustrate the invention in greater detail, without limiting the latter to the products and embodiments described in the examples. EXAMPLE A1 Ex. 9 of Table 1 0.7 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid were added to a solution of 25 g (266 mmol of 2-aminopyridine and 40 g (265 mmol) of 2-nitrobenzaldehyde in 300 ml of toluene, and the mixture was refluxed for 6 hours. After cooling, half of the solvent was removed in vacuo and left to stand overnight. The resulting precipitate was filtered off with suction, washed with cold toluene and dried in vacuo. Subsequent recrystallization from n-heptanelethyl acetate 2:1 gave 48.8 g (81%) of the imine. C 12 H 9 N 3 O 2 (227.2) MS (FAB) 228.2 MH 250 ml of n-butyllithium (15% in hexane) were added dropwise at 55 C. to a solution of 50 g (0.54 mol) of 2-picolin in 770 ml of tetrahydrofuran, and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes. The mixture was subsequently warmed to 0 C. and, after a further 30 minutes, cooled to 55 C. A solution of 77 g (0.52 mol) of N,N-dimethylbenzamide in 570 ml of tetrahydrofuran was subsequently slowly added dropwise. After the addition, the mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 1 hour. After addition of 500 ml of water and 35 ml of concentrated HCl, the organic phase was separated off and the aqueous phase was extracted twice with ethyl acetate. After drying over MgSO 4 , it was concentrated in vacuo and the residue was distilled in a high vacuum. Boiling point 134-136 C./0.3 mbar. Yield: 47.5 g (47%) of the ketone. C 13 H 11 NO (197.2) MS (FAB) 198.1 MH 200 g (0.89 mol) of the imine of Example 1a and 171 g (0.88 mol) of the ketone of Example 1b were dissolved in dichloromethane under reflux. After the starting materials have dissolved, the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature. The reaction solution was diluted with 600 ml of ethyl acetate and 300 ml of n-heptane. This solution was filtered with the aid of a glass frit (1 liter) filled with 500 ml of flash silica gel, and washed with 500 ml of n-heptane/ethyl acetate (1:2). The filtrate was concentrated, and 370 g of crude product were obtained. The crude product was a mixture of all four possible stereoisomers. The two desired cis products 1c/d were obtained by crystallization from ethanol. To this end, the crude product was dissolved in 600 ml of ethanol and left to stand for two days at room temperature; this gave 190 g of product 1c/d. A further 106 g of product 1c/d was isolated from the mother liquor after a further five days. The stereoisomers exist in solution in an equilibrium. The pair of enantiomers 1c/1d was sparingly soluble in ethanol and crystallized out of solution, while the trans pair of enantiomers was soluble in ethanol. Yield 296 g (79%) 1c/1d as yellowish crystals. C 25 H 20 N 4 O 3 (424.2) MS (FAB) 425.1 MH 33 g (153 mmol) of ()-camphanic chloride CAMCI (Fluka) were dissolved in 500 ml of methylene chloride and the solution was cooled to 10 C. 50 ml of triethylamine were added to this solution. Then, 52.3 g (123 mmol) of crystalline ketone of Example 1c/d were slowly added in such a way that the reaction temperature does not exceed 20 C. The end of the reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography (approx. 30 minutes). The reaction solution was diluted with 500 ml of ethyl acetate and washed with water, dried over MgSO 4 , filtered and concentrated. The organic phase was concentrated until 1f started to crystallize. It was then filtered, and 32.5 g (44%) of 1f were obtained as a white solid. The mother liquor was diluted with 500 ml of n-heptanelethyl acetate (4:1) and reconcentrated until product 1e started to crystallize again. This gave 32 g (44%) of 1e as colorless crystals. C 35 H 32 N 4 O 6 (604.7) MS (FAB) 605.3 MH 8.5 g (14.1 mmol) of the keto compound of Example 1e were dissolved in 150 ml of THF/water 10:1, the solution was treated with 2.0 g (53 mmol) of sodium borohydride and everything was stirred for 10 hours at room temperature. The pH was brought to 1 using 2 N HCl and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at 50 C. After cooling, the reaction mixture was rendered alkaline with 2 N NaOH and extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The organic phases were dried over MgSO 4 and concentrated until the crystallization of 1 g started. Yield: 3.6 g of white crystals. The mother liquor was concentrated further, and a second fraction of 1 g (2.45 g) was isolated. The total yield was 6.05 g (71%) of 1 g. 1f was reacted in an analogous procedure, which gave 1h as colorless crystals. The stereochemistry of Example 1h was determined by X-ray structural analysis as shown in FIG. 1 . C 35 H 34 N 4 O 6 (606.7) MS (FAB) 607.3 MH 50 g of KOH were dissolved in 500 ml of ethanol. 57 g (94 mmol) of the camphanic acid derivative 19, dissolved in 500 ml of methylene chloride, were added to this solution at room temperature. After 2 hours, the mixture was subjected to aqueous work-up, which gives 44.3 g of crude product. This crude product was dissolved in 750 ml of methylene chloride, and 7.5 g of palladium on charcoal (10%) were added. After a hydrogenation time of 10 hours, the hydrogen uptake was complete (approximately 6.5 l). The reaction solution was filtered through silica gel and washed with 400 ml of methanol. After the solvent was evaporated on a rotary evaporator, 40 g of crude product were obtained. This was recrystallized from ethyl acetate/n-heptane, which gave 25.2 g of 1i as colorless crystals (68% in 2 steps). Also, the mother liquor gave 10 g of an amorphous fraction of 1i, with a purity of 80-90%. C 25 H 24 N 4 O (396.49) MS (FAB) 397.2 MH Optical rotation () D 20 59 0 (C1, in CH 2 Cl 2 ) 8.0 g (18.8 mmol) of penta-O-acetyl-D-gluconic chloride ( Org. Synth ., Volume 5, 887) were added to a suspension of 8.0 g (40 mmol) of 11 -aminoundecanoic acid (Fluka) in 150 ml of anhydrous DMF. This suspension was stirred vigorously for 20 hours at room temperature. 500 ml of ethyl acetate and 200 ml of water were then added. The aqueous phase was reextracted with 250 ml of ethyl acetate. The combined organic phase was washed three times with sodium chloride solution, dried over MgSO 4 , filtered and concentrated, yielding 9.5 g (86%) of 1j as colorless oil. Thin layer chromatography in a mobile phase of methylene chloride/methanol/concentrated ammonia, 30/10/3, gave an R f of 0.8. C 27 H 43 NO 13 (589.6) MS (FAB) 590.4 MH 27 g (45.8 mmol) of 1j and 16 g (40.3 mmol) of 1i were dissolved in 300 ml of DMF (dimethylformamide). 20 g (61 mmol) of TOTU (Fluka), 7 g (50 mmol) of oxime (ethyl hydroxyiminocyanoacetate; Fluka) and 17 ml (150 mmol) of NEM (4-ethylmorpholine) were added in succession. After one hour at room temperature, the mixture was diluted with 1000 ml of ethyl acetate and washed three times with water. The organic phase was dried over MgSO 4 , filtered and concentrated.

C 52 H 65 N 5 O 13 (968.1) MS (FAB) 968.7 MH 37.1 g (38.3 mmol) of 1k were dissolved in 300 ml of methanol. After addition of 3 ml of a methanolic 1 M sodium methoxide solution, the mixture was left to stand for one hour at room temperature. It was then neutralized with methanolic HCl solution and concentrated. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (methylene chloride/methanol/concentrated ammonia 30/5/1), and 24.5 g (84%) of A1 (Ex. 9 of Table 1) were obtained as amorphous solid.

After one hour at 0 C., the mixture was diluted with 500 ml of ethyl acetate and washed three times with water. The organic phase was dried over MgSO 4 , filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by means of flash chromatography (ethylacetate/n-heptane 2:1), and 9.9 g (62%) of 2a were obtained as amorphous solid. C 36 H 43 BrN 4 O 2 (643.7) MS (FAB) 643.3 MH 9.87 g (15.3 mmol) of 2a were dissolved in 200 ml of DMF. After addition of 14 g (77 mmol) of glucamine (Fluka), the solution was heated for two hours at 80 C. It was then diluted with 500 ml of ethyl acetate and washed three times with water. The organic phase was dried over MgSO 4 , filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by means of flash chromatography (methylene chloride/methanol/concentrated ammonia 30/5/1), and 7.3 g (65%) of A2 were obtained as an amorphous solid. C 42 H 57 N 5 O 7 (743.9) MS (FAB) 744.4 MH EXAMPLE A3 92 g (0.43 mol) of 1-(3,5-dimethylisoxazol4-yl)-2-pyridin-2-yl-ethanone (prepared as described for Example 1b, but using ethyl 3,5-dimethyl-isoxazolylcarboxylate instead of N,N-dimethylbenzamide) were dissolved in 1200 ml of hot ethanol. 96.7 g of the imine of Example 1a were added at room temperature, and the reaction mixture was stirred for three days at room temperature. After a few hours, a pale yellow solid started to precipitate. In order to isolate the reaction product, the precipitated solid was filtered off, which provided 118.9 g (63%) of pale yellow crystals of melting point 139-140 C. C 24 H 21 N 5 O 4 (443.5) MS (FAB) 444.4 (MH ) 117 g (0.264 mol) of the ketone of Example 3a were reduced by means of sodium borohydride following the procedure described in Example 1 g/h. The resulting crude product was purified by means of silica gel chromatography using a mixture of ethyl acetate/n-heptane in the ratio of 2:1 as the mobile phase. This gave 76 g (65%) of the strongly unpolar diastereomer of melting point 95 C.; in addition, small amounts of the other three possible diastereomers were also isolated. C 24 H 23 N 5 O 4 (445.5) MS (FAB) 446.3 (MH ) 44.5 g (0.1 mol) of the aminopropanol of Example 3b were dissolved in 1500 ml of ethanol and treated at 20 C. with 570 ml of 15% strength aqueous TiCl 3 solution. After the addition has ended, the mixture was stirred for 2.5 hours at room temperature. For work-up, the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, the residue which remains was extracted with dichloromethane/water and neutralized by adding NaHCO 3 , and insoluble titanium hydroxide was filtered off. After the organic phase was dried and concentrated under reduced pressure, the remaining residue was filtered through a short silica gel column (mobile phase ethyl acetate). The remaining residue, after the eluant was removed, crystallized upon stirring with diethyl ether in the form of colorless crystals. This gave 33.2 g (80%) of colorless crystals with a melting point 115 C. C 24 H 25 N 5 O 2 (415.5) MS (FAB) 416.4 (MH ) 6.2 g (0.015 mol) of the amino compound of Example 3c (strongly unpolar diastereomer, which, in turn, was present as a pair of enantiomers) were dissolved in 100 ml of absolute DMF and treated with 6.1 g (0.015 mol) of pentaacetyl-D-gluconic acid ( Org. Synth ., Volume 5, 887), 5.9 g of TOTU (Fluka), 2.1 g of ethyl hydroxyiminocyanoacetate and 5.9 ml of N-ethylmorpholine, with stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred for 20 hours at room temperature. For work-up, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the resulting crude product was extracted by means of water/dichloromethane using saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. After the organic phase was dried by means of Na 2 SO 4 and the extractant removed on a rotary evaporator, the mixture was chromatographed on silica gel (mobile phase ethyl acetate/n-heptane3:1). This gave both of the possible diastereomers in the form of colorless crystals: Unpolar diastereomer: 3.9 g (31%) of melting point 140 C. C 40 H 45 N 5 O 13 (803.8) MS (FAB) 804.1 (MH ) Polar diastereomer: 4.3 g (35%) of melting point 204 C. C 40 H 45 N 5 O 13 (803.8) MS (FAB) 804.1 (MH ) 3.5 g (4.4 mmol) of the unpolar diastereomer which was synthesized in Example 3d were reacted as described in Example A1(reaction time 1 hour; the reaction product is shown in Table 2 as Example 58). The crude product obtained after concentration was dissolved in 80 ml of 0.5M methanolic HCl and the solution was stirred for six hours at room temperature. It was subsequently concentrated under reduced pressure and extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 /water. The organic phase was dried by means of Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. This gave 1.8 g (98%) of colorless crystals. The compound was present in enantiomerically pure form (column CSP-Chiralpak AD, 2504.6, mobile phase n-hexane/ethanol10/1, purity 99.7%, ()-enantiomer), which was demonstrated with reference to the enantiomer which resulted from the analogous reaction of the polar diastereomer (Example 3d). C 24 H 25 N 5 O 2 (415.5) MS (FAB) 416.2 (MH ) 1.8 g (4.3 mmol) of the enantiomerically pure compound of Example 3e were reacted with the compound of Example 1j analogously to Example 1k. This gave 3.7 g (86%) of a pale yellow oil. C 51 H 66 N 6 O 14 (987.1) MS (FAB) 987.5 (MH ) 3.7 g (3.8 mmol) of the acetyl compound of Example 3f were deacylated as described in Example A1 (reaction time 2 hours) and worked up. After chromatography on silica gel (mobile phase CH 2 Cl 2 /methanol/NH 3 (33%)30/10/3), 1.78 g (60%) of colorless crystals of melting point 60 C. were obtained.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The preparation of the compounds of the present invention is illustrated in the following Scheme. The compounds of the present invention are readily prepared. With reference to the Scheme illustrated above, the starting compound of formula 2 is hygromycin A which may be prepared according to procedures known to those skilled in the art, such as by fermentation of Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 2388. The methyl ketone at 4 on the furanose sugar of the hygromycin A molecule can exist in the S configuration (hygromycin A) or R configuration (epi-hygromycin) on the furanose sugar. When published protocols are used as a model for fermentation and recovery of hygromycin A (U.S. Pat. No. 3,100,176; Antibiotic Chemotherapy (1953)3:1268-1278, 1279-1282), the hygromycin product is an approximately 3:1 mixture of hygromycin A (the 4-(S) epimer), with the beta-oriented methyl ketone on the furanose sugar, as drawn, and epi-hygromycin. It is known in the literature (Journal of Antibiotics 33(7), 695-704, 1980) that pure hygromycin A will convert to epi-hygromycin in alkaline solutions. By carefully controlling the pH below 6.9 during the fermentation, and the pH, temperature and solvent exposure during the purification process, the final recovered product may be improved to at least a 14:1 ratio of hygromycin A:epi-hygromycin. Using this material, substantially single isomers derived from the 4-(S) hygromycin may be prepared for use as templates for further synthetic modification. Hygromycin A enriched for the 4-(S) epimer is produced by fermentation of Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL2388, or mutants thereof, in media with pH controlled at less than 6.9, preferably 6.2 to 6.7, throughout the process. The medium contains assimilable sources of carbon, nitrogen and trace elements, as known to those skilled in the art. The fermentation is run at a temperature of about 25-35 C., preferably about 29 C. The fermentation is monitored, for example by high pressure liquid chromatography. Incubation is continued until the yield of the compound reaches a maximum, generally for a period of about 3 to 10 days, preferably about 4 to 6 days. The formation of epi-hygromycin is minimized during the purification process by using an aqueous buffer (rather than unbuffered water) and controlling the pH of the active streams to near 6.0. Epi-hygromycin formation is also minimized by minimizing the time the recovered material is subject to higher temperatures. Thus, where it is necessary to reduce solvent concentrations, it is preferred to dilute active streams with the aqueous buffer and avoid use of rotary evaporation at elevated temperatures. Also, as means of avoiding higher temperatures, a resin column may be used to concentrate the active solution prior to the final purification step in order to reduce the volume of solution that must be boiled. The final purification step in the process is the concentration of the active cuts to solids using vacuum and a bath temperature of about 35-50 C. The period in which the solution is subject to elevated temperatures may be minimized by boiling in stages. The compound of formula 1 where R 2 is defined as above, X 1 is CH 2 , X 2 is O and R 3 is H may be prepared through the corresponding ,-unsaturated ester intermediates derived from Wittig, Horner-Emmons or Peterson olefination of the C-5 ketone of hygromycin A. For instance, (carbethoxymethylene)triphenylphosphorane or (carbethoxyethylidene)triphenylphosphorane can be reacted with hygromycin A to provide the unsaturated ethyl ester. At this point the hydroxy groups of hygromycin A may be appropriately protected, for instance as their silyl ethers using an appropriate reagent such as triethylsilyl chloride (TESCl), trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) or tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBDMSCl) and an amine base, such as imidazole or pyridine. This compound may then be reduced, for instance with diisobutyl aluminum hydride, and deprotection of the hydroxyl groups may be carried out by use of acid, such as acetic acid or fluoride ion, such as TBAF. The compounds of formula 1 where R 1 is H and where R 2 is defined as above, X 1 is CH 2 , X 2 is O and R 3 is H can be prepared through the corresponding ,-unsaturated ester intermediates derived from Wittig, Horner-Emmons or Peterson olefination of the C-5 ketone of 2-deoxy-pentaprotected hygromycin A. In this process hygromycin A is prepared by protection of all of the hydroxy groups of hygromycin A, with the exception of the hydroxy at the 2 carbon (C-2), as their silyl ethers using an appropriate reagent such as triethylsilyl chloride (TESCl), trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) or tert-butyldimethysilyl chloride (TBDMSCl). The preferred method is 10 eq of TBDMSCl and imidazole in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at a temperature of 25-40 C. for 12-36 hours. The 2-deoxy-pentaprotected hygromycin A is then prepared by removal of the hydroxy group using the method of Barton et al., J. Chem Soc., Perkin Trans. I 1975, 1574. The preferred method in this case is the method of Gnu-Dellac et al., Carbohydrate Res. 1991, 216, 249. The aforementioned ,-unsaturated ester may then be prepared via a Wittig, Horner-Emmons or Peterson olefination of the C-5 ketone of 2-deoxy-pentaprotected hygromycin A. For instance, (carbethoxymethylene)triphenylphosphorane or (carbethoxyethylidene)triphenyl-phosphorane can be reacted with hygromycin A to provide the unsaturated ethyl ester. This compound may then be reduced, for instance with diisobutyl aluminum hydride, and deprotection of the hydroxyl groups may be carried out by use of acid, such as acetic acid or fluoride ion, such as TBAF. The compound of formula 1 where R 1 and R 2 are defined as above, X 1 is CH 2 , X 2 is O and R 3 is C(O)(CR 6 R 7 ) t (C 6 -C 10 aryl), wherein R 6 , R 7 and t are as defined above, may be prepared via acylation of protected hygromycin allyl alcohol described above; for example by treatment of said alcohol with XC(O)(CR 6 R 7 ) t (C 6 -C 10 aryl), wherein X is a leaving group such as Cl, Br or N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester, in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride, triethylamine or potassium tert-butoxide. The protecting groups may then be removed as above.

The protecting groups may then be removed as above. The compound of formula 1 where R 1 and R 2 are defined as above, X 1 is CH 2 , X 2 is O or S, t is 0 and R 3 is (CR 6 R 7 ) t (C 6 -C 10 aryl), wherein R 6 and R 7 are as defined above, may also be prepared via a Mitsunobu reaction.

L. Hughes, Org. Reactions (1992) 42 335. The resulting ether or thioether may then be deprotected as described above or in the case of the thioether may be oxidized, for instance with m-CPBA, and then deprotected as described above. The compound of formula 1 where R 1 and R 2 are defined as above, X 1 is CH 2 , X 2 is O and R 3 is C(O)NR 6 (CR 6 R 7 ) t (C 6 -C 10 aryl), wherein R 6 , R 7 and t are defined above, may be prepared by reacting protected hygromycin allyl alcohol, prepared as described above, with isocyanate OCNR 6 (CR 6 R 7 ) t (C 6 -C 10 aryl), in toluene at temperatures from 40 C. to 110 C., preferably 50-80 C. Addition of dimethylaminopyridine and triethylamine to the reaction may be advantageous. The protecting groups may then be removed as above. The compound of formula 1 where R 1 and R 2 are defined as above, X 1 is CH 2 , X 2 is N and R 3 is defined as above, with the proviso that nitrogen is not adjacent to a carbonyl functionality, may be prepared via reduction amination of protected hygromycin aldehyde, prepared by the oxidation of the allyl alcohol above: (1) the allyl alcohol may be oxidized, for example using Swern conditions as described in T Tidwell, Org. Reactions (1990) 39 297, (2) and combined with HN(R 6 )R 3 in an inert solvent and then (3) treated with a reducing agent such as NaBH 4 , NaBH(OAc) 3 (Ac is acetyl), or NaCNBH 3 . R 6 may be introduced as part of HN(R 6 )R3 in step (2) or introduced after step (3), wherin H 2 NR 3 was used, via alkylation, for instance with a base such as sodium hydride or potassium tert-butoxide and an alkylating agent such as R 6 X where is X is Br, Cl or methanesulfonate. The compound of formula 1 where R 1 and R 2 are defined as above, X 1 is NR 6 , S or S(O) n , X 2 is C or NR 6 and R 3 is (CR 6 R 7 ) t (C 6 -C 10 aryl), wherein R 6 , R 7 and t are defined above, may be prepared by the Peterson Olefination reaction as described in D. Ager, Org. Reactions (1990) 38 1. For example, protected hygromycin ketone, prepared by reacting the appropriate reagent such as triethylsilyl chloride (TESCl), trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) or tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBDMS) and imidazole or pyridine with hygromycin A, may be reacted with TMSCH(R 2 )X 1 X 2 R 3 in the presence of a strong base, for example lithium diisopropylamide or butyl lithium. When the intermediate -hydroxysilane is stable the olefin may be generated by further reaction with strong base, for example sodium or potassium hydride. The protecting groups may then be removed as above. TMSCH(R 2 )X 1 X 2 R 3 , where X 1 is S or S(O) n , may be made from trimethylsilylmethylsulfide, for example by reaction with the appropriate electrophile in the presence of an amine base, such as triethylamine or pyridine. The thiol may be oxidized by m-CPBA to the sulfone. TMSCH(R 2 )X 1 X 2 R 3 , where X 1 is S(O) n and X 2 is NR 6 , may be prepared from trimethylsilylmethanesulfonyl chloride and the appropiate amine, HN(R 6 )(CR 6 R 7 ) t (C 6 -C 10 aryl). The compound of formula 1 where R 1 and R 2 are defined above, X 1 is C and where X 2 is N and X 2 and R 3 are taken together as described above may be prepared by the reaction of HNR 6 R 3 with protected hygromycin allyl mesylate in the presence of an amine base, such as triethylamine or pyridine. Protected hyrgromycin allyl mesylate may be prepared by the reaction of protected hygromycin allyl alcohol, described above, with methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of an amine base, such as triethylamine or pyridine. The compounds of the present invention have asymmetric carbon atoms. Compounds having a mixture of isomers at one or more centers will exist as diastereomeric mixtures, which can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. All such isomers, including diastereomer mixtures, are considered as part of the invention. The compounds of the present invention that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate the compound of the present invention from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the basic compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the basic compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained. The desired acid salt can also be precipitated from a solution of the free base in an organic solvent by adding to the solution an appropriate mineral or organic acid. Those compounds of the present invention that are acidic in nature, are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. These salts are all prepared by conventional techniques. The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of this invention are those which form non-toxic base salts with the acidic compounds of the present invention. Such non-toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, etc. These salts can easily be prepared by treating the corresponding acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired alkali metal alkoxide or metal hydroxide, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide or metal hydroxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum yields of the desired final product. The antibacterial activity of the compounds of the present invention against bacterial pathogens is demonstrated by the compounds ability to inhibit growth of defined strains of pathogens. ASSAY The assay, described below, employs conventional methodology and interpretation criteria and is designed to provide direction for chemical modifications that may lead to compounds with antibacterial activity against susceptible and drug-resistant organisms including, but not limited to, beta-lactam, macrolide and vancomycin resistance. In the assay, a panel of bacterial strains is assembled to include a variety of target pathogenic species, including representatives of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Use of this panel enables the chemical structure/activity relationship to be determined with respect to potency and spectrum of activity. The assay is performed in microtiter trays and interpreted according to Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Disk Susceptibility TestsSixth Edition; Approved Standard , published by The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines; the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is used to compare strains. Compounds are initially dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as stock solutions. The activity of the compounds of the present invention also may be assessed in accord with Steers replicator technique which is a standard in vitro bacterial testing method described by Steers et al., Antibiotics and Chemotherapy 1959, 9, 307. The in vivo activity of the compounds of the present invention can be determined by conventional animal protection studies well known to those skilled in the art, usually carried out in rodents. According to one in vivo model, compounds are evaluated for efficacy in mouse models of acute bacterial infection. An example of one such in vivo system is provided as follows. Mice (CF1 mixed sex mice; 18-20 g) are allotted to cages upon their arrival, and allowed to acclimate 1-2 days before being placed in a study. The acute infection is produced by intraperitoneal inoculation of bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus strain 01A1095) suspended in 5% sterile hog gastric mucin. The inoculum is prepared by: growing the culture overnight at 37 C. on blood agar, harvesting the resulting surface growth with sterile brain heart infusion broth, and adjusting this suspension to a turbidity that when diluted 1:10 into 5% sterile hog gastric mucin would produce 100% lethality. Mice (10 per group) are treated subcutaneously, at 0.5 hour and 4 hours after challenge. Appropriate non-treated (infected but not treated) and positive (vancomycin or minocycline, etc.) controls are included in each study. Percent survival is recorded after a 4-day observation period; the PD 50 (mg/kg/dose calculated to protect 50% of infected animals) is determined by the probit method. The compounds of the present invention, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof (hereinafter the active compounds), may be administered through oral, parenteral, topical, or rectal routes in the treatment of bacterial and protozoal infections. In general, these compounds are most desirably administered in dosages ranging from about 0.2 mg per kg body weight per day (mg/kg/day) to about 200 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses (i.e., from 1 to 4 doses per day), although variations will necessarily occur depending upon the species, weight and condition of the subject being treated and the particular route of administration chosen. However, a dosage level that is in the range of about 3 mg/kg/day to about 60 mg/kg/day is most desirably employed. Variations may nevertheless occur depending upon the species of mammal, fish or bird being treated and its individual response to said medicament, as well as on the type of pharmaceutical formulation chosen and the time period and interval at which such administration is carried out. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effects, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day. The active compounds may be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents by the routes previously indicated, and such administration may be carried out in single or multiple doses. More particularly, the active compounds may be administered in a wide variety of different dosage forms, i.e., they may be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, hard candies, powders, sprays, creams, salves, suppositories, jellies, gels, pastes, lotions, ointments, aqueous suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs, syrups, and the like. Such carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various non-toxic organic solvents, etc. Moreover, oral pharmaceutical compositions can be suitably sweetened and/or flavored. In general, the active compounds are present in such dosage forms at concentration levels ranging from about 5.0% to about 70% by weight. For oral administration, tablets containing various excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and glycine may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch (and preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch), alginic acid and certain complex silicates, together with granulation binders like polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral adinistration, the active compound may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes, and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents as well, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof. For parenteral administration, solutions of an active compound in either sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous ethanol or propylene glycol may be employed. Use of a cyclodextrin derivative such as -cyclodextrin sulfobutyl ether, sodium salt (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,134,127) may also be advantageous. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic. These aqueous solutions are suitable for intravenous injection purposes. The oily solutions are suitable for intraarticular, intramuscular and subcutaneous injection purposes. The preparation of all these solutions under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques known to those skilled in the art. Additionally, it is also possible to administer the active compounds of the present invention topically and this may be done by way of creams, jellies, gels, pastes, patches, ointments and the like, in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice. For administration to animals other than humans, such as cattle or domestic animals, the active compounds may be administered in the feed of the animals or orally as a drench composition. The active compounds may also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines. The active compounds may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide phenyl, polyhydroxyethylaspartamide-phenol, or polyethyleneoxide-polylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the active compounds may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, copolymers of polylactic and polyglycolic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels. The present invention is further described and exemplified in the preparations and examples described below. In the preparations and examples, rt means room or ambient temperature which is a temperature within the range of about 20-25 C. Preparation 1 Five (5) mL of a frozen lot (stored at 80 C. in 20% glycerol/80% inoculum medium) of the culture Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 2388 was used to inoculate 1 L of hygromycin inoculum medium (Corn Products Corp. cerelose 13 g/L, Hubinger starch 7 g/L, Roquette corn steep solids 3 g/L, Sheffield Brand Products NZ Amine YTT 7 g/L, Baker CoCl 2 .6H 2 O 0.002 g/L, KH 2 PO 4 0.7 g/L, MgSO 4 .7H 2 O 1.3 g/L, ammonium sulfate 0.7 g/L, Dow Chemical P2000 defoamer 1 drop/flask, Colfax soybean oil 2 drops/flask, pH to 7.0 before autoclave) in a 2.8 L Fernbach flask. The culture was grown for 3 days at 29 C. with 200 rpm agitation on a 2-inch-throw shaker. This grown culture was used to inoculate 8 L of sterile hygromycin fermentation medium (Albaglos calcium carbonate 1 g/L, Sheffield Brand Products NZ Amine YTT 5 g/L, Hubingers starch 20 g/L, Archer Daniels Midland Nutrisoy flour 10 g/L, Dow Chemical P2000 defoamer 1 ml/L, Baker CoCl 2 .6H 2 O 0.002 g/L, Colfax soybean oil 2 ml/L, cerelose 10 g/L, NaCl 5 g/L, pH to 7.0 before autoclave) in a 14 liter fermentor jar (New Brunswick Microferm, New Brunswick, N.J.) equipped with two 4.75-inch Rushton impellers, spaced 3.75 inches from each other. The broth was incubated at 29 C. with an aeration rate of 8 L/minute, and with stirring at 800 rpm. To minimize formation of epi-hygromycin, the pH was maintained between 6.5 and 6.9 for 126 hours, then to 6.2 to 6.6 with H 2 SO 4 (15%) for the rest of the run. The fermentation was harvested after 143 hours total incubation. At this time, the ratio was 31:1 hygromycin A to epi-hygromycin. Six liters of broth from the above fermentation was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for approximately 15 minutes. After centrifugation, the pellet was discarded and the supernatant (at pH 6.4, assayed by HPLC to contain approximately 4.12 gms of hygromycin A activity) was loaded on a column packed with 500 gms of an XAD-16 resin (Rohm and Haas (Philadelphia, Pa.). The resin had previously been equilibrated with two bed volumes of 25 mM disodium phosphate, pH 6.0 (buffer). After loading, the column was washed with 2 bed volumes of buffer and 2 bed volumes of 80/20 buffer/methanol and the activity eluted with 5 bed volumes of 50/50 buffer/methanol. The cuts were assayed by HPLC and the cuts containing the bulk of the activity (2.730 gms of hygromycin A) were combined. A part of this XAD-16 eluate (approximately 800 mg of hygromycin A) was diluted to 10% methanol by the addition of 1.8 liters of buffer and loaded on a 100 ml CG-161 column (TosoHaas (Montgomeryville, Pa.)) which had been equilibrated with 4 bed volumes of 90/10 buffer/methanol. The product was eluted with 6 bed volumes of 50/50 buffer/methanol. The cuts were assayed by HPLC and the active cuts were combined. The combined cut was evaporated to dryness and the solids assayed to be approximately 65% pure by weight. A small part of these solids were transferred for assay. About 500 mg of the solids were mixed with 500 ml of water and 500 ml of ethyl acetate and stirred for 20 minutes. The two layers were separated and part of the aqueous layer was dried to obtain solids which were assayed to be approximately 52% purity by weight. Both these solids (34945-280-1 and 281-1) were assayed by NMR and TLC and found to contain hygromycin A activity. In addition, the NMR showed a hygromycin A/epi-hygromycin ratio of approximately 15:1. Preparation 2 Five (5) mL of a frozen lot (stored at 80 C. in 20% glycerol/80% inoculum medium) of the culture Streptomyces hygroscopicus NRRL 2388 was used to inoculate 1 L of Hygromycin inoculum medium (CPC International Inc. cerelose 13 g/L, Hubingers starch 7 g/L, Roquette corn steep solids 3 g/L, NZ Amine YTT 7 g/L, Baker CoCl 2 .6H 2 O 0.002 g/L, KH 2 PO 4 0.7 g/L, MgSO 4 .7H 2 O 1.3 g/L, ammonium sulfate 0.7 g/L, Dow Chemical P2000 defoamer 1 drop/flask, Colfax soybean oil 2 drops/flask, pH to 7.0 before autoclave) in a 2.8 L Fernbach flask. The culture was grown for 2 to 3 days at 29 C. with 200 rpm agitation on a 2-inch-throw shaker. Two five-hundred gallon, stainless steel fermentors were loaded with 380-400 gallons of the hygromycin fermentation medium (Mineral Technologies Calcium Carbonate 1 g/L, Sheffield Brand Products NZ Amine YTT 5 g/L, Hubingers starch 20 g/L, Archer Daniels Midland Co., Soyflour 10 g/L, Dow Chemical P2000 defoamer 1 ml/L, Baker CoCl 2 .6H 2 O 0.002 g/L, Colfax, Inc. soybean oil 2 gm/L, CPC International Inc. Cerelose 10 g/L, Cargill Inc. NaCl 5 g/L,). The medium was sterilized with 20 psig of steam for 60 minutes in the fermentors. After the medium was cooled using cooling coils in the fermentors, the pH was adjusted to 6.5-6.7. The fermentor conditions were set so that the airflow rate was 20 standard cubic feet per minute, the temperature was 28 C., the vent pressure was 5 psig, and the pH was maintained between 6.5-6.7 with 25% sodium hydroxide and 98% sulfuric acid. The agitation rates in the two fermentors were varied so as to maintain a dissolved oxygen level of greater than 20% of saturation level as measured in the broth immediately prior to inoculation. Upon setting the fermentor control conditions, five Fernbach inoculum flasks were combined in a sterile manner, into an 8 L aspirator bottle. This inoculum was then used for inoculation of a single, nominal, five-hundred gallon fermentor as described above. This procedure was repeated using 4 liters of inoculum so that one fermentor received four liters of inoculum and one fermenter received five liters of inoculum. Each fermentor ran for approximately 114 hours, at which time the fermentations were stopped. The broth pH was adjusted to 6.3 using 98% sulfuric acid and transferred from the fermentors for recovery. The two fermentors referred to above (pH6.3, having a ratio of hygromycin A to epi-hygromycin of approximately 51:1) were filtered on a ceramic filtration system. The filtrate (1450 gmsA, 506 gal) was loaded on a 70-gallon XAD-16 resin column. This column had been equilibrated previously with 4 bed volumes of a solution of trisodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.0 (buffer). After loading, the column was washed with 2 bed volumes of buffer and 2 bed volumes of 80/20 buffer/methanol. The activity was subsequently eluted from the column with 10 cuts (approximately 50 gallons each) of a solution of 50/50 buffer/methanol. The active cuts (approximately 1240 gmsA) were combined and diluted to a final concentration of 10% methanol by the addition of 1200 gallons of buffer. The use of dilution (rather than rotary evaporation) to reduce methanol concentration allowed the use of lower temperatures so as to minimize epi-hygromycin amounts, which tend to increase at higher temperatures. Half of this solution was loaded on a 40 liter CG-161 column (previously equilibrated with 4 bed volumes of a solution of 90/10 buffer/methanol). After loading, the column was washed with 4 bed volumes of 80/20 buffer/methanol and eluted with 5.5 bed volumes of 50/50 buffer/methanol. After regeneration and re-equilibration of the column, the second half of the activity was loaded on the column and eluted as described above. The combined cuts from both the runs (120 liters, approximately 1051 gmsA) were diluted to 10% methanol by the addition of buffer. This was re-loaded on the regenerated and re-equilibrated CG-161 resin column. Once the activity was adsorbed on the column, it was eluted with 4 bed volumes of methanol. This step served to both reduce the salts as well as increase the concentration of the sample prior to the final evaporation. The combined cuts from the final CG-161 column were evaporated to dryness to obtain a total of approximately 1 kgA of hygromycin A activity. The ratio of hygromycin A to epi-hygromycin in the final solids was about 14.5:1. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES FOR EXAMPLES 5-Allyl Alcohol Preparations 1.

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to novel compounds that function as proteolytic enzyme inhibitors, and particularly to a new class of thrombin inhibitors. 2. Related Art Proteases are enzymes that cleave proteins at single, specific peptide bonds. Proteases can be classified into four generic classes: serine, thiol or cysteinyl, acid or aspartyl, and metalloproteases (Cuypers et al., J. Biol. Chem. 257:7086 (1982)). Proteases are essential to a variety of biological activities, such as digestion, formation and dissolution of blood clots, reproduction and the immune reaction to foreign cells and organisms. Aberrant proteolysis is associated with a number of disease states in man and other mammals. The human neutrophil proteases, elastase and cathepsin G, have been implicated as contributing to disease states marked by tissue destruction. These disease states include emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis, corneal ulcers and glomerular nephritis. (Barret, in Enzyme Inhibitors as Drugs , Sandler, ed., University Park Press, Baltimore, (1980)). Additional proteases such as plasmin, C-1 esterase, C-3 convertase, urokinase, plasminogen activator, acrosin, and kallikreins play key roles in normal biological functions of mammals. In many instances, it is beneficial to disrupt the function of one or more proteolytic enzymes in the course of therapeutically treating a mammal. Serine proteases include such enzymes as elastase (human leukocyte), cathepsin G, plasmin, C-1 esterase, C-3 convertase, urokinase, plasminogen activator, acrosin, chymotrypsin, trypsin, thrombin, factor Xa and kallikreins. Human leukocyte elastase is released by polymorphonuclear leukocytes at sites of inflammation and thus is a contributing cause for a number of disease states. Cathepsin G is another human neutrophil serine protease. Compounds with the ability to inhibit the activity of these enzymes are expected to have an anti-inflammatory effect useful in the treatment of gout, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases, and in the treatment of emphysema. Chymotrypsin and trypsin are digestive enzymes. Inhibitors of these enzymes are useful in treating pancreatitis. Inhibitors of urokinase and plasminogen activator are useful in treating excessive cell growth disease states, such as benign prostatic hypertrophy, prostatic carcinoma and psoriasis. The serine protease thrombin occupies a central role in hemostasis and thrombosis, and as a multifactorial protein, induces a number of effects on platelets, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, leukocytes, the heart, and neurons. Activation of the coagulation cascade through either the intrinsic pathway (contact activation) or the extrinsic pathway (activation by exposure of plasma to a non-endothelial surface, damage to vessel walls or tissue factor release) leads to a series of biochemical events that converge on thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen ultimately leading to a hemostatic plug (clot formation), potently activates platelets through a unique proteolytic cleavage of the cell surface thrombin receptor (Coughlin, Seminars in Hematology 31(4):270-277 (1994)), and autoamplifies its own production through a feedback mechanism. Thus, inhibitors of thrombin function have therapeutic potential in a host of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases. Factor Xa is another serine protease in the coagulation pathway. Factor Xa associates with factor Va and calcium on a phospholipid membrane thereby forming a prothrombinase complex. This prothrombinase complex then converts prothrombin to thrombin (Claeson, Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 5:411-436 (1994); Harker, Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 5 (Suppl 1):S47-S58 (1994)). Inhibitors of factor Xa are thought to offer an advantage over agents that directly inhibit thrombin since direct thrombin inhibitors still permit significant new thrombin generation (Lefkovits and Topol, Circulation 90(3):1522-1536 (1994); Harker, Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 5 (Suppl 1):S47-S58 (1994)). In vivo diagnostic imaging methods for intravascular thrombi have been previously reported. These imaging methods use compounds that are detectably labeled with radioactive or paramagnetic atoms. For example, platelets labeled with the gamma emitter, In-111, can be employed as an imaging agent for detecting thrombi (Thakur, M. L. et al., Thromb Res. 9:345 (1976); Powers et al., Neurology 32:938 (1982)). The thrombolytic enzyme streptokinase labeled with Tc-99m has been proposed as an imaging agent (Wong, U.S. Pat. No. 4,418,052 (1983)). The fibrin-binding domains of Staphylococcus aureus derived protein A labeled with the gamma emitters, I-125 and I-131, have been proposed as imaging agents (Pang, U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,686 (1991)). Monoclonal antibodies having specificity for fibrin (in contrast to fibrinogen) and labeled with Tc-99m have been proposed as imaging agents (Berger et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,024,829 (1991); Dean et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,980,148 (1990)). The use of the paramagnetic contrasting agent, gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid in magnetic resonance imaging of patients treated by thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction has been reported (De Roos, A. et al., Int. J. Card. Imaging 7:133 (1991)). Radiolabeled and paramagnetically labeled alpha-ketoamide derivatives have also been proposed as thrombus imaging agents (Abelman et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,600). Edwards et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 114:1854-63(1992), describes peptidyl -ketobenzoxazoles that reversibly inhibit the serine proteases human leukocyte elastase and porcine pancreatic elastase. European Published Application 363 284 describes analogs of peptidase substrates in which the nitrogen atom of the scissile amide group of the substrate peptide has been replaced by hydrogen or a substituted carbonyl moiety. Australian Published Application 86245677 also describes peptidase inhibitors having an activated electrophilic ketone moiety such as fluoromethylene ketone or -keto carboxyl derivatives. Brown et al., J. Med. Chem. 37:1259-1261 (1994) describes orally active, non-peptidic inhibitors of human leukocyte elastase which contain trifluoromethylketone and pyridinone moieties. H. Mack et al., J. Enzyme Inhibition, 9:73-86 (1995) describes rigid amidinophenylalanine thrombin inhibitors which contain a pyridinone moiety as a central core structure. PCT International Published Application WO 97/01338 describes pyridinone compounds having the formula: where W is R 1 , R 1 OCO, R 1 CO, R 1 SO 2 , or (R 1 ) m (CH 2 ) n NH q CO; R 1 is R 2 (CH 2 ) n , (R 2 )(OR 2 )CH(CH 2 ) p , (R 2 ) 2 CH(CH 2 ) n , and R 2 O(CH 2 ) p ; R 2 is hydrogen, optionally substituted phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, a mono- or bicyclic heterocyclic ring, COOR 6 , C 1-4 linear or branched alkyl, C 3-7 cycloalkyl, or C 7-12 bicyclic alkyl; R 3 is hydrogen, C 1-4 linear or branched alkyl, C 3-7 cycloalkyl, or trifluoromethyl; A is one of: where Y is hydrogen, hydroxy, or CN; and R 6 is hydrogen, or C 1-4 linear or branched alkyl.

PCT Published Application WO 96/18644 describes compounds having the formula: wherein Het is selected from the group consisting of and R 3 is selected from the group consisting of: The compounds are described as specific inhibitors of thrombin. A need continues to exist for non-peptidic compounds that are potent and selective protease inhibitors, and which possess greater bioavailability and fewer side-effects than currently available protease inhibitors. Accordingly, new classes of potent protease inhibitors, characterized by potent inhibitory capacity and low mammalian toxicity, are potentially valuable therapeutic agents for a variety of conditions, including treatment of a number of mammalian proteolytic disease states.

Preferred acids for forming acid addition salts include HCl and acetic acid. The compounds of the present invention represent a novel class of potent inhibitors of metallo, acid, thiol and serine proteases. Examples of the serine proteases inhibited by compounds within the scope of the invention include leukocyte neutrophil elastase, a proteolytic enzyme implicated in the pathogenesis of emphysema; chymotrypsin and trypsin, digestive enzymes; pancreatic elastase, and cathepsin G, a chymotrypsin-like protease also associated with leukocytes; thrombin and factor Xa, proteolytic enzymes in the blood coagulation pathway. Inhibition of thermolysin, a metalloprotease, and pepsin, an acid protease, are also contemplated uses of compounds of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention are preferably employed to inhibit trypsin-like proteases. An end use application of the compounds that inhibit chymotrypsin and trypsin is in the treatment of pancreatitis. For their end-use application, the potency and other biochemical parameters of the enzyme-inhibiting characteristics of the compounds of the present invention is readily ascertained by standard biochemical techniques well known in the art. Actual dose ranges for their specific end-use application will, of course, depend upon the nature and severity of the disease state of the patient or animal to be treated, as determined by the attending diagnostician. It is expected that a useful dose range will be about 0.01 to 10 mg per kg per day for an effective therapeutic effect. Compounds of the present invention that are distinguished by their ability to inhibit thrombin may be employed for a number of therapeutic purposes. As thrombin inhibitors, compounds of the present invention inhibit thrombin production. Therefore, these compounds are useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of states characterized by abnormal venous or arterial thrombosis involving either thrombin production or action. These states include, but are not limited to, deep vein thrombosis; disseminated intravascular coagulopathy which occurs during septic shock, viral infections and cancer; myocardial infarction; stroke; coronary artery bypass; fibrin formation in the eye; hip replacement; and thrombus formation resulting from either thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCTA). Other uses include the use of said thrombin inhibitors as anticoagulants either embedded in or physically linked to materials used in the manufacture of devices used in blood collection, blood circulation, and blood storage, such as catheters, blood dialysis machines, blood collection syringes and tubes, and blood lines. The compounds of the present invention may also be used as an anticoagulant in extracorporeal blood circuits. Metal stents have been shown to reduce restenosis, but are thrombogenic. A strategy for reducing the thrombogenicity of stents is to coat, embed, adsord or covalently attach a thrombin-inhibiting agent to the stent surface. The compounds of the present invention can be employed for this purpose. Compounds of the invention can be attached to, or embedded within soluble and/or biodegradeable polymers as and thereafter coated onto stent materials. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyhydroxy-propylmethacrylamide-phenol, polyhydroxyethyl-aspartamide-phenol, or polyethyleneoxide-polylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, copolymers of polylactic and polyglycolic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels. See European Application 761 251, European Application 604,022, Canadian Patent 2,164,684 and PCT Published Applications WO 96/11668. WO 96/32143 and WO 96/38136. By virtue of the effects of thrombin on a host of cell types, such as smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and neutrophils, the compounds of the present invention find additional use in the treatment or prophylaxis of adult respiratory distress syndrome; inflammatory responses; wound healing; reperfusion damage; atherosclerosis; and restenosis following an injury such as balloon angioplasty, atherectomy, and arterial stent placement. The compounds of the present invention may be useful in treating neoplasia and metastasis as well as neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease. When employed as thrombin inhibitors, the compounds of the present invention may be administered in an effective amount within the dosage range of about 0.1 to about 500 mg/kg, preferably between 0.1 to 10 mg/kg body weight, on a regimen in single or 2-4 divided daily doses. When employed as inhibitors of thrombin, the compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with thrombolytic agents such as tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase, and urokinase. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with other antithrombotic or anticoagulant drugs such as, but not limited to, fibrinogen antagonists and thromboxane receptor antagonists. The thrombin inhibitors may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxy-propylmethacrylamide-phenol, polyhydroxyethyl-aspartamide-phenol, or polyethyleneoxide-polylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the thrombin inhibitors may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, copolymers of polylactic and polyglycolic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels. Human leucocyte elastase is released by polymorphonuclear leukocytes at sites of inflammation and thus is a contributing cause for a number of disease states. Compounds of the present invention are expected to have an anti-inflammatory effect useful in the treatment of gout, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases, and in the treatment of emphysema. The leucocyte elastase inhibitory properties of compounds of the present invention are determined by the method described below. Cathepsin G has also been implicated in the disease states of arthritis, gout and emphysema, and in addition, glomerulonephritis and lung infestations caused by infections in the lung. In their end-use application the enzyme inhibitory properties of the compounds of Formula I is readily ascertained by standard biochemical techniques that are well-known in the art. The Cathepsin G inhibitory properties of compounds within the scope of the present invention are determined by the following method. A preparation of partially purified human Cathepsin G is obtained by the procedure of Baugh et al., Biochemistry 15:836 (1979). Leukocyte granules are a major source for the preparation of leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G (chymotrypsin-like activity). Leukocytes are lysed and granules are isolated. The leukocyte granules are extracted with 0.20 M sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and extracts are dialyzed against 0.05 M Tris buffer, pH 8.0 containing 0.05 M NaCl overnight at 4 C. A protein fraction precipitates during dialysis and is isolated by centrifugation. This fraction contains most of the chymotrypsin-like activity of leukocyte granules. Specific substrates are prepared for each enzyme, namely N-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide. The latter is not hydrolyzed by leukocyte elastase. Enzyme preparations are assayed in 2.00 mL of 0.10 M Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.50 M NaCl, 10% dimethylsulfoxide and 0.0020 M Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide as a substrate. Hydrolysis of the p-nitroanilide substrate is monitored at 405 nm and at 25 C. Useful dose range for the application of compounds of the present invention as neutrophil elastase inhibitors and as Cathepsin G inhibitors depend upon the nature and severity of the disease state, as determined by the attending diagnostician, with a range of 0.01 to 10 mg/kg body weight, per day, being useful for the aforementioned disease states. Compounds of the present invention that inhibit urokinase or plasminogen activator are potentially useful in treating excessive cell growth disease state. As such compounds of the present invention may also be useful in the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma, the treatment of psoriasis, and as abortifacients. For their end-use application, the potency and other biochemical parameters of the enzyme inhibiting characteristics of compounds of the present invention are readily ascertained by standard biochemical techniques well known in the art. Actual dose ranges for this application will depend upon the nature and severity of the disease state of the patient or animal to be treated as determined by the attending diagnostician. It is to be expected that a general dose range will be about 0.01 to 10 mg per kg per day for an effective therapeutic effect. Additional uses for compounds of the present invention include analysis of commercial reagent enzymes for active site concentration. For example, chymotrypsin is supplied as a standard reagent for use in clinical quantitation of chymotrypsin activity in pancreatic juices and feces. Such assays are diagnostic for gastrointestinal and pancreatic disorders. Pancreatic elastase is also supplied commercially as a reagent for quantitation of 1 -antitrypsin in plasma. Plasma 1 -antitrypsin increases in concentration during the course of several inflammatory diseases, and 1 -antitrypsin deficiencies are associated with increased incidence of lung disease. Compounds of the present invention can be used to enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of these assays by titrametric standardization of the commercial elastase supplied as a reagent. See, U.S. Pat. No. 4,499,082. Protease activity in certain protein extracts during purification of particular proteins is a recurring problem which can complicate and compromise the results of protein isolation procedures. Certain proteases present in such extracts can be inhibited during purification steps by compounds of the present invention, which bind tightly to various proteolytic enzymes. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered to any animal that can experience the beneficial effects of the compounds of the invention. Foremost among such animals are humans, although the invention is not intended to be so limited. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be administered by any means that achieve their intended purpose. For example, administration can be by parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, transdermal, buccal, or ocular routes. Alternatively, or concurrently, administration can be by the oral route. The dosage administered will be dependent upon the age, health, and weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment, and the nature of the effect desired. In addition to the pharmacologically active compounds, the new pharmaceutical preparations can contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries that facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations that can be used pharmaceutically. The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention are manufactured in a manner that is, itself, known, for example, by means of conventional mixing, granulating, dragee-making, dissolving, or lyophilizing processes. Thus, pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compounds with solid excipients, optionally grinding the resulting mixture and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired or necessary, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as saccharides, for example, lactose or sucrose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and/or calcium phosphates, for example, tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, as well as binders, such as, starch paste, using, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinyl pyrrolidone. If desired, disintegrating agents can be added, such as, the above-mentioned starches and also carboxymethyl-starch, cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as, sodium alginate. Auxiliaries are, above all, flow-regulating agents and lubricants, for example, silica, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as, magnesium stearate or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings that, if desired, are resistant to gastric juices. For this purpose, concentrated saccharide solutions can be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. In order to produce coatings resistant to gastric juices, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as, acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose phthalate, are used. Dye stuffs or pigments can be added to the tablets or dragee coatings, for example, for identification or in order to characterize combinations of active compound doses. Other pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as, glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active compounds in the form of granules that may be mixed with fillers such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds are preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as, fatty oils or liquid paraffin. In addition, stabilizers may be added. Suitable formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form, for example, water-soluble salts, alkaline solutions and cyclodextrin inclusion complexes. Especially preferred alkaline salts are ammonium salts prepared, for example, with Tris, choline hydroxide, Bis-Tris propane, N-methylglucamine, or arginine. One or more modified or unmodified cyclodextrins can be employed to stabilize and increase the water solubility of compounds of the present invention. Useful cyclodextrins for this purpose are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,727,064, 4,764,604, and 5,024,998. In addition, suspensions of the active compounds as appropriate oily injection suspensions can be administered. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils, for example, sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for example, ethyl oleate or triglycerides or polyethylene glycol-400 (the compounds are soluble in PEG-400). Aqueous injection suspensions can contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension, for example, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, and/or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain stabilizers. Compounds of Formula VII can be labeled with radioactive iodine as described below in Example 3 or by using an exchange reaction. Exchange of hot iodine for cold iodine is well known in the art. Alternatively, a radio iodine labeled compound can be prepared from the corresponding bromo compound via a tributylstannyl intermediate. See, U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,361, herein incorporated by reference. The present invention also includes compositions which are useful for in vivo imaging of thrombi in a mammal, wherein the compositions are comprised of a compound of Formula VII complexed with a radioactive atom. For the compounds of Formula VII, suitable radioactive atoms include Co-57, Cu-67, Ga-67, Ga-68, Ru-97, Tc-99m, In-111, In-113m, Hg-197, Au-198, and Pb-203. In particular, technetium-99m (Tc-99m) is an ideal radioactive atom for imaging because of its nuclear properties. It is a gamma emitter and has a single photon energy of 140 keV, a half-life of about 6 hours, and it is readily available from a Mo-99/Tc-99 generator. Rhenium-186 and -188 also have gamma emission which allows them to be imaged. Preferred compositions contain the radioactive atom, Tc-99m. Compositions of the present invention are conveniently prepared by completing a compound of Formula VII with radioisotopes which are suitable for detection externally. The compounds of Formula VII can be labeled by any of the many techniques known in the art to provide a composition of the present invention. For example, these compounds can be labeled through a chelating agent such as diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) or metallothionein, both of which can be covalently attached to the compound of Formula VII. In general, the compositions of the present invention containing technetium-99m are prepared by forming an aqueous mixture of technetium-99m and a reducing agent and a water-soluble ligand, and then contacting the mixture with a compound of the present invention represented by Formula VII. For example, the imaging compounds of this invention are made by reacting technetium-99m (in an oxidized state) with the compounds of the present invention having a chelating means in the presence of a reducing agent to form a stable complex between technetium-99m in a reduced state (IV or V valence state). One embodiment of the composition of the present invention is prepared by labeling a compound of Formula VII having a DTPA chelating means with technetium-99m. This may be accomplished by combining a predetermined amount (as 5 g to 0.5 mg) of compound of the present invention with an aqueous solution containing citrate buffer and stannous reducing agent, then adding freshly eluted sodium pertechnetate containing a predetermined level of radioactivity (as 15 mCi). After allowing an incubation of the mixture at room temperature, the reaction mixture is loaded into a shielded syringe through a sterile filter (0.2-0.22 micron), then is dispensed into 0.9% saline for injection, if desired. Another embodiment of the compositions of the present invention is prepared by labeling a compound of Formula VII having a metallothionein chelating means with technetium-99m. This may be accomplished by combining aqueous sodium pertechnetate-99m with aqueous stannous glucoheptonate to form a soluble complex of technetium-99m (in reduced state) with two glucoheptonate molecules, then combining this solution with a compound of the Formula VII having a metallothionein attached thereto. After incubating the mixture for a period of time and under conditions which allow for an exchange of the technetium-99m from the glucoheptonate complex to the metallothionein of the compound of Formula VII, the technetium-labeled composition of the present invention is formed. The source of technetium-99m should preferably be water soluble. Preferred sources are alkali and alkaline earth metal pertechnetate (TcO 4 ). Technetium-99m is most preferably obtained in the form of fresh sodium pertechnetate from a sterile technetium-99m generator (as from a conventional Mo-99/Tc-99m generator). However, any other source of physiologically acceptable technetium-99m may be used. Reducing agents for use in the method are physiologically acceptable for reducing technetium-99m from its oxidized state to the IV or V valence state or for reducing rhenium from its oxidized state. Reducing agents which can be used are stannous chloride, stannous fluoride, stannous glucoheptonate, stannous tartarate, and sodium dithionite. The preferred agents are stannous reducing agents, especially stannous chloride or stannous glucoheptonate. For example, stannous chloride (SnCl 2 ) is the reducing agent and can be used in range from 1-1,000 g/mL. Especially preferred concentrations are about 30-500 g/mL. Citric acid complexes with technetium-99m to quickly form a stable technetium-99m-citrate complex. Upon contact with a compound of Formula VII, substantially quantitative transfer of technetium-99m from its citrate complex to the chelating means of the compound of Formula VII is achieved rapidly and under mild conditions. The amount of citric acid (as sodium citrate) can range from about 0.5 mg/ml up to the amount maximally soluble in the medium. Preferred amounts of citric acid range from 15 to 30 g/ml. The amount of compound of Formula VII having a chelating means can range from 0.001 to about 3 mg/mL, preferably about 0.017 to about 0.15 mg/mL. Finally, technetium-99m in the form of pertechnetate can be used in amounts of preferably about 1-50 mCi. The amount of mCi per mg of compound of the present invention is preferably about 30-150. Alternative compositions of the present invention include an In-111 labeled compound of the present invention. The present invention also includes compositions of the compounds of the present invention which are useful for in vivo imaging of thrombi in a mammal, comprised of a compound represented by Formula VII complexed to a paramagnetic atom. Preferred paramagnetic atoms are divalent or trivalent ions of elements with an atomic number of 21 to 29, 42, 44 and 58 to 70. Suitable ions include chromium(III), manganese(II), iron(III), iron(II), cobalt(II), nickel(II), copper(II), praseodymium(III), neodymium(III), samarium(III) and ytterbium(III). Because of their very strong magnetic moments, gadolinium(III), terbium(III), dysoprosium(III), holmium(III), and erbium(III) are preferred. Especially preferred for the paramagnetic atom is gadolinium(III). The compositions of the present invention may be prepared by combining a compound of Formula VII with a paramagnetic atom. For example, the metal oxide or a metal salt (for example, nitrate, chloride or sulfate) of a suitable paramagnetic atom is dissolved or suspended in a medium comprised of water and an alcohol, such as methyl, ethyl or isopropyl alcohol. This mixture is added to a solution of an equimolar amount of the compound of Formula VII in a similar aqueous medium and stirred. The reaction mixture may be heated moderately until the reaction is completed. Insoluble compositions formed may be isolated by filtering, while soluble compositions may be isolated by evaporation of the solvent. If acid groups on the chelating means are still present in the composition of the present invention, inorganic or organic bases, and even amino acids, may be added to convert the acidic complex into a neutral complex to facilitate isolation or purification of homogenous composition. Organic bases or basic amino acids may be used as neutralizing agents, as well as inorganic bases such as hydroxides, carbonates or bicarbonates of sodium, potassium or lithium. The present invention also include diagnostic compositions which are useful for in vivo imaging of thrombi in a mammal, comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a diagnostically effective amount of a radiolabeled compound of Formula VII. Compositions such as those described above may be conveniently used in these diagnostic compositions. The diagnostically effective amount of the composition required as a dose will depend on the route of administration, the type of mammal being treated, and the physical characteristics of the specific mammal under consideration. These factors and their relationship to determining this dose are well known to skilled practitioners in the medial diagnostic arts. Also, the diagnostically effective amount and method of administration can be tailored to achieve optimal efficacy but will depend on such factors as weight, diet, concurrent medication and other factors which those skilled in the medical arts will recognize. In any regard, the dose for imaging should be sufficient for detecting the presence of the imaging agent at the site of a thrombus in question. Typically, radiologic imaging will require that the dose provided by the pharmaceutical composition position of the present invention be about 5 to 20 Ci, preferably about 10 Ci. Magnetic resonance imaging will require that the dose provided be about 0.001 to 5 mmole/kg, preferably about 0.005 to 0.5 mmole/kg of a compound of Formula VII complexed with paramagnetic atom. In either case, it is known in the art that the actual dose will depend on the location of the thrombus. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for in vivo use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences , Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985). The present invention also encompasses diagnostic compositions prepared for storage or administration. These would additionally contain preservatives, stabilizers and dyes. For example, sodium benzoate, sorbic acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid may be added as preservatives. Id. At 1449. In addition, antioxidants and suspending agents may be used. The in vivo imaging methods of the present invention also offer several advantages over previous imaging techniques for the detection or monitoring of the presence, size, regression or increase of a thrombus. In particular, the present invention provides compounds, compositions and diagnostic compositions have been designed to bind extremely tightly to the thrombin associated with a thrombus and thereby reduce background due to circulating radioactivity or paramagnetism arising from unbound imaging agent. Furthermore, in vivo imaging by intracoronary injection of the compounds, compositions or diagnostic compositions of the present invention, is expected to be almost instantaneous since these imaging agents would saturate the thrombin bound to the thrombus immediately. Accordingly, the present invention also includes methods for in vivo imaging of a thrombus in a mammal, comprising the steps of: (1) administering to a mammal a diagnostically acceptable amount of a compound, composition, or diagnostic composition of the present invention and (2) detecting a thrombus in a blood vessel. In employing the compounds, compositions or diagnostic compositions in vivo by this method, administering is accomplished parenterally, in either a systemic or local targeted manner. Systemic administration is accomplished by injecting the compounds, compositions by diagnostic compositions of the present invention into a convenient and accessible vein or artery. This includes but is not limited to administration by the ankecubutal vein. Local targeted administration is accomplished by injecting the compounds, compositions or diagnostic compositions of the present invention proximal in flow to a vein or artery suspected to contain thrombi distal to the injection site. This includes but is not limited to direct injection into the coronary arterial vasculature to image coronary thrombi, into the carotid artery to image thrombi in the cerebral vasculature, or into a pedal vein to image deep vein thrombosis of the leg. Also, the manner of delivery of a composition of the present invention to the site of a thrombus is considered within the scope of the term administering. For example, a compound represented by Formula VII having a chelating means attached thereto may be injected into the mammal, followed at a later time by the radioactive atom thereby forming in vivo at the site of the thrombus the composition comprising the compound of formula complexed to radioactive atom. Alternatively, a composition comprising the compound of formula complexed to radioactive atom may be injected into the mammal. The detecting of a thrombus by imaging is made possible by the presence of radioactive or paramagnetic atoms localized at such thrombus. The radioactive atoms associated with the compositions and diagnostic compositions of the present invention are preferably imaged using a radiation detection means capable of detecting gamma radiation, such as a gamma camera or the like. Typically, radiation imaging cameras employ a conversion medium (wherein the high energy gamma ray is absorbed, displacing an electron which emits a photon upon its return to the orbital state), photoelectric detectors arranged in a spatial detection chamber (to determine the position of the emitted photons), and circuitry to analyze the photons detected in the chamber and produce an image. The paramagnetic atoms associated with the compositions and diagnostic compositions of the present invention are detected in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems. In such systems, a strong magnetic field is used to align the nuclear spin vectors of the atoms in a patients body. The field is disturbed by the presence of paramagnetic atoms localized at a thrombus and an image of the patient is read as the nuclei return to their equilibrium alignments. The following examples are illustrative, but not limiting, of the method and compositions of the present invention. Other suitable modifications and adaptations of the variety of conditions and parameters normally encountered and obvious to those skilled in the art are within the spirit and scope of the invention.

All the psychiatric disorders and conditions referred to herein are known to those of skill in the art and defined as in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, American Psychiatric Association, 1994 (DMS IV), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The piperazinyl-heterocyclic compounds of formula I can be prepared by one or more of the synthetic methods described and referred to in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,831,031 and 4,883,795. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,831,031 and 4,883,795 are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The compounds of formula I may be prepared by reacting piperazines of formula II with compounds of formula III as follows: wherein Hal is fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo. This coupling reaction is generally conducted in a polar solvent such as a lower alcohol, for instance ethanol, dimethylformamide or methylisobutylketone, and in the presence of a weak base such as a tertiary amine base, for instance triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine. Preferably, the reaction is in the further presence of a catalytic amount of sodium iodide, and a neutralizing agent for hydrochloride such as sodium carbonate. The reaction is preferably conducted at the reflux temperature of the solvent used. The piperazine derivatives of formula II may be prepared by methods known in the art. For instance, preparation may be by reacting an arylhalide of the formula ArHal wherein Ar is as defined above and Hal is fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo, with piperazine in a hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene at about room temperature to reflux temperature for about half an hour to 24 hours. Alternatively, the compounds of formula II may be prepared by heating an amino-substituted aryl compound of the formula ArNH 2 wherein Ar is as defined above with a secondary amine to allow cyclization to form the piperazine ring attached to the aryl group Ar. The compounds of formula III may be prepared by known methods. For instance, compounds (III) may be prepared by reacting a halo-acetic acid or halo-butyric acid wherein the halogen substituted is fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo with a compound of the formula IV as follows: wherein X and Y are as defined above and m is 1 or 3. The compounds (V) are then reduced, e.g. with triethylsilane and trifluoroacetic acid in a nitrogen atmosphere, to form compounds (III). When Ar is the oxide or dioxide of benzoisothiazolyl, the corresponding benzoisothiazolyl is oxidized under acid conditions at low temperatures. The acid used is advantageously a mixture of sulphuric acid and nitric acid. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I are prepared in a conventional manner by treating a solution or suspension of the free base (I) with about one chemical equivalent of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. Conventional concentration and recrystallization techniques are employed in isolating the salts. Illustrative of suitable acids are acetic, lactic, succinic, maleic, tartaric, citric, gluconic, ascorbic, benzoic, cinnamic, fumaric, sulfuric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfamic, sulfonic such as methanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, and related acids. Compounds of formula I, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salt (referred to collectively hereinafter, as the active compounds of this invention), can be administered to a human subject either alone, or, preferably, in combination with pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers or diluents, in a pharmaceutical practice. Such compounds can be administered orally or parenterally. Parenteral administration includes especially intravenous and intramuscular administration. Additionally, in a pharmaceutical composition comprising an active compound of this invention, the weight ratio of active ingredient to carrier will normally be in the range from 1:6 to 2:1, and preferably 1:4 to 1:1. However, in any given case, the ratio chosen will depend on such factors as the solubility of the active component, the dosage contemplated and the precise route of administration. For oral use in treating psychiatric conditions whose manisfestations include psychiatric symptoms or behavioral disturbance, the active compounds of this invention can be administered, for example, in the form of tablets or capsules, or as an aqueous solution or suspension. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which can be used include lactose and corn starch, and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, can be added. For oral administration in capsule form, useful diluents are lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient can be combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and/or flavoring agents can be added. For intramuscular, parenteral and intravenous use, sterile solutions of the active ingredient can be prepared, and the pH of the solutions should be suitably adjusted and buffered. For intravenous use, the total concentration of solutes should be controlled to render the preparation isotonic. When an active compound of this invention is to be used in a human subject to treat psychiatric conditions whose manisfestations include psychiatric symptoms or behavioral disturbance, the daily dosage will normally be determined by the prescribing physician. Moreover, the dosage will vary according to the age, weight and response of the individual patient as well as the severity of the patients symptoms. However, in most instances, an effective amount for treating psychiatric conditions whose manisfestations include psychiatric symptoms or behavioral disturbance, will be a daily dosage in the range from 0.5 to 500 mg, and preferably 10 mg a day to 80 mg a day, in single or divided doses, orally or parenterally. In some instances it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits. The receptor binding and neurotransmitter uptake inhibition profile for ziprasidone, 5-(2-(4-(1,2-benzisothiazol-3-yl)piperazinyl)ethyl)chlorooxindole hydrochloride, was described in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 275, 101-113 (1995), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The following examples illustrate methods of preparing various compounds of formula I. EXAMPLE 1 6-(2-(4-(1-Naphthyl)piperazinyl)ethyl)-benzoxazolone A. To a 500 ml three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with mechanical stirrer and nitrogen inlet were added 200 grams of polyphosphoric acid, 13.51 grams (0.1 mole) of benzoxazolone, and 13.89 g (0.1 mole) of bromoacetic acid. The reaction was heated with stirring at 115 C. for 2.5 hours and poured into 1 kg ice. The mixture was stirred mechanically for 1 hour to form a purple solid, which was then filtered off and washed with water. The solid was slurried with acetone for 30 minutes, a small amount of purple solid filtered off, and the brown filtrate evaporated. The resulting dark brown gum was slurried with 150 ml ethanol for 30 minutes, and the brown solid filtered off and washed with ethanol. This solid had a m.p. of 192-194 C. The solid (6.6 grams, 0.0257 mole) was placed in a 100 ml three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with magnetic stirrer, dropping funnel, thermometer, and nitrogen inlet and 19.15 ml (0.257 mole) of trifluoroacetic acid added. Triethylsilane (9.44 ml, 0.0591 mole) was added dropwise to the stirring slurry over 30 minutes. The reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature, then poured into 150 grams ice. The mixture was stirred for 15 minutes, and the brown gum filtered off. The gum was dissolved in 100 ml ethyl acetate, and 125 ml cyclohexane added, giving a brown precipitate, which was filtered and washed with cyclohexane. The filtrate was evaporated and the resulting yellow solid slurried with 50 ml isopropyl ether the pale yellow solid was filtered off and dried to give 2.7 g 6-(2-bromoethyl)-benzoxazolone (11% yield for two steps), m.p. 148-151 C. B. To a 100 ml round-bottomed flask equipped with magnetic stirrer, condenser, and nitrogen inlet were added 0.618 g (2.10 mmol) of N-(1-naphthyl)piperazine 0.472 g (1.95 mmol) of 6-(2-bromoethyl)-benzoxazolone, 0.411 ml (2.92 mmol) of triethylamine, 50 ml ethanol, and a catalytic amount of sodium iodide. The reaction was refluxed for 3 days, cooled, and evaporated to a brown gum. The gum was partitioned between 50 ml water and 75 ml methylene chloride, the pH adjusted with aqueous 1 N sodium hydroxide solution, and a little methanol added to facilitate phase separation.

This application is a divisional of Ser. No. 08/767,062 filed Dec. 16, 1996, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 5,990,113. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the monohydrates of aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said hydrates as active ingredients, and methods for preparing the monohydrates of the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivatives. BACKGROUND ART The aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivatives represented by the following formula (I): wherein R 1 represents a hydrogen atom, a C 1 -C 6 alkyl group, a C 3 C 7 , cycloalkyl group, a halogenated C 1 -C 4 alkyl group, a halogen atom, or a C 6 -C12 aryl group; R 2 represents a hydrogen atom, a C 1 -C 6 alkyl group, or a C 7 -C 12 aralkyl group which may have one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of cyano group, nitro group, a C 1 -C 6 alkoxy group, a halogen atom, a C 1 -C 6 alkyl group, and amino group; and n represents an integer of from 1 to 4, are known to have inhibitory activities on intracellular hyperaccumulation of Ca 2 (the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) No. (Hei)3-7263/1991). It has been also revealed that these compound are useful for the preventive and therapeutic treatment of ischemic heart diseases such as myocardial infarction or angina pectoris, cardiac failure, hypertension, arrhythmia and the like the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) Nos. (Hei)3-7263/1991 and (Hei)4-139127/1992. Among these compounds, 2-(1-piperazinyl)-5-methylbenzene-sulfonic acid (the substance disclosed in Example 1 of the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) No. (Hei)3-7263/1991 and disclosed as Compound No. 12 in Preparation Example 1 of the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) No. (Hei)4-139127/1992) remarkably inhibits the inflow of calcium ions into cardiac muscle cells and is highly safe, and thus the compound is expected to be extremely useful as an active ingredient of a medicament for preventive and therapeutic treatment of heart diseases. The methods for preparation of these compounds are disclosed in the Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) No. (Hei)6-86438/1994, and according to these methods, the compounds of the above formula (I) are obtained as anhydrgus crystals. However, according to the research by the inventors of the present invention, it was found that these anhydrous crystals are hygroscopic and may finally form monohydrates, when being left alone, by gradually absorbing moisture to gain weight. When the inventors conducted research particularly focusing on the preparation of formulations to provide 2-(1-piperazinyl)-5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid as a medicament for therapeutic and preventive treatment of heart disease, they faced problems that the substance could not be accurately weighed because it gradually absorbed moisture and in weight during manufacturing processes, and that constant formulations could not be stably manufactured because the contents of the active ingredient fluctuated from lot to lot of resulting formulations. In order to provide medicaments comprising the aforementioned aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivatives as active ingredients, it is thus desired that monohydrates instead of anhydrous crystals are used the viewpoints of manufacturing and distributing medicaments being stable and having guaranteed constant qualities. The Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) Nos. (Hei) 3-7263/1991 and (Hei)4-139127/1992 disclose the presence of acid addition salts and base addition salts of the aforementioned aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivatives. However, the publications neither teach nor suggest that these compounds have properties to form hydrates. Furthermore, although the publications specifically disclose 2-(1-piperazinyl)-5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid in the free form (anhydrous crystal), they neither teach nor suggest as to whether or not the compound forms a monohydrate. Generally, for the preparation of hydrates from anhydrous crystals, such methods are used, for example, (1) a method in which an anhydrous crystal is left in a steam-humidified room so as to be appropriately moistened; or (2) a method in which an anhydrous crystal is actively sprayed with humidified steam so as to be appropriately moistened. However, when large amounts of hydrates are manufactured, the above method (1) requires a prolonged period of time for humidification and it also causes difficulties that constant hydrates can hardly be manufactured, because sweat, formed in the steam room or the container, leads to partially uneven humidification. The method (2) also causes problems that constant hydrates can hardly be manufactured because of partially uneven humidification when an anhydrous crystal is insufficiently dispersed. In addition, in both of the methods (1) and (2), it is difficult to control the conditions for humidification, and accordingly, it is very likely that moisture is absorbed more than the desired amount that equates to the anhydrous crystal. In that case, a problem arises that the anhydrous crystal must be prepared all over again. The inventors of the present invention tried to prepare a monohydrate basically according to the method (1), and as described in the Reference Example which follows, they confirmed that the method had problems, for example, that the production of monohydrate required a long period of time and sweat was formed in the steam room or the container and the sweat had to be frequently wiped. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The inventors of the present invention examined the causes for the above problems, and as a result, they found that the anhydrous crystal of 2-(1-piperazinyl)-5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid gradually converted to monohydrate by uptaking one molecule of water as water of crystallization while contacting moisture in air and water used in the drug manufacturing process. The inventors also found that the monohydrate once formed was stable and free from weight variation by hygroscopicity, and that the monohydrate can be accurately weighed when used in a formulation process and thus a pharmaceutical composition containing a constant content of the active ingredient can be provided. The present invention was achieved on the basis of these findings. In addition, the inventors of the present invention conducted various studies on convenient methods for preparing monohydrates of the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivatives, and as a result, succeeded in achieving the present invention. The present invention thus provides a monohydrate of an aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative represented by the following formula (I): wherein R 1 represents a hydrogen atom, a C 1 -C 6 alkyl group, a C 3 -C 7 cycloalkyl group, a halogenated C 1 -C 4 alkyl group, a halogen atom, or a C 6 -C 12 aryl group; R 2 represents a hydrogen atom, a C 1 -C 6 alkyl group, or a C 7 -C 12 aralkyl group which may have one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of cyano group, nitro group, a C 1 -C 6 alkoxy group, a halogen atom, a C 1 -C 6 alkyl group, and amino group; and n represents an integer of from 1 to 4 (in the specification, the term monohydratel means a monohydrated crystal). According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the monohydrate is of said aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative wherein R 1 is a hydrogen atom or a C 1 -C 6 alkyl group, R 2 is a hydrogen atom, and n is 2.

Examples of such salts include, for example, alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts such as, for example, sodium salts, potassium salts, magnesium salts, calcium salts, or aluminum salts; ammonium salts; amine salts such as, for example, lower alkylamine salts such as triethylamine, hydroxy-lower alkylamine salts such as 2-hydroxyethylamine salts, bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine salts, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane salts, or N-methyl-D-glucamine salts, cycloalkylamine salts such as dicyclohexylamine salts, benzylamine salts such as N,N-dibenzylethylenediamine salts, or dibenzylamine salts; inorganic acid salts such as, for example, hydrochloric acid salts, hydrobromic acid salts, sulfuric acid salts, or phosphoric acid salts; and organic acid salts such as, for example, fumaric acid salts, succinic acid salts, oxalic acid salts, or lactic acid salts. An example of the more preferred embodiment of the present invention include, for example, the monohydrate of the compound of the formula (I) wherein R 1 is methyl group, R 2 is a hydrogen atom, and n is 2. The crystal of the monohydrate of 2-(1-piperazinyl)-5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid, provided as a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, is distinguishable from the anhydrous crystal of 2-(1-piperazinyl)-5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid disclosed as Compound No. 12 in Example 1 of the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) No. (Hei)3-7263/1991. The aforementioned monohydrate of the present invention is stable for a long period of time and the water of crystal will not be generally released when dried at room temperature. However, when heated under ambient pressure or reduced pressure at a temperature of 60 C. or higher, e.g., a temperature of from 100 to 120 C., the hydrate will gradually release the water of crystal to give the anhydrous crystal disclosed in Example 1 of the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) No. (Hei)3-7263/1991. As for the monohydrate of 2-(1-piperazinyl)-5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid, a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, various physicochemical properties will be described in the section of Examples by referring to experimental values and spectrums. However, it should be understood that these experimental values and spectrums are described by way of a reference purpose. Whether or not a certain crystal falls within the monohydrate of the present invention should not be decided based on criteria whether or not the crystal gives completely the same experimental values, and spectrums as those disclosed in the present specification. It will be readily understood by those skilled in the art that such experimental values and spectrums involve experimental errors due to factors including a measuring apparatus, a measuring process, and measuring conditions, and accordingly, the decision should be made based on a consideration of such experimental errors and using criteria whether or not the crystal has substantially the physicochemical properties set out below. Although the method for manufacturing the monohy drate of the present invention is not particularly limited, it may generally be manufactured by preparing anhydrous crystals of the compound of formula (I) according to the method disclosed in Example 1 of the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) No. (Hei)3-7263/1991, and then contacting the anhydrous crystals with water, moisture in a solvent, or moisture in air for a suitable period of time. However, for the preparation of the monohydrate of the present invention, it is preferable to use the method of the present invention as explained below. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for preparing the monohydrate of the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivatives of formula (I), which comprises the step in which an anhydrous crystal of said aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative is suspended in water or an organic solvent containing water, or said anhydrous crystal is dissolved in water or an organic solvent containing water and the resulting solution is subjected to crystallization treatment, and then the crystal obtained is dried. The aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivatives of formula (I), used as the starting materials of the present invention, can be prepared by the known method (the Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) No. (Hei)6-86438/1994). For example, 5-methyl-2-(1-piperazinyl)benzenesulfonic acid can be obtained by reacting 2-fluoro-5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid and piperazine in a sealed tube under heating in the presence of cuprous iodide and copper powder. This compound corresponds to the compound of the formula (I) wherein R 1 is methyl group, R 2 is a hydrogen atom, and n is 2 (Compound No. 2 in Table 1). The monohydrate of the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative can be obtained by suspending the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative represented by the formula (I) in water or a water-containing organic solvent, and recovering the resulting crystals by filtration and drying the crystals. As the organic solvent, water-miscible solvents such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, acetone, and tetrahydrofuran can be used. The suspending treatment may preferably be carried out with stirring and a temperature for the treatment may be in a range of from an ambient temperature to a temperature under heating, preferably at 35 C. or less, and an ambient temperature may be sufficient. The volume of water or the water-containing organic solvent is not particularly limited, and may be chosen so as to sufficiently immerse the aminobenzene-ulfonic acid derivative of the above formula (I). Generally, the solvent may used in an amount of 1 to 50 times (V/W) of the weight of the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative of the formula (I). Although a water content ratio in the water-containing organic solvent is not particularly limited, water should be used in an equimolar amount or more of the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative of the above formula (I). The time for the suspension treatment may generally be 1 hour or more, preferably 2 hours or more, although a shorter time may be sufficient. After the completion of the suspending treatment, the resulting crystals are collected by filtration and then dried to give the monohydrate of the present invention. The pressure and a temperature for the drying process may appropriately determined in consideration of a bond strength of the water of crystal, constituting the monohydrate, to the crystal (i.e., a stability of the monohydrate). The completion of the drying process may be determined by observing a cessation of weight alteration (i.e., a decrease) of the crystals. The monohydrate of the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative of the present invention can also be prepared by subjecting a solution, obtained by dissolving the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative of the above formula (I) in water or a water-containing organic solvent, to a crystallizing treatment and then recovering the resulting crystals by filtration and drying the crystals. Examples of the crystallizing treatment include, for example, (a) a process comprising the step of dissolving the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative of the above general formula (I) in water or a water-containing organic solvent under heating or under reflux with stirring, and then cooling the solution to allow the precipitation and growing of the crystals; (b) a process comprising the step of dissolving the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative of the above general formula (I) in a basic or a acidic aqueous solution or water-containing organic solvent, and then adjusting the hydrogen ion concentration using an acid or a base to allow the precipitation and growing of the crystals; or (c) dissolving the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative of the above general formula (I) in water or a water-containing organic solvent, and then adding a solvent which reduces the solubility of the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative of the above general formula (I) to allow the precipitation and growing of the crystals. As the organic solvent, water-miscible organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, acetone, or tetrahydrofuran can be used. As the acid, mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, or organic acids such as acetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, or p-toluenesulfonic acid may be used, and as the base, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, or potassium hydrogen carbonate, or organic bases such as pyridine or triethylamine may be used. These acids and bases may be used as solutions diluted or dissolved with water or organic solvents. The temperature applied to dissolve the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative of the above general formula (I); the amount of water, the water-containing organic solvent, the basic solvent, or the acidic solvent; the amount of an acid or a base used to adjust the hydrogen ion concentration; and a temperature for the growing of the precipitated crystals may suitably be chosen in consideration of the solubility of the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative of the above general formula (I) in the solvent used. In the above process (a), the temperature applied to dissolve the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative of the above general formula (I) may preferably be, for example, the refluxing temperature of the solvent, and the volume of water or water-containing organic solvent may preferably be the minimum volume required to completely dissolve the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative of the above general formula (I) at the refluxing temperature of the solvent. The temperature applied to the growing of the crystals may preferably be an ambient temperature or less, more preferably 25 C. or less. The water content ratio of the water-containing organic solvent is not particularly limited, and may be suitably chosen in consideration of the solubility of the aminobenzene-sulfonic acid derivative of the above general formula (I) in the solvent. The period of time for the growing of the precipitated crystals may generally be 1 hour or more, preferably 2 hours or more. After the completion of the growing, the crystals are collected by filtration and dried to obtain the monohydrate of the present invention. The drying process may be carried out according to the methods explained above. Where the monohydrates of the present invention are the monohydrates of the salts of the compounds of the above formula (I), the monohydrates of the present invention may be prepared by processes such as, for example, a process comprising the step of preparing the salt of the aminobenzenesulfonic acid derivative of the above formula (I) by an ordinary method, and then preparing the monohydrate of the resulting salt according to the method described above; a process comprising the step of preparing the monohydrate of the compound in the free form according to the method of the present invention, and then converting the product to the monohydrate of the salt by an ordinary method: or a process comprising the step of preparing the salt by an ordinary method simultaneously in the process of preparing the monohydrate according to the method of the present invention. The monohydrates of the present invention are characterized in that they are substantially free from water absorption and/or hygroscopicity. Accordingly, for example, by using the monohydrate of 2-(1-piperazinyl)-5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid of the present invention as an active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition, instead of the anhydrous crystal of 2-(1-piperazinyl)-5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid disclosed in Example 1 of the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) No.(Hei)3-7263/1991, it becomes possible to accurately weigh the active ingredient, and a pharmaceutical composition having a constant content of the active ingredient can be provided. The monohydrates of the present invention are useful for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions used for the preventive and therapeutic treatment of ischemic heart diseases such as myocardial infarction or angina pectoris, cardiac failure, hypertension, arrhythmia and the like. The forms of the pharmaceutical compositions are not particularly limited, and examples include, for example, formulations for oral administration such as, for example, tablets, capsules, powders, subtilized granules, granules, solutions, or syrups, or formulations for parenteral administration such as, for example, injections, drip infusions, suppositories, inhalants, patches. For the manufacture of the above pharmaceutical compositions, pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable additives may optionally be used. For the preparation of the pharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral, transdermal, or transmucosal administration, for example, excipients such as glucose, lactose, D-mannitol, starch, or crystalline cellulose; disintegrator or disintegrating aids such as carboxymethylcellulose, starch, or carboxymethylcellulose calcium; binders such as hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or gelatin; lubricants such as magnesium stearate or talc; coating agents such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, saccharose, polyethylene glycol, or titanium oxide; bases such as vaseline, liquid paraffin, polyethylene glycol, gelatin, china clay, glycerin, purified water, or hard fat. Pharmaceutical additives such as, for example, propellants such as flons, diethyl ether, or compressed gases; adhesives such as sodium polyacrylate, polyvinyl alcohol, methylcellulose, polyisobutylene, or polybutene; or base cloths such as cotton cloths or plastic sheets may also be used. For the manufacture of the pharmaceutical compositions suitable as injections or drip infusions, pharmaceutical additives such as, for example, dissolving agents or dissolving aids which can form aqueous injections or injections dissolved before use such as distilled water for injection, physiological saline, or propylene glycol; isotonic agents such as glucose, sodium chloride, D-mannitol, or glycerin; pH modifiers such as inorganic acids, organic acid, inorganic bases, or organic bases may be used. The present invention will be more specifically explained by referring to the following examples. However, the scope of the present invention is not limited to the following examples. EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of the Monohydrate of the Present Invention (a) According to the method described in Example 1 of the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) No.(Hei)3-7263/1991, 2-fluoro-5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid (0.76 g) and piperazine (3.44 g) were reacted in a sealed tube in the presence of cuprous iodide (0.76 g) and copper powder (0.26 g) at 160 C. for 8 hours, and then the reaction product was purified by silica gel chromatography (eluent: chloroform : methanol : acetic acid100:100:3) to give anhydrous crystals of 2-(1-piperazinyl)-5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid (0.67 g, yield: 65.0%). (b) The anhydrous crystals obtained in the above process (a) (0.4506 g) and distilled water (1.35 ml) were added in a 5 ml round-bottomed flask and the mixture was stirred at 5 C. for 2 hours. The crystals were recovered from the suspension by suction filtration, and then crystals remaining in the round-bottomed flask were recovered by washing with the filtrate. The crystals were combined and dried at 50 C. and 90 mmpg for 3 hours to obtain 5-methyl-2-(1-piperazinyl)benzenesulfonic acid monohydrate as white crystals (0.4485 g, yield: 93.0%). From the result of the elemental analysis set out below, the compound was verified as the monohydrate.

The measurements were carried out in the temperature range of from 50 to 400 C. applying the temperature raising rate of 5 C./min. As the anhydrous crystals, those obtained in the above process (a) was used. For the monohydrate of the present invention, a weight loss and a thermal absorption peak due to the release of the water of crystal were observed from around 60 C. The weight loss was 6.57%, which corresponded to the release of one molecule of water. Thermal absorption peaks accompanied by weight losses were also observed around 300 C. and 320 C. (FIG. 1 ). On the other hand, the anhydrous crystal exhibited thermal absorption peaks accompanied by weight losses around 300 C. and 320 C., but no weight loss or no thermal absorption peak due to the release of the water of crystal was observed at temperatures below 100 C. (FIG. 2 ). A sample was prepared, in situ, by heating the monohydrate obtained in the above process (b) in the thermal analyzer by heating up to 110 C. to remove the water of crystal, and after cooling to room temperature, the thermal analysis was carried out using the converted weight. The results were the same as those obtained by the anhydrous product (FIG. 2 ). Example 3 X-ray Diffraction Analysis of the Monohydrate of the Present Invention Powder X-ray diffraction analysis of the monohydrate of the present invention was performed at room temperature under dried nitrogen gas flow (50 ml/min) using an X-ray diffractometer (Philips, PW 1700). The powder diffraction profile obtained is shown in FIG. 3 . Powder X-ray diffraction analysis of the anhydrous crystal obtained in the above process (a) in Example 1 was also carried out under the same conditions. The resulting powder diffraction profile is shown in FIG. 4 . The monohydrate and the anhydrous crystal gave distinguishable powder diffraction profiles, which verified that these crystalline powders were different from each other. After the analysis of the monohydrate, the sample was heated to 110 C. to prepare anhydrous crystals, in situ. After cooling to 25 C., powder X-ray diffraction analysis was carried out, and as a result, the same powder diffraction profile as that shown in FIG. 4 was obtained. Example 4 Hygroscopic Property of the Monohydrate of the Present Invention Each of the samples of the monohydrate of the present invention was put in a desiccator adjusted at a relative humidity of 57% or 98%, and then stored at 20 C. for 16 days. Weight changes during the period of time were measured. As controls, the anhydrous crystals obtained in the above process (a) in Example 1 were also stored in a desiccator adjusted at a relative humidity of 57% or 98%, and weight changes were measured. The results are shown in Table 2 in the table, each of the values (%) represents a weight increase. No substantial weight change was observed in the monohydrate under both of the relative humidity conditions. On the other hand, as for the anhydrous crystal, the weight increase of about 7% was observed, which corresponded to about 1 mole of the water of crystal.

Radioactivities in the serum were measured and AUC(0-) was calculated (1039.86 ng eqh/ml). The labeled compound was also administered intravenously to male rats (n3) at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg (corresponding to 0.28-mg/kg of the anhydrous crystal) and radioactivities in the serum were measured to calculate AUC(0-) (816.28 ng eqh/ml). Using these values of AUC(0-) and the doses applied, the bioavailability was calculated according to the following Equation 1. Example 6 Serum Concentration (2) The labeled compound was orally administered to male rats (n5) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, or 3 mg/kg (0.094 mg/kg, 0.28 mg/kg, 0.94 mg/kg or 2.8 mg/kg corresponding to the anhydrous crystals, respectively) and radioactivities in serum were observed. Tmax, Cmax, t1/2, and AUC calculated from the course of the serum radioactivities are summarized in Table 3. Correlations between the AUC and the dose, and between the Cmax and the dose are shown FIGS. 5 and 6 . TABLE 3 Dose (mg/kg) T max (hr) C max (ng/ml) t (hr) AUC (ng hr/ml) 0.1 2.2 0.5 16.2 2.6 1.77 0.34 64.1 12.3 0.3 2.2 0.5 69.0 17.8 1.33 0.09 270.5 88.4 1 1.8 0.5 171.6 31.1 1.64 0.17 574.4 113.2 3 2.0 0.0 501.5 133.8 1.30 0.08 1769.2 498.4 Mean S.D (n 5) As shown in Example 4, the anhydrous crystal exhibited about 7% of weight change (one molecule of water corresponds to about 7% of the total weight of the monohydrate of 2-(1-piperazinyl)-5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid). Apparently, the anhydrous crystal causes approximately the maximum 7% of weight change by hydration due to moisture absorption in course of time. Therefore, where crystals obtained as the anhydrous crystals are measured, administration doses of the active substance may be varied in a range of from 93 to 100% depending on the degree of the hydration, since the degree of hydration due to the moisture absorption is unknown. on the other hand, if the crystals are weighed as the monohydrate, administration doses of the active substance may be varied in a range of from 100 to 107% by the same reason. Accordingly, the weighing process of the anhydrous crystal may cause fluctuation of the dose of the active substance within a range of from 93 to 107% with respect to an intended dose. As shown in Example 6, the serum concentration of the monohydrate of the present invention exhibits linear direct proportion to the dose of administration. Accordingly, if the anhydrous crystal is weighed and administered, the serum concentration may similarly fluctuate within the span of 14%. In consideration of the calculation of the oral absorbability in Example 5, the absorbability is provided by Equation 1, and therefore, the values as the denominator and the numerator of Equation 1 which represent the doses may fluctuate independently. When the average of the fluctuated bioavailability is considered as 38%, the following results are obtained: Maximum value(107%/93%)38%43.72% Minimum value(93%/107%)38%33.03%. The results indicate that the range of fluctuation of the bioavailability may be expanded to 33.0343.72% (difference) 10.69%). In contrast, the monohydrates of the present invention are stable and free from the fluctuations as mentioned above. Accordingly, the monohydrates of the present invention have advantages that determination of a dose for desired efficacy and the assurance of safe range of administration can easily be conducted, and various administration routes can be chosen. In addition, for example, when the monohydrate of the present invention is used as a medicament for clinical treatment of a patient in a condition of cardiac failure, it is clinically very important to accurately measure the effect of improvement of cardiac functions and appropriately control the dose depending on the improved conditions. By using the monohydrate of the present invention, the serum concentration of the drug can properly be maintained and the production of the effect can be controlled. Example 7 Preparation of the Monohydrate in a Steam Moistened Room Steam was generated by heating a bath filled with water at 50 C. in a plastic sheet housing isolated from outer air. The anhydrous crystal of 5-Methyl-2-(1-piperazinyl)benzenesulfonic acid (4886.16 g) prepared by the method described in the Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) No.(Hei)3-7263/1991 was spread in a stainless flat container and left in the above plastic sheet housing.

Field of the Invention This invention relates to aminoisoindole derivatives which selectively bind to brain dopamine receptor subtypes. More specifically, it relates to 1-(N-(arylalkylaminoalkyl)) aminoisoindoles and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds. It further relates to the use of such compounds in treating various neuropsychochological disorders. 2. Description of the Related Art Schizophrenia or psychosis is a term used to describe a group of illnesses of unknown origin which affect approximately 2.5 million people in the United States. These disorders of the brain are characterized by a variety of symptoms which are classified as positive symptoms (disordered thought, hallucinations and delusions) and negative symptoms (social withdrawal and unresponsiveness). These disorders have an age of onset in adolescence or early adulthood and persist for many years. The disorders tend to become more severe during the patients lifetime and can result in prolonged institutionalization. Within the United States of America, approximately 40% of all hospitalized psychiatric patients suffer from schizophrenia. During the 1950s physicians demonstrated that they could successfully treat psychotic (schizophrenic) patients with medications called neuroleptics. This classification of antipsychotic medication was based largely on the activating (neuroleptic) properties of the nervous system by these drugs. Subsequently, neuroleptic agents were shown to increase the concentrations of dopamine metabolites in the brain. This finding suggested that altered neuronal firing of the dopamine system contributed in some way to the aberrant behavior observed in schizophrenic patients. Additional evidence indicated that dopamine could increase the activity of adenylate cyclase in the corpus striatum, an effect reversed by neuroleptic agents. Thus, cumulative evidence from these and later experiments strongly suggested that the neurotransmitter dopamine was involved in schizophrenia One of the major actions of antipsychotic medication is the blockade of dopamine receptors in brain. Several dopamine systems appear to exist in the brain and at least five classes of dopamine receptors appear to mediate the actions of this transmitter. These dopamine receptors differ in their pharmacological specificity and were originally classified on the basis of their ability to bind various dopaminergic ligands. The butyrophenones are a class of drugs containing many potent antipsychotic drugs. Perhaps the most prominent member of this class of compounds is the antipsychotic drug haloperidol (chemical name). Haloperidol binds relatively weakly at the major dopamine receptor subtype which activates adenylate cyclase (commonly classified as the D 1 dopamine receptor). In contrast, haloperidol displayed binding affinity at a dopamine receptor subtype which suppressed the activity of adenylate cyclase (commonly classified as D 2 receptors) in the subnanomolar range. Recently, three additional dopamine receptor subtypes have been identified using the often congruent sciences of receptor pharmacology and molecular biology. These new dopamine receptors have been labeled as D3, D4, and D 5 . The D 3 and D 4 subtypes are pharmacologically related to the D 2 receptor via their ability to suppress the activity of adenylate cyclase. Conversely, the D 5 receptor is classified as a D 1 -like dopamine subtype through its ability to stimulate cyclase activity. Recently, a new group of drugs (such as sulpiride and clozapine) have been developed with a lesser incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) than classical neuroleptics. In addition, there is some indication that they may be more beneficial in treating negative symptoms in some patients. Since all D 2 blockers do not possess a similar profile, hypotheses underlying the differences have been investigated. Major differences have been detected in the anticholinergic actions of these drugs. It has also been suggested that the dopamine receptors in motor areas may differ from those in the limbic areas which are thought to mediate the antipsychotic responses. The existence of the D 3 , D 4 and D5 and other as yet undiscovered dopamine receptors may contribute to this profile. Some of the atypical compounds possess similar activity at D 2 , D 3 and D 4 receptors. The examples of this patent fall into this general class of molecules. Using molecular biological techniques it has been possible to clone cDNAs coding for each of the pharmacologically defined receptors There are at least two forms of D1 which have been identified as D 1 and D 5 , and two forms of D 2 , identified now as D2 and D 4 dopamine receptors. In addition, there is at least one form of D 3 dopamine receptor. The 1-(N-(arylalkylaminoalkyl))aminoisoindoles of this invention possess differential affinities for each receptor subtype. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention provides novel compounds of Formula 1 which interact with dopamine receptor subtypes. The invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds of Formula 1. The invention also provides compounds useful in treating affective disorders such as schizophrenia and depression as well as certain movement disorders such as Parkinsonism. Furthermore, compounds of this invention are useful in treating the extrapyramidal side effects associated with the use of conventional neuroleptic agents. Since particularly dopamine D 3 and D 4 receptor subtypes are concentrated in the limbic system (Taubes, Science 265 (1994) 1034), which controls cognition and emotion, compounds which interact with these receptors are useful in the treatment of cognitive disorders. Such disorders may be the cognitive deficits which are a significant component of the negative symptoms (social withdrawal and unresponsiveness) of schizophrenia. Other disorders involving memory impairment or attention deficit disorders can also be treated with some of the compounds of this invention that interact specifically with dopamine D 3 and/or D 4 receptor subtypes. Accordingly, a broad embodiment of the invention is directed to a compounds of Formula 1 where the 6-membered A ring may be optionally substituted with up to four groups independently selected from halogen, hydroxy, lower alkyl, or lower alkoxy; Ar represents optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl Z represents carbon or nitrogen provided that where Z is carbon. R 11 represents hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, lower alkyl, or lower alkoxy, or phenyl optionally substituted with one or two groups selected from hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, lower alkyl, or lower alkoxy; and where Z is nitrogen, R 11 represents an electron pair; R 5 is hydrogen or lower alkyl; L is an integer of from 1-4; m is an integer of from 2-5; n is 0, or an integer of from 1-4; R 12 and R 13 independently represent lower alkyl; or together may represent (CR x R y ) s where s is an integer of from 1-6 and R x and R y independently represent hydrogen or lower alkyl; CRR represents a methylene group optionally substituted with lower alkyl; and k is 0 or an integer of from 1 to 3. Thus, the compounds of Formula 1 can be used in the treatment of various neuropsychochological disorders including, for example, schizophrenia, dementia, depression, anxiety, Parkinson-like motor disorders and motion disorders related to the use of neuroleptic agents.

The pharmaceutical utility of compounds of this invention are indicated by the following assays for dopamine receptor subtype affinity. Assay for D 2 and D 3 Receptor Binding Activity Pellets of COS cells containing recombinantly produced D2 or D3 receptors from African Green monkey were used for the assays. The sample is homogenized in 100 volumes (w/vol) of 0.05 M Tris HCl buffer at 4 C. and pH 7.4. The sample is then centrifuged at 30,000g and resuspended and rehomogenized. The sample is then centrifuged as described and the final tissue sample is frozen until use. The tissue is resuspended 1:20 (wt/vol) in 0.05 M Tris HCl buffer containing 100 mM NaCl. Incubations are carried out at 48 C. and contain 0.4 ml of tissue sample, 0.5 nM 3 H-YM 09151-2 and the compound of interest in a total incubation of 1.0 ml. Nonspecific binding is defined as that binding found in the presence of 1 mM spiperone; without further additions, nonspecific binding is less than 20% of total binding. The binding characteristics of examples of this patent for the D2 and D 3 receptor subtypes are shown in Table 2 for Rat Striatal Homogenates. TABLE 2 Compound Number 1 D 2 K i (mM) D 3 K i (mM) 1 2.380 100 2 1.420 100 3 1.937 100 1 Compound numbers relate to compounds shown in Table 1 above. Assay for D 4 Receptor Binding Activity Clonal cell lines expressing the human dopamine D 4 receptor subtype were harvested in PBS and the cells centrifuged and the pellets stored at 80 C. until used in the binding assay. The pellets were resuspended and the cells lysed at 4 C. in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 buffer containing 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 5 mM MgCl 2 . The homogenate is centrifuged at 48000g for 10 minutes at 4 C. The resulting pellet is resuspended in fresh buffer and centrifuged again. After resuspension of the pellet in fresh buffer a 100 ml aliquot is removed for protein determination. The remaining homogenate is centrifuged as above, the supernatant removed and the pellet stored at 4 C. until needed at which time it is resuspended to a final concentration of 625 mg/ml (250 mg per sample) with 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) and 120 mM NaCl just prior to use. Incubations were carried out for 60 minutes at 25 C. in the presence of 0.1 nM 3 H YM-09151-2. The incubation was terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/C filters and rinsed with 24 ml washes of chilled 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 120 mM NaCl. Non-specific binding was determined with 1 mM spiperone and radioactivity determined by counting in an LKB beta counter. Binding parameters were determined by non-linear least squares repression analysis from which the inhibition constant Ki could be calculated for each test compound. The binding characteristics of some examples of this invention are shown in Table 3 for the dopamine D 4 binding assay. In general, compounds of the accompanying Examples were tested in the above assay, and all were found to possess a Ki value for the displacement of 3 HYM-09151-2 from the human dopamine D 4 receptor subtype of below 500 nM. Some specific data is indicated in Table 3. TABLE 3 Compound Number 1 K i (mM) 1 0.012 2 0.070 3 0.100 1 Compound numbers relate to compounds shown in Table 1 above.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/057,432, filed Sep. 2, 1997. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods for the treatment of psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases, including major depression, anxiety-related disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, supranuclear palsy and feeding disorders, as well as treatment of immunological, cardiovascular or heart-related diseases and colonic hypersensitivity associated with psychopathological disturbance and stress. In particular, the present invention relates to novel heterocyclyl-substituted ring-fused pyridine and pyrimidine compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and methods of use in treating psychiatric disorders, neurological diseases, immunological, cardiovascular or heart-related diseases and colonic hypersensitivity associated with psychopathological disturbance and stress, by administration of the compounds of the invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Corticotropin releasing factor (herein referred to as CRF), a 41 amino acid peptide, is the primary physiological regulator of proopiomelanocortin(POMC)derived peptide secretion from the anterior pituitary gland J. Rivier et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA) 80:4851 (1983); W. Vale et al., Science 213:1394 (1981). In addition to its endocrine role at the pituitary gland, immunohistochemical localization of CRF has demonstrated that the hormone has a broad extrahypothalamic distribution in the central nervous system and produces a wide spectrum of autonomic, electrophysiological and behavioral effects consistent with a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role in brain W. Vale et al., Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 39:245 (1983); G. F. Koob, Persp. Behav. Med. 2:39 (1985); E. B. De Souza et al., J. Neurosci. 5:3189 (1985). There is also evidence that CRF plays a significant role in integrating the response of the immune system to physiological, psychological, and immunological stressors J. E. Blalock, Physiological Reviews 69:1 (1989); J. E. Morley, Life Sci. 41:527 (1987). Clinical data provide evidence that CRF has a role in psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases including depression, anxiety-related disorders and feeding disorders. A role for CRF has also been postulated in the etiology and pathophysiology of Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, Huntingtons disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as they relate to the dysfunction of CRF neurons in the central nervous system for review see E. B. De Souza, Hosp. Practice 23:59 (1988). In affective disorder, or major depression, the concentration of CRF is significantly increased in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of drug-free individuals C. B. Nemeroff et al., Science 226:1342 (1984); C. M. Banki et al., Am. J. Psychiatry 144:873 (1987); R. D. France et al., Biol. Psychiatry 28:86 (1988); M. Arato et al., Biol Psychiatry 25:355 (1989). Furthermore, the density of CRF receptors is significantly decreased in the frontal cortex of suicide victims, consistent with a hypersecretion of CRF C. B. Nemeroff et al., Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 45:577 (1988). In addition, there is a blunted adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) response to CRF (i.v. administered) observed in depressed patients P. W. Gold et al., Am J. Psychiatry 141:619 (1984); F. Holsboer et al., Psychoneuroendocrinology 9:147 (1984); P. W. Gold et al., New Eng. J. Med. 314:1129 (1986). Preclinical studies in rats and non-human primates provide additional support for the hypothesis that hypersecretion of CRF may be involved in the symptoms seen in human depression R. M. Sapolsky, Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 46:1047 (1989). There is preliminary evidence that tricyclic antidepressants can alter CRF levels and thus modulate the numbers of CRF receptors in brain Grigoriadis et al., Neuropsychopharmacology 2:53 (1989). There has also been a role postulated for CRF in the etiology of anxiety-related disorders. CRF produces anxiogenic effects in animals and interactions between benzodiazepine/non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics and CRF have been demonstrated in a variety of behavioral anxiety models D. R. Britton et al., Life Sci. 31:363 (1982); C. W. Berridge and A. J. Dunn Regul. Peptides 16:83 (1986). Preliminary studies using the putative CRF receptor antagonist a-helical ovine CRF (9-41) in a variety of behavioral paradigms demonstrate that the antagonist produces anxiolytic-like effects that are qualitatively similar to the benzodiazepines C. W. Berridge and A. J. Dunn Horm. Behav. 21:393 (1987), Brain Research Reviews 15:71 (1990). Neurochemical, endocrine and receptor binding studies have all demonstrated interactions between CRF and benzodiazepine anxiolytics providing further evidence for the involvement of CRF in these disorders. Chlordiazepoxide attenuates the ganxiogenicm effects of CRF in both the conflict test K. T. Britton et al., Psychopharmacology 86:170 (1985); K. T. Britton et al., Psychopharmacology 94:306 (1988) and in the acoustic startle test N. R. Swerdlow et al., Psychopharmacology 88:147 (1986) in rats. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (Ro15-1788), which was without behavioral activity alone in the operant conflict test, reversed the effects of CRF in a dose-dependent manner while the benzodiazepine inverse agonist (FG7142) enhanced the actions of CRF K. T. Britton et al., Psychopharmacology 94:306 (1988). The mechanisms and sites of action through which the standard anxiolytics and antidepressants produce their therapeutic effects remain to be elucidated. It has been hypothesized however, that they are involved in the suppression of the CRF hypersecretion that is observed in these disorders. Of particular interest is that preliminary studies examining the effects of a CRF receptor antagonist (-helical CRF 9 -41) in a variety of behavioral paradigms have demonstrated that the CRF antagonist produces anxiolytic-like effects qualitatively similar to the benzodiazepines for review see G. F. Koob and K. T. Britton, In: Corticotropin - Releasing Factor: Basic and Clinical Studies of a Neuropeptide , E. B. De Souza and C. B. Nemeroff eds., CRC Press p221 (1990).

The compounds herein described may have asymmetric centers. Compounds of the present invention containing an asymmetrically substituted atom may be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms, such as by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis from optically active starting materials. Many geometric isomers of olefins, CN double bonds, and the like can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Cis and trans geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. All chiral, diastereomeric, racemic forms and all geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically indicated. All processes used to prepare compounds of the present invention and intermediates made therein are considered to be part of the present invention. The term substituted, as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens on the designated atom is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atoms normal valency is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound. When a substitent is keto (i.e., O), then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Keto substituents are not present on aromatic moieties. The present invention is intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. Isotopes of carbon include C-13 and C-14. When any variable (e.g., R 6 ) occurs more than one time in any constituent or formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-2 R 6 , then said group may optionally be substituted with up to two R 6 groups and R 6 at each occurrence is selected independently from the definition of R 6 . Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating the atom via which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound of a given formula, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such substituent. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.

The term amino acid residue as used herein means that portion of an amino acid (as defined herein) that is present in a peptide. The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. As used herein, Pharmaceutically acceptable salts refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; and alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and nitric; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, and isethionic. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 1418, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Since prodrugs are known to enhance numerous desirable qualities of pharmaceuticals (e.g., solubility, bioavailability, manufacturing, etc. . . ) the compounds of the present invention may be delivered in prodrug form. Thus, the present invention is intended to cover prodrugs of the presently claimed compounds, methods of delivering the same and compositions containing the same. Prodrugs are intended to include any covalently bonded carriers which release an active parent drug of the present invention in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs the present invention are prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound. Prodrugs include compounds of the present invention wherein a hydroxy, amino, or sulfhydryl group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the present invention is administered to a mammalian subject, it cleaves to form a free hydroxyl, free amino, or free sulfhydryl group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups in the compounds of the present invention. Stable compound and stable structure are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent. Substituted is intended to indicate that one or more hydrogens on the atom indicated in the expression using substituted is replaced with a selection from the indicated group(s), provided that the indicated atoms normal valency is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound. When a substituent is keto (i.e., O) group, then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Therapeutically effective amount is intended to include an amount of a compound of the present invention or an amount of the combination of compounds claimed effective to inhibit HIV infection or treat the symptoms of HIV infection in a host. The combination of compounds is preferably a synergistic combination. Synergy, as described for example by Chou and Talalay, Adv. Enzyme Regul. 22:27-55 (1984), occurs when the effect (in this case, inhibition of HIV replication) of the compounds when administered in combination is greater than the additive effect of the compounds when administered alone as a single agent. In general, a synergistic effect is most clearly demonstrated at suboptimal concentrations of the compounds. Synergy can be in terms of lower cytotoxicity, increased antiviral effect, or some other beneficial effect of the combination compared with the individual components. The term therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention means an amount effective to antagonize abnormal level of CRF or treat the symptoms of affective disorder, anxiety or depression in a host. Synthesis The bicylic fused pyrimidine and pyridines of this invention can be prepared by one of the general schemes outlined below (Schemes 1-15). Compounds of the Formula (I) wherein X and Y are can be prepared as shown in Scheme 1. The 4,6-dihydroxypyrimidines (III) can be nitrated using fuming nitric acid and then converted into intermediates (IV) by the action of phosphorous oxychloride with the optional assistance of a catalyst such as dialkylanilines (see: Brown, D. J. et.al. J. Chem. Soc., 1954, 3832). The amino group of pyrimidines of Formula (V) can be prepared from the corresponding nitro compounds (IV) by treatment with reducing agents such as, but not limited to, sodium dithionate, iron or zinc, or catalytic hydrogenation (see: Larock, R. C. Comprehensive Organic Transformations , VCH Publishers, New York, 1989, 411). Reaction with compounds of Formula ArLNH (XV), can be used to provide compounds of Formula (VI). Conditions which may facilitate this transformation include the optional presence of protic or aprotic acids, or bases such as alkali metal hydrides, trialkylamines, or alkali metal carbonates, or alkali metal bis(trimethylsilyl)amides wherein the metal can be sodium, lithium, or potassium. These reactions may be conducted neat, or in the optional presence of solvents such as but not limited to cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dialkylformamides, ethylene glycol, 2-ethoxyethanol, halocarbons, alkanenitriles, or alkyl alcohols at room temperature or at elevated temperature up to the boiling point of the solvent employed. One skilled in the art of organic synthesis will readily understand the optimal combinations of these conversions to prepare a number of compounds of Formula (VI). Treatment of compound of Formula (VI) with primary amines then can provide the intermediates (VII) using reaction conditions similar to those employed for the conversion of (V) to (VI). Cyclization to triazolopyrimidines of Formula (I) can then be readily accomplished by diazotization and cyclization of the diamino compounds of Formula (VII) with an alkali metal nitrite in the presence of acid in water with or without an organic cosolvent such as halocarbons, or cyclic ethers. Alternatively, compounds of Formula (I) wherein X and Y are N and Z is NR 3 , of this invention can be prepared as outlined in Scheme 2: Treatment of compound of Formula (V) with primary amines can provide the diamino substituted pyrimidines (VIII). Conditions which facilitate this transformation are detailed previously for the conversion of (VI) to (VII). Cyclization to triazolopyrimidines of Formula (VIII) can then be readily accomplished by following the conditions already described for the conversion of (VII) to (I) in Scheme 1. The leaving group such as, but not limited to, halogen can then be displaced by addition of ArLNH to provide compounds of Formula (I) by utilizing the conditions described for the conversion of (V) to (VI). Compounds of the Formula (VI) can also prepared by an another approach (Scheme 3) involving addition of ArLNH to (IV) to afford compounds of Formula (XI). The nitro group in (XI) can be reduced to give compounds of Formula (VI) under conditions similar to those described for the transformation of (IV) to (V) in Scheme 1. Alternatively, as shown in Scheme 3, addition of ArLNH to compounds of Formula (IV) can generate in-situ the pyrimidones (X). For example, treatment of dichloropyrimidines of Formula (IV) with one equivalent of ArLNH in the presence of solvents such as (but not limited to) dialkylsulfoxides, dialkylformamides, and alkyl alcohols readily generate pyrimidones (X). Compounds of Formula (X) can be converted into (XI) by the action of phosphorous oxychloride with the optional assistance of a catalyst such as dialkylanilines with or without an inert solvent. Compounds of Formula (XI) can be reduced to give (IV) under conditions described in Scheme 1. Compounds of Formula (VI) are elaborated to structures of Formula (I) as previously shown in Scheme 1. Scheme 4 outlines another route to fused triazolopyrimidine type of compounds of this invention. 4,6-dihydroxy-5-nitropyrimidines can be treated with aryl sulfonic anhydrides, aryl sulfonyl chlorides, alkyl sulfonic anhydrides or alkyl sulfonyl chlorides in the presence or absence of bases such as alkali metal hydrides, alkaline earth metal hydrides, alkali metal dialkyl amides in inert solvents such as dialkylformamides, dialkylacetamides at temperatures ranging from 0 to 200 C. to give intermediates of Formula (XII). Compounds of Formula (XII) are treated with primary amines to give aminonitropyrimidines (XIII). Treatment of (XIII) with ArLNH can provide compounds of Formula (XIV). Compounds of the formula (XIV) can be reduced to amino derivatives (VII) using the reagents described for the conversion of (IV) to (V) in Scheme 1. Intermediate (VII) can be converted to (I) (X and Y are N; Z is NR 3 ) by diazotization and cyclization as delineated in Scheme 1. Fused imidazolopyrimidines of the Formula (I) wherein X is N, Y is CR 2 , and Z is NR 3 , can be prepared from compound (VIII) as shown in Scheme 5. Treatment of (VIII) with an acylating agent such as, but not limited to, alkyl anhydrides, haloalkyl anhydrides, alkylamides, haloalkyl amides, trialkylorthoesters R 2 (OR) 3 (where R is C 1 -C 4 alkyl), iminoesters, guanidines, cyanogen bromide, R 2 COOH, urea or thiourea in the presence or absence of an acid (such as HOAc, HCl, H 2 SO 4 ) in the presence or absence of an organic cosolvent such as alkyl alcohols, cyclic ethers, or aromatic solvents at temperatures ranging from 0 to 200 C. gives compounds of Formula (XVI). Treatment of (XVI) with ArLNH can provide imidazolopyrimidine (I, wherein X is N, Y is CR 2 , Z is NR 3 ). The method of synthesis of the triazolopyridines of this invention is shown in Scheme 6. The 4-hydroxy group in (XVII) can be converted into chloro by the action of phosphorous oxychloride with the optional assistance of a catalyst such as dialkylaniline (see: Brown, D. J. et.al. J. Chem. Soc., 1954, 3832) to afford compounds of Formula (XVIII). Addition of primary amines to compound (XVIII) can provide alkylaminonitropyridines (XIX). The nitro group in (XIX) can be reduced using the conditions employed for the transformation of (IV) to (V) in Scheme 1 to give (XX). Diazotization and cyclization of (XX) can provide chlorotriazolopyridine derivatives (XXI) as was described for the conversion of (VI) to (VII) in Scheme 1. The chloro group can then be displaced by addition of ArLNH to afford compounds of Formula (I). Imidazolopyridines of the present invention can be prepared from compound (XX) as shown in Scheme 6 by following the conditions outlined for the conversion of (VIII) to (XVI) in Scheme 5. Treatment of compound (XXII) with ArLNH using the conditions outlined in Scheme 1 can provide compounds of Formula I. Alternatively, the triazolopyridines and imidazolopyridines can be synthesized as shown in Scheme 7. Treatment of compounds of Formula (XVII) with an aliphatic or aromatic amine in the appropriate organic solvent but not limited to, alkyl alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, alkyl alkanoates such as ethyl acetate, alkanenitriles such as acetonitrile, dialkyl formamides such as DMF gives the corresponding ammonium salt, which upon treatment with POCl 3 at temperatures from 25 to 120 C., give compounds of Formula (XXIII). Treatment of compounds of Formula (XXIII) with appropriate primary amines in an organic solvent such as but not limited to, alkyl alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, alkyl alkanoates such as ethyl acetate, alkanenitriles such as acetonitrile, dialkyl formamides such as DMF, dialkylsulfoxides at temperatures from 25 to 120 C. to give (XXIV). This was converted to (XIX) by treatment with POCl 3 at temperatures from 25 to 120 C. Compounds of Formula (XIX) could be coupled with ArLNH with or without the presence of solvent at temperatures from 25 to 200 C. to give product (XXV), These could be converted to intermediates (XXVI) by reduction of the nitro group under a variety of reducing conditions, such as those used for the conversion of (IV) to (V) in Scheme 1. The final cyclization was carried out as described for the conversion of (VII) to (I) in Scheme 1. Compounds of Formula (XIX) can be converted to intermediates (XX) by reduction of the nitro group under a variety of reducing conditions, such as those used for the conversion of (IV) to (V) in Scheme 1. Diazotization and cyclization of (XX) can provide chlorotriazolopyridine (XXI) as was described for the conversion of (VII) to (I) in Scheme I. The chloro group can then be displaced by addition of ArLNH in the presence of a base in an inert solvent. Bases include, but are not limited to, alkali metal alkoxides, akali metal hydrides, trialkyl amines, pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, alkali metal dialkyl amides or alkali metal bis(trimethylsilyl)amides. Inert solvents include, but are not limited to, halocarbons, alkanenitriles, dialkylformamides, dialkylacetamides, dialkyl ethers, cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, or alkyl alcohols. The addition can take place in the presence of an acid such as but not limited to HCl, H 2 SO 4 , AcOH, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid in inert solvents such as toluene, xylenes at temperatures ranging from 0 to 200 C. to afford product I. The same transformation can be affected under thermal conditions, neat, or in the presence of a high boiling solvent. Imidazolopyridines can be synthesized from intermediates of Formula (XXII) as described in Scheme 6. Compounds of general Formula (I, Q is Ib) may be prepared according to the procedures outlined in Scheme 8. Intermediates of Formula (VIII), (XX) or (XIII) may be converted to compounds of Formula (XXVII) by treatment with an acylating agent in the presence or absence of a base in an inert solvent at reaction temperatures ranging from 78 C. to 200 C. Acylating agents include, but are not limited to, phosgene, thiophosgene, diphosgene, triphosgene, carbonyl diimidazole, thiocarbonyl diimidazole, dialkylcarbonates (such as diethyl carbonate) or R a R b N(CG)OR c (where G is O, S; R a , R b , and R c are independently C 1 -C 8 alkyl). Bases include, but are not limited to, alkali metal alkoxides, akali metal hydrides, trialkyl amines, pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, alkali metal dialkyl amides or alkali metal bis(trimethylsilyl)amides. Inert solvents include, but are not limited to, halocarbons, alkanenitriles, dialkylformamides, dialkylacetamides, dialkyl ethers, cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, or alkyl alcohols. Intermediates of Formula (XXVII) may be converted to compounds of Formula (XXVIII) (Formula (I), where Q is Ib and R 13 is H) by reaction with ArLNH, using the conditions described for the conversion of compound (V) to (VI) in Scheme 1. Compounds of Formula (XXVIII) may be converted to compounds of (Formula (I), where Q is Ib) by treatment with R 13 L (where L is a leaving group such as halide, alkanesulfonate or arylsulfonate) in the presence or absence of a base in an inert solvent. Bases include, but are not limited to, alkali metal alkoxides, akali metal hydrides, trialkyl amines, pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, alkali metal dialkyl amides or alkali metal bis(trimethylsilyl)amides. Inert solvents include, but are not limited to, halocarbons, alkanenitriles, dialkylformamides, dialkylacetamides, dialkyl ethers, cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, or alkyl alcohols. Compounds of Formula (XXIX) may be prepared from compounds of structure (XXVII) by reaction with R 13 L where L is a leaving group such as halide, alkanesulfonate or arylsulfonate) in the presence or absence of a base in an inert solvent. Bases and inert solvents may be the same as those listed above for the preparation of compounds of Formula (I), (where Q is Ib) from (XXVIII). Intermediates of Formula (XXIX) can be reacted with ArLNH to give compounds of Formula (I), (where Q is Ib) using the conditions described for the conversion of compound (V) to (VI) in Scheme 1. Alternatively intermediates of Formula (VII) and (XXVI) can be converted to compounds of Formula (XXVIII) under similar conditions that may by used for the conversion of (VIII), (XX) or (XIII) to (XXVII). As shown in Scheme 9, reaction of a 4-alkylamino-3-nitro-pyridone of Formula (XXIV) with a reducing agent, such as Na 2 S 2 O 4 affords the corresponding 4-amino-3-amino-pyridone of Formula (XXX). This transformation can be effected under a variety of reducing conditions, such as catalytic hydrogenation, reducing metal reaction (Fe, Sn, Zn), hydride reaction (NaBH 4 , LiAlH 4 ) etc., which are known to those skilled in the art. The 4-amino-3-amino-pyridone can be converted to the triazolopyridone of formula (XXXI) by treatment with an alkali metal nitrite, such as NaNO 2 , under acidic conditions. The resulting triazolopyridone can be converted to the corresponding halo-triazolopyridine of Formula (XXXII)(X is Cl or Br), by treatment with a halogenating agent such as POCl 3 , PBr 3 , POBr 3 . Alternatively X can be an appropriate leaving group resulting from treatment of the triazolopyridone with triflic, tosic or mesyl anhydride in the presence of a base. The triazolopyridine can be coupled with arylamines ArLNH under acidic, basic or thermal catalysis (conditions described in Scheme 7) to compounds of Formula I. The R 5 substituents on the aryl ring can be further modified by reactions described in Scheme 10. The dibromo analog (XXXIII) of Formula (I) (where X is CH, Y is N, L is CH 2 CH 2 ) was treated with an alkyllithium such as n-butyllithium in an aprotic solvent at low temperature to affect Br/Li exchange. The aryllithium intermediate was further reacted with an electrophile to give the 7-substituted analog (XXXIV). Alternatively the 5-bromo substituent of the indoline could selectively react with various vinyltrialkyltin, vinylboronic acid reagents, or thiol salts in the presence of a palladium catalyst to give the 5-substituted analogs of Formula (XXXV). These analogs could be further reacted with an alkyllithium followe by an electrophile to give analogs of Formula (XXXVIII). Compounds of Formula (XXXIII) could be converted to the 7-methoxy analogs (XXXVI) by treatment with MeONa/MeOH in DMF under copper (I) salt catalysis. The 5-bromo substituent of these analogs could be further elaborated by the employing conditions described for the transformation of (XXXV) to (XXXVIII). In all cases the indoline ring may be dehydrogenated to the corresponding indole analogs by employing known methods described in the chemical literature. Compounds of Formula I may be synthesized as described in Scheme 11. Coupling a suitably substituted aniline having an ortho Br, I, or OSO 2 CF 3 group with a triazolopyridine of Formula (XXXII) under base, acid or thermal catalysis gives the coupled product of Formula (XXXIV). The central nitrogen of (XXXIV) was allylated by treatment with a base such as NaH in an aprotic solvent to give (XXXV). This in turn may be subjected to a palladium-catalyzed ring closure (see: Larock, R. C et. al. Tetrahedron Let., 1987, 44, 5291) to give compounds of Formula (I) (L is CHCR). Alternatively other analogs with the Formula (I) can be obtained by transformations described on Scheme 12. Reaction of compounds of Formula (XXXIV) with a suitably substituted acetylene using a suitable palladium catalyst (see: Heck, R. F. et. al. Acc. Chem. Res., 1979, 12, 146) may provide the corresponding acetylenic aryls of Formula (XXXVI). Depending on the original substitution on the acetylene, compounds of Formula (XXXVI) can be converted to the 2-alkylindole analogs (Formula I in which L is CRCH), or the indolinones (Formula I in which L is COCH 2 ). An alternative method for the introduction of various side chains is described in Scheme 13: The benzyltriazolopyridine or pyrimidine (XXXVII) may be synthesized by one of the previously described Schemes. The benzyl group is cleaved by the action of a strong acid or Lewis acid such as AlCl 3 and the resulting system of Formula (XXXVIII) is alkylated by treatment with a strong base, followed by an electrophile, or by a method described for the introduction of a functional group on a triazole by Katrinsky, A. R in Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry the Structure, Reactions Synthesis and Uses of Heterocyclic Compounds and Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry II: a review of the literature, 1982-1995: the Structure, Reactions Synthesis and Uses of Heterocyclic Compounds to give compounds of Firmula (I). Pyrazolo-, imidazolo, and indolo analogs can be synthesized in an analogous manner. Other heterocyclic linkers may be synthesized by methods described in the above references. Other ring systems of the present invention can be synthesized according to Scheme 14: The cyano compounds of Formula (XXXIX) may be condensed with hydrazine to give compounds of Formula (XL). These may be condensed with amidines, followed by a cyclization with a carbonate in the presence of a base to give compounds of Formula (XLI). Compounds of Formula (XLI) may be converted to the chlorode (XLII) and further coupled with compounds ArLNH to give compounds of Formula (XLIII) or (XLIV), depending on the structure of the starting compounds of Formula (XXXIX). Another ring system of this invention may be synthesized as shown in Scheme 15. The known pyrazines (see:Huynh-Dinh et. al. J. Org. Chem. 1979, 44, 1028) of Formula (XLV) could be converted to the fused systems of Formula (XLVI) via the action of an triethylorthoester. Compounds of Formula (XLVI) could be coupled with compounds ArLNH to give compounds of Formula (I), (where Q is IIc). Pyrazolopyrimidines (LI) of the present invention may be readily synthesized by following the reaction sequence outlined in Scheme 17 shown below. Alkylhydrazines of the type (XXXXII) were readily prepared by reacting ketone (XXXIX) with acetylhydrazide or t-butylcarbazate (XXXX) to afford hydrazone (XXXXI) which can readily be reduced using catalytic hydrogenation or by treatment with borane to give (XXXXII). XXXXII can readily be converted to XXXXIII in the presence of aq. acid (see: N. I Ghali et al J. Org. Chem. 1981, 46, 5413-14 and Boissier et al French patent M4306, 1966). Alternatively alkylhydrazines (XXXXIII) may be readily prepared from amines (XXXXIV) using hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid in the presence of base (See Gever et al. J. Org. Chem. 1949, 14, 813). Treatment of compound (XXXXIII) with ethylidine malononitrile (XXXXV) in alcohol medium in the presence or absence of base such as alkylamines to afford pyrazole derivative (XXXXVI). The nitrile group in the pyrazole derivative can readily be hydrolyzed using acids such as sulfuric acid, to give pyrazole carboxamide derivative (XXXXVII). Alternatively pyrazole carboxamides (XXXXVII) can be prepared by reacting (XXXXIII) with (XXXXVIII) in solvents such as alcohol in the presence of a base. Pyrazolopyrimidones of the formula (XXXXIX) can be obtained by treatment with esters in the presence of a base such as alkali metal alkoxides in refluxing alcohol (for example, see: Miyashita et al, Heterocycles, 1996, 42(2), 691). The hydroxy group of pyrazolopyrimidones (XXXXIX) can be converted to a leaving group Y (eg. tosylate, mesylate, triflate, or halogen) using classical organic group transformations to afford formula (L). Formula (L) can readily be converted to compounds of the present invention (LI) upon treatment with ArLNH either as a neat reaction mixture at elevated temperatures or in the presence of a base in solvents such as THF, alkyl ethers or dialkylformamides. Other ring systems can be synthesized by methods described in EP 0 778277 A1, WO 9413677 and WO 9413696. The following examples are provided to describe the invention in further detail.

Utility CRF-R1 Receptor Binding Assay for the Evaluation of Biological Activity The following is a description of the isolation of cell membranes containing cloned human CRF-R1 receptors for use in the standard binding assay as well as a description of the assay itself. Messenger RNA was isolated from human hippocampus. The mRNA was reverse transcribed using oligo (dt) 12-18 and the coding region was amplified by PCR from start to stop codons The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into the EcoRV site of pGEMV, from whence the insert was reclaimed using XhoIXbaI and cloned into the XhoIXbaI sites of vector pm3ar (which contains a CMV promoter, the SV40 t splice and early poly A signals, an Epstein-Barr viral origin of replication, and a hygromycin selectable marker). The resulting expression vector, called phchCRFR was transfected in 293EBNA cells and cells retaining the episome were selected in the presence of 400 M hygromycin. Cells surviving 4 weeks of selection in hygromycin were pooled, adapted to growth in suspension and used to generate membranes for the binding assay described below. Individual aliquots containing approximately 110 8 of the suspended cells were then centrifuged to form a pellet and frozen. For the binding assay a frozen pellet described above containing 293EBNA cells transfected with hCRFRl receptors is homogenized in 10 ml of ice cold tissue buffer (50 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.0, containing 10 EN MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA, 1 g/l aprotinin, 1 g/ml leupeptin and 1 g/ml pepstatin). The homogenate is centrifuged at 40,000g for 12 min and the resulting pellet rehomogenized in 10 ml of tissue buffer. After another centrifugation at 40,000g for 12 min, the pellet is resuspended to a protein concentration of 360 g/ml to be used in the assay. Binding assays are performed in 96 well plates; each well having a 300 l capacity. To each well is added 50 l of test drug dilutions (final concentration of drugs range from 10 10 -10 5 M), 100 l of 125I -ovine-CRF ( 125 I-o-CRF) (final concentration 150 M) and 150 l of the cell homogenate described above. Plates are then allowed to incubate at room temperature for 2 hours before filtering the incubate over GF/F filters (presoaked with 0.3% polyethyleneimine) using an appropriate cell harvester. Filters are rinsed 2 times with ice cold assay buffer before removing individual filters and assessing them for radioactivity on a gamma counter. Curves of the inhibition of 125 I-o-CRF binding to cell membranes at various dilutions of test drug are analyzed by the iterative curve fitting program LIGAND P. J. Munson and D. Rodbard, Anal. Biochem. 107:220 (1980), which provides Ki values for inhibition which are then used to assess biological activity. A compound is considered to be active if it has a Ki value of less than about 10000 nM for the inhibition of CRF. Inhibition of CRF-Stimulated Adenylate Cyclase Activity Inhibition of CRF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity can be performed as described by G. Battaglia et al. Synapse 1:572 (1987). Briefly, assays are carried out at 37 C. for 10 min in 200 ml of buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4 at 37 C.), 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.4 mM EGTA, 0.1% BSA, 1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), 250 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase, 5 mM creatine phosphate, 100 mM guanosine 5-triphosphate, 100 mM oCRF, antagonist peptides (concentration range 10 9 to 10 6 m) and 0.8 mg original wet weight tissue (approximately 40-60 mg protein). Reactions are initiated by the addition of 1 mM ATP/ 32 PATP (approximately 2-4 mCi/tube) and terminated by the addition of 100 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCL, 45 mM ATP and 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. In order to monitor the recovery of cAMP, 1 l of 3 HcAMP (approximately 40,000 dpm) is added to each tube prior to separation. The separation of 32 PcAMP from 32 PATP is performed by sequential elution over Dowex and alumina columns. In Vivo Biological Assay The in vivo activity of the compounds of the present invention can be assessed using any one of the biological assays available and accepted within the art. Illustrative of these tests include the Acoustic Startle Assay, the Stair Climbing Test, and the Chronic Administration Assay. These and other models useful for the testing of compounds of the present invention have been outlined in C. W. Berridge and A. J. Dunn Brain Research Reviews 15:71 (1990). Compounds may be tested in any species of rodent or small mammal. Compounds of this invention have utility in the treatment of inbalances associated with abnormal levels of corticotropin releasing factor in patients suffering from depression, affective disorders, and/or anxiety. Compounds of this invention can be administered to treat these abnormalities by means that produce contact of the active agent with the agents site of action in the body of a mammal. The compounds can be administered by any conventional means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals either as individual therapeutic agent or in combination of therapeutic agents. They can be administered alone, but will generally be administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The dosage administered will vary depending on the use and known factors such as pharmacodynamic character of the particular agent, and its mode and route of administration; the recipients age, weight, and health; nature and extent of symptoms; kind of concurrent treatment; frequency of treatment; and desired effect. For use in the treatment of said diseases or conditions, the compounds of this invention can be orally administered daily at a dosage of the active ingredient of 0.002 to 200 mg/kg of body weight. Ordinarily, a dose of 0.01 to 10 mg/kg in divided doses one to four times a day, or in sustained release formulation will be effective in obtaining the desired pharmacological effect. Dosage forms (compositions) suitable for administration contain from about 1 mg to about 100 mg of active ingredient per unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions, the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.5 to 95% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. The active ingredient can be administered orally is solid dosage forms, such as capsules, tablets and powders; or in liquid forms such as elixirs, syrups, and/or suspensions. The compounds of this invention can also be administered parenterally in sterile liquid dose formulations. Gelatin capsules can be used to contain the active ingredient and a suitable carrier such as but not limited to lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, steric acid, or cellulose derivatives. Similar diluents can be used to make compressed tablets. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of time. Compressed tablets can be sugar-coated or film-coated to mask any unpleasant taste, or used to protect the active ingredients from the atmosphere, or to allow selective disintegration of the tablet in the gastrointestinal tract. Liquid dose forms for oral administration can contain coloring or flavoring agents to increase patient acceptance. In general, water, pharmaceutically acceptable oils, saline, aqueous dextrose (glucose), and related sugar solutions and glycols, such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions. Solutions for parenteral administration preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing agents, and if necessary, butter substances. Antioxidizing agents, such as sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid, either alone or in combination, are suitable stabilizing agents. Also used are citric acid and its salts, and EDTA. In addition, parenteral solutions can contain preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride, methyl- or propyl-paraben, and chlorobutanol. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, A. Osol, a standard reference in the field. Useful pharmaceutical dosage-forms for administration of the compounds of this invention can be illustrated as follows: Capsules A large number of units capsules are prepared by filling standard two-piece hard gelatin capsules each with 100 mg of powdered active ingredient, 150 mg lactose, 50 mg cellulose, and 6 mg magnesium stearate. Soft Gelatin Capsules A mixture of active ingredient in a digestible oil such as soybean, cottonseed oil, or olive oil is prepared and injected by means of a positive displacement was pumped into gelatin to form soft gelatin capsules containing 100 mg of the active ingredient. The capsules were washed and dried. Tablets A large number of tablets are prepared by conventional procedures so that the dosage unit was 100 mg active ingredient, 0.2 mg of colloidal silicon dioxide, 5 mg of magnesium stearate, 275 mg of microcrystalline cellulose, 11 mg of starch, and 98.8 mg lactose. Appropriate coatings may be applied to increase palatability or delayed adsorption. The compounds of this invention may also be used as reagents or standards in the biochemical study of neurological function, dysfunction, and disease.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to certain pyrimidinones, their N-oxides, agriculturally suitable salts and compositions, and methods of their use as fungicides. The control of plant diseases caused by fungal plant pathogens is extremely important in achieving high crop efficiency. Plant disease damage to ornamental, vegetable, field, cereal, and fruit crops can cause significant reduction in productivity and thereby result in increased costs to the consumer. Many products are commercially available for these purposes, but the need continues for new compounds which are more effective, less costly, less toxic, environmentally safer or have different modes of action.

The total number of carbon atoms in a substituent group is indicated by the C i -C j prefix where i and j are numbers from 1 to 10. For example, C 1 -C 3 alkylsulfonyl designates methylsulfonyl through propylsulfonyl; C 2 alkoxyalkyl designates CH 3 OCH 2 ; C 3 alkoxyalkyl designates, for example, CH 3 CH(OCH 3 ), CH 3 OCH 2 CH 2 or CH 3 CH 2 OCH 2 ; and C 4 alkoxyalkyl designates the various isomers of an alkyl group substituted with an alkoxy group containing a total of four carbon atoms, examples including CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 OCH 2 and CH 3 CH 2 OCH 2 CH 2 . In the above recitations, when a compound of Formula I is comprised of one or more heterocyclic rings, all substituents are attached to these rings through any available carbon or nitrogen by replacement of a hydrogen on said carbon or nitrogen. Exemplary values of a 8-, 9- or 10-membered fused carbobicyclic or fused heterobicyclic ring, and a 3-, 4-, 5- or 6-membered heteromonocyclic ring wherein said heterobicyclic or heteromonocyclic rings contain 1 to 4 heteroatoms independently selected from the group nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, provided that each heterobicyclic or heteromonocyclic ring contains no more than 4 nitrogens, no more than 2 oxygens and no more than 2 sulfurs, include the ring systems illustrated in Exhibit 1. As with the carbon atoms in the ring, the nitrogen atoms which require substitution to fill their valence are substituted with hydrogen or with R 8 , R 9 or R 10 . In the bicyclic ring systems (e.g., Y-66-Y-90), the R 8 , R 9 and R 10 groups may substitute either ring. Although the R 8 , R 9 and/or R 10 groups are shown in the structures Y-1 to Y-100, it is noted that they do not need to be present since they are optional substituents. Exhibit 1 When a group contains a substituent which can be hydrogen, for example R 3 or R 7 , then, when this substituent is taken as hydrogen, it is recognized that this is equivalent to said group being unsubstituted. Compounds of this invention can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers.

The compounds of Formula I can be prepared by one or more of the following methods and variations as described in Schemes 1-17. The definitions of W, n, Q, G, R 1 -R 13 in the compounds of Formulae 1-6 below are as defined above in the Summary of the Invention. Compounds of Formulae Ia-It are various subsets of the compounds of Formula I, and all substituents for Formulae Ia-It are as defined above for Formula I. The synthesis of compounds of Formula I is described below. First, the synthesis of the pyrimidinone ring system is described. In this first section, when R 1 and/or R 2 are R 11 , the R 11 substituent is incorporated into the substrates which are used in the syntheses described therein. Alternatively, the pyrimidinone ring system can be prepared using a precursor to the R 11 group, and then the R 11 group can be introduced afterwards. Syntheses of various R 11 groups are described in the second section which describes this alternate strategy. Synthesis of the Pyrimidinone Ring System Compounds of Formula Ib, compounds of Formula I wherein W and Q are each O, can be made by the method illustrated in Scheme 1. A 2-aminoaryl caboxylic acid of Formula 1 is condensed with an isothiocyanate of Formula R 1 NCS to form the 2-thiopyrinidinone of Formula 2. The condensation is preferably performed in the presence of a base such as triethylamine. S-Methylation of this compound affords the 2-methylthio-pyrimidinone of Formula Ia. For the introduction of the R 2 O group, the 2-methylthio bicyclic pyrimidinone of Formula Ia is treated with a mixture of a base, for example sodium hydride, in R 2 OH solvent. The reaction mixture is stirred at a temperature from about 0 C. to 120 C. for 1 to 120 hours. The desired 2-R 2 O bicyclic pyrimidinone can be isolated from the reaction mixture by extraction into a water-immiscible solvent, and purified by chromatography or recrystallization. Synthetic procedures for the preparation of related 4(3H)-quinazolinones are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,755,582 and incorporated herein by reference. 2-Aminocarboxylic acids of Formula 1 are commercially available or can be prepared by known methods. For example, see J. Heterocycl. Chem., (1966), 3, 252; J. Org. Chem., (1952), 17, 547; J. Org. Chem., (1949), 14, 97; Synth. Commun., (1979), 9, 731. The isothiocyanates of Formula R 1 NCS can be prepared from the corresponding amine by treatment with thiophosgene as known in the art. For example, see J. Heterocycl. Chem., (1990), 27, 407. Alternatively, 2-thiopyrimidinediones of Formula 2 can be prepared by treatment of the (C 1 -C 4 alkyl) carboxylic acid ester of Formula 3 with thiophosgene to form the isothiocyanate ester, followed by treatment with an amine of formula R 1 NH 2 (Scheme 2). The ester of Formula 3 is treated with thiophosgene at a temperature from about 20 to 100 C. for 1 to 48 hours optionally in an inert solvent. Often this reaction is performed in a biphasic mixture in the presence of a base, such as calcium carbonate, and an acid, such as aqueous hydrochloric acid. The resulting isothiocyanate may be isolated by extraction into a water-immiscible solvent, such as methylene chloride, followed by drying of the organic extracts and evaporation under reduced pressure. Alternatively, the isothiocyanate can be combined in situ with the amine of Formula H 2 NR 1 and stirred at about 20 to 50 C. for 0.1 to 24 hours. The desired 2-thiopyrimidinedione of Formula 2 can be isolated from the reaction mixture by aqueous extraction, and purified by chromatography or recrystallization. Similar synthetic procedures are described in J. Heterocycl. Chem., (1990), 27, 407. Pyrimidinones of Formula Ic, compounds of Formula I wherein W is S and Q is O, can be prepared by a modification of the synthesis illustrated in Scheme 1. As illustrated in Scheme 3, the 2-thiopyrimidinedione of Formula 2 is alkylated with R 2 X wherein X is a typical leaving group such as Br, I, CH 3 SO 3 (OMs), or (4CH 3 Ph)SO 3 (OTs) to afford the 2R 2 S fused pyrimidinone of Formula Ic. One or more equivalents of a base can be used to accelerate the process. Bases such as sodium hydroxide and sodium hydride arm suitable. Typically, the 2-thiopyrimidinedione is dissolved or dispersed in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide and treated with a base at a temperature from about 20 to 60 C. The reaction mixture may then be heated to just above ambient temperature to the reflux temperature of the solvent for 0.1 to 24 hours to effect deprotonation. The reaction mixture is cooled and treated with R 2 X and stirred for 0.1-24 hours at a temperature from about 20 C. to the reflux temperature of the solvent. The pyrmidinone of Formula Ic can be isolated by extraction into a water-immiscible solvent, and purified by chromatography or recrystallization. 2-Thiopyrimidinediones of Formula 2 are prepared as described above in Schemes 1 and 2. Fused bicyclic pyrimidinones of Formula Id, compounds of Formula I wherein Q is O and W is S(O) or S(O) 2 , can be prepared by oxidation of the corresponding SR 2 compound of Formula Ic using well-known procedures for oxidation of sulfur (Scheme 4). For example, see March, J. Advanced Organic Chemistry; 3rd ed., John Wiley: New York, (1985), p 1089. Fused bicyclic pyrimidinones of Formula Ie, compounds of Formula I wherein Q is O and W is NR 5 , can be prepared by the method illustrated in Scheme 5. This method is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 3,867,384 and incorporated herein by reference. One method of preparation of compounds of Formula Ie is by treatment of a 2-methylthio pyrimidinone of Formula 4 (ZSMe) with an excess of an amine of Formula HNR 5 R 2 at about 150 to 175 C. A second method is to contact a 2-chloro-pyrimidinone of Formula 4 (ZCl) with one equivalent of HNR 5 R 2 and one equivalent of an acid scavenger, for example triethylamine, or with two equivalents of HNR 5 R 2 , at a temperature between 60 and 120 C. optionally in the presence of a solvent. The preparation of compounds of pyrimidinones wherein Z is SMe is described above and in U.S. Pat. No. 3,755,582. The synthesis of pyrimidinones of Formula 4 wherein Z is Cl is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,867,384. Amines of Formula HNR 5 R 2 are commercially available or can be prepared by well-known methods (March, J. Advanced Organic Chemistry; 3rd ed., John Wiley: New York, (1985), p 1153). In addition to the methods described above, compounds of Formula Ib and Ic can be prepared by displacement of the 2-chlorine in the appropriate fused pyrimidinone, rather than by displacement of the 2-SCH 3 group (Scheme 1) or S-alkylation of the thiocarbonyl (Scheme 3). In addition to the method described above, pyrimidinones of Formulae Ig and Ih, compounds of Formula I wherein R 5 C(O)R 12 , can be prepared by acylation of the corresponding R 5 H compound of Formula If as illustrated in Scheme 6. The pyrimidinones of Formula If are treated with an acylating agent of Formula R 12 C(O)L wherein L is an appropriate leaving group such as chlorine or OC(O)(H or C 1 -C 4 alkyl). In a similar fashion, compounds of Formula I wherein R 5 is C(O)NHR 7 (Formula Ih) can be prepared by condensing pyrimidinones of Formula If with isocyanates of Formula R 7 NCO using well known procedures. Compounds of Formula Ij, compounds of Formula I wherein Q is S, can be prepared as illustrated in Scheme 7. Treatment of the fused pyrimidinone of Formula Ii with phosphorous pentasulfide or Lawessons reagent 2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-dithia-2,4-diphosphetane-2,4-disulfide in an inert solvent such as dioxane at a temperature from 0 C. to the reflux temperature of the solvent for 0.1 to 72 hours affords the pyrimidinethione of Formula Ij. This procedure is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,755,582 and incorporated herein by reference. For some compounds of Formula I, the R 3 and/or R 4 substituent is more conveniently introduced after cyclization to form the fused pyrimidinone. For example, the fused bromo-thiophene compound of Example 1 below was prepared by first synthesizing the fused pyrimidinone ring system, and then introducing the bromine substituent onto the thiophene ring. Other R 3 and R 4 substituents can be introduced onto the G ring in a similar fashion, or by displacement of a leaving group. For example, displacement of the bromine on the thiophene ring with the appropriate nucleophile can afford the corresponding R 3 alkoxy, alkylthio, or NR 6 R 7 compound. Salts of compounds of Formula I can be formed by treating the free base of the corresponding compound with strong acids such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid. Salts can also be prepared by alkylation of a tertiary amine group in the molecule to form, for example, the trialkylammonium salt. N-Oxides of compounds of Formula I can be made by oxidizing the corresponding reduced nitrogen compound with a strong oxidizing agent such as meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Synthesis of R 11 Groups As indicated above, compounds of Formula I can be prepared by incorporation of the R 11 group after the synthesis of the pyrimidinone ring system. A method for preparing the desired R 11 group is to form the carbocycle or heterocycle from the pyrimidinone wherein R 1 alkenyl or alkynyl, or R 2 alkenyl or alkynyl. Methods for preparing carbocycles or heterocycles from alkenes and alkynes are well-known in the literature. The method of incorporating R 11 into the corresponding alkenyl compound is generically illustrated in Scheme 8. The first reaction illustrates the method for preparing R 1 R 11 compounds from the corresponding R 1 alkenyl compound. The second reaction illustrates how the same methodology can be used to prepare the R 2 R 11 compounds. The descriptions below refer to the preparation of the R 1 R 11 compounds, although one skilled in the art recognizes that the same procedures can be used to prepare the R 2 R 11 materials as well. The starting R 1 or R 2 alkenes are prepared by the methods described above and illustrated in Schemes 1-7. 3-Membered Ring Heterocycles Compounds of Formula Ik, compounds of Formula I wherein R 1 is R 11 and R 11 comprises an epoxide, can be prepared as illustrated in Scheme 9. Treatment of the alkene of Formula 4 with an oxidizing agent such as m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA) in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride affords the epoxide of Formula Ik as described by Schwartz, N., in J. Org. Chem., (1964), 29, 1976. Similarly, the aziridines of Formula Il can be prepared from the alkenes of Formula 4 by condensation with a nitrene as illustrated in Scheme 10 and described in Abramovitch, R. J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., (1972), 1160. The NH aziridine compound of Formula Im can be prepared from the corresponding epoxide by contact with sodium azide and triphenylphosphine as illustrated below in Scheme 11 and described by Ittah, Y. in J. Org. Chem., (1978), 43, 4271. The episulfide of Formula In can also be prepared from the epoxide using triphenylphosphine sulfide using techniques taught by Chan, T. in J. Am. Chem. Soc., (1972), 94, 2880. In addition to the methods described above, methods for accessing compounds of Formulae Ik-In are taught in Calo, V., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., (1975), 621; Fujisawa, T., Chem. Lett., (1972), 935; and March, J. Advanced Organic Chemistry; 3rd ed., John Wiley: New York, (1985), p 741. 4-Membered Ring Heterocycles The synthesis of oxetanes of Formula Io may be achieved by ring expansion of the corresponding epoxide using dimethyloxosulfonium methylide as illustrated in Scheme 12 and described by J. Okuma in J. Org. Chem., (1983), 48, 5133. In some cases, a mixture of regioisomers will be obtained. Additional methods for preparing oxetanes, as well as other 4-membered ring heterocycles, from an alkene precursor are well-known in the art. For example, see: Buchi, G., J. Am. Chem. Soc., (1954), 76, 4327; and Pifferi, G., J. Heterocyclic Chem., (1967), 4, 619. 5-Membered Ring Heterocycles Compounds of Formula I wherein R 11 comprises a 5-membered ring heterocycle can be obtained in a variety of ways. For example, dioxolane compounds can be prepared from the glycol using known methods. A method exemplifying the preparation of the dimethyl-dioxolane is illustrated in Scheme 13 and described by A. Hampton in J. Am. Chem. Soc., (1961), 83, 3640. Reaction of the glycol of Formula 5 with p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) and 2,2-dimethoxypropane provides the desired material. The glycol of Formula 5 can be prepared from the alkene of Formula 4 using vicinal bis-hydroxylation reagents such as osmium tetroxide (see Wade, P., Tetrahedron Lett., (1989), 5969). Some 5-membered ring compounds can be prepared from the alkene of Formula 4 using a 1,3-dipole cyclization. For example, reaction of 4 with bromonitrile oxide produces the dihydroisoxazole of Formula Iq as illustrated in Scheme 14 (see Wade, P., in J. Org. Chem., (1990), 55, 3045). Cycloaddition of 1,3-dipoles with alkynes are also well-documented in the literature. For example, C. Kashima in Heterocycles, (1979), 12, 1343 teaches the condensation of an alkyne with benzene nitrile oxide to form the isoxazole. A similar process to prepare the isoxazole of Formula Ir is illustrated in Scheme 15. Many 1,3-dipoles are known to react with alkenes and alkynes of Formulae 4 and 6, respectively, in cycloaddition reactions. Dipoles and methods for generating them are described in 1,3- Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions , A. Padwa, Ed., Wiley Interscience, NY 1984, Vols. 1 and 2; and Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry , Katritzky, A., Ed., Pergamon, N.Y., 1984, Vol. 5, p 143). Examples of known 1,3 dipoles are nitrile ylides, nitrile imines, nitrile sulfides, diazoalkanes, azides, azomethine ylides and nitrones. One skilled in the art will recognize that the regiochemical outcome of the 1,3-dipolar addition will depend on the structures of both the 1,3-dipole and the dipolarophile. In many instances, a mixture of regioisomers will be obtained which can be separated by chromatography or recrystallization. 6-Membered Ring Heterocycles Compounds of Formula I wherein R 11 comprises a 6-membered ring heterocycle can be prepared from the alkene of Formula 4 by 42 cycloaddition with a suitable heterodiene. For example, conditions similar to those described by Krespan, C., in J. Am. Chem. Soc., (1960), 82, 1515, can be employed to form dithianes of Formula Is as illustrated in Scheme 16. As with the aforementioned 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions, alkynes can also engage in reactions with heterodiene systems to afford unsaturated ring compounds such as those of Formula It. Ample literature exists citing various other heterodiene systems which are known to engage alkenes and alkynes of Formulae 4 and 6, respectively, to deliver 6-membered ring heterocyclic adducts. For example, see Hetero Diels - Alder Methodology in Organic Synthesis , Boger, D. and Weinreb, S., Eds., Academic, NY, (1987), pp 167-357; and Contemporary Heterocyclic Chemistry , Newkome, G. and Paudler, W., Wiley Interscience, NY, (1982), p 129. Examples of heterodienes known to undergo cycloaddition reactions are thiophene, furan, ,-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, ,-unsaturated thiocarbonyl compounds, ,-unsaturated imines, vinyl nitroso species, azoalkenes, acyldiimides, acyl sulfenes, o-quinones, and thioamide-N-methylium salts. Again, as in the previously mentioned case of 1,3-dipole cycloadditions, the regiochemical course of the 42 condensation depends on the structure of the alkene or alkyne and the heterodiene. Both regioisomers are often obtained in which case the desired regioisomer can be isolated by chromatography or recrystallization. It is recognized that some reagents and reaction conditions described above for preparing compounds of Formula I may not be compatible with certain functionalities present in the intermediates. In these instances, the incorporation of protection/deprotection sequences or functional group interconversions into the synthesis will aid in obtaining the desired products. The use and choice of the protecting groups will be apparent to one skilled in chemical synthesis (see, for example, Greene, T. W.; Wuts, P. G. M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed.; Wiley: New York, 1991). One skilled in the art will recognize that, in some cases, after the introduction of a given reagent as it is depicted in any individual scheme, it may be necessary to perform additional routine synthetic steps not described in detail to complete the synthesis of compounds of Formula I. One skilled in the art will also recognize that it may be necessary to perform a combination of the steps illustrated in the above schemes in an order other than that implied by the particular sequence presented to prepare the compounds of Formula I. One skilled in the art will also recognize that compounds of Formula I and the intermediates described herein can be subjected to various electrophilic, nucleophilic, radical, organometallic, oxidation, and reduction reactions to add substituents or modify existing substituents. Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art using the preceding description can utilize the present invention to its fullest extent.

formulation or composition with an agriculturally suitable carrier comprising at least one of a liquid diluent, a solid diluent or a surfactant. The formulation or composition ingredients are selected to be consistent with the physical properties of the active ingredient, mode of application and environmental factors such as soil type, moisture and temperature. Useful formulations include liquids such as solutions (including emulsifiable concentrates), suspensions, emulsions (including microemulsions and/or suspoemulsions) and the like which optionally can be thickened into gels. Useful formulations further include solids such as dusts, powders, granules, pellets, tablets, films, and the like which can be water-dispersible (wettable) or water-soluble. Active ingredient can be (micro)encapsulated and further formed into a suspension or solid formulation; alternatively the entire formulation of active ingredient can be encapsulated (or overcoated). Encapsulation can control or delay release of the active ingredient. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes from about one to several hundred liters per hectare. High-strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations will typically contain effective amounts of active ingredient, diluent and surfactant within the following approximate ranges which add up to 100 percent by weight.

Plant disease control is ordinarily accomplished by applying an effective amount of a compound of this invention either pre- or post-infection, to the portion of the plant to be protected such as the roots, stems, foliage, fruit, seeds, tubers or bulbs, or to the media (soil or sand) in which the plants to be protected are growing. The compounds can also be applied to the seed to protect the seed and seedling. Rates of application for these compounds can be influenced by many factors of the environment and should be determined under actual use conditions. Foliage can normally be protected when treated at a rate of from less than 1 g/ha to 5,000 g/ha of active ingredient. Seed and seedlings can normally be protected when seed is treated at a rate of from 0.1 to 10 g per kilogram of seed. The following TESTS demonstrate the control efficacy of compounds of this invention on specific pathogens. The pathogen control protection afforded by the compounds is not limited, however, to these species. See Index Tables A-B for compound descriptions.

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION Test compounds were first dissolved in acetone in an amount equal to 3% of the final volume and then suspended at a concentration of 200 ppm in purified water containing 250 ppm of the surfactant Trem 014 (polyhydric alcohol esters). The resulting test suspensions were then used in the following tests. Spraying these 200 ppm test suspensions to the point of run-off on the test plants is the equivalent of a rate of 500 g/ha. TEST A The test suspension was sprayed to the point of run-off on wheat seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore dust of Erysiphe graminis f . sp. tritici , (the causal agent of wheat powdery mildew) and incubated in a growth chamber at 20 C. for 7 days, after which disease ratings were made. TEST B The test suspension was sprayed to the point of run-off on wheat seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore suspension of Puccinia recondita (the causal agent of wheat leaf rust) and incubated in a saturated atmosphere at 20 C. for 24 h, and then moved to a growth chamber at 20 C. for 6 days, after which disease ratings were made. TEST C The test suspension was sprayed to the point of run-off on tomato seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore suspension of Phytophthora infestans (the causal agent of potato and tomato late blight) and incubated in a saturated atmosphere at 20 C. for 24 h, and then moved to a growth chamber at 20 C. for 5 days, after which disease ratings were made. TEST D The test suspension was sprayed to the point of run-off on grape seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore suspension of Plasmopara viticola (the causal agent of grape downy mildew) and incubated in a saturated atmosphere at 20 C. for 24 h, moved to a growth chamber at 20 C. for 6 days, and then incubated in a saturated atmosphere at 20 C. for 24 h, after which disease ratings were made. TEST E The test suspension was sprayed to the point of run-off on cucumber seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore suspension of Botrytis cinerea (the causal agent of gray mold on many crops) and incubated in a saturated atmosphere at 20 C. for 48 h, and moved to a growth chamber at 20 C. for 5 days, after which disease ratings were made. TEST F The test suspension was sprayed to the point of run-off on cucumber seedlings. The following day the seedlings were inoculated with a spore suspension of Erysiphe cichoracearum (the causal agent of cucumber powdery mildew) and moved to a greenhouse for 7 days. Disease ratings were made 7 days following application of the test compounds. Results for Tests A-F are given in Table A. In the table, a rating of 100 indicates 100% disease control and a rating of 0 indicates no disease control (relative to the controls). A dash (-) indicates no test results.

No. 08/192,333, filed Feb. 4, 1994 (now U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,165). The present application relates to new active compound combinations composed of, on the one hand, valinamide derivatives and, on the other hand, of other, known fungicidal active compounds, and which are highly suitable for combating phytopathogenic fungi. It is already known that valinamide derivatives has fungicidal properties (cf. EP-A 472,996). The activity of this substance is good; however, it leaves something to be desired in some cases when low application rates are used. Furthermore, it is already known that a large number of azole derivatives, aromatic carboxylic acid derivatives, morpholine compounds and other heterocycles can be employed for combating fungi (cf. K. H. Bchel Pflanzenschutz und Schdlingsbekmpfung Crop Protection and Pest Control pages 87, 136, 140, 141 and 146 to 153, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1977). However, the activity of the substances in question is not always satisfactory when low application rates are used. It has now been found that the new active compound combinations of valinamide derivatives of the general formula (I) in which R 1 represents i-propyl or s-butyl and R 2 represents chlorine, methyl, ethyl or methoxy, and (A) dichlofluanid, of the formula and/or (B) tolyifluanid, of the formula and/or (C) tetrachloro-isophthalo-nitrile of the formula and/or (D) propineb, of the formula and/or (E) tetramethyl-thiuram-disulphide, of the formula and/or (F) mancozeb, of the formula and/or (G) dyrene, of the formula and/or (H) copper oxychloride and/or (I) captan of the formula and/or (K) a morpholine derivative of the formula and/or (L) dithianon, of the formula and/or (M) Phaltan, of the formula and/or (N) cymoxanil, of the formula and/or (O) propamocarb, of the formula (CH 3 ) 2 NCH 2 CH 2 CH 2 NHCOOCH 2 CH 3 (XIII) or its hydrochloride and/or (P) fosetyl, of the formula or the aluminium adduct thereof and/or (Q) metalaxyl, of the formula and/or (R) oxadixyl, of the formula and/or (S) fluazinam, of the formula and/or (T) methoxyacrylates, such as methyl (E)-2-2-6-(2-cyanophenoxy)pyrimidin-4-yloxy-phenyl-3-methoxyacrylate, of the formula and/or (U) methoximinoacetates, such as methyl (E)-methoximino-(o-tolyloxy)-o-tolylacetate of the formula and/or (V) furalaxyl methyl-N- (2-furoyl) -N- (2,6-xylyl) -alanit and/or (W) azoles of the formula I XCl, Y(CH(OH)(Triadimenol) III XCl, YCO(triadimefon) IV tebuconazole of the formula and/or (X) etridiazole3-trichlormethyl-5-ethoxy-1,2,4-thiadiazole and/or (Y) pencycuron1-(4-chlorbenzyl)-1-cyclopentyl-(3-phenylurea have very good fungicidal properties. Surprisingly, the fungicidal activity of the active compound combinations according to the invention is substantially greater than the total of the activities of the individual active compounds. This means that a true synergistic effect, which could not have been predicted, is present, not merely a complemented activity. It can be seen from the structural formula of the active compounds of the formula (I) that the compounds have two asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms. The product can therefore exist in the form of mixture of various isomers or else in the form of a single isomer. Preferred compounds of the formula (I) are compounds in which the amino acid moiety is formed by ipropyloxycarbonyl-L-valine or sec-butoxycarbonyl-L-valine and the phenethylamine moiety is either racemic or has the S() configuration, but in particular the R() configuration Particularly preferred compounds of the formula (I) are the compounds in which R 1 represents i-propyl. Particular mention may be made of the compounds 1-methylethyl 2-methyl-1--1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl-aminocarbonyl-carbamate, of the formula (II) 1-Methylethyl 2-methyl-1-1-(4-methylphenyl)ethyl-aminocarbonyl-propyl-carbamate, of the formula (III) 1-Methylethyl 2-methyl-1--1-(4-ethylphenyl)ethyl-aminocarbonyl-propyl-carbamate, of the formula (IV) and 1-methylethyl 2-methyl-1--1- (4-methoxyphenyl)ethylaminocarbonyl-propyl-carbamate, of the formula and their isomers, as mentioned above. The active compounds of the formula (I) are known (cf. EP-A 472,996). The fungicidal active compounds which are additionally present in the combinations according to the invention are also known. The individual active compounds are described in the following publications: (A): K. H.

Besides at least one active compound of the formula (I), the active compound combinations according to the invention comprise at least one active compound from amongst the compounds of groups (A) to (U). In addition, they can also comprise other fungicidally active components which can be admixed. The synergistic effect is particularly obvious when the active compounds are present in the active compound combinations according to the invention in certain ratios by weight. However, the ratios by weight of the active compounds in the active compound combinations can be varied within a relatively wide range. In general, the following amounts are employed per part by weight of active compound of the formula (I): 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 2.5 to 10 parts by weight of active compound from Group (A), 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 2.5 to 10 parts by weight of active compound from Group (B), 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 10 parts by weight of active compound from Group (C), 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 5 to 20 parts by weight of active compound from Group (D), 1 to 200 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 100 parts by weight of active compound from Group (E), 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 5 to 20 parts by weight of active compound from Group (F), 1 to 200 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 100 parts by weight of active compound from Group (G), 1 to 200 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 50 parts by weight of active compound from Group (H), 1 to 100 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 50 parts by weight of active compound from Group (I), 0.5 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 5 parts by weight of active compound from Group (K), 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 20 parts by weight of active compound from Group (L), 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 20 parts by weight of active compound from Group (M), 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 10 parts by weight of active compound from Group (N), 1 to 100 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 50 parts by weight of active compound from Group (O), 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 20 parts by weight of active compound from Group (P), 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 10 parts by weight of active compound from Group (Q), 5 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 10 parts by weight of active compound from Group (R), 1 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 10 parts by weight of active compound from Group (S), 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 10 parts by weight of active compound from Group (T) 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, preferably is 1 to 10 parts by weight of active compound from Group (U). 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 10 parts by weight of active compound from group (V) 20 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 0.5 to 10 parts by weight of active compound from group (W) 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 0.5 to 10 parts by weight of active compound from group (X), 0.5 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 0.5 to 10 parts by weight of active compound from group (Y) The active compound combinations according to the invention have very good fungicidal properties and can be employed for combating phytopathogenic fungi, such as, inter alia, Plasmodiophoromycetes, Oomycetes, Chyridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes. The active compound combinations according to the invention are particularly suitable for protectively combating Phytophthora infestans and Alternaria spec. on tomatoes and potatoes, as well as Plasmopara viticola on vines. The good toleration, by plants, of the active compound combinations at the concentrations required for combating plant diseases permits a treatment of above-ground parts of plants, of vegetative propagation stock and seed, and of the soil. The active compound combinations according to the invention can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, pastes, granules, aerosols, very fine capsules in polymeric substances and in coating compositions for seed, as well as ULV formulations. These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds, or active compound combinations with extenders, that is, liquid solvents, liquefied gases under pressure, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surface-active agents, that is, emulsifying agents and/or dispersing agents and/or foam-forming agents. In the case of the use of water as an extender, organic solvents can, for example, also be used as auxiliary solvents. As liquid solvents, there are suitable in the main: aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol as well as their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, as well as water. By liquefied gaseous extenders or carriers are meant liquids which are gaseous at ambient temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellants, such as butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. As solid carriers there are suitable: for example ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as highly-disperse silica, alumina and silicates. As solid carriers for granules there are suitable: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, as well as synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks. As emulsifying and/or foam-forming agents there are suitable: for example non-ionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates as well as albumen hydrolysis products. As dispersing agents there are suitable: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose. Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils. It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dye-stuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc. The formulations in general contain between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%. The active compound or combinations according to the invention can be present in the formulations as a mixture with other known active compounds, such as fungicides, insecticides, acaricides and herbicides, as well as in mixtures with fertilizers or plant growth regulators. The active compounds can be used as such or in the form of their formulations or the use forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspensions, wettable powders, soluble powders and granules. They are used in the customary manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing, scattering, brushing on in the form of dry seed treatment, as a solution for seed treatment a water-soluble powder for seed treatment or a water-dispersible powder for slurry treatment, or by seed coating. In the treatment of parts of plants, the active compound concentrations in the use forms can be varied within a relatively wide range. They are, in general, between 1 and 0.0001% by weight, preferably between 0.5 and 0.001%. In the treatment of seed, amounts of active compound of 0.001 to 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably 0.01 to 10 g, are generally required. For the treatment of soil, active compound concentrations of 0.00001 to 0.1% by weight, preferably 0.0001 to 0.02% by weight, are required at the place of action. The good fungicidal activity of the active compound combinations according to the invention can be seen from examples. While the individual active compounds have weaknesses in . . . fungicidal activity, the activity of the combinations exceed a simple additive-effect. Whenever the fungicidal activity of the active compound combinations exceeds the total of the activities of the individually applied active compounds, then the fungicides always show a synergistic effect. The activity to be expected for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated as follows (cf. Colby, S. R., Calculating Synergistic and Antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations, Weeds 15, pages 20-22, 1967): If x is the degree of effectiveness expressed as a percentage of the untreated control when active compound A is used in a concentration of m ppm, Y is the degree of effectiveness expressed as a percentage of the untreated control when using the active compound B in a concentration of m ppm, and E is the degree of effectiveness expressed as a percentage of the untreated control, which is to be expected when using active compound A and B in a concentration of m and n ppm, then If the actual fungicidal activity exceeds the calculated value, then the activity of the combination is super-additive, i.e. a synergistic effect exists. In this case, the actually observed degree of effectiveness must exceed the value calculated for the expected degree of effectiveness (E) using the abovementioned formula. What is claimed is: 1. A fungicidal composition comprising synergistic effective amounts of a valinamide derivative of the formula in which R 1 represents i-propyl or s-butyl and R 2 represents chlorine, methyl, ethyl or methoxy and 2. A method of combating fungi which comprises applying such fungi or to a fungus habitat a synergistic fungicidal effective amount of a composition according to claim 1 .", "related_docs": [],

compounds of the following formula: which are selective antagonists for human 1A receptors. This invention is also related to uses of these compounds for lowering intraocular pressure, inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, relaxing lower urinary tract tissue, the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, impotency, cardiac arrhythmia and for the treatment of any disease where antagonism of the 1A receptor may be useful. The invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the above-defined compounds and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/017,801, filed May 16, 1996, the contents of which are hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference into the present application. Throughout this application, various references are referred to within parentheses. Disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The designation 1A is the appellation recently approved by the IUPHAR Nomenclature Committee for the previously designated 1C cloned subtype as outlined in the 1995 Receptor and Ion Channel Nomenclature Supplement (Watson and Girdlestone, 1995). The designation 1A is used throughout this application and the supporting tables and figures to refer to this receptor subtype. At the same time, the receptor formerly designated 1A was renamed 1D . The new nomenclature is used throughout this application. Stable cell lines expressing these receptors are described herein; however, these cell lines were deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) under the old nomenclature (infra). Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), also called Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy, is a progressive condition which is characterized by a nodular enlargement of prostatic tissue resulting in obstruction of the urethra. This results in increased frequency of urination, nocturia, a poor urine stream and hesitancy or delay in starting the urine flow. Chronic consequences of BPH can include hypertrophy of bladder smooth muscle, a decompensated bladder and an increased incidence of urinary tract infection. The specific biochemical, histological and pharmacological properties of the prostate adenoma leading to the bladder outlet obstruction are not yet known. However, the development of BPH is considered to be an inescapable phenomenon for the aging male population. BPH is observed in approximately 70% of males over the age of 70. Currently, in the United States, the method of choice for treating BPH is surgery (Lepor, H., Urol. Clinics North Amer ., 17, 651 (1990)). Over 400,000 prostatectomies are performed annually (data from 1986). A medicinal alternative to surgery is clearly very desirable. The limitations of surgery for treating BPH include the morbidity rate of an operative procedure in elderly men, persistence or recurrence of obstructive and irritative symptoms, as well as the significant cost of surgery. -Adrenergic receptors (McGrath, et. al. Med. Res. Rev ., 9, 407-533, 1989) are specific neuroreceptor proteins located in the peripheral and central nervous systems on tissues and organs throughout the body. These receptors are important switches for controlling many physiological functions and, thus, represent important targets for drug development. In fact, many -adrenergic drugs have been developed over the past 40 years. Examples include clonidine, phenoxybenzamine and prazosin (treatment of hypertension), naphazoline (nasal decongestant), and apraclonidine (treating glaucoma). -Adrenergic drugs can be broken down into two distinct classes: agonists (clonidine and naphazoline are agonists), which mimic the receptor activation properties of the endogenous neurotransmitter norepinephrine, and antagonists (phenoxybenzamine and prazosin are antagonists), which act to block the effects of norepinephrine. Many of these drugs are effective but also produce unwanted side effects (for example, clonidine produces dry mouth and sedation in addition to its antihypertensive effects). During the past 15 years a more precise understanding of -adrenergic receptors and their drugs has evolved through increased scientific scrutiny. Prior to 1977, only one -adrenergic receptor was known to exist. Between 1977 and 1988, it was accepted by the scientific community that at least two -adrenergic receptors 1 and 2 existed in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Since 1988, new techniques in molecular biology have led to the identification of at least six -adrenergic receptors which exist throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems: 1A (new nomenclature), 1B , 1D (new nomenclature), 2A , 2B and 2C (Bylund, D. B., FASEB J., 6, 832 (1992)). In many cases, it is not known precisely which physiological responses in the body are controlled by each of these receptors. In addition, current -adrenergic drugs are not selective for any particular -adrenergic receptor. Many of these drugs produce untoward side effects which may be attributed to their poor -adrenergic receptor selectivity. Since the mid 1970s, nonselective -antagonists have been prescribed to treat BPH. In 1976, M. Caine, et al. (Brit. J. Urol., 48, 255 (1976)), reported that the nonselective -antagonist phenoxybenzamine was useful in relieving the symptoms of BPH. This drug may produce its effects by interacting with -receptors located on the prostate. However, this drug also produces significant side effects such as dizziness and asthenia which severely limit its use in treating patients on a chronic basis. More recently, the -adrenergic antagonists prazosin and terazosin have also been found to be useful for treating BPH. However, these drugs also produce untoward side effects. It has recently been discovered that the 1A receptor is responsible for mediating the contraction of human prostate smooth muscle (Gluchowski, C. et. al., WO 94/10989, 1994; Forray, C. et. al., Mol. Pharmacol . 45, 703, 1994). This discovery indicates that the 1A antagonists may be effective agents for the treatment of BPH with decreased side effects. Further studies have indicated that the 1A receptor may also be present in other lower urinary tract tissues, such as urethral smooth muscle (Ford et al. Br. J. Pharmacol., 114, 24P, (1995)). This invention is directed to dihydropyrimidine compounds which are selective antagonists for cloned human 1A receptors. This invention is also related to uses of these compounds for lowering intraocular pressure (Zhan, et. al. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci ., 34 Abst. 1133, 928, 1993), inhibiting cholesterol synthesis (DEletto and Javitt, J. Cardiovascular Pharmacol ., 13 (Suppl. 2) S1-S4, 1989), benign prostatic hyperplasia, impotency (Milne and Wyllie, EP 0 459 666 A2, 1991), sympathetically mediated pain (Campbell, WO 92/14453, 1992), cardiac arrhythmia (Spiers, et. al., J. Cardiovascular Pharmacol ., 16, 824-830, 1990) and for the treatment of any disease where antagonism of the 1A receptor may be useful.

Pharmacolocical Profiles of the Compounds in Cloned Human Adrenergic Receptors Binding affinities were measured for selected compounds of the invention at six cloned human alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptor subtypes, as well as at the L-type calcium channel. The protocols for these experiments are given below. Protocol for the Determination of the Potency of 1 Antagonists The activity of compounds at the different human receptors was determined in vitro using cultured cell lines that selectively express the receptor of interest. These cell lines were prepared by transfecting the cloned cDNA or cloned genomic DNA or constructs containing both genomic DNA and cDNA encoding the human -adrenergic receptors as follows: 1D Human Adrenergic Receptor: The entire coding region of 1D (1719 bp), including 150 base pairs of 5 untranslated sequence (5 UT) and 300 bp of 3 untranslated sequence (3 UT), was cloned into the BamHI and ClaI sites of the polylinker-modified eukaryotic expression vector pCEXV-3, called EXJ.HR. The construct involved the ligation of partial overlapping human lymphocyte genomic and hippocampal cDNA clones: 5 sequence were contained on a 1.2 kb SmaI-XhoI genomic fragment (the vector-derived BamHI site was used for subcloning instead of the internal insert-derived SmaI site) and 3 sequences were contained on an 1.3 kb XhoI-ClaI cDNA fragment (the ClaI site was from the vector polylinker). Stable cell lines were obtained by cotransfection with the plasmid 1A/EXJ (expression vector containing the 1A receptor gene (old nomenclature)) and the plasmid pGCcos3neo (plasmid containing the aminoglycoside transferase gene) into LM(tk) cells using calcium phosphate technique. The cells were grown, in a controlled environment (37 C., 5% CO 2 ), as monolayers in Dulbeccos modified Eagles Medium (GIBCO, Grand Island, N.Y.) containing 25 mM glucose and supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin g, and 100 g/ml streptomycin sulfate. Stable clones were then selected for resistance to the antibiotic G-418 (1 mg/ml), and membranes were harvested and assayed for their ability to bind 3 Hprazosin as described below (see Radioligand Binding assays). The cell line expressing the human 1D receptor used herein was designated L- 1A (old nomenclature) and was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md. 20852, U.S.A. under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty for the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure. The cell line expressing the human 1D receptor, was accorded ATCC Accession No. CRL 11138, and was deposited on Sep. 25, 1992. 1B Human Adrenergic Receptor: The entire coding region of 1B (1563 bp), including 200 base pairs and 5 untranslated sequence (5 UT) and 600 bp of 3 untranslated sequence (3 UT), was cloned into the EcoRI site of pCEXV-3 eukaryotic expression vector.

The construct involved ligating three partial overlapping fragments: a 5 0.6 kb HincII genomic clone, a central 1.8 EcoRI hippocampal cDNA clone, and a 3 0.6 Kb PstI genomic clone. The hippocampal cDNA fragment overlaps with the 5 and 3 genomic clones so that the HincII and PstI sites at the 5 and 3 ends of the cDNA clone, respectively, were utilized for ligation. This full-length clone was cloned into the KpnI site of the expression vector, using the 5 and 3 KpnI sites of the fragment, derived from vector (i.e., pBluescript) and 3-untranslated sequences, respectively. Stable cell lines were selected as described above. The stable cell line expressing the human 1A receptor used herein was designated L- 1C (old nomenclature) and was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md. 20852, U.S.A. under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty for the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure.

Briefly, the tissue is minced and homogenized in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenates are centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 minutes, and the resulting supernatant centrifuged at 45,000 g for 15 minutes. The 45,000 g pellet is suspended in buffer and centrifuged a second time. Aliquots of membrane protein are then incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C. in the presence of 3Hnitrendipine (1 nM), and nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 10 M nifedipine.

Compounds according to the invention are phosphodiesterase type IV inhibitors and are useful in the prophylaxis and treatment of disease such as asthma where unwanted inflammatory response or muscular spasm is present. This invention relates to a novel series of tri-substituted phenyl derivatives, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to their use in medicine. Many hormones and neurotransmitters modulate tissue function by elevating intra-cellular levels of adenosine 3,5-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP). The cellular levels of cAMP are regulated by mechanisms which control synthesis and breakdown. The synthesis of cAMP is controlled by adenyl cyclase which may be directly activated by agents such as forskolin or indirectly activated by the binding of specific agonists to cell surface receptors which are coupled to adenyl cyclase. The breakdown of cAMP is controlled by a family of phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes, which also control the breakdown of guanosine 3,5-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP). To date, seven members of the family have been described (PDE I-VII) the distribution of which varies from tissue to tissue. This suggests that specific inhibitors of PDE isoenzymes could achieve differential elevation of cAMP in different tissues, for reviews of PDE distribution, structure, function and regulation, see Beavo Reifsnyder (1990) TIPS, 11: 150-155 and Nicholson et al (1991) TIPS, 12: 19-27. There is clear evidence that elevation of cAMP in inflammatory leukocytes leads to inhibition of their activation. Furthermore, elevation of cAMP in airway smooth muscle has a spasmolytic effect. In these tissues, PDE IV plays a major role in the hydrolysis of cAMP. It can be expected, therefore, that selective inhibitors of PDE IV would have therapeutic effects in inflammatory diseases such as asthma, by achieving both anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator effects. The design of PDE IV inhibitors has met with limited success to date, in that many of the potential PDE IV inhibitors which have been synthesised have lacked potency and/or have been capable of inhibiting more than one type of PDE isoenzyme in a non-selective manner. Lack of a selective action has been a particular problem given the widespread role of cAMP in vivo and what is needed are potent selective PDE IV inhibitors with an inhibitory action against PDE IV and little or no action against other PDE isoenzymes. We have now found a novel series of tri-substituted phenyl derivatives, members of which are potent inhibitors of PDE IV at concentrations at which they have little or no inhibitory action on other PDE isoenzymes. These compounds inhibit the human recombinant PDE IV enzyme and also elevate cAMP in isolated leukocytes. The compounds of the invention are therefore of use in medicine, especially in the prophylaxis and treatment of asthma.

Alkyl groups represented by R 3 , R 4 , R 6 , R 7 or R 12 in compounds of formula (1) include optionally substituted straight or branched C 1-6 alkyl groups, e.g. C 1-3 alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl or i-propyl groups. Optional substituents which may be present on these groups include one or more halogen atoms, e.g. fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atoms, or hydroxyl or C 1-6 alkoxy e.g. C 1-3 alkoxy such as methoxy or ethoxy groups. When R 1 , R 2 , R 4 or R 6 is a CO 2 R 8 , CONR 9 R 10 or CSNR 9 R 10 group it may be for example a CO 2 H, CONH 2 or CSNH 2 group or a group CO 2 R 8 , CONR 9 R 10 , CSNR 9 R 10 , CONHR 10 , or CSNHR 10 where R 8 , R 9 and R 10 where present is a C 1-3 alkyl group such as methyl or ethyl group, a C 6-12 aryl group, for example an optionally substituted phenyl, or a 1- or 2-naphthyl group, or a C 6-12 aryl C 1-3 alkyl group such as an optionally substituted benzyl or phenethyl group. Optional substituents which may be present on these aryl groups include R 14 substituents discussed below in relation to the group Ar. When the chain Alk is present in compounds of formula (1) it may be an optionally subtituted straight or branched C 1-3 alkylene chain optionally interrupted by an atom or group X. Particular examples include CH 2 , (CH 2 ) 2 , (CH 2 ) 3 , CH 2 OCH 2 , CH 2 SCH 2 , or CH 2 N(R b )CH 2 , e.g. CH 2 NHCH 2 or CH 2 N(CH 3 )CH 2 chains. Optional substituents include those described in relation to the alkyl groups represented by R 3 , R 4 , R 6 , R 7 and R 12 . In the compounds of formula (1) when the group (Alk) t (X) n Ar is present it may be a group Ar, CH 2 Ar, (CH 2 ) 2 Ar, (CH 2 ) 3 Ar, CH 2 OAr, CH 2 OCH 2 Ar, CH 2 N(R b )Ar or CH 2 N(R b )CH 2 Ar group. Monocyclic or bicyclic aryl groups represented by the group Ar, Ar, or R in compounds of formula (1) include for example C 6-12 optionally substituted aryl groups, for example optionally substituted phenyl, 1- or 2-naphthyl, indenyl or isoindenyl groups. When the monocyclic or bicyclic aryl group Ar, Ar or R contains one or more heteroatoms it may be for example a C 5-10 optionally substituted heteroaryl group containing for example one, two, three or four heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen atoms. In general, Ar heteroaryl groups may be for example monocyclic or bicyclic heteroaryl groups. Monocyclic heteroaryl groups include for example five- or six-membered heteroaryl groups containing one, two, three or four heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen atoms. Bicyclic heteroaryl groups include for example nine- or ten-membered heteroaryl groups containing one, two or more heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen atoms. Examples of heteroaryl groups represented by Ar, Ar or R include pyrrolyl, furyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, N-methylimidazolyl, N-ethylimidazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, pyrazolyl, 1,2,3-triazolyl, 1,2,4-triazolyl, 1,2,3-oxadiazolyl, 1,2,4-oxadiazolyl, 1,2,5-oxadiazolyl, 1,3,4-oxadiazolyl, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, 1,3,5-triazinyl, 1,2,4-triazinyl, 1,2,3-triazinyl, benzofuryl, isobenzofuryl, benzothienyl, isobenzothienyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, benzimidazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, quinazolinyl, naphthyridinyl, pyrido3,4-bpyridyl, pyrido3,2-bpyridyl, pyrido4,3-bpyridyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, tetrazolyl, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinolinyl and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroisoquinolinyl. Example of bicyclic heteroaryl groups include quinolinyl or isoquinolinyl groups. The heteroaryl group represented by Ar, Ar or R may be attached to the remainder of the molecule of formula (1) through any ring carbon or heteroatom as appropriate. Thus, for example, when the group Ar or Ar is a pyridyl group it may be a 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl or 4-pyridyl group. When it is a thienyl group it may be a 2-thienyl or 3-thienyl group, and, similarly, when it is a furyl group it may be a 2-furyl or 3-furyl group. In another example, when the group Ar is a quinolinyl group it may be a 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-quinolinyl and when it is an isoquinolinyl, it may be a 1-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-isoquinolinyl group. When in compounds of formula (1) the Ar, Ar or R group is a nitrogen-containing heterocycle it may be possible to form quaternary salts, for example N-alkyl quaternary salts and the invention is to be understood to extend to such salts. Thus for example when the group Ar is a pyridyl group, pyridinium salts may be formed, for example N-alkylpyridinium salts such as N-methylpyridinium. The aryl or heteroaryl groups represented by Ar, Ar or R, in compounds of formula (1) may each optionally be substituted by one, two, three or more substituents R 14 . The substituent R 14 may be selected from an atom or group R 15 or Alk 1 (R 15 ) m wherein R 15 is a halogen atom, or an amino (NH 2 ), substituted amino, nitro, cyano, hydroxyl (OH), substituted hydroxyl, cycloalkoxy, cycloaliphatic, formyl HC(O), carboxyl (CO 2 H), esterified carboxyl, thiol (SH), substituted thiol, C(O)R where R is a group Alk 1 where Alk 1 is a straight or branched C 1-6 alkylene, C 2-6 alkenylene, or C 2-6 alkynylene chain optionally interrupted by one, two, or three O, or S atoms or S(O) z , (where z is an integer 1 or 2) or N(R b ) groups; or is a group Ar (where Ar is as defined for Ar), SO 3 H, SO 2 R, SO 2 NH 2 , SO 2 NHR SO 2 NR 2 , CONH 2 , CONHR CONR 2 , NHSO 2 H, N(R)SO 2 H, NHSO 2 R, NRSO 2 R, NSO 2 R 2 , NHSO 2 NH 2 , NRSO 2 NH 2 , NHSO 2 NHR, NRSO 2 NHR, NRSO 2 NHR, NHSO 2 NR 2 , N(R)SO 2 NR 2 , NHC(O)R, NRC(O)R, NC(O)R 2 , NHC(O)H, NRC(O)H, NHC(O)OR, NRC(O)OR, NHC(O)OH, NRC(O)OH, NHCONH 2 , NHCONHR, NHCONR 2 , NRCONR 2 , C(S)R, C(S)NH 2 , C(S)NHR, C(S)NR 2 , NHC(S)R, NRC(S)R, NC(S)R 2 , NHC(S)H, NRC(S)H, NHC(S)NH 2 , NHC(S)NHR, NHC(S)NR 2 , NRC(S)NR 2 , Ar or XAr group; and m is zero or an integer 1, 2 or 3. When in the group Alk 1 (R 15 ) m m is an integer 1, 2 or 3, it is to be understood that the substituent or substituents R 15 may be present on any suitable carbon atom in Alk 1 . Where more than one R 15 substituent is present these may be the same or different and may be present on the same or different carbon atom in Alk 1 . Clearly, when m is zero and no substituent R 15 is present or when Alk 1 forms part of a group such as SO 2 Alk 1 the alkylene, alkenylene or alkynylene chain represented by Alk 1 becomes an alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group. When R 15 is a substituted amino group it may be a group NHAlk 1 (R 15a ) m where Alk 1 and m are as defined above and R 15a is as defined above for R 15 but is not a substituted amino, a substituted hydroxyl or a substituted thiol group or a group NAlk 1 (R 15a ) m2 wherein each Alk 1 (R 15a ) m group is the same or different. When R 15 is a halogen atom it may be for example a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. When R 15 is a cycloalkoxy group it may be for example a C 5-7 cycloalkoxy group such as a cyclopentyloxy or cyclohexyloxy group. When R 15 is a substituted hydroxyl or substituted thiol group it may be a group OAlk 1 (R 15a ) m or SAlk 1 (R 15a ) m respectively, where Alk 1 , R 15a and m are as just defined. Esterified carboxyl groups represented by the group R 15 include groups of formula CO 2 Alk 2 wherein Alk 2 is a straight or branched, optionally substituted C 1-8 alkyl group such as a methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, s-butyl or t-butyl group; a C 6-12 arylC 1-8 alkyl group such as an optionally substituted benzyl, phenylethyl, phenylpropyl, 1-naphthylmethyl or 2-naphthylmethyl group; a C 6-12 aryl group such as an optionally substituted phenyl, 1-naphthyl or 2-naphthyl group; a C 6-12 aryloxyC 1-8 alkyl group such as an optionally substituted phenyloxymethyl, phenyloxyethyl, 1-naphthyloxymethyl, or 2-naphthyloxymethyl group; an optionally substituted C 1-8 alkanoyloxyC 1-8 alkyl group, such as a pivaloyloxymethyl, propionyloxyethyl or propionyloxypropyl group; or a C 6-12 aroyloxyC 1-8 alkyl group such as an optionally substituted benzoyloxyethyl or benzoyloxy-propyl group. Optional substituents present on the Alk 2 group include R 14 substituents described above. When the group R 15 in compounds of formulae (1) and (2) is an optionally substituted C 3-9 cycloaliphatic group, it may be a C 3-9 cycloalkyl or C 3-9 cycloalkenyl group such as a C 5-7 cycloalkyl or C 5-7 cycloalkenyl group, containing 1, 2, 3 or more heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen atoms. Particular examples of such R 15 groups include pyrrolyl, e.g. 2H-pyrrolyl, pyrrolinyl, e.g. 2- or 3-pyrrolinyl, pyrrolidinyl, 1,3-dioxolanyl, imidazolinyl, e.g. 2-imidazolinyl, imidazolidinyl, pyrazolinyl, e.g. 2-pyrazolinyl, pyrazolidinyl, pyranyl, e.g. 2- or 4-pyranyl, piperidinyl, 1,4-dioxanyl, morpholinyl, 1,4-dithianyl, thiomorpholinyl, piperazinyl, 1,3,5-trithianyl, 3H-pyrrolyl, 2H-imidazolyl, dithiolyl, e.g. 1,2- or 1,3-dithiolyl, oxathiolyl, e.g. 3H-1-2 or 1,3-oxathiolyl, 5H-1,2,5-oxathiozolyl, 1,3-dioxinyl, oxazinyl, e.g. 2H-1,3-, 6H-1,3-, 6H-1,2-, 1,4-2H-1,2- or 4H-1,4-oxazinyl, 1,2,5-oxathiazinyl, isoxazinyl, e.g. -o- or p-isoxazinyl, oxathiazinyl, e.g. 1,2,5-, 1,2,6-oxathiazinyl, 1,3,5,2-oxadiazinyl, or 1,2,4-diazepinyl groups. Optional substituents which may be present on such groups include those substituents discussed above in relation to the group Ar where Ar is a heterocycloaliphatic group. It will be appreciated that the group Ar, Ar or R may be attached to the remainder of the molecule of formula (1) through either a ring carbon atom or heteroatom. Particular examples of the group Alk 1 when present include methylene, ethylene, n-propylene, i-propylene, n-butylene, i-butylene, s-butylene, t-butylene, ethenylene, 2-propenylene, 2-butenylene, 3-butenylene, ethynylene, 2-propynylene, 2-butynylene or 3-butynylene chain, optionally interrupted by one, two, or three O or S atoms or S(O), S(O) 2 or N(R b ) groups.

Where desired, two R 14 substituents may be linked together to form a cyclic group such as a cyclic ether, e.g. a C 2-6 alkylenedioxy group such as ethylenedioxy. It will be appreciated that where two or more R 1 4 substituents are present, these need not necessarily be the same atoms and/or groups. The R 14 substituents may be present at any ring carbon atom away from that attached to the rest of the molecule of formula (1). Thus, for example, in phenyl groups represented by Ar any substituent may be present at the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5- or 6-positions relative to the ring carbon atom attached to the remainder of the molecule. Particular examples of the chain Z 1 in compounds of formula (1) include NHCO, CONH, NHCS, CSNH, NHSO 2 , SO 2 NH and CC. In the compounds of formula (1), when an ester group is present, for example a group CO 2 R 8 or CO 2 Alk 2 this may advantageously be a metabolically labile ester. The presence of certain substituents in the compounds of formula (1) may enable salts of the compounds to be formed. Suitable salts include pharmaceutically acceptable salts, for example acid addition salts derived from inorganic or organic acids, and salts derived from inorganic and organic bases. Acid addition salts include hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, hydroiodides, alkylsulphonates, e.g. methanesulphonates, ethanesulphonates, or isethionates, arylsulphonates, e.g. p-toluenesulphonates, besylates or napsylates, phosphates, sulphates, hydrogen sulphates, acetates, trifluoroacetates, propionates, citrates, maleates, fumarates, malonates, succinates, lactates, oxalates, tartrates and benzoates. Salts derived from inorganic or organic bases include alkali metal salts such as sodium or potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as magnesium or calcium salts, and organic amine salts such as morpholine, piperidine, dimethylamine or diethylamine salts. Prodrugs of compounds of formula (1) include those compounds, for example esters, alcohols or aminos, which are convertible in vivo by metabolic means, e.g. by hydrolysis, reduction, oxidation or trans-esterification, to compounds of formula (1). Particularly useful salts of compounds according to the invention include pharmaceutically acceptable salts, especially acid addition pharmaceutically acceptable salts. In the compounds of formula (1) the group W is preferably a C(Y) group. In compounds of this type Y is preferably a XR a group where X is O and R a is an optionally substituted ethyl group or, especially, an optionally substituted methyl group. Especially useful substituents which may be present on R a groups include one, two or three fluorine or chlorine atoms. The group L in compounds of formula (1) is preferably a CHC(R 1 )(R 2 ) group. In compounds of this type R 1 and R 2 are preferably linked together with the C atom to which they are attached to form an optionally substituted cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl group, especially a substituted cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl or, especially, a cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl group. In the compounds of formula (1) where Z is the group (A), one preferred group of compounds are those where the group R 3 is a hydrogen atom; the group R 6 is a methyl group, or especially a hydrogen atom; the group R 7 is a methyl group, or especially a hydrogen atom; and R 4 and R 5 are as defined for formula (1). In compounds of this type R 6 and R 7 in one preference, is each a methyl group; in another preference, one of R 6 or R 7 is a methyl group and the other is a hydrogen atom, in general, however, R 6 and R 7 is each especially a hydrogen atom. The groups R 4 and R 5 when present in compounds of formula (1) are each, independently, preferably a CH 2 Ar group, or, especially, an Ar group. Particularly useful R 4 or R 5 groups of this type include those groups in which Ar is a monocyclic aryl group optionally containing one or more heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulphur, or, in particular, nitrogen atoms, and optionally substituted by one, two, three or more R 14 substituents. In these compounds, when the group represented by Ar is a heteroaryl group it is preferably a nitrogen-containing monocyclic heteroaryl group, especially a six-membered nitrogen-containing heteroaryl group. Thus, in one preferred example, the groups R 4 and R 5 may each be a six-membered nitrogen-containing heteroaryl group. In another preferred example R 4 may be a monocyclic aryl group or a monocyclic or bicyclic heteroaryl group containing one or more oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen atom and R 5 may be a six-membered nitrogen-containing heteroaryl group. In these examples, the six-membered nitrogen-containing heteroaryl group may be an optionally substituted pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl or imidazolyl group. Particular examples include optionally substituted 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 5-imidazolyl, or, especially, 4-pyridyl, 3-pyridazinyl, 4-pyridazinyl, 5-pyridazinyl, 2-pyrimidinyl, 4-pyrimidinyl, 5-pyrimidinyl, 2-pyrazinyl or 3-pyrazinyl. The monocyclic aryl group may be a phenyl group or a substituted phenyl group, and the monocyclic or bicyclic heteroaryl group containing one or more oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen atom may be an optionally substituted 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-thiazolyl, 2-benzo(b)thiophenyl, 2-benzo(b)furyl or 4-isoquinolinyl group. One particularly useful group of compounds of formula (1) when Z is a group (A) or (B) is that wherein R 4 and R 5 is each a pyridyl or, especially, a monosubstituted pyridyl, or preferably a disubstituted pyridyl group, or R 4 is a phenyl, thienyl or furyl, or substituted phenyl, thienyl or furyl group and R 5 is a pyridyl or, especially a monosubstituted pyridyl, or preferably a disubstituted pyridyl group. In this particular group of compounds and also in general in compounds of formula (1) when R 4 and/or R 5 is a substituted phenyl group it may be for example a mono-, di- or trisubstituted phenyl group in which the substituent is an atom or group R 14 as defined above. When the R 4 and/or R 5 group is a monosubstituted phenyl group the substituent may be in the 2-, or preferably 3-, or especially 4-position relative to the ring carbon atom attached to the remainder of the molecule. When the R 4 and/or R 5 group is a disubstituted phenyl group, the substituents may be in the 2,6 position relative to the ring carbon atom attached to the remainder of the molecule. When in compounds of formula (1) R 4 and/or R 5 is a substituted pyridyl group it may be for example a mono- or disubstituted pyridyl group, such as a mono- or disubstituted 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl or especially 4-pyridyl group substituted by one or two atoms or groups R 14 as defined above, in particular one or two halogen atoms such as fluorine or chlorine atoms, or methyl, methoxy, hydroxyl or nitro groups. Particularly useful pyridyl groups of these types are 3-monosubstituted-4-pyridyl or 3,5-disubstituted-4-pyridyl, or 2- or 4-monosubstituted-3-pyridyl or 2,4-disubstituted-3-pyridyl groups. Other particularly useful groups of compounds of formula (1) where Z is the group (B), include those where R 4 is a CH 3 group or a hydrogen atom; R 5 is a hydrogen atom, a CN or a CH 3 group; R 6 is as just described for R 4 and R 5 in the compounds of formula (1) where Z is the group (A). Another particularly useful group of compounds of formula (1) when Z is a group (C) is that wherein Ar is a phenyl, naphthyl, pyrrolyl, furyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, thiazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinolinyl or 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-isoquinolinyl group. In compounds of this type when Ar is a quinolinyl group it may be for example a mono- or disubstituted quinolinyl group such as a 2-monosubstituted-4-quinolinyl group; when it is a pyridyl group, it may be an optionally substituted 3- or 4-pyridyl, e.g. a 2,3,5,6-tetrasubstituted-4-pyridyl or 2,4,6-trisubstituted-3-pyridyl group; when it is a pyrimidinyl group, it may be for example a 5-pyrimidinyl group or a 2-substituted 5-pyrimidinyl group; and when it is an isoquinolinyl group, it may be a 4-isoquinolinyl group. Other especially useful groups of compounds of formula (1) include those where Z is a group (D) in which (1) Z 1 is a C(O)NR 12 group, where R 12 is a hydrogen atom. In compounds of this type, t is preferably zero and Ar is a 2-nitrophenyl or 4-(3,5-dichloro)pyridyl group, or (2) those where Z 1 is a NR 12 C(O) group, where R 12 is a hydrogen atom, t is zero and Ar is a 4-pyridyl or 4-(3,5-dichloro)pyridyl, benzyl or 2-methylbenzoate group, or t is an integer of value 1 and Ar is a 2- or 3-nitrophenyl, phenyl or 2-methylphenyl group. A particularly useful group of compounds of formula (1) has the formula (2): where (1) L is a CHC(R 1 )(R 2 ) or CH 2 CH(R 1 )(R 2 ) group where R 1 and R 2 are linked together with the carbon atom to which they are attached to form a cycloalkyl group; or (2) L is a group OAlkAr where Alk is a C 1-6 alkylene chain and Ar is a monocyclic aryl or heteroaryl group. Particular examples of such L groups include benzyloxy, thienyloxy or phenylpentyloxy groups; or (3) L is a group OR where R is an optionally substituted polycyloalkyl or polycycloalkyl group or is as described above for Ar. Preferred examples of such R groups include optionally substituted bicycylo2.2.1heptyl or bicyclo2.2.1heptenyl group. In particular R is a bicyclo2.2.1hept-2-yl group; and Z is as defined for formula (1); and the salts, solvates, hydrates, prodrugs and N-oxides thereof. In compounds of formula (2) where R 3 , R 6 or R 7 is present it is each preferably a hydrogen atom. A particularly useful group of compounds according to the invention has the formula (2) wherein L is a OR group and Z is the group (A). In this particular group of compounds R 3 , R 6 and R 7 is each a hydrogen atom and R 4 and R 5 are as defined for compounds of formula (1) and the salts, solvates, hydrates and N-oxides thereof. Compounds of this type in which R is a bicyclo2.2.1heptyl, particularly a bicyclo2.2.1hept-2-yl group are particularly useful.

Compounds according to the invention are selective and potent inhibitors of PDE IV. The ability of the compounds to act in this way may be simply determined by the tests described in the Examples hereinafter. Particular uses to which the compounds of the invention may be put include the prophylaxis and treatment of asthma, especially inflamed lung associated with asthma, cystic fibrosis, or in the treatment of inflammatory airway disease, chronic bronchitis, eosinophilic granuloma, psoriasis and other benign and malignant proliferative skin diseases, endotoxic shock, septic shock, ulcerative colitis, Crohns disease, reperfusion injury of the myocardium and brain, inflammatory arthritis, chronic glomerulonephritis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria, adult respiratory distress syndrome, diabetes insipidus, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, arterial restenosis and artherosclerosis. Compounds of the invention may also suppress neurogenic inflammation through elevation of cAMP in sensory neurones. They are, therefore, analgesic, anti-tussive and anti-hyperalgesic in inflammatory diseases associated with irritation and pain. Compounds according to the invention may also elevate cAMP in lymphocytes and thereby suppress unwanted lymphocyte activation in immune-based diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, transplant rejection and graft versus host disease. Compounds according to the invention may also reduce gastric acid secretion and therefore can be used to treat conditions associated with hypersecretion. Compounds of the invention may suppress cytokine synthesis by inflammatory cells in response to immune or infectious stimulation. They are, therefore, useful in the treatment of bacterial, fungal or viral induced sepsis and septic shock in which cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) are key mediators. Also compounds of the invention may suppress inflammation and pyrexia due to cytokines and are, therefore, useful in the treatment of inflammation and cytokine-mediated chronic tissue degeneration which occurs in diseases such as rheumatoid or osteoarthritis. Over-production of cytokines such as TNF in bacterial, fungal or viral infections or in diseases such as cancer, leads to cachexia and muscle wasting. Compounds of the invention may ameliorate these symptoms with a consequent enhancement of quality of life. Compounds of the invention may also elevate cAMP in certain areas of the brain and thereby counteract depression and memory impairment. Compounds of the invention may suppress cell proliferation in certain tumour cells and can be used, therefore, to prevent tumour growth and invasion of normal tissues. For the prophylaxis or treatment of disease the compounds according to the invention may be administered as pharmaceutical compositions, and according to a further aspect of the invention we provide a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of formula (1) together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or diluents. Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may take a form suitable for oral, buccal, parenteral, nasal, topical or rectal administration, or a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets, lozenges or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g. pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g. potato starch or sodium glycollate); or wetting agents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles and preservatives. The preparations may also contain buffer salts, flavouring, colouring and sweetening agents as appropriate. Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound. For buccal administration the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. The compounds of formulae (1) and (2) may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection e.g. by bolus injection or infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g. in glass ampoule or multi dose containers, e.g. glass vials. The compositions for injection may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising, preserving and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. In addition to the formulations described above, the compounds of formulae (1) and (2) may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation or by intramuscular injection. For nasal administration or administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation for pressurised packs or a nebuliser, with the use of suitable propellant, e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas or mixture of gases. The compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack or dispensing device may be accompanied by instructions for administration. The quantity of a compound of the invention required for the prophylaxis or treatment of a particular inflammatory condition will vary depending on the compound chosen, and the condition of the patient to be treated. In general, however, daily dosages may range from around 100 ng/kg to 100 mg/kg, e.g. around 0.01 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg body weight for oral or buccal administration, from around 10 ng/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight for parenteral administration and around 0.05 mg to around 1000 mg e.g. around 0.5 mg to around 1000 mg for nasal administration or administration by inhalation or insufflation. The compounds according to the invention may be prepared by the following processes. The symbols W, L, Z, X,R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 , and R 7 when used in the formulae below are to be understood to represent those groups described above in relation to formula (1) unless otherwise indicated. In the reactions described below it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, thio, carboxy or aldehyde groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice see, for example, Green, T. W. in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis John Wiley and Sons, 1981. Thus, according to a further aspect of the invention, compounds of general formula (1) where L is X a AlkAr, AlkX a Ar or X a R may be prepared by coupling an intermediate of formula (3) a) where L 2 is a group X a H with a reagent L 3 AlkAr, or L 3 R where L 3 is a leaving group; or b) where L 2 is a group AlkL 3 with a reagent ArX a H. Leaving groups represented by L 3 include halogen atoms such as iodine, chlorine or bromine atoms, sulphonyloxy groups such as arylsulpyhonyloxy groups, e.g. p-toluenesulphonyloxy or hydroxyl groups. The coupling reaction may be carried out in the presence of a base, e.g. an inorganic base such as a carbonate, e.g. caesium or potassium carbonate, an alkoxide, e.g. potassium t-butoxide, or a hydride, e.g. sodium hydride, in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as an amide, e.g. a substituted amide, such as dimethylformamide or an ether, e.g. diethylether or a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran or halogenated solvents, such as dichloromethane. The temperature of the reaction mixture may vary from ambient temperature or above, e.g. around 40 C. to the reflux temperature. Where necessary, an activator may be used, such as diethyl-, diisopropyl-, or dimethylazodicarboxylate, in the presence of a phosphine, such as triphenylphosphine and a base, such as an amine, e.g. triethylamine. Intermediates of formula (3) where L 2 is a group AlkL 3 wherein L 3 is a halogen atom may be prepared by reaction of an intermediate of formula (3) wherein AlkL 3 is a AlkOH group with a halogenating agent, such as an inorganic acid halide e.g. thienylchloride, or an anhydride such as an arylsulphonic anhydride, e.g. p.toluenesulphonic anhydride, using conventional procedures. Intermediates of formula (3) where L 2 is a group X a H may be prepared by deprotection of a protected compound of formula (4) where P is a hydroxy, thio, or amino protecting group. Examples of hydroxy protecting groups include, for example ether groups, such as a cyclopentyloxy group. The deprotection reaction may take place in an aqueous solvent, such as an aqueous ether, e.g. dioxane-water, in the presence of an acid, e.g. sulphuric acid at an elevated temperature. e.g. around 90 C. Another example of protecting group P include t-butyldimethylsilyloxy group which can be cleaved by treatment with tetrabutylammonium fluoride to regenerate the free hydroxy group. Intermediates of formula (3) where Z is a group (A) in which R 3 is a hydroxyl group and R 7 is a hydrogen atom may be prepared by reacting a ketone of formula (5) with an organometallic reagent R 5 R 6 CHM, where M is a metal atom. Metal atoms represented by Z include, for example, a lithium atom. The reaction may be performed in a solvent such as an ether, e.g. a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran, at a low temperature e.g. around 70 C. to ambient temperature. This reaction is particularly suitable for the preparation of compounds of formula (3) wherein R 5 is an electron deficient group such as a 2- or 4-pyridyl group. Reagents R 5 R 6 CHM are either known compounds or may be prepared, preferably in situ during the above process, by reaction of a compound AlkCH 2 M where Alk is an alkyl group such as n-propyl with a compound R 5 R 6 CH 2 where necessary in the presence of a base such as an amine e.g. diisopropylamine using the above-mentioned conditions. Intermediates of formula (5) where L 2 is a group X a H in which X a is NH and R 4 is a hydrogen atom may be prepared from the known compound of formula (6) by reduction with a reducing agent, such as a lithium aluminium hydride, to give the alcohol derivative. This in turn may be oxidised, for example with manganese dioxide to afford an aldehyde of formula (5). Intermediates of formula (3) where Z is a group (A) in which R 3 is a hydroxyl group may be prepared by reacting a ketone of formula (5) with a reagent R 5 CHR 6 R 7 using a base, such as an organometallic base, for example an organolithium reagent e.g. n-butyllithium, in a solvent, such as an ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, at around 70 C. to room temperature. Ketones of formula (5) may be prepared by oxidation of an alcohol of formula (7) using an oxidising agent, such as manganese (IV) oxide, in a solvent, such as dichloromethane, at room temperature. Alternatively, ketones of formula (5) may be prepared by reaction of a halide of formula (8) where Hal is a halogen atom such as a bromine or chlorine atom by halogen-metal exchange with a base such as n-butyllithium followed by reaction with a nitrile R 4 CN, an acid chloride R 4 COCl or an ester R 4 CO 2 A (where A is an alkyl group, e.g. a methyl group), in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a low temperature, e.g. around 70 C., and subsequent treatment with an acid such as hydrochloric acid at e.g. 20 C. to ambient temperature. Alcohols of formula (7) may be prepared (1) by reacting a halide of formula (8) e.g. a bromide, with an aldehyde R 4 CHO, in the presence of a base, such as n-butyllithium, in a solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, at a temperature from around 70 C. to room temperature; or (2) by reacting an aldehyde of formula (9) where W a is a CHO group (as described hereinbelow) with an organometallic compound, such as an organolithium R 4 Li, or a Grignard R 4 MgBr, in a solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, at a low temperature, e.g. around 55 C. to 0 C. Intermediates of formula (3) where Z is a group (B) may be prepared by condensing an intermediate of formula (9) where (a) W a is a C(O)R 4 group wherein R 4 is as defined for formula (1) but is not a CN or CH 2 CN group, with a compound R 5 CH 2 R 6 ; or where (b) W a is a CH 2 R 4 group with an aldehyde or ketone R 5 COR 6 where R 5 is as just defined for R 4 ; or where (c) W a is a C(O)R 4 group with a silane derivative (Alk a ) 3 SiCH(R 5 )(R 6 ), where Alk a is an alkyl group; in each instance in the presence of a base or an acid in a suitable solvent. Bases for use in these reactions include inorganic bases, for example alkali and alkaline earth metal bases, e.g. hydroxides, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide; alkoxides, for example sodium ethoxide; organic bases, for example amines such as piperidine; and organolithium bases, such as alkyllithium, e.g. n-butyllithium bases. Suitable solvents include alcohols such as ethanol, or ethers such as tetrahydrofuran. Acids for use in the reactions include organic acids, e.g. carboxylic acids such as acetic acid. The reactions may be performed at any suitable temperature, for example from around 78 C. to ambient temperature or to the reflux temperature depending on the nature of the starting materials. In general, the base, acid, solvent and reaction conditions may be selected depending on the nature of the starting materials, from a range of known alternatives for reactions of this type. In silane derivatives of formula (Alk a ) 3 SiCH(R 5 )(R 6 ), Alk a may be for example a C 1-6 alkyl group such as a methyl group. Derivatives of this type may be prepared for example by reacting a compound R 5 CH 2 R 6 with a silane derivative, such as a chlorotrialkylsilane, e.g. chlorotrimethylsilane in the presence of a base, e.g. lithium diisopropylamide, in a solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, at a low temperature, e.g. around 10 C. The starting materials R 5 COR 6 and R 5 CH 2 R 6 are either known compounds or may be prepared from known starting materials by methods analogous to those used for the preparation of the known compounds. Intermediates of formula (9) where W a is a C(O)R 4 group where R 4 is an alkyl or aryl group (CH 2 ) t Ar group, may be prepared by reacting an aldehyde of formula (9) where W a is a CHO group with an organometallic reagent in a solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, at low temperature, e.g. around 10 C., followed by oxidation with an oxidising agent, such as manganese dioxide, in a solvent, e.g. dichloromethane. Intermediates of formula (9) where W a is CHO may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (8) described above with an organometallic reagent, such as n-butyllithium, in a solvent, such as an amide, e.g. dimethylformamide, at a low temperature, e.g. below 60 C. Intermediates of formula (8) may be prepared by deprotecting a compound of formula (10) using reagents and conditions described herein for the obtention of an intermediate of formula (3) from an intermediate of formula (4) where L 2 is a group X a H. Intermediates of formula (10) may be prepared by protecting a compound of formula (11) Examples of protecting groups include hydroxy, thio or amino protecting groups using conventional procedures see Green, T. W. ibid. Thus for example, where X a is an oxygen atom, the hydroxyl group may be protected as an ether group, using a reagent Alk b L 3 , where Alk b is an alkyl group and L 3 is a leaving group. Alkyl groups represented by Alk b include cycloalkyl groups, such as cyclopentyl group, and leaving groups L 3 include halogen atoms such as iodine, chlorine or bromine atoms or sulphonyloxy groups such as arylsulphonyloxy groups, e.g. p.toluenesulphonyloxy groups. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a base, e.g. an inorganic base such as a carbonate, e.g. caesium or potassium carbonate, an alkoxide, e.g. potassium-t-butoxide, or a hydride, e.g. sodium hydride, in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as an amide, e.g. a substituted amide such as dimethylformamide or an ether, e.g. a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran, at ambient temperature or above. e.g. around 40 C. to 50 C. Halides of formula (11) where X a is O may be prepared by oxydation of an aldehyde of formula (17) (where R is a hydrogen atom) as described below using an oxidising agent such as 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in a halogenated hydrocarbon such as chloroform at a temperature from around 0 C. to room temperature. Halides of formula (11) where X a is S or N(R b ) are either known compounds or may be prepared from known starting materials by methods analogous to those used for the preparation of the known compounds. Compounds of formula (1) where Z is a group (A) in which R 3 is a hydroxyl group and R 7 is as described for compounds of formula (1) may be prepared by reacting a compound or formula (11) with a reagent R 5 R 6 CHM or R 5 CHR 6 R 7 using the conditions described hereinabove for the obtention of an intermediate of formula (3) from a ketone of formula (5). In another process according to the invention, compounds of formula (1) where Z is a group (B) and R 4 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl or (CH 2 ) t Ar group may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (12) with a phosphonate ester (R d O)(OR e )P(O)CH(R 5 )(R 6 ) where R d and R e , which may be the same or different is an alkyl, or aralkyl group in the presence of a base in a suitable solvent. Suitable bases include organometallic bases such as organolithium, e.g. n-butyllithium, alkoxides, for example alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium ethoxide or sodium methoxide and a hydride such as potassium hydride or sodium hydride. Solvents include ethers, e.g. diethylether or cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and alcohol, e.g. methanol or ethanol. The phosphonate derivatives used in this reaction are either known compounds or may be prepared by reacting a phosphite P(OR d ) 2 (OR e ) with a compound R 5 CHR 6 Hal where Hal is a halogen atom, for example a bromine atom using conventional methods. Intermediates of formula (12) where R 4 is a hydrogen atom may be prepared by reacting a halide of formula (13) where Hal is a halogen atom, e.g. a bromine or chlorine atom with an organometallic reagent using the same reagents and conditions described above for the preparation of intermediates of formula (9) where W a is CHO from intermediates of formula (8). Intermediates of formula (2) where W is N and R 4 is H may be prepared from an acid of formula (14) using the conditions described above for the preparation of an intermediate of formula (5) from an acid of formula (6). Intermediates of formula (14) where L is X a AlkAr or X a R and X a is O, S or NH, may be prepared by reacting a halide of formula (15) where Hal is a halogen atom, e.g. a bromine, chlorine or iodine atom with a compound ArAlkX a H, where X a is O, S or NH in the presence of a base. Bases used in this reaction include a hydride, such as sodium hydride, or an organometallic base such as butyllithium in a solvent, such as an amide, for example dimethylformamide at a temperature from room temperature to above, e.g. 80 C. Intermediates of formula (15) may be prepared by reacting the known amine of formula (16) with nitrous acid (made in situ by reacting sodium nitrite with an acid, for example sulphuric acid or hydrobromic acid) to produce the diazonium salt. This in turn may be reacted with a haloacid, e.g. hydrobromic, hydrochloride or hydriodic acid if necessary in the presence of the corresponding copper (I), halide (CuBr or Cul) or halogen Br 2 , Cl 2 or I 2 . Intermediates of formula (13) where L is a C(R)C(R 1 )(R 2 ) group may be prepared by coupling a compound of formula (17) where Hal is a halogen atom, e.g. a bromine atom with a phosphonium salt (R 1 )(R 2 )CHP(D) 3 Hal as described below for the preparation of compounds of formula (1) from intermediates of formula (19). Intermediates of formula (12) where R 4 is an alkyl or (CH 2 ) t Ar group may be prepared by reaction of the corresponding compound of formula (12) where R 4 is a hydrogen atom with an organometallic reagent, followed by oxidation, as described previously for the preparation of intermediates of formula (9) where W a is C(O)R 4 where R 4 is an alkyl or aryl group (CH 2 ) t Ar from intermediates of formula (9) where R 4 is a hydrogen atom. In another process for the preparation of compounds of formula (1) where Z is the group (B), an intermediate of formula (18) may be coupled in a Heck reaction with an organopalladium compound derived from a compound R 5 Hal where Hal is a halogen atom such as a bromine atom and a palladium salt such as palladium acetate in the presence of a phosphine such as tri-o-tolylphosphine and a base such as triethylamine at an elevated temperature and pressure. Intermediate alkenes of formula (18) may be obtained by reaction of a corresponding intermediate of formula (12) using a Wittig reaction employing a phosphonium salt such as methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide in the presence of a base such as n-butylithium and an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at, for example, 0 C. to ambient temperature. Intermediates of formula (3) where L 2 is a AlkL 3 group in which Alk is an alkenylene chain CCAlk and L 3 is a hydroxyl group may be prepared by coupling a compound of formula (19) where R is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group such as a methyl group, with an olefination agent. Particular examples of olefination agents include phosphonium salts such as compounds HOAlkP(D) 3 Hal where the hydroxyl group may need to be protected using conventional protecting group where Hal is a halogen atom, such as a bromine atom and D is an optionally substituted alkyl, e.g. methyl, or aryl, especially phenyl group; phosphoranes HOAlkCP(D) 3 ; phosphonates (DO) 2 P(O)AlkOH; or silane derivatives, for example compounds of formula (D) 3 SiAlkOH e.g. trialkylsilanes such as (CH 3 ) 3 SiAlkOH.

Intermediates of formula (20) may be prepared by protecting an aldehyde or ketone of formula (19) with an aldehyde or ketone protecting group, using for example a suitable diol, e.g. 1,3-propanediol, in the presence of an acid catalyst, e.g. 4-toluene sulphonic acid, in a solvent, such as an aromatic solvent, e.g. toluene, at an elevated temperature. In general, this reaction may be used when it is desired to protect an aldehyde in any intermediate described herein. Compounds of formula (1) where L is a group C(R)C(R 1 )(R 2 ) or AlkAr where Alk is an alkenylene chain CCAlk may be prepared from an intermediate of formula (19) using an appropriate olefination agent. Particular examples of olefination agents include phosphonium salts such as compounds (R 1 )(R 2 )CHP(D) 3 Hal or ArAlkP(D) 3 Hal where Hal is a halogen atom, such as a bromine atom, and D is an optionally substituted alkyl, e.g. methyl, or aryl, especially phenyl, group; phosphoranes (R 1 )(R 2 )CP(D) 3 or ArAlkP(D) 3 ; phosphonates (DO) 2 P(O)CH(R 1 )(R 2 ) or (DO 2 )P(O)AlkAr; or silane derivatives, for example compounds of formula (D 3 )SiC(R 1 )(R 2 ) or (D 3 )SiAlkAr, e.g. trialkylsilanes such as (CH 3 ) 3 SiC(R 1 )(R 2 ) or (CH 3 ) 3 SiAlkAr. Bases for use in the above reaction include organometallic bases, for example, an organolithium compound such as an alkyllithium e.g. n-butyllithium, a hydride, such as sodium or potassium hydride or an alkoxide, such as a sodium alkoxide, e.g. sodium methoxide. The reaction may be performed in a suitable solvent, for example a polar aprotic solvent, such as an alkyl sulphoxide, e.g. methyl sulphoxide, an amide such as N,N-dimethylformamide or hexamethylphosphorous triamide; a non-polar solvent, such as an ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether or an aromatic solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene; or a polar protic solvent, such as an alcohol, for example ethanol. Preferably the reaction is carried out at a low temperature, for example from around 78 C. to around room temperature. The olefination agents used in this reaction are either known compounds or may be prepared from known starting materials using reagents and conditions similar to those used to prepare the known compounds. For example, a phosphorane may be prepared in situ by reaction of a phosphonium salt with a base of the type described above. In another example, a phosphonate reagent may be prepared by reacting a halide AlkHal with a phosphite (DO) 3 P, as described in the Arbuzov reaction. Silane derivatives may be prepared by reaction of a halosilane (D) 3 SiHal where Hal is a halogen atom, for example a chlorine atom, with a base, such as lithium diisopropylamide, in a solvent, such as an ether, for example a cyclic ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, at low temperature, e.g. 10 C. According to a further aspect of the invention, compounds of formula (1) where L is a group C(R)CH(R 1 ) and R 1 is an optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl or alkenyl group may also be prepared by reaction of an intermediate of formula (19) with an organometallic reagent, followed by dehydration of the corresponding alcohol. Examples of organometallic reagents include organolithium R 1 Li or organomagnesium R 1 MgHal reagents. The reaction with the organometallic reagent may be performed in a solvent such as an ether, e.g. diethyl ether or for example a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran, at a low temperature for example 10 C. to room temperature. The dehydration may be performed using an acid, for example an organic acid such as p.toluene sulphonic acid or trifluoracetic acid, in the presence of a base, such as an amine, e.g. triethylamine. In yet another process according to the invention, compounds of formula (1) wherein R 3 , R 6 and R 7 is each a hydrogen atom may be prepared by decarboxylation of an acid of formula (21): The reaction may be carried out by treatment of the compound of formula (21) with a base, for example an inorganic base such as a hydroxide, e.g. sodium hydroxide in a solvent such as an alcohol, e.g. ethanol, at an elevated temperature e.g. the reflux temperature, followed by acidification of the reaction mixture to a pH of around pH4 to around pH6 using an acid such as an inorganic acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, at an elevated temperature, e.g. the reflux temperature. If desired, the acid of formula (21) may be generated in situ from the corresponding ester or nitrile using the above reaction conditions, or by initial treatment with an acid. Intermediates of formula (21) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (22) where R 15 is an ester of an acid CO 2 H (e.g. an alkyl ester such as an ethyl ester) or a nitrile CN, with a Grignard reagent R 4 MgBr, in the presence of a complexing agent, e.g. a copper (I) bromide-dimethyl sulphide complex, or a copper (I) chloride, or with an organolithium compound, e.g. R 4 Li, in a solvent, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, at low temperature, e.g. around 40 C., followed by treatment with a base or an acid to yield the acid of formula (21). The Grignard and the lithium reagents are either known compounds or may be prepared in a manner similar to that used to synthesise the known compounds. Compounds of formula (22) may be obtained by reacting an adehyde of formula (12) with an ester or nitrile R 5 CH 2 R 15 in an acid solvent, such as acetic acid, at an elevated temperature, for example the reflux temperature, in the presence of a base, such as ammonium acetate. In a further process according to the invention a compound of formula (1) wherein R 3 , R 6 and R 7 is each a hydrogen atom and R 5 is a heteroaryl group may be generally prepared by cyclisation of a compound of formula (23): where R 16 is a carboxylic acid CO 2 H group or a reactive derivative thereof; or a nitrile CN or an imine salt with a bifunctional reagent W 1 R 5a W 2 and, where necessary, a compound R 5b W 3 where W 1 , W 2 and W 3 , which may be the same or different, is each a reactive functional group or a protected derivative thereof; and R 5a and R 5b are components of the heteroaryl group R 5 such that when added together with W 1 , W 2 and W 3 to the group R 16 in compounds of formula (23) the resulting group RW 1 R 5a W 2 or RW 1 R 5a W 2 R 5b W 3 constitutes the heteroaryl group R 5 . Reactive derivatives of carboxylic acids for use in this reaction include acid halides, (e.g. acid chlorides), amides, including thioamides, or esters, including thioesters. Imine salts include for example salts of formula e.g. C(OAlk)NH 2 A , where Alk is a C 1-4 alkyl group and A is a counterion e.g. a chloride ion. In this general reaction the reactive functional groups represented by W 1 , W 2 or W 3 may be any suitable carbon, nitrogen, sulphur or oxygen nucleophiles. Particular examples include simple nucleophiles such as carbanions e.g. generated by the coupling of an alkyl group with an organometallic compound, amino, thiol and hydroxyl groups. In general, the cyclisation reaction will initially be performed in a solvent, for example an inert solvent such as a halocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane, an ether, e.g. a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran, or a hydrocarbon, e.g. an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene, from a low temperature, e.g. around 70 C., to around the reflux temperature, where necessary in the presence of a base or a thiation reagent, e.g. Lawessons reagent, followed if necessary by heating, to an elevated temperature, e.g. the reflux temperature. Thus, in one particular example, compounds of formula (1) wherein R 3 , R 6 and R 7 is each a hydrogen atom and R 5 is a benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl or benzimidazolyl group may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula (19) where R 16 is an acid halide, e.g. acid chloride, with a reagent W 1 R 5a W 2 which is 2-aminothiophenol, 2-hydroxyphenol, or 1,2-diaminobenzene respectively in the presence of a base e.g. an organic amine such as pyridine, in a solvent e.g. a halocarbon such as dichloromethane, from around 70 C. to the reflux temperature. In another example of the general cyclisation process, a compound of formula (23) where R 16 is an acid halide as described above may be reacted with a compound W 1 R 5a W 2 which is a monoalkylmalonate, e.g. ethyl hydrogen malonate, followed by reaction with a compound R 5b W 3 which is hydrazine to give a compound of formula (1) wherein R 3 , R 6 and R 7 is each a hydrogen atom and R 5 is a 5-hydroxypyrazolyl group. In another variation of the cyclisation process, the halide of formula (23) may be reacted with a compound W 1 R 5a W 2 which is BrMg(CH 2 ) 3 O(CH 2 ) 2 O followed by reaction in an acid solution with a compound R 5b W 3 which is methylamine to yield a compound of formula (1) wherein R 3 , R 6 and R 7 is each a hydrogen atom and R 5 is a N-methyl pyrrole group. In a further example of the cyclisation process, the acid halide of formula (23) may be reacted with a compound W 1 R 5a W 2 which is H 2 NNHCSNH 2 in an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene, at an elevated temperature, e.g. around 150 C., followed by treatment with a base, e.g. an inorganic base such as sodium bicarbonate to give a compound of formula (1) wherein R 3 , R 6 and R 7 is each a hydrogen atom and R 5 is a 1,2,4-triazolyl-5-thiolate group. Intermediate compounds of formula (23) are particularly useful and form a further aspect of the invention. Active derivatives of the acids of formula (23) and other compounds of formula (23) where R 16 is a nitrile or an imine salt may be prepared from the corresponding acids where R 16 is CO 2 H using conventional procedures for converting carboxylic acids to such compounds, for example as described in the Examples hereinafter. Acids of formula (23) where R 16 is CO 2 H may be prepared by hydrolysing a diester of formula (24) where A 1 is a C 1-4 alkyl group, e.g. an ethyl group, with a base, e.g. sodium hydroxide, in a solvent, e.g. dioxane, at an elevated temperature, e.g. the reflux temperature, followed by acidification at an elevated temperature. Diesters of formula (24) may be prepared by reacting a diester of formula (24) with an organometallic reagent, such as a Grignard reagent using the conditions described above for the preparation of alcohols of formula (1). In yet another process according to the invention, a compound of formula (1) where Z is a group (C) may be prepared by coupling a compound of formula (25), where E is a boronic acid B(OH) 2 or a tin reagent Sn(R) 3 , in which R is an alkyl group, for example a methyl group, with a reagent ZL 4 , where L 4 is a leaving group, in the presence of a complex metal catalyst. Particular leaving groups L 4 include for example halogen atoms, e.g. bromine, iodine or chlorine atoms and an alkyl sulphonate, such as trifluoromethanesulphonate. Suitable catalysts include heavy metal catalysts, for example palladium catalysts, such as tetrakis (triphenylphosphine)palladium. The reaction may be performed in an inert solvent, for example an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene or benzene, or an ether, such as dimethoxyethane or dioxane, if necessary in the presence of a base, e.g. an alkali carbonate such as sodium carbonate, at an elevated temperature, e.g. the reflux temperature. In general, the metal catalyst and reaction conditions may be selected, depending on the nature of the compound of formula (25) and/or the compound ZL 4 from a range of known alternatives for reactions of this type see for example Miyaura, N et al, Synth. Comm. (1981), 11, 513; Thompson, W. J. and Gaudino, J., J. Org. Chem, (1984), 49, 5237 and Sharp, M. J. et al, Tetrahedron Lett. (1987), 28, 5093. Intermediates ZL 4 are either known compounds or may be prepared from known starting materials by methods analogous to those used for the preparation of the known compounds. Thus, for example, where it is desired to obtain a compound ZL 4 where L 4 is a halogen atom such as bromine or chlorine atom and this compound is not readily available, such a compound may be prepared by (1) treatment of the corresponding amine with t-butyl nitrite and anhydrous CuCl 2 or CuBr 2 at elevated temperature, or (2) with t-butyl thionitrite or t-butyl thionitrate and CuCl 2 or CuBr 2 at room temperature followed by reaction with an appropriate copper (I) halide such as cuprous chloride or bromide in an aqueous acid. Intermediates of formula (25) may be prepared by halogen-metal exchange between a compound of formula (13) where Hal is a bromine atom and an organometallic agent such as n-butyl or t-butyllithium followed by reaction with a borate such as triisopropylborate or a tin reagent (R) 3 SnX, where R is as described above and X is a halogen atom, such as chlorine atom, optionally at a low temperature e.g. around 70 C., in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. According to another aspect of the invention, a compound of formula (1) where Z is a group (D) in which Z 1 is NR 12 C(O) or C(O)NR 12 may be prepared by coupling a compound of formula (26) where A is a CO 2 H or NHR 12 group, or an active derivative thereof with a compound R 12 NH(Alk) t (X) n Ar or Ar(X) n (Alk) t CO 2 H or an active derivative thereof. Active derivatives of acids of formula (26) or Ar(X) n (Alk) t CO 2 H include, for example, acid anhydrides, or acid halides, such as acid chlorides. The coupling reaction may be performed using standard conditions for reactions of this type. Thus for example, the reaction may be carried out in a solvent, for example an inert organic solvent such as an ether, e.g. a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran, an amide, e.g. a substituted amide such as dimethylformamide, or a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, at a low temperature, e.g. 30 C. to ambient temperature such as 20 C. to 0 C., optionally in the presence of a base, e.g. an organic base such as an amine, e.g. triethylamine or a cyclic amine such as N-methylmorpholine. Where an acid of formula (17) or Ar(X) n (Alk) t CO 2 H is used, the reaction may additionally be performed in the presence of a condensing agent, for example a diimide such as N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, advantageously in the presence of a triazole such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Alternatively, the acid may be reacted with a chloroformate, for example ethylchloroformate, prior to reaction with the amine. Intermediate acids of formula (26) where A is a CO 2 H group may be prepared by hydrolysis of a corresponding ester of formula (27) where Alk a is an alkyl group; by heating in the presence of a base, for example an alkali metal hydroxide such as lithium hydroxide in a solvent such as an alcohol, e.g. methanol. Intermediates of formula (26) where A is a NHR 12 group and R 12 is a hydrogen atom, may be prepared by hydrogenation of a corresponding nitro compound of formula (28) using the reagents described below for the hydrogenation of a compound of formula (1) where L is a CHC(R 1 )(R 2 ) chain to a compound of formula (1) where L is a CH 2 CH(R 1 )(R 2 ) chain. Intermediates of formula (26) where A is a NHR 12 group in which R 12 is an alkyl group may be prepared by alkylation of an intermediate of formula (26) in which R 12 is a hydrogen atom, using an alkyl halide e.g. an alkyl iodide in a solvent, such as an aromatic solvent, for example benzene. Intermediates of formulae (27) and (28) and the reagents R 12 NH(Alk) t (X) n Ar and Ar(X) n (Alk) t CO 2 H are known compounds or may be prepared from known starting materials by methods analogous to those used for the preparation of the known compounds. In yet another aspect of the invention compounds of formula (1) where Z is a group(D) in which Z 1 is a CC chain and n and t is each zero may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (29) with a reagent Ar(X) n (Alk) t L 5 (where L 5 is a leaving group) in the presence of a metal complex catalyst, and in a solvent Examples of L 5 leaving groups include halogen atoms such as bromine, iodine or chlorine atoms or alkyl triflate such as trifluoromethane sulphonate. Suitable solvents include for example an amine, for example a tertiary amine, e.g. triethylamine, a secondary amine, e.g. dimethylamine or a primary amine e.g. n-butylamine. Metal complex catalysts include palladium catalysts, such as Pd(Hal) 2 (PPh 3 ) 2 or Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 (where Hal is a halogen atom e.g. a chlorine atom) in the presence of copper (I) iodide, at a temperature from room temperature to an elevated temperature, e.g. the reflux temperature. (Comprehensive organic synthesis, vol. 3., 531-541; Trost, Fleming. Pergamon Press, 1991). Intermediates of formula (29) may be prepared by reacting a dihalide of formula (30) where Hal is a halogen atom, e.g. a bromine atom, with a base such as an organometallic base, for example an organolithium, e.g. n-butyllithium, in a solvent such as an ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or diethylether, at a temperature from around 78 C. to room temperature. Intermediates of formula (30) may be prepared by reacting an aldehyde of formula (12) (where R 4 is a hydrogen atom) with a reagent Hal 2 CP(Ar 1 ) 3 (where Hal is a halogen atom, such as a bromine atom and Ar 1 is an aryl group, such as phenyl or o-tolyl), prepared in situ from C(Hal) 4 and P(Ar 1 ) 3 in the presence of a base, such a an organometallic base, for example an organolithium, e.g. n-butyllithium). In a futher aspect of the invention, compounds of formula (1) where Z is a group (D) in which Z 1 is a NR 12 SO 2 or SO 2 NR 12 group may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula (30) where (a) W b is a NHR 12 group with a compound Ar(X) n (Alk) t SO 2 Hal where Hal is a halogen atom, e.g. a bromine or chlorine atom, if necessary in the presence of a base; or, (b) W b is a SO 2 Hal group with a compound Ar(X) n (Alk) t NHR 12 using the reagents and conditions described in (a) above. Examples of bases used in this reaction include amine, such as tertiary amine, for example triethylamine, in a solvent such as an ether, for example a cyclic ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran. Compounds Ar (X) n (Alk) t NHR 12 and compounds of formula (30) where W b is a NHR 12 group are known compounds or may be prepared using similar reagents and conditions to those used to prepare the known compounds. Compounds of formula (30) where W b is SO 2 Hal, may be prepared by reacting an intermediate halide of formula (13) with an organometallic reagent, such as an organolithium, e.g. n-butyllithium in a solvent, such as an ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, at a low temperature e.g. around 60 C. to 100 C. followed by reaction with sulphuryl chloride, in a solvent, such as an aliphatic solvent, e.g. n-hexane, at a low temperature, e.g. around 0 C. Compounds of formula (1) where L is a group CH(R 1 )(R 2 ) where R 2 is a CO 2 H group may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (31) where Hal 1 is a halogen atom, such as a chlorine or a bromine atom, with a diazoalkane CH(R 1 )N 2 to give the corresponding diazoketone derivative which is then treated with water and silver oxide or with silver benzoate and triethylamine. Intermediates of formula (31) may be prepared by oxidation of an aldehyde of formula (19), using an oxidising agent, such as permanganate or chromic acid, to give the corresponding carboxylic acid which is then reacted with a halide reagent, such as thionylchloride, phosphorous pentachloride or phosphorous pentabromide. Compounds of formula (1) may also be prepared by interconverting other compounds of formula (1). Thus, for example where Z is a group (A) in which R 3 is a hydrogen atom may be prepared by hydrogenation of a compound of formula (1) where Z is a group (B). The hydrogenation may be performed using for example hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst. Suitable catalysts include metals such as platinum or palladium optionally supported on an inert carrier such as carbon or calcium carbonate; nickel, e.g. Raney nickel, or rhodium. The reaction may be performed in a suitable solvent, for example an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, or an ester such as ethyl acetate, optionally in the presence of a base, for example a tertiary organic base such as triethylamine, at for example ambient temperature. Alternatively, the reaction may be accomplished by transfer hydrogenation using an organic hydrogen donor and a transfer agent. Suitable hydrogen donors include for example acids, such as formic acid, formates, e.g. ammonium formate, alcohols, such as benzyl alcohol or ethylene glycol, hydrazine, and cycloalkenes such as cyclohexene or cyclohexadiene. The transfer agent may be for example a transition metal, for example palladium or platinum, optionally supported on an inert carrier as discussed above, nickel, e.g. Raney nickel, ruthenium, e.g. tris (triphenylphosphine) ruthenium chloride or copper. The reaction may generally be performed at an ambient or elevated temperature, optionally in the presence of a solvent, for example an alcohol such as ethanol or an acid such as acetic acid. In a second example of an interconversion process, compounds of formula (1) where Z is a group (A) in which R 7 is an OR c group where R c is an alkyl or alkenyl group, may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (1) where Z is a group (A) in which R 7 is a OH group, with a reagent R c OH, in the presence of an acid, such as sulphuric acid. In another example of an interconversion process, compounds of formula (1) where Z is a group (A) in which R 7 is an OR c group where R c is a carboxamido or thiocarboxamido group may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula (1) where Z is a group (A) in which R 7 is a OH group, with an isocyanate R c NCO or an isothiocyanate R c NCS in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride, in a solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran. Compounds R c NCO and R c NCS are known compounds or may be prepared using the reagents and conditions used for the preparation of the known compounds. When R c NCS is not available, a compound of formula (1) where R c is a thiocarboxamido group may be prepared by interconverting a compound of formula (1) where R c is a carboxamido group using a thiation reagent, such as Lawessons reagent 2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane-2,4-di-sulphide, in an aromatic solvent, such as xylene or toluene. In a yet another example of an interconversion process, a compound of formula (1) where Z is a group (A) in which R 3 is a fluorine atom may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (1) where Z is a group (A) in which R 3 is a hydroxyl group, with a fluorinating reagent, such as diethylaminosulphur trifluoride (DAST), in a solvent, for example a chlorinated solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, at a low temperature, e.g. around 0 C. In a still further example of an interconversion process, a compound of formula (1) where Z is a group (A) in which R 3 is an alkyl group, may be prepared by alkylation of a compound of formula (1) where Z is a group (A), and R 3 is a hydrogen atom, with a reagent R 3 L 3 using a base, for example n-butyllithium or lithium diisopropylamide. In this process, R 4 in the starting material is preferably an electron withdrawing group. In a still further example of interconversion process, a compound of formula (1) where L is (X a ) n AlkAr or AlkX a Ar where Alk is an alkylene chain, may be prepared by hydrogenation of a compound of formula (1) where Alk is an alkenylene or alkynylene chain, using for example hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst, as described above for the hydrogenation of a compound of formula (1) where Z is a group (B) to give a compound of formula (1) where Z is the group A. Compounds of formula (1) where Z is the group (B) may also be prepared by dehydrating a compound of formula (1) where Z is the group (A) and R 3 is a hydroxyl group, by using an acid, e.g. trifluoroacetic acid, in the presence of a base, such as an amine, e.g. triethylamine, in a solvent, such as dichloromethane, at a low temperature, e.g. around 10 C. Where it is desired to obtain a particular enantiomer of a compound of formula (1) this may be produced from a corresponding mixture of enantiomers using any suitable conventional procedure for resolving enantiomers. Thus for example diastereomeric derivatives, e.g. salts, may be produced by reaction of a mixture of enantiomers of formula (1) e.g. a racemate, and an appropriate chiral compound, e.g. a chiral acid or base. Suitable chiral acids include, for example, tartaric acid and other tartrates such as dibenzoyl tartrates and ditoluoyl tartrates, sulphonates such as camphor sulphonates, mandelic acid and other mandelates and phosphates such as 1,1-binaphthalene-2,2-diyl hydrogen phosphate. The diastereomers may then be separated by any convenient means, for example by crystallisation and the desired enantiomer recovered, e.g. by treatment with an acid or base in the instance where the diastereomer is a salt. In another resolution process a racemate of formula (1) may be separated using chiral High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Alternatively, if desired a particular enantiomer may be obtained by using an appropriate chiral intermediate in one of the processes described above. N-oxides of compounds of formula (1) may be prepared for example by oxidation of the corresponding nitrogen base using an oxidising agent such as hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid, at an elevated temperature, for example around 70 C. to 80 C., or alternatively by reaction with a peracid such as peracetic acid in a solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, at ambient temperature. Salts of compounds of formula (1) may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula (1) with an appropriate acid or base in a suitable solvent or mixture of solvents e.g. an organic solvent such as an ether e.g. diethylether, or an alcohol, e.g. ethanol using conventional procedures.

The activity and selectivity of compounds according to the invention was demonstrated in the following tests. In these tests the abbreviation FMLP represents the peptide N-formyl-met-leu-phe. 1. Isolated Enzyme The potency and selectivity of the compounds of the invention was determined using distinct PDE isoenzymes as follows: i. PDE I, rabbit heart ii. PDE II, rabbit heart iii. PDE III, rabbit heart, Jurkat cells iv. PDE IV, HL60 cells, rabbit brain, rabbit kidney and human recombinant PDE IV v. PDE V, rabbit lung, guinea pig lung A gene encoding human PDE IV has been cloned from human monocytes (Livi, et al., 1990 , Molecular and Cellular Biology , 10, 2678). Using similar procedures we have cloned human PDE IV genes from a number of sources including eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, brain and neuronal tissues. These genes have been transfected into yeast using an inducible vector and various recombinant proteins have been expressed which have the biochemical characteristics of PDE IV (Beavo and Reifsnyder, 1990 , TIPS , 11, 150). These recombinant enzymes, particularly the human eosinophil recombinant PDE IV, have been used as the basis of a screen for potent, selective PDE IV inhibitors. The enzymes were purified to isoenzyme homogeneity using standard chromatographic techniques. Phosphodiesterase activity was assayed as follows. The reaction was conducted in 150 l of standard mixture containing (final concentrations): 50 mM 2-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino-1-ethanesulphonic acid (TES) NaOH buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 M 3 H-cAMP and vehicle or various concentrations of the test compounds. The reaction was initiated by addition of enzyme and conducted at 30 C. for between 5 to 30 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 50 l 2% trifluoroacetic acid containing 14 C-5AMP for determining recovery of the product. An aliquot of the sample was then applied to a column of neutral alumina and the 3 H-cAMP eluted with 10 ml 0.1 TES-NaOH buffer (pH8). The 3 H-5-AMP product was eluted with 2 ml 2M NaOH into a scintillation vial containing 10 ml of scintillation cocktail. Recovery of 3H-5AMP was determined using the 14 C-5AMP and all assays were conducted in the linear range of the reaction. Compounds according to the invention such as compounds of the Examples herein cause a concentration-dependent inhibition of recombinant PDE IV at 0.1-1000 nM with little or no activity against PDE I, II, III or V at concentrations up to 100 M. 2. The Elevation of cAMP in Leukocytes The effect of compounds of the invention on intracellular cAMP was investigated using human neutrophils or guinea pig eosinophils. Human neutrophils were separated from peripheral blood, incubated with dihydrocytochalasin B and the test compound for 10 min and then stimulated with FMLP. Guinea pig eosinophils were harvested by peritoneal lavage of animals previously treated with intra-peritoneal injections of human serum. Eosinophils were separated from the peritoneal exudate and incubated with isoprenaline and test compound. With both cell types, suspensions were centrifuged at the end of the incubation, the cell pellets were resuspended in buffer and boiled for 10 min prior to measurement of cAMP by specific radioimmunoassay (DuPont). The most potent compounds according to the Examples induced a concentration-dependent elevation of cAMP in neutrophils and/or eosinophils at concentrations of 0.1 nM to 1 M. 3. Suppression of Leukocyte Function Compounds of the invention were investigated for their effects on superoxide generation, chemotaxis and adhesion of neutrophils and eosinophils. Isolated leukocytes were incubated with dihydrocyto-chalasin B for superoxide generation only and test compound prior to stimulation with FMLP. The most potent compounds of the Examples caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of superoxide generation, chemotaxis and adhesion at concentrations of 0.1 nM to 1 M. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced synthesis of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) by human peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) is inhibited by compounds of the Examples at concentrations of 0.01 nM to 10 M. 4.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS Benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/134,658, filed on May 18, 1999, is hereby claimed. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compounds, compositions and methods for the treatment of diseases caused by a functional disorder resulting from overstimulation. In particular, the present invention relates to N-(5-phenyl-tetrahydrofuranyl)methyl- and N-(6-phenyl-tetrahydropyranyl)methyl-substituted 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydro-2,6-methano-3-benzazocin-10-ols, processes for preparing such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and methods for using these compounds for the treatment of diseases caused by a functional disorder resulting from overstimulation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to N-(5-phenyl-tetrahydrofuranyl)methyl- and N-(6-phenyl-tetrahydropyranyl)methyl-substituted 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydro-2,6-methano-3-benzazocin-10-ols of general formula 1: wherein R 1 is hydrogen, methyl or fluorine; R 2 is hydrogen, methyl or fluorine; n is an integer 1 or 2; R 3 is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, methyl, ethyl, hydroxy, methoxy; R 4 is hydrogen or methyl; R 5 is hydrogen or methyl; and R 6 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl. The present invention is also directed to processes for preparing such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and methods for using these compounds for the treatment of diseases caused by a functional disorder resulting from overstimulation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The preferred compounds of general formula 1 are those wherein: R 1 is hydrogen or fluorine; R 2 is hydrogen or fluorine; n is 1; R 3 is hydrogen, methyl; R 4 is hydrogen or methyl; R 5 is hydrogen or methyl; and R 6 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl. The invention relates to the compounds of formula 1, optionally in the form of the individual optical isomers, mixtures of the individual enantiomers, or racemates, and also in the form of the free bases or the corresponding acid addition salts thereof with pharmacologically acceptable acids such as, for example, acid addition salts with hydrohalic acids, e.g., hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, or organic acids such as, e.g. oxalic, fumaric or diglycolic acid or methanesulphonic acid. Biological Properties The compounds claimed are blockers of the voltage-dependent sodium channel. These are compounds which displace batrachotoxin (BTX) with a high affinity (K i 1000 nM) competitively or non-competitively from the binding site on the sodium channel. Such compounds exhibit use-dependency while the sodium channels are blocked, i.e. in order to bind the compounds at the sodium channel, the sodium channels first have to be activated. Maximum blockage of the sodium channels is only achieved after repeated stimulation of the sodium channels. Consequently, the compounds bind preferentially to sodium channels which are activated a number of times. As a result, the compounds are in a position to become effective particularly in those parts of the body which are pathologically overstimulated. The compounds of general formula 1 according to the invention can thus be used to treat diseases which are caused by a functional disorder resulting from overstimulation. These include diseases such as arrhythmias, spasms, cardiac and cerebral ischemias, pain and neurodegenerative diseases of various origins. These include, for example, epilepsy, hypoglycemia, hypoxia, anoxia, brain trauma, brain edema, cerebral stroke, perinatal asphyxia, degeneration of the cerebellum, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, Huntingtons disease, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, cyclophrenia, hypotonia, cardiac infarction, heart rhythm disorders, angina pectoris, chronic pain, neuropathic pain and local anaesthesia. The blocking action on the sodium channel may be demonstrated by the test system which tests the BTX binding to the sodium channel S. W. Postma W. A. Catterall, Mol. Pharmacol 25, 219-227 (1984) as well as by patch-clamp experiments which show that the compounds according to the invention block the electrically stimulated sodium channel in a use-dependent manner W. A. Catterall, Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 8, 57-65 (1987). By a suitable choice of cell system (e.g. neuronal, cardiac, DRG cells) it is possible to test the effect of the substances on different subtypes of sodium channel. The sodium channel blocking property of the compounds according to the invention can be demonstrated by the blocking of the veratridine-induced release of glutamate S. Villanueva, P. Frenz, Y. Dragnic, F. Orrego, Brain Res. 461, 377-380 (1988). Veratridine is a toxin which opens the sodium channel permanently. This leads to an increased influx of sodium ions into the cell. By means of the cascade described above, this sodium influx leads to increased release of glutamate in the neuronal tissue. The compounds according to the invention antagonize this release of glutamate. The anticonvulsant properties of the substances according to the invention were demonstrated by their protective effect against convulsions triggered by a maximum electric shock in mice M. A. Rogawski R. J. Porter, Pharmacol. Rev. 42, 223-286 (1990). Neuroprotective properties were demonstrated by a protective effect in a rat MCAO model U. Pschorn A. J. Carter, J. Stroke Cerebrovascular Diseases, 6, 93-99 (1996) and a malonate-induced lesion model M. F. Beal, Annals of Neurology, 38, 357-366 (1995) and J. B. Schulz, R. T. Matthews, D. R. Henshaw and M. F. Beal, Neuroscience, 71, 1043-1048 (1996). Analgesic effects can be investigated in models of diabetic neuropathy and in a ligature model C. Courteix, M. Bardin, C. Chantelauze, J. Lavarenne, A. Eschalier, Pain 57, 153-160 (1994); C. Courteix, A. Eschalier, J. Lavarenne, Pain 53, 81-88 (1993); G. J. Bennett and Y.-K. Xie, Pain 33, 87-107 (1988). It has also been reported that sodium channel blockers can be used to treat cyclophrenia (manic depressive disorder) J. R. Calabrese, C. Bowden, M. J. Woyshville; in: Psychopharmacology: The Fourth Generation of Progress (Eds.: D. E. Bloom and D. J. Kupfer) 1099-1111. New York: Raven Press Ltd.. Preparation Methods The compounds of formula 1 of the invention may be prepared by methods known per se from the prior art. One possible method of synthesis is shown in Diagram 1. The methods of synthesizing the nor-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydro-2,6-methano-3-benzazocin-10-ols 2 needed as starting compounds are described in published German applications 41 21 821, 195 28 472 and 197 40 110. The synthesis component 3 contains a leaving group X which is preferably iodine, bromine or a methanesulphonate group. The synthesis of the 5-phenyl-tetrahydrofuranyl)methyl-iodide is described in the literature K. Miura, T. Hondo, S. Okajima, A. Hosomi, Tetrahedron Lett. 37 (1996) 487-490 for the racemate. The enantiomerically pure compounds may be prepared analogously, following this same procedure, if the corresponding chiral 5-hydroxy-5-phenyl-pentene is used as starting compound cf. D. Seebach, R. E. Marti, T. Hintermann; Helv. Chim. Acta, 79 (1996) 1710-1740.The corresponding bromides are prepared analogously if bromine is used instead of iodine. The methanesulphonates of the 6-phenyl-tetrahydropyran-2-yl-methanols and 5-phenyl-tetrahydrofuran-2-yl-methanols may be prepared from the corresponding alcohols. The synthesis of 6-phenyl-tetrahydropyran-2-yl-methanol and 5-phenyl-tetrahydrofuran-2-yl-methanol is described in the literature T. Mandai, M. Ueda, K. Kashiwagi, M. Kawada, J. Tsuji, Tetrahedron Lett., 34 (1993) 111-114; S. Inoki, T. Mukaiyama, Chemistry Lett. 1990, 67-70. EXAMPLES Example 1 (2R, 5S)- and (2S, 5S)-5-Phenyl-tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methyl-bromide 1.6 g (10 mmol) of(5S)-5-hydroxy-5-phenyl-pentene are dissolved in 16 mL of dichloromethane and at 10 to 15 C. 1.6 g of bromine in 16 mL dichloromethane is added. The mixture is left to return to ambient temperature and 2 g of Na 2 CO 3 (sodium carbonate) and 0.1 g of tetrabutyl ammoniumsulphate are added.

The residue is chromatographed on 400 g of silica gel (cyclohexane/ethyl acetate: 95:5). 0.6 g (25% of theory) of (2S, 5S)-5-phenyl-tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methyl-bromide and 0.7 g (29% of theory) of (2R, 5S)-5-phenyl-tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methyl-bromide are obtained. Example 2 (5-Phenyl-tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methyl (2S, 5S)-methanesulphonate 580 mg (3.3 mmol) of (2S, 5S)-5-phenyl-tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methanol are dissolved in 4 mL of pyridine and combined with 390 mg (3.4 mmol) of methanesulphonic acid chloride and stirred for 1 h at 0 C. and then for 8 h at ambient temperature. Next, 30 mL of water and 30 mL of 2 N hydrochloric acid are added. The mixture is extracted three times with 20 mL of diethylether, the ethereal phase is washed once with 50 mL of 10% Na 2 CO 3 solution, dried, and the solvent is eliminated in vacuo. The residue is chromatographed over 20 g of silica gel (cyclohexane/ethyl acetate: 1:1). 450 mg (53% of theory) of the title compound are obtained as an oil.

When synthesised, these compounds are often in salt form, typically the hydrochloride or trifluoroacetate, and such salts also form part of this invention. Such salts may be used in preparing pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The compounds and their salts may be obtained as solvates, such as hydrates, and these also form part of this invention. The above-listed compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, especially the hydrochloride, and pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, especially hydrates, form a preferred aspect of the present invention. The administration of such compounds to a mammal may be by way of oral, parenteral, sub-lingual, nasal, rectal, topical or transdermal administration. An amount effective to treat the disorders hereinbefore described depends on the usual factors such as the nature and severity of the disorders being treated and the weight of the mammal. However, a unit dose will normally contain 1 to 1000 mg, suitably 1 to 500 mg, for example an amount in the range of from 2 to 400 mg such as 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg of the active compound. Unit doses will normally be administered once or more than once per day, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times a day, more usually 1 to 4 times a day, such that the total daily dose is normally in the range, for a 70 kg adult of 1 to 1000 mg, for example 1 to 500 mg, that is in the range of approximately 0.01 to 15 mg/kg/day, more usually 0.1 to 6 mg/kg/day, for example 1 to 6 mg/kg/day. It is greatly preferred that the compound of formula (I) is administered in the form of a unit-dose composition, such as a unit dose oral, including sub-lingual, nasal, rectal, topical or parenteral (especially intravenous) composition. Such compositions are prepared by admixture and are suitably adapted for oral or parenteral administration, and as such may be in the form of tablets, capsules, oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, reconstitutable powders, injectable and infusable solutions or suspensions or suppositories. Orally administrable compositions are preferred, in particular shaped oral compositions, since they are more convenient for general use. Tablets and capsules for oral administration are usually presented in a unit dose, and contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, diluents, tabletting agents, lubricants, disintegrants, colourants, flavourings, and wetting agents. The tablets may be coated according to well known methods in the art. Suitable fillers for use include cellulose, mannitol, lactose and other similar agents. Suitable disintegrants include starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone and starch derivatives such as sodium starch glycollate. Suitable lubricants include, for example, magnesium stearate. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents include sodium lauryl sulphate. These solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling, tabletting or the like. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers. Such operations are, of course, conventional in the art. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, alumninium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats, emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example, almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as esters of glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents. Oral formulations also include conventional sustained release formulations, such as tablets or granules having an enteric coating. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dose forms are prepared containing the compound and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and the concentration, can be either suspended or dissolved. Parenteral solutions are normally prepared by dissolving the compound in a vehicle and filter sterilising before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents are also dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle.

Another aspect of the invention provides a process for the preparation of compounds of formula (I), which comprises reacting a compound of formula (II) where R 1A is R 1 as defined for formula (I) or a group convertible to R 1 with a compound of formula (III) where Y is Cl or OH, and R 2A is R 2 as defined for formula (I) or a group or groups convertible to R 2 , and where required converting a R 1A or R 2A group to a R 1 or R 2 group, converting one X, R 1 or R 2 group to another X, R 1 or R 2 group, converting a salt product to the free base or another pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or converting a free base product to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Reaction of a compound of formula (HII) which is a benzoyl chloride derivative (YCl) will lead directly to the hydrochloride salt. Suitable solvents include tetrahydrofuran and ethyl acetate. When the compound of formula (III) is a benzoic acid derivative (YOH), conventional conditions for condensation of aromatic acids with amines may be used, for example reacting the components in a mixture of (dimethylaminopropyl)-ethyl-carbodiimide/hydroxybenzotriazole in a suitable solvent, such as dimethyl formamide. Conversions of an R 1A or R 2A group to a R 1 or R 2 group typically arise when a protecting group is needed during the above coupling reaction or during the preparation of the reactants by the procedures described below. Interconversion of one X, R 1 or R 2 group to another typically arises when one compound of formula (I) is used as the immediate precursor of another compound of formula (I), or when it is easier to introduce a more complex or reactive substituent at the end of a synthetic sequence. Compounds of formula (II) may be prepared starting from a compound of formula (IV), that is a dinitro-1-methyl-2-pyridone by reaction with a compound of formula (V) in a solution of ammonia in a suitable solvent such as methanol, to obtain a compound of formula (VI) using a procedure similar to that of S. Takada et al, J. Med. Chem, 1996, 39, 2844. Compounds of formula (VI) may be converted to compounds of formula (II) wherein X is hydrogen by hydrogenation or reduction of the nitro group. For example, a compound of formula (VI) may be hydrogenated by treatment with hydrogen in a suitable solvent such as methanol in the presence of a palladium/carbon catalyst. Alternatively, a compound of formula (VI) may be reduced with stannous chloride in concentrated hydrochloric acid in a suitable solvent such as ethanol. Compounds of formula (IV) may be prepared using the procedure of E. Matsumura, M. Ariga and Y. Tohda, Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 52 (8), 2413-2419 (1979). Compounds of formula (II) wherein X is hydrogen can be converted to compounds wherein X is other using methods known in the art and described hereinbelow in the Descriptions. Compounds of formula (III) may be prepared by further substitution of commercially available benzoic acid derivatives using conventional procedures, or by oxidation of corresponding substituted benzyl alcohols. Alternatively benzoic acids can be prepared from correpondingly substituted phenols, for example by formation of the acetate, coversion to an acetophenone and then to the desired acid. The preparation of compounds of formula (II) is illustrated by the following Descriptions; the preparation of compounds of formula (III) is illustrated by the following Preparations; the preparation of compounds of this invention is illustrated by the following Examples. The utility of compounds of this invention is shown by the Pharmacological Data that follow the Examples.

Biological Data All the compounds showed in vitro binding affinity in this test with pKis in the range 6-9. Examples 1, 3, 10, 11, 12, 20, 28, 30, 33 and 36 had a pKi8.0. Binding Assay Method WO 92/22293 (SmithKline Beecham) discloses compounds having anti-convulsant activity, including inter alia the compound trans-()-6-acetyl-4S-(4-fluorobenzoylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-3R-ol (herein referred to as Compound A). It has been found that the compounds of WO 92/22293 bind to a novel receptor obtainable from rat forebrain tissue, as described in WO 96/18650 (SmithKline Beecham). The affinity of test compounds to the novel receptor site is assessed as follows. Method Whole forebrain tissue is obtained from rats. The tissue is first homogenised in buffer (usually 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4). The homogenised tissue is washed by centrifugation and resuspension in the same buffer, then stored at 70 C. until used. To carry out the radioligand binding assay, aliquots of tissue prepared as above (usually at a concentration of 1-2 mg protein/ml) are mixed with aliquots of 3H-Compound A dissolved in buffer. The final concentration of 3H-Compound A in the mixture is usually 20 nM. The mixture is incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. 3H-Compound A bound to the tissue is then separated from unbound 3H-Compound A by filtration through Whatman GF/B glass fibre filters. The filters are then washed rapidly with ice-cold buffer. The amount of radioactivity bound to the tissue trapped on the filters is measured by addition of liquid scintillation cocktail to the filters followed by counting in a liquid scintillation counter. In order to determine the amount of specific binding of 3H-Compound A, parallel assays are carried out as above in which 3H-Compound A and tissue are incubated together in the presence of unlabelled Compound A (usually 3 M). The amount of binding of 3H-Compound A remaining in the presence of this unlabelled compound is defined as non-specific binding. This amount is subtracted from the total amount of 3H-Compound A binding (i.e. that present in the absence of unlabelled compound) to obtain the amount of specific binding of 3H-Compound A to the novel site. The affinity of the binding of test compounds to the novel site can be estimated by incubating together 3H-Compound A and tissue in the presence of a range of concentrations of the compound to be tested. The decrease in the level of specific 3HCompound A binding as a result of competition by increasing concentrations of the compound under test is plotted graphically, and non-linear regression analysis of the resultant curve is used to provide an estimate of compound affinity in terms of pKi value. MEST Test The maximal electroshock seizure (MEST) threshold test in rodents is particularly sensitive for detecting potential anticonvulsant properties 1 . In this model, anticonvulsant agents elevate the threshold to electrically-induced seizures whilst proconvulsants lower the seizure threshold. Method Mice (naive male, Charles River, U.K. CD-1 strain, 25-30 g) are randomly assigned to groups of 10-20 and dosed orally or intraperitoneally at a dose volume of 10 ml/kg with various doses of compound (0.3-300 mg/kg) or vehicle. Mice are then subjected at 30 or 60 min post dose to a single electroshock (0.1 sec, 50 Hz, sine wave form) administered via corneal electrodes. The mean current and standard error required to induce a tonic seizure in 50% (CC 50 ) of the mice in a particular treatment group is determined by the up and down method of Dixon and Mood (1948) 2 . Statistical comparisons between vehicle- and drug-treated groups are made using the method of Litchfield and Wilcoxon (1949) 3 . In control animals the CC 50 is usually 14-18 mA. Hence the first animal in the control group is subjected to a current of 16 mA. If a tonic seizure does not ensue, the current is increased for a subsequent mouse. If a tonic convulsion does occur, then the current is decreased, and so on until all the animals in the group have been tested. The percentage increase or decrease in CC 50 for each group compared to the control is calculated. Studies are carried out using a Hugo Sachs Electronik Constant Current Shock Generator with totally variable control of shock level from 0 to 300 mA and steps of 2 mA are usually used. Drugs are suspended in 1% methyl cellulose. REFERENCES 1. Loscher, W. and Schmidt, D. (1988). Epilepsy Res., 2, 145-181 2. Dixon, W. J. and Mood, A. M. (1948). J. Amer. Stat. Assn., 43, 109-126 3.

This application is the national phase of PCT/JP98/03045 filed on Jul. 7, 1998. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel naphthyridine derivatives. BACKGROUND ART Our research group focused on compounds having a naphthyridine skeleton and continued intensive research thereon to develop compounds having excellent pharmacological effects. As a result, we found novel compounds having anti-inflammatory activity, anti allergic activity, immune regulating activity, analgesic activity and the like (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 304775/1995). The novel compounds have potent anti-inflammatory effects but their alagesic effects are not completely satisfactory. An object of the invention is to provide novel naphthyridine derivatives having potent analgesic effects. We synthesized compounds in which the substituents at 1-position of the naphthyridine ring varied and carried out pharmacological screening of the same. Consequently we found a group of novel compounds having highly potent analgesic activity as compared with conventional compounds, and accomplished the present invention.

Stated more specifically, (1) 3.5 g of sodium carbonate was dissolved in 200 ml of water. Then dissolved in this aqueous solution was 5.1 g of 4-hydroxy-1,8-naphthyridin-2(1H)-one. Further 10.1 g of iodobenzene diacetate was added thereto at room temperature, followed by stirring at room temperature for 2 hours. After completion of the reaction, the crystals precipitated were collected by filtration, washed sequentially with water, methanol and diethyl ether and dried under reduced pressure at room temperature for 20 hours to give 10.6 g of 3-(phenyliodonium)-1,8-naphthyridin-2(1H)-on-4-olate as crystals. mp: 268-271 C. (decomposition). (2) 10.6 g of the crystals obtained above, 3.1 g of methyl-n-propylsulfide and 200 mg of p-toluenesulfonic acid were dissolved in 50 ml of trifluoroethanol, and the solution was stirred at 50 C. for 30 minutes. After completion of the reaction, trifluoroethanol was distilled off under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluent; methanol:chloroform1:10). The crystals obtained were washed with diethyl ether-n-hexane to provide 6.9 g of 3-(methyl-n-propylsulfonium)-1,8-naphthyridin-2(1H)-on-4-olate as crystals. mp: 172-174 C. 1 H-NMR (:ppm) (measured in DMSO-d 6 solvent); 1.04 (3H, t, J7.4), 1.51-1.80(2H, m), 3.17(3H, s), 3.29-3.41(1H, m), 3.99-4.09(1H, m), 7.17(1H, dd, J4.9, 7.9), 8.24(1H, d, J7.9), 8.51(1H, d, J4.9), 10.97(1H, brs). Then 250 mg of 60% sodium hydride was dissolved in 20 ml of DMF and 1.3 g of the crystals obtained above was added to the solution at 0 C., followed by stirring at 0 C. for 10 minutes. Further 1.2 g of 2-chlorobenzylbromide was added, followed by stirring at room temperature for 1 hour. After completion of the reaction, water was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was extracted with 30 ml of chloroform three times. The chloroform layers were combined, washed with water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluent; methanol:chloroform1:30) and the crystals obtained were washed with diethyl ether-n-hexane to provide 0.77 g of the title compound as crystals. Table 1 shows the structure and physical properties of the compound obtained. EXAMPLES 31-35 The compounds shown in Table 1 were prepared following the procedure of Example 30. EXAMPLE 36 Preparation of 1-benzyl-4-hydroxy-3-phenylthio-1,8-naphthyridin-2(1H)-one 2.5 g of the compound obtained in Example 29 and 200 mg of p-toluene sulfonic acid were dissolved in 50 ml of methanol, and the solution was refluxed for 2 hours. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the crude crystals obtained were washed with diethyl ether to give 1.43 g of the title compound as crystals. Table 1 shows the structure and physical properties of the compound obtained. EXAMPLES 37-38 The compounds shown in Table 1 were prepared following the procedure of Example 36. TABLE 1 m.p.

Pharmacological Test Example 1 Using 6-week-old male S.D. rats (7 rats in each group), the pain threshold of each rats left hind paw plantar was measured using an Analgesy-meter (product of Unicom) in accordance with the Randall-Sellitto method Randall, L. O. and Sellitto, J. J., Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn., 111, 409 (1957). The values thus obtained was termed pre-value. One hour after the measurement of the pre-value, a 5% gum arabic suspension containing the active ingredient compound of the invention was orally administered to the rats of the test group in an amount of 10 ml/kg (so that the dosage of the active ingredient was 10 mg/kg), whereas a 5% gum arabic suspension (not containing the active ingredient compound of the invention) was orally administered to the rats of the control group in an amount of 10 ml/kg. One hour later, a physiological saline solution containing substance P (25 ng/0.1 ml) was subcutaneously injected into the left hind paw plantar of each rat. The pain threshold of each rats left hind paw was measured in the same manner as above at predetermined time intervals from the substance P injection (the time is shown in Table 4). The measured value is termed post-value. The recovery rate(%) of the pain threshold was calculated from the post-values and pre-values of the test group and control group, by means of the following formula: Recovery Rate of Pain Threshold In the formula, Tb is test group average post value, Cb is control group average post-value and Ca is control group average pre-value. Table 4 shows the results (the highest recovery rate).

An incision of about 3 cm in length was made in the animals skin along the hipbone of the left hind paw to detach the musculus biceps femoris along the fascia and to expose about 1.5 cm of the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve was loosely ligated at four points with about 1 mm spacing from the distal end. The incision was closed with sutures. Two weeks after the surgery, the pain threshold of the injured paw and the normal paw of each rat were measured with an Analgesy-meter (product of Muromachi Kikai K. K.) in accordance with the Randall-Sellitto method Randall, L. O. and Sellitto, J. J., Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn., 111, 409 (1957). Lowered pain threshold was confirmed. On the following day to day 7, the rats of the test group were orally given a 5% gum arabic suspension containing the active ingredient compound of the invention in an amount of 10 ml/kg once a day (the administered dosage of the active ingredient compound of the invention is shown in Table 5), whereas the rats of the control group were likewise given a 5% gum arabic suspension (not containing the active ingredient compound of the invention). Three hours after the day 7 administration, the pain threshold of the injured paw and the normal paw of each rat were measured in the same manner as above. The recovery rate(%) of the pain threshold was calculated from the measured values of the test group and control group, by means of the following formula: Recovery Rate of Pain Threshold In the formula, Tb is test group injured paw average value, Cb is control group injured paw average value and Ca is control group normal paw average value.

CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPIICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/155,207, which was converted from U.S. application Ser. No. 09/298,041, filed Apr. 22, 1999. FIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates to compounds which are useful for the treatment of diseases affected by disorders of the serotonin-affected neurological systems, such as depression and anxiety. More specifically, the present invention is directed to dihydroiosoquinolinyl-indole derivatives useful in the treatment of such disorders. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Pharmaceuticals which enhance neurotransmission of serotonin (5-HT) are useful for the treatment of many psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety. The first generation of non-selective serotonin-affecting drugs operated through a variety of physiological functions which caused them to possess numerous undesired side-effects. The more recently prescribed drugs, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), act predominately by inhibiting 5-HT, which is released at the synapses, from being actively removed from the synaptic cleft via a presynaptic serotonin transport carrier. Since SSRIs require several weeks before they exert their full therapeutic effect, this 5-HT blockade mechanism cannot fully account for their therapeutic activity. It is speculated that this two week induction, which occurs before a full antidepressant effect is observed, is due to the involvement of the 5HT1 A autoreceptors which suppress the firing activity of 5-HT neurons, causing a dampening of the therapeutic effect. Studies suggest that after several weeks of SSRI administration, a desensitization of the 5-HT autoreceptors occurs allowing a full antidepressant effect in most patients (see, e.g., LePaul et al., Arch. Pharmacol ., 352:141 (1995)). Hence, it is believed that overriding this negative feedback by using 5 HT1A antagonists would potentially increase and accelerate the clinical antidepressant response. Recent studies by Artigas et al., Trends Neurosci ., 19:378-383 (1996) suggested a combination of 5-HT1A activity and inhibition of 5-HT uptake within a single molecular entity can achieve a more robust and fast-acting antidepressant effect. The present invention relates to a new class of molecules which have the ability to act at the 5-HT1A autoreceptors and concommitantly with the 5-HT transporter. Such compounds are therefore potentially useful for the treatment of depression as well as other serotonin disorders. U.S. Pat.

The activity of the present compounds is demonstrated by the following standard pharmacological test procedures. The PCR cloning of the human 5-HT 1A receptor subtype from a human genomic library has been described previously by Chanda et al., Mol. Pharmacol ., 43:516 (1993). A stable Chinese hamster ovary cell line expressing the human 5-HT 1A receptor subtype (5-HT 1A .CHO cells) was employed throughout this study. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, non-essential amino acids and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown to 95-100% confluency as a monolayer before membranes were harvested for binding studies. Cells were gently scraped from the culture plates, transferred to centrifuge tubes, and washed twice by centrifugation (2000 rpm for 10 min., 4 C.) in buffer (50 mM Tris; pH 7.5). The resulting pellets were aliquoted and maintained at 80 C. On the day of assay, the cells were thawed on ice, and resuspended in buffer. Studies were conducted using 3 H8-OH-DPAT as the radioligand. The binding assay was performed in 96 well microtiter plates in a final total volume of 250 L of buffer. Comparison experiments were performed by using 7 concentrations of unlabelled drug and a final ligand concentration of 1.5 nM. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 M 5HT. Saturation analysis was conducted by using 3 H8-OH-DPAT at concentrations ranging from 0.3-30 nM. Following a 30 minute incubation at room temperature, the reaction was terminated by the addition of ice cold buffer and rapid filtration using a M-96 Brandel Cell Harvester (Gaithersburg, Md.) through a GF/B filter presoaked for 30 minutes in 0.5% polyethyleneimine. A protocol similar to that used by Cheetham et al., Neuropharmacol ., 32:737 (1993) was used to determine the affinity of compounds for the serotonin transporter. Briefly, frontal cortical membranes prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats were incubated with 3 H-parsoxetinc (0.1 nM) for 60 min at 25 C. All tubes also contained either vehicle, test compound (one to eight concentrations), or a saturating concentration of fluoxetine (10 M) to define specific binding. All reactions were terminated by the addition of ice cold Tris buffer followed by rapid filtration using a Tom Tech filtration device to separate bound from free 3 H-paroxetine. Bound radioactivity was quantitated using a Wallac 1205 Beta Plate counter. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine IC 50 values which were converted to Ki values using the method set forth in Cheng and Prusoff, Biochem. Pharmacol ., 22:3099 (1973) (KiIC50/((Radioligand conc.)/(1KD)). The 35 S-GTPS binding assay was similar to that used by Lazareno and Birdsall, Br. J. Pharmacol . 109:1120 (1993). Briefly, 5-HT 1A cloned receptor membrane fragments (as used for 5-HT 1A receptor binding assays) were stored at 70 C. When needed, membranes were rapidly thawed, centrifuged at 40,000g for 10 minutes and resuspended at 4 C. for 10 minutes in assay buffer (25 mM HEPES, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 uM GDP, 500 mM DTT, pH 8.0). These membranes were then incubated for 30 min at 30 C. with 35 SGTPgS (1 nM) in the presence of vehicle, test compound (one to eight concentrations), or excess 8-OH-DPAT to define maximum agronist response. All reactions were terminated by the addition of ice cold Tris buffer followed by rapid filtration using a Tom Tech filtration device to separate bound from free 35 SGTPgS. Agonists produced an increase in the amount of 35 SGTPgS bound whereas antagonists produced no increase in binding. Bound radioactivity was counted and analyzed as above. The following assays were performed by incubating the cells with DMEM containing 25 mM HEPES, 5 mM theophylline and 10 M pargyline for a period of 20 minutes at 37 C. Functional activity was assessed by treating the cells with forskolin (1 uM final concentration) followed immediately by test Compound (6 concentrations) for an additional 10 min at 37 C. In separate experiments, 6 concentrations of antagonist were preincubated for 20 min prior to the addition of 10 nM 8-OH-DPAT and forskolin. The reaction was terminated by removal of the media and addition of 0.5 ml ice cold assay buffer. Plates were stored at 20 C. prior to assessment of cAMP formation by a cAMP SPA assay (Amersham).

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to novel compounds having retinoid-like biological activity. More specifically, the present invention relates to amides formed between aryl or heteraryl amines and aryl or heteroaryl carboxylic acids where one of the aromatic or heteroaromatic moieties bears an electron withdrawing substituent. The compounds have retinoid-like biological activity. 2. Background Art Compounds which have retinoid-like activity are well known in the art, and are described in numerous United States and other patents and in scientific publications. It is generally known and accepted in the art that retinoid-like activity is useful for treating animals of the mammalian species, including humans, for curing or alleviating the symptoms and conditions of numerous diseases and conditions. In other words, it is generally accepted in the art that pharmaceutical compositions having a retinoid-like compound or compounds as the active ingredient are useful as regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation, and particularly as agents for treating skin-related diseases, including, actinic keratoses, arsenic keratoses, inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne, psoriasis, ichthyoses and other keratinization and hyperproliferative disorders of the skin, eczema, atopic dermatitis, Darriers disease, lichen planus, prevention and reversal of glucocorticoid damage (steroid atrophy), as a topical anti-microbial, as skin anti-pigmentation agents and to treat and reverse the effects of age and photo damage to the skin. Retinoid compounds are also useful for the prevention and treatment of cancerous and precancerous conditions, including, premalignant and malignant hyperproliferative diseases such as cancers of the breast, skin, prostate, cervix, uterus, colon, bladder, esophagus, stomach, lung, larynx, oral cavity, blood and lymphatic system, metaplasias, dysplasias, neoplasias, leukoplakias and papillomas of the mucous membranes and in the treatment of Kaposis sarcoma. In addition, retinoid compounds can be used as agents to treat diseases of the eye, including, without limitation, proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), retinal detachment, dry eye and other corneopathies, as well as in the treatment and prevention of various cardiovascular diseases, including, without limitation, diseases associated with lipid metabolism such as dyslipidemias, prevention of post-angioplasty restenosis and as an agent to increase the level of circulating tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). Other uses for retinoid compounds include the prevention and treatment of conditions and diseases associated with human papilloma virus (HPV), including warts and genital warts, various inflammatory diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, ileitis, colitis and Krohns disease, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease and stroke, improper pituitary function, including insufficient production of growth hormone, modulation of apoptosis, including both the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of T-Cell activated apoptosis, restoration of hair growth, including combination therapies with the present compounds and other agents such as Minoxidil R , diseases associated with the immune system, including use of the present compounds as immunosuppressants and immunostimulants, modulation of organ transplant rejection and facilitation of wound healing, including modulation of chelosis. U.S. Pat. No. 4,723,028 (Shudo), Published European Patent Application Nos. 0 170 105 (Shudo), German Patent Application No. DE 3524199 A1 (Shudo), PCT WO 91/16051 (Spada et al.), PCT WO 85/04652 (Polus) and J. Med Chem. 1988 31, 2182-2192 (Kagechika et al.), describe or relate to aryl and heteroary or diary substituted olephines or amides having retinoid-like or related biological activity. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,992,468, 5,013,744, 5,068,252, 5,175,185, 5,202,471, 5,264,456, 5,324,840, 5,326,898, 5,349,105, 5,391,753, 5,414,007 and 5,434,173 (assigned to the same assignee as the present application) and patents and publications cited therein, describe or relate to compounds which have retinoid-like biological activity and a structure wherein a phenyl and a heteroaryl or a phenyl and a second phenyl group is linked with an olephinic or acetylenic linkage. Still further, several co-pending applications and recently issued patents which are assigned to the assignee of the present application, are directed to further compounds having retinoid-like activity. It is now general knowledge in the art that two main types of retinoid receptors exist in mammals (and other organisms). The two main types or families of receptors are respectively designated RARs and RXRs. Within each type there are subtypes; in the RAR family the subtypes are designated RAR , RAR and RAR , in RXR the subtypes are: RXR , RXB and RXR . It has also been established in the art that the distribution of the two main retinoid receptor types, and of the several sub-types is not uniform in the various tissues and organs of mammalian organisms. Accordingly, among compounds capable of binding to retinoid receptors, specificity or selectivity for one of the main types or families, and even specificity or selectivity for one or more subtypes within a family of receptors, is considered a desirable pharmacological property. The present invention provides compounds having retinoid-like biological activity and specifically compounds which bind to one or more RAR retinoid receptor subtypes.

General Embodiments Definitions The term alkyl refers to and covers any and all groups which are known as normal alkyl, branched-chain alkyl and cycloalkyl. The term alkenyl refers to and covers normal alkenyl, branch chain alkenyl and cycloalkenyl groups having one or more sites of unsaturation. Similarly, the term alkynyl refers to and covers normal alkynyl, and branch chain alkynyl groups having one or more triple bonds. Lower alkyl means the above-defined broad definition of alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbons in case of normal lower alkyl, and as applicable 3 to 6 carbons for lower branch chained and cycloalkyl groups. Lower alkenyl is defined similarly having 2 to 6 carbons for normal lower alkenyl groups, and 3 to 6 carbons for branch chained and cyclo-lower alkenyl groups. Lower alkynyl is also defined similarly, having 2 to 6 carbons for normal lower alkynyl groups, and 4 to 6 carbons for branch chained lower alkynyl groups. The term ester as used here refers to and covers any compound falling within the definition of that term as classically used in organic chemistry. It includes organic and inorganic esters. Where B of Formula 1 is COOH, this term covers the products derived from treatment of this function with alcohols or thioalcohols preferably with aliphatic alcohols having 1-6 carbons. Where the ester is derived from compounds where B is CH 2 OH, this term covers compounds derived from organic acids capable of forming esters including phosphorous based and sulfur based acids, or compounds of the formula CH 2 OCOR 11 where R 11 is any substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic, aromatic, heteroaromatic or aliphatic aromatic group, preferably with 1-6 carbons in the aliphatic portions. Unless stated otherwise in this application, preferred esters are derived from the saturated aliphatic alcohols or acids of ten or fewer carbon atoms or the cyclic or saturated aliphatic cyclic alcohols and acids of 5 to 10 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred aliphatic esters are those derived from lower alkyl acids and alcohols. Also preferred are the phenyl or lower alkyl phenyl esters. Amides has the meaning classically accorded that term in organic chemistry. In this instance it includes the unsubstituted amides and all aliphatic and aromatic mono- and di-substituted amides. Unless stated otherwise in this application, preferred amides are the mono- and di-substituted amides derived from the saturated aliphatic radicals of ten or fewer carbon atoms or the cyclic or saturated aliphatic-cyclic radicals of 5 to 10 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred amides are those derived from substituted and unsubstituted lower alkyl amines. Also preferred are mono- and disubstituted amides derived from the substituted and unsubstituted phenyl or lower alkylphenyl amines. Unsubstituted amides are also preferred. Acetals and ketals include the radicals of the formula-CK where K is (OR) 2 . Here, R is lower alkyl. Also, K may be OR 7 O where R 7 is lower alkyl of 2-5 carbon atoms, straight chain or branched. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared for any compounds in this invention having a functionality capable of forming such-salt, for example an acid functionality. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt is any salt which retains the activity of the parent compound and does not impart any deleterious or untoward effect on the subject to which it is administered and in the context in which it is administered. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be derived from organic or inorganic bases. The salt may be a mono or polyvalent ion. Of particular interest are the inorganic ions, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. organic salts may by be made with amines, particularly ammonium salts such as mono-, di- and trialkyl amines or ethanol amines. Salts may also be formed with caffeine, tromethamine and similar molecules. Where there is a nitrogen sufficiently basic as to be capable of forming acid addition salts, such may be formed with any inorganic or organic acids or alkylating agent such as methyl iodide. Preferred salts are those formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid. Any of a number of simple organic acids such as mono-, di- or tri-acid may also be used. Some of the compounds of the present invention may have trans and cis (E and Z) isomers. In addition, the compounds of the present invention may contain one or more chiral centers and therefore may exist in enantiomeric and diastereomeric forms. The scope of the present invention is intended to cover all such isomers per se, as well as mixtures of cis and trans isomers, mixtures of diastereomers and racemic mixtures of enantiomers (optical isomers) as well. With reference to the symbol X in Formula 1, compounds are equally preferred where X is CH or N. When X is CH then the benzene ring is preferably 1, 3, 5 substituted with the L group occupying the 1 position and the W and/or R 1 groups occupying the 3 and 5 positions. When the symbol X is N, then the pyridine ring is preferably 2,4,6 substituted with the L group occupying the 4 position and the W and/or R 1 groups occupying the 2 and 6 positions. The L group of Formula 1 is preferably (CZ)NH, and Z is preferably O. In other words, those carbamoyl or amide compounds are preferred in accordance with the present invention where the NH-moiety is attached to the Y group. Referring now to the W group in Formula 1, this group is, generally speaking, an electron withdrawing group. W is present in the compounds of the invention either in the phenyl or pyridyl ring (shown in Formula 1 as substituent (W) p ) and/or as a substituent of the aryl or heteroaryl group Y. Preferably, the W group is present in the Y group, or both in the Y group and in the phenyl or pyridyl ring discussed above. In the aryl or heteroaryl Y moiety the W group is preferably located in the position adjacent to the A-B group; preferably the A-B group is in para position in the phenyl ring relative to the L (amide or carbamoyl) moiety, and therefore the W group is preferably in meta position relative to the L (amide or carbamoyl) moiety. Preferred W groups are F, NO 2 , Br, I, CF 3 , N 3 , and OH. Alternatively, in the phenyl or pyridyl ring (shown in Formula 1 as substituent (W) p ) W is an alkyl group, preferably branch-chained alkyl, such as tertiary butyl, and preferably p is 2. Moreover, the presence of one or two fluoro substituents in the Y group is especially preferred. When the Y group is phenyl, the fluoro substituents preferably are in the ortho and ortho positions relative to the A-B group. With reference to the symbol Y in Formula 1, the preferred compounds of the invention are those where Y is phenyl, pyridyl, 2-thiazolyl, thienyl, or furyl, more preferably phenyl. As far as substitutions on the Y (phenyl) and Y (pyridyl) groups are concerned, compounds are preferred where the phenyl group is 1,4 (para) substituted by the L and A-B groups, and where the pyridine ring is 2,5 substituted by the L and A-B groups. (Substitution in the 2,5 positions in the pyridine nomenclature corresponds to substitution in the 6-position in the nicotinic acid nomenclature.) In the preferred compounds of the invention there is no optional R 1 substituent (other than H) on the Y group. The R 1 groups, when present, preferably are H or CH 3 . The A-B group of the preferred compounds is (CH 2 ) n COOH or (CH 2 ) n COOR 8 , where n and R 8 are defined as above. Even more preferably n is zero and R 8 is lower alkyl, or n is zero and B is COOH or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The most preferred compounds of the invention are shown in Table 1, with reference to Formula 4.

Med Chem. 1988, 31, 2182 (Kagechika et al.) Modes of Administration The compounds of this invention may be administered systemically or topically, depending on such considerations as the condition to be treated, need for site-specific treatment, quantity of drug to be administered, and numerous other considerations. In the treatment of dermatoses, it will generally be preferred to administer the drug topically, though in certain cases such as treatment of severe cystic acne or psoriasis, oral administration may also be used. Any common topical formulation such as a solution, suspension, gel, ointment, or salve and the like may be used. Preparation of such topical formulations are well described in the art of pharmaceutical formulations as exemplified, for example, Remingtons Pharmaceutical Science, Edition 17, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. For topical application, these compounds could also be administered as a powder or spray, particularly in aerosol form. If the drug is to be administered systemically, it may be connected as a powder, pill, tablet or the like or as a syrup or elixir suitable for oral administration. For intravenous or intraperitoneal administration, the compound will be prepared as a solution or suspension capable of being administered by injection. In certain cases, it may be useful to formulate these compounds by injection. In certain cases, it may be useful to formulate these compounds in suppository form or as extended release formulation for deposit under the skin or intramuscular injection. Other medicaments can be added to such topical formulation for such secondary purposes as treating skin dryness; providing protection against light; other medications for treating dermatoses; medicaments for preventing infection, reducing irritation, inflammation and the like. Treatment of dermatoses or any other indications known or discovered to be susceptible to treatment by retinoic acid-like compounds will be effected by administration of the therapeutically effective dose of one or more compounds of the instant invention. A therapeutic concentration will be that concentration which effects reduction of the particular condition, or retards it expansion. In certain instances, the compound potentially may be used in prophylactic manner to prevent onset of a particular condition. A useful therapeutic or prophylactic concentration will vary from condition to condition and in certain instances may vary with the severity of the condition being treated and the patients susceptibility to treatment. Accordingly, no single concentration will be uniformly useful, but will require modification depending on the particularities of the disease being treated. Such concentrations can be arrived at through routine experimentation. However, it is anticipated that in the treatment of, for example, acne, or similar dermatoses, that a formulation containing between 0.01 and 1.0 milligrams per mililiter of formulation will constitute a therapeutically effective concentration for total application. If administered systemically, an amount between 0.01 and 5 mg per kg per day of body weight would be expected to effect a therapeutic result in the treatment of many disease for which these compounds are useful. Assay of Retinoid-like Biological Activity The retinoid-like activity of the compounds of the invention can be confirmed in assays wherein ability of the compound to bind to retinoid receptors is measured. As it is noted in the introductory section of this application for patent two main types of retinoic acid receptors (RAR and RXR) exist in mammals (and other organisms). Within each type there are sub-types (RAR , RAR , RAR , RXR , RXR and RXR ) the distribution of which is not uniform in the various tissues and organs of mammalian organisms. Selective binding of only one or two retinoid receptor subtypes within one retinoid receptor family can give rise to beneficial pharmacological properties because of the varying distribution of the sub-types in the several mammalian tissues or organs. For the above-summarized reasons, binding of any or all of the retinoid receptors, as well as specific or selective activity in a receptor family, or selective or specific activity in any one of the receptor subtypes, are all considered desirable pharmacological properties. In light of the foregoing the prior art has developed assay procedures for testing the agonist like activity of compounds in the RAR , RAR , RAR , RXR , RXR and RXR receptor subtypes. For example, a chimeric receptor transactivation assay which tests for agonist-like activity in the RAR , RAR , RAR , and RXR receptor subtypes, and which is based on work published by Feigner P. L. and Holm M. (1989) Focus, 11 2 is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,265. The specification of U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,265 is expressly incorporated herein by reference. A holoreceptor transactivation assay and a ligand binding assay which measure the ability of the compounds of the invention to bind to the several retinoid receptor subtypes, respectively, are described in published PCT Application No. WO WO93/11755 (particularly on pages 30-33 and 37-41) published on Jun. 24, 1993, the specification of which is also incorporated herein by reference. A description of the ligand binding assay is also provided below. Binding Assay All binding assays were performed in a similar fashion. All six receptor types were derived from the expressed receptor type (RAR , , and RXR , , ) expressed in Baculovirus. Stock solutions of all compounds were prepared as 10 mM ethanol solutions and serial dilutions carried out into 1:1 DMSO; ethanol. Assay buffers consisted of the following for all six receptor assays: 8% glycerol, 120 mM KCl, 8 mM Tris, 5 mM CHAPS 4 mM DTT and 0.24 mM PMSF, pH7.4 room temperature. All receptor biding assays were performed in the same manner. The final assay volume was 250 l and contained from 10-40 g of extract protein depending on receptor being assayed along with 5 nM of 3 H all-trans retinoic acid or 10 nM 3 H 9-cis retinoic acid and varying concentrations of competing ligand at concentrations that ranged from 0-10 5 M. The assays were formatted for a 96 well minitube system. Incubations were carried out at 4 C. until equilibrium was achieved. Non-specific binding was defined as that binding remaining in the presence of 1000 nM of the appropriate unlabeled retinoic acid isomer. At the end of the incubation period, 50 l of 6.25% hydroxyapitite was added in the appropriate wash buffer. The wash buffer consisted of 100 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris and either 5 mM CHAPS (RXR , , ) or 0.5% Triton X-100 (RAR , , ). The mixture was vortexed and incubated for 10 minutes at 4 C., centrifuged and the supernatant removed. The hydroxyapitite was washed three more times with the appropriate wash buffer. The receptor-ligand complex was adsorbed by the hydroxyapitite. The amount of receptor-ligand complex was determined by liquid scintillation counting of hydroxyapitite pellet. After correcting for non-specific binding, IC 50 values were determined. The IC 50 value is defined as the concentration of competing ligand needed to reduce specific binding by 50%. The IC 50 value was determined graphically from a loglogit plot of the data. The K d values were determined by application of the Cheng-Prussof equation to the IC 50 values, the labeled ligand concentration and the K d of the labeled ligand. The results of ligand binding assay are expressed in K d numbers. (See Cheng et al. Biochemical Pharmacology Vol. 22 pp 3099-3108, expressly incorporated herein by reference.) Table 2 shows the results of the ligand binding assay for certain exemplary compounds of the invention.

Med Chem. 1988, 31, 2182 (Kagechika et al.) As it can be seen from the test results summarized in Table 2, the therein indicated exemplary compounds of the invention bind specifically or selectively to RAR receptors. Cancer Cell Line Assays Materials and Methods Hormones All trans-Retinoic acid (t-RA) (Sigma Chemicals Co., St. Louis, Mo.) was stored at 70 C. Prior to each experiment the compound was dissolved in 100% ethanol at 1 mM and diluted in culture medium immediately before use. All experiments were performed in subdued light. Controls were assayed using the same concentration of ethanol as present in the experimental plates and this concentration of diluent had no effect in either assay. Cells and Cell Culture All cell lines, RPMI 8226, ME-180 and AML-193 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, Md.). RPMI 8226 is a human hematopoietic cell line obtained from the peripheral blood of a patient with multiple myeloma. The cells resemble the lymphoblastoid cells of other human lymphocyte cell lines and secrete -type light chains of immunoglobulin. RPMI-8226 cells are grown in RPMI medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine and antibiotics. The cells were maintained as suspension cultures grown at 37 C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in air. The cells were diluted to a concentration of 110 5 /ml twice a week. ME-180 is a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line derived from the cervix. The tumor was a highly invasive squamous cell carcinoma with irregular cell clusters and no significant keratinization. ME-180 cells were grown and maintained in McCoys 5a medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine and antibiotics. The cells were maintained as monolayer cultures grown at 37 C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in air. The cells were diluted to a concentration of 110 5 /ml twice a week. AML-193 was established from the blast cells classified as M5 Acute Monocyte Leukemia. The growth factor, granulocyte colony-stimulation factor (GM-CSF) was required to establish this cell line and growth factors are necessary for its continuous proliferation in chemically defined medium. AML-193 cells were grown and maintained in Iscoves modified Dulbeccos medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine and antibiotics with 5 g/ml insulin (Sigma Chemical Co.) and 2 ng/ml rh GM-CSF (R and D Systems). The cells were diluted to a concentration of 310 5 /ml twice a week. Incorporation of 3 H-Thymidine The method used for determination of the incorporation of radiolabeled thymidine was adapted from the procedure described by Shrivastav et al. RPMI-8226 cells were plated in a 96 well round bottom microtiter plate (Costar) at a density of 1,000 cells/well. To appropriate wells, retinoid test compounds were added at the final concentrations indicated for a final volume of 150 l/well. The plates were incubated for 96 hours at 37 C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in air. Subsequently, 1 Ci of 5- 3 H-thymidine (Amersham, U.K. 43 Ci/mmol specific activity) in 25 l culture medium was added to each well and the cells were incubated for an additional 6 hours. The cultures were further processed as described below. ME-180 wells, harvested by trypsinization were plated in a 96 well flat bottom microtiter plate (Costar) at a density of 2,000 cells/well. The cultures were treated as described above for RPMI 8226 with the following exceptions. After incubation with thymidine the supernatant was carefully removed, and the cells were washed with a 0.5 mM solution of thymidine in phosphate buffered saline. ME180 cells were briefly treated with 50 l of 2.5% trypsin to dislodge the cells from the plate. AML-193 cells were plated in a 96 well round bottom microtiter plate (Costar) at a density of 1,000 cells/well. To appropriate wells, retinoid test compounds were added at the final concentrations indicated for a final volume of 150 l/well. The plates were incubated for 96 hours at 37 C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in air. Subsequently, 1 Ci of 5- 3 H-thymidine (Amersham, U.K., 43 Ci/mmol specific activity) in 25 l culture medium was added to each well and the cells were incubated for an additional 6 hours. All cells lines were then processed as follows: the cellular DNA was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid onto glass fiber filter mats using a SKATRON multi-well cell harvester (Skatron Instruments, Sterling Va.). Radioactivity incorporated into DNA, as a direct measurement of cell growth, was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The numbers represent the mean disintegrations per minute of incorporated thymidine from triplicate wellsSEM. In the above noted in vitro cell lines exemplary Compound 2 of the invention caused significant decrease in the proliferation of the tumor cell lines (as measured by incorporation of radioactive labeled thymidine) in the 10 11 to 10 6 molar concentration range of the test compound. SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS The compounds of this invention can be made by the synthetic chemical pathways illustrated here. The synthetic chemist will readily appreciate that the conditions set out here are specific embodiments which can be generalized to any and all of the compounds represented by Formula 1. Generally speaking the process of preparing compounds of the invention involves the formation of an amide by the reaction of a compound of the general Formula 2 with a compound of general Formula 3, or by the reaction of a compound of general Formula 2a with a compound of general Formula 3a as these formulas are defined in the Summary section of the present application for patent. Thus, as is noted above, a compound of Formula 2 is an acid or an activated form of a carboxylic acid attached to a substituted phenyl (in Formula 1 X is CH) or to a substituted pyridyl (in Formula 1 X is N) nucleus. The term activated form of the carboxylic acid should be understood in this regard as such derivative of the carboxylic acid which is capable of forming an amide when reacted with a primary amine of Formula 3. In case of the reverse amides the activated form of a carboxylic acid is a derivative (Formula 3a) that is capable of forming an amide when reacted with a primary amine of Formula 2a. This, generally speaking, means such derivatives of a carboxylic acid which are normally known and used in the art to form amide linkages with an amine. Examples of suitable forms or derivatives for this purpose are acid chlorides, acid bromides, and esters of the carboxylic acid, particularly active esters, where the alcohol moiety of the ester forms a good leaving group. Presently most preferred as reagents in accordance with Formula 2 (or Formula 3a) are acid chlorides (X 1 is Cl). The acid chlorides of Formula 2 (or of Formula 3a) can be prepared by traditional methods from the corresponding esters (X 1 is for example ethyl) by hydrolysis and treatment with thionyl chloride (SOCl 2 ). The acid chlorides of Formula 2 (or of Formula 3a) can also be prepared by direct treatment of the carboxylic acids with thionyl chloride, where the carboxylic acid, rather than an ester thereof is available commercially or by a known synthetic procedure. The acid chlorides of Formula 2 (or of Formula 3a) are typically reacted with the amine of Formula 3 (or amine of Formula 2a) in an inert solvent, such as methylene chloride, in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as pyridine. The carboxylic acids themselves in accordance with Formula 2 (or Formula 3a) are also suitable for amide formation when reacted with an amine, a catalyst (4-dimethylaminopyridine) in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or more pereferably 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). The carboxylic acids or the corresponding esters of Formula 2, are generally speaking, prepared as described in the chemical scientific or patent literature and the literature procedures for their preparation may be modified, if necessary, by such chemical reactions or processes which per se are known in the art. Reaction Scheme 1 provides an example for the preparation of 2,6-di-tert-butylisonicotinic acid (Compound C) which is a reagant in accordance with Formula 2 for the preparation of several preferred compounds of the present invention. Thus, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine (available commercially from Aldrich Chemical Co.) is reacted with N-bromosuccinimide and benzoyl peroxide to provide 4-bromomethyl-2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine (Compound A). Compound A is reacted with base (sodium hydroxyde) to yield the coresponding hydroxymethyl compound (Compound B), which is thereafter oxidized in a Jones oxydation reaction to give 2,6-di-tert-butylisonicotinic acid (Compound C). A further example of a compound which serves as a reagent for preparing the carbamoyl (or amide) compounds of the present invention is provided in Reaction Scheme 1. 2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol (Aldrich) is brominated in glacial acetic acid to yield 2-bromo-4,6-di-tert-butylphenol (Compound D) which is thereafter reacted with methoxymethyl chloride (MOMCl)to give O-methoxymethyl-2-bromo-4,6-di-tert-butylphenol (Compound E). Compound E is treated with t-butyl lithium followed by carbon dioxide to yield O-methoxymethyl-3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylic acid (Compound F). Compound F is a reagent which differs from the compounds generally encompassed by Formula 2 only in that the hydroxyl function of this compound is protected by the methoxymethyl (MOM) group. However, the methoxymethyl protecting group is removed after formation of the carbamoyl (amide) linkage, as exemplified in Reaction Scheme 5. Reaction of an aromatic bromo compound (such as Compound D) with t-butyl lithium followed by carbon dioxide is a preferred method for preparing several aromatic carboxylic acids in accordance with Formula 2 and Formula 3a, described in the present application. Reaction Scheme 2 provides examples for the preparation of aromatic amino carboxylic acids or esters which serve as reagents corresponding to Formula 3 described above. Thus, in accordance with Reaction Scheme 2, 3-nitro-6-methyl-fluorobenzene (Aldrich) is subjected to oxidation, conversion of the resulting carboxylic acid to an acid chloride and thereafter to an ethyl ester, followed by reduction of the nitro group, to yield ethyl 2-fluoro-4-amino-benzoate (Compound G). As another example, 2,4,6-trifluorobenzoic acid (Aldrich) is converted to the methyl ester through the acid chloride, and the 4-fluoro atom is displaced by reaction with sodium azide to give the intermediate azido compound (Compound H). Compound H is reduced by hydrogenation, to yield methyl 2,6-difluoro-4-amino benzoate (Compound I). As still another example, 2-nitro-4-aminobenzoic acid (Research Plus Inc.) is converted to its methyl ester (Compound K) through the corresponding acid chloride. Reaction scheme 3 illustrates the synthesis of the primary amine compounds of Formula 2a from the acid chlorides (X 1 Cl) or other form of activated acids of Formula 2 where the primary amine of Formula 2a is not available by a published literature procedure. Thus, substantially in accordance with the steps of a Curtius rearrangement, the acid chloride of Formula 2 is reacted with sodium azide in acetone to yield the azide compound of Formula 5. The azide of Formula 5 is heated in a polar high boiling solvent, such as t-butanol, to provide the intermediate isocyanate of Formula 6, which is hydrolyzed to yield a compound of Formula 2a. Reaction Scheme 4 illustrates examples for preparing compounds of Formula 3a where such compounds are not available commercially or by a published literature procedure. Thus, by way of example 2,5-difluoro-4-bromobenzoic acid (available by the literature procedure of Sugawara et al. Kogyo Kaguku Zasshi 1970, 73, 972-979, incorporated herein by reference) is first esterified by treatment with ethyl alcohol and acid to yield the corresponding ester, and thereafter is reacted with butyl lithium followed by carbon dioxide to give the monoester of 2,5-difluoro terephthalic acid (Compound L). A similar sequence of reactions performed on 2,3,5,6-difluoro-4-bromobenzoic acid (available by the literature procedure of Reuman et al. J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 2531-2540, incorporated herein by reference) yields the monoester of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthalic acid (Compound M) The just illustrated sequence of reactions can be, generally speaking, utilized for the synthesis of all compounds of Formula 3a with such modification which will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art, where such compounds are not available by a known literature procedure. Numerous other reactions suitable for preparing compounds of the invention, and for converting compounds of Formula 1 within the scope of the present invention into still further compounds of the invention, and also for preparing the reagents of Formula 2, Formula 3, Formula 2a and Formula 3a will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the present disclosure. In this regard the following general synthetic methodology, applicable for conversion of the compounds of Formula 1 into further homologs and/or derivatives, and also for preparing the reagents of Formula 2 and 3, (as well as 2a and 3a) is noted. Carboxylic acids are typically esterified by refluxing the acid in a solution of the appropriate alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst such as hydrogen chloride or thionyl chloride. Alternatively, the carboxylic acid can be condensed with the appropriate alcohol in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and dimethylaminopyridine. The ester is recovered and purified by conventional means. Acetals and ketals are readily made by the method described in March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 2nd Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company, p 810). Alcohols, aldehydes and ketones all may be protected by forming respectively, ethers and esters, acetals or ketals by known methods such as those described in McOmie, Plenum Publishing Press, 1973 and Protecting Groups, Ed. Greene, John Wiley Sons, 1981. A means for making compounds where A is (CH 2 )q (q is 1-5) is to subject the compounds of Formula 1, where B is an acid or other function, to homologation, using the well known Arndt-Eistert method of homologation, or other known homologation procedures. Similar homologations (and several of the other herein mentioned synthetic transformations) can be transformed on the reagents of Formula 3 or 3a. Compounds of the invention, where A is an alkenyl group having one or more double bonds can be made, for example, by having the requisite number of double bonds incorporated into the reagent of Formula 3. Generally speaking, such compounds where A is an unsaturated carbon chain can be obtained by synthetic schemes well known to the practicing organic chemist; for example by Wittig and like reactions, or by introduction of a double bond by elimination of halogen from an alpha-halo-carboxylic acid, ester or like carboxaldehyde. Compounds of the invention where the A group has a triple (acetylenic) bond can be made by using the corresponding aryl or heteroaryl aldehyde intermediate. Such intermediate can be obtained by reactions well known in the art, for example, by reaction of a corresponding methyl ketone with strong base, such as lithium diisopropyl amide. The acids and salts derived from compounds of Formula 1 are readily obtainable from the corresponding esters. Basic saponification with an alkali metal base will provide the acid. For example, an ester of Formula 1 may be dissolved in a polar solvent such as an alkanol, preferably under an inert atmosphere at room temperature, with about a three molar excess of base, for example, potassium or lithium hydroxide. The solution is stirred for an extended period of time, between 15 and 20 hours, cooled, acidified and the hydrolysate recovered by conventional means. The amide (in Formula 1 B is CONR 9 R 10 ) may be formed by any appropriate amidation means known in the art from the corresponding esters or carboxylic acids. One way to prepare such compounds is to convert an acid to an acid chloride and then treat that compound with ammonium hydroxide or an appropriate amine. Alcohols are made by converting the corresponding acids to the acid chloride with thionyl chloride or other means (J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 2nd Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company), then reducing the acid chloride with sodium borohydride (March, Ibid, pg. 1124), which gives the corresponding alcohols. Alternatively, esters may be reduced with lithium aluminum hydride at reduced temperatures. Alkylating these alcohols with appropriate alky halides under Williamson reaction conditions (March, Ibid, pg. 357) gives the corresponding ethers. These alcohols can be converted to esters by reacting them with appropriate acids in the presence of acid catalysts or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and dimethylaminopyridine. Aldehydes can be prepared from the corresponding primary alcohols using mild oxidizing agents such as pyridinium dichromate in methylene chloride (Corey, E. J., Schmidt, G., Tet. Lett., 399, 1979), or dimethyl sulfoxide/oxalyl chloride in methylene chloride (Omura, K., Swern, D., Tetrahedron, 1978. 34, 1651). Ketones can be prepared from an appropriate aldehyde by treating the aldehyde with an alkyl Grignard reagent or similar reagent followed by oxidation. Acetals or ketals can be prepared from the corresponding aldehyde or ketone by the method described in March, Ibid, p 810. Compounds of Formula 1 where B is H can be prepared from the corresponding halogenated aromatic compounds, preferably where the halogen is I. Reaction Scheme 5 illustrates examples for the formation of the carbamoyl (amide) compounds of the present invention by reaction of a reagent of Formula 2 with a reagent of Formula 3. Thus, 2,6-di-tert-butylisonicotinic acid (Compound C) is reacted with thionyl chloride (SOCl 2 ) to provide the intermediate acid chloride, which is then reacted with ethyl 2-fluoro-4-amino-benzoate (Compound G) in the presence of an acid acceptor (pyridine) to yield ethyl 2-fluoro-4-(26-di-tert-butylpyrid-4-yl)carbamoylbenzoate (Compound 1). As another example, 3,5-di-tert-butylbenzoic acid (available by the literature procedure of Kagechika et al., J. Med. Chem. 1988, 31, 2182, incorporated herein by reference) is reacted with thionyl chloride, followed by ethyl 2-fluoro-4-amino-benzoate (Compound G) to yield ethyl 2-fluoro-4-(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)carbamoylbenzoate (Compound 5). As still another example, O-methoxymethyl-3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylic acid (Compound F)is reacted with ethyl 2-fluoro-4-amino-benzoate (Compound G) in the presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) catalyst and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) to give ethyl 2-fluoro-4-(2-methoxymethyl-3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)carbamoylbenzoate (Compound N). The methoxymethyl protecting group is removed from Compound N by treatment with borontrifluoride ethereate and thiophenol to yield ethyl 2-fluoro-4-(2-hydroxy-3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)carbamoylbenzoate (Compound 7). In yet another example shown in Reaction Scheme 5, 2,6-di-tert-butylisonicotinic acid (Compound C) is reacted with thionyl chloride (SOCl 2 ), the resulting intermediate acid chloride is reacted with methyl 2,6-difluoro-4-amino benzoate (Compound I), followed by saponification of the ester group, to yield 2,6-difluoro-4-(2,6-di-tert-butylpyrid-4yl)carbamoylbenzoic acid (Compound 10). 3,5-Di-tert-butylbenzoic acid is subjected to the same sequence of reactions to provide 2,6-difluoro-4-(3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)carbamoylbenzoic acid (Compound 12). As yet another example, shown in Reaction Scheme 5, 2,6-di-tert-butylisonicotinic acid (Compound C) is reacted with thionyl chloride (SOCl 2 ), followed by methyl 2-nitro-4-aminobenzoate (Compound K) and saponification of the ester function to give 2-nitro-4-(2,6-di-tert-butylpyrid-4-yl)carbamoylbenzoic acid (Compound 14). SPECIFIC EXAMPLES 4-Bromomethyl-2,6-di-t-butylpyridine (Compound A) To a mixture of 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylpyridine (Aldrich, 2.0 g, 9.73 mmol) in 25 ml of dry CCl 4 was added benzoyl peroxide (24 mg, 0.097 mmol) and NBS (1.9 g, 10.7 mmol). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 16 hours. After it cooled to room temperature, the solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, hexane) to give an oil (1.957 g) which contained 82% of the desired product and 18% of the starting material. 1 H NMR 7.09 (s, 2H), 4.39 (s, 2H), 1.35 (s, 18H). 4-Hydroxymethyl-2,6-di-t-butylpyridine (Compound B) A heterogeneous solution of 4-bromomethyl-2,6-di-t-butylpyridine (Compound A, 1.743 g, 82% purity) in 20 ml of 12% NaOH in water and 10 ml of 1,4-dioxane was refluxed for 12 hours. The solution spontaneously separated into two layers as it cooled to room temperature. The upper layer was separated and ethyl acetate was added.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION HIV and other viral infections such as hepatitis are a few of the leading causes of death. HIV is the virus known to cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans. HIV is a disease in which a virus is replicated in the body or in host cells. The virus attacks the bodys immune system Several drugs have been approved for treatment of this devastating disease, including azidovudine (AZT), didanosine (dideoxyinosine, ddI), d4T, zalcitabine (dideoxycytosine, ddC), nevirapine, lamivudine (epivir, 3TC), saquinavir (Invirase), ritonavir (Norvir), indinavir (Crixivan), and delavirdine (Rescriptor). See M. I. Johnston D. F. Hoth, Science, 260(5112), 1286-1293 (1993) and D. D. Richman, Science, 272(5270), 1886-1888 (1996). An AIDS vaccine (Salks vaccine) has been tested and several proteins which are chemokines from CD8 have been discovered to act as HIV suppressers. In addition to the above synthetic nucleoside analogs, proteins, and antibodies, several plants and substances derived from plants have been found to have in vitro anti-HIV activity. However, HIV virus is not easily destroyed nor is there a good mechanism for keeping the host cells from replicating the virus. Thus, medical professionals continue to search for drugs that can prevent HIV and retroviral infections, treat HIV carriers to prevent their disease from progressing to full-blown deadly AIDS, and to treat the AIDS patient. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 are persistent viruses that commonly infect humans; they cause a variety of troubling human diseases. HSV type 1 causes oral fever blisters (recurrent herpes labialis), and HSV type 2 causes genital herpes, which has become a major venereal disease in many parts of the world. No fully satisfactory treatment for genital herpes currently exists. In addition, although it is uncommon, HSV can also cause encephalitis, a life-threatening infection of the brain. (The Merck Manual, Holvey, Ed., 1972; Whitley, Herpes Simplex Viruses, In: Virology, 2nd Ed., Raven Press (1990)). A most serious HSV-caused disorder is dendritic keratitis, an eye infection that produces a branched lesion of the cornea, which can in turn lead to permanent scarring and loss of vision. Ocular infections with HSV are a major cause of blindness. HSV is also a virus which is difficult, if not impossible to cure. Hepatitis is a disease of the human liver. It is manifested with inflammation of the liver and is usually caused by viral infections and sometimes from toxic agents. Hepatitis may progress to liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and eventually death. Several viruses such as hepatitis A, B, C, D, E and G are known to cause various types of viral hepatitis. Among them, HBV and HCV are the most serious. HBV is a DNA virus with avinon size of 42 nm. HCV is a RNA virus with a virion size of 30-60 nm. See D. S. Chen, J. Formos. Med. Assoc ., 95(1), 6-12 (1996). Hepatitis C infects 4 to 5 times the number of people infected with HIV. Hepatitis C is difficult to treat and it is estimated that there are 500 million people infected with it worldwide (about 15 times those infected with HIV). No effective immunization is currently available, and hepatitis C can only be controlled by other preventive measures such as improvement in hygiene and sanitary conditions and interrupting the route of transmission. At present, the only acceptable treatment for chronic hepatitis C is interferon which requires at least six (6) months of treatment and or ribavarin which can inhibit viral replication in infected cells and also improve liver function in some people. Treatment with interferon however has limited long term efficacy with a response rate about 25%. Hepatitis B virus infection can lead to a wide spectrum of liver injury. Moreover, chronic hepatitis B infection has been linked to the subsequent development of hepatocellular carcinoma, a major cause of death. Current prevention of HBV infection is a hepatitis B vaccination which is safe and effective. However, vaccination is not effective in treating those already infected (i.e., carriers and patients). Many drugs have been used in treating chronic hepatitis B and none have been proven to be effective, except interferon. Treatment of HCV and HBV with interferon has limited success and has frequently been associated with adverse side effects such as fatigue, fever, chills, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, mild alopecia, psychiatric effects and associated disorders, autoimmune phenomena and associated disorders and thyroid dysfunction. Because the interferon therapy has limited efficacy and frequent adverse effects, a more effective regimen is needed. In the present invention it has been discovered that the compounds described above are useful for the treatment of hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, herpes simplex and the treatment of HIV infection and other viral infections.

C. SYNTHESIS The arylthiazolyl thiourea or arylthiazolyl urea derivatives can be prepared in a number of ways well known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. The arylthiazolyl thiourea or arylthiazolyl urea derivatives can be synthesized using the methods described below, together with synthetic methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred methods include but are not limited to those methods described below. Each of the references cited below are hereby incorporated herein by reference. The compounds can be synthesized by a desulphurization of aromatic thioureas or urea compounds using hydrogen peroxide in alkali or by reacting the corresponding 3-amino-5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazole with ethoxy carbonyl isothiocyanate to produce the ethoxycarbonyl-3-(5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol-3-yl)thiourea or 3-(5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol-3-yl) urea which is then reacted with sodium hydroxide in ethanol and then acidified. (5-Phenyl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl thiourea is prepared by the method described in Kurzer, et al, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans . 1(2), 311-314 (1985) and Kurzer, et al., J. Heterocycl. Chem ., 26 (2), 355-60 (1989). (5-Phenyl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl thiourea can also be prepared by the hydrolysis of 3-N-benzoylthioureido-5-phenyl-1,2,4-thiadiazole using 3 molar potassium hydroxide at about 60 C. The mixture is cooled, and then acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid. Concentrated ammonium hydroxide is then used to basify the resultant product. The material from this hydrolysis procedure is pure (about 99%) and the yield is high. The pharmaceutical addition salt of the present invention can be synthesized from the arylthiazolyl thiourea or arylthiazolyl urea derivatives which contain a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 1418, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The disclosures of all of the references cited herein are hereby incorporated herein by references in their entirety. D. DOSAGE The compounds can be administered in one dose, continuously or intermittently throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art. The compounds can be administered in one dose, continuously or intermittently throughout the course of treatment. The compounds may also be given daily or from 1 to 4 times a week. The compounds of the present invention can be given in one or more doses on a daily basis or from one to three times a week. Twice weekly dosing over a period of at least several weeks is preferred. Often the anti-viral compounds will be administered for extended periods of time and may be administered for the lifetime of the patient. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with one dose level and pattern being selected by the administrator. The compounds are generally safe. The oral LD 50 is greater than 6000 mg/kg in mice and there are no special handling requirements. By way of general guidance, a dosage of as little as about 1 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight and preferably as little as 10 mg/kg and up to about 10,000 mg per kg of body weight is suitable. Preferably from 10 mg/kg to about 5000 mg/kg of body weight is used. Most preferably the doses are between 250 mg/kg to about 5000 mg/kg. Generally, the dosage in man is lower than for small warm blooded mammals such as mice. By way of guidance the human dose is about {fraction (1/12)} that of mice. Thus, if 25 mg/kg is effective in mice, a dose of 2 mg/kg would be used for a 60 kg person, and a typical dosage would be 120 mg. The dosage administered will, of course, vary depending upon known factors, such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the age, health and/or weight of the recipient; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent treatment; the frequency of treatment; and the effect desired. E. METHOD OF ADMINISTERING AND DOSAGE DELIVERY FORMS The compounds of the present invention can be administered by any suitable means including, but not limited to, for example, oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including transdermal, aerosol, buccal and sublingual), vaginal, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal), intravesical or injection into or around the virus. The dosage amounts are based on the effective inhibitory concentrations observed in anti-viral studies. The preferred route will vary with the (1) condition and age of the recipient, (2) virus and being treated (3) nature of the infection and (4) desired blood levels. It is believed that parenteral treatment by intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular application of the compounds of the present invention formulated with an appropriate carrier, other antiviral agents or compounds or diluents to facilitate application will be the preferred method of administering the compounds to warm blooded animals. The (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl thiourea derivatives or (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl urea derivatives are preferably micronized or powdered so that it is more easily dispersed and solubilized by the body. Processes for grinding or pulverizing drugs are well known in the art. For example, a hammer mill or similar milling device can be used. The preferred particle size is less than about 100 and preferably less than 50. These compounds are not very soluble, and therefore are preferably given in tablet form or as a suspension. Suitable methods of administering the compounds of the present invention and dosage forms can be found herein below. The (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl thiourea derivatives or (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl urea derivatives of this invention can be administered as treatment for viral infections by any means that produces contact of the active agent with the agents site of action in the body. They can be administered by any conventional means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals, either as individual therapeutic agents or in a combination of therapeutic. Preferably the compounds of the present invention are administered as a pharmaceutical formulation comprising at least one compound of the present invention, as defined above, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. It can be co-administered in the form of a tablet or capsule, as an agglomerated powder or in a liquid form or as a liposome. The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unicellular vesicles, large unilamallar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, or phosphatidylcholines. The (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl thiourea derivatives or (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl urea derivatives of the present invention can also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxylpropylmethacrylamide-phenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxide-polylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention can be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, copolymers of polylactic and polyglycolic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacylates, and crosslinked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels. 1. Combination Therapy The compounds of the present invention may additionally be combined with other antiviral compounds to provide an operative combination. It is intended to include any chemically compatible combination of a compound of this inventive group with other compounds of the inventive group or other compounds outside of the inventive group, as long as the combination does not eliminate the antiviral activity of the compound of this inventive group. For example, one or more (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl thiourea derivatives or (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl urea derivatives can be combined with other antiviral agents or potentiators. Potentiators are materials which affect the bodys response to the anti-viral agent. In the case of HIV a combination therapy with AZT, TC-3 or protease inhibitors is effective. In the case of hepatitis, cyclovir, famciclovir or valacyclovir, Ribavirin, interferon or combinations of Ribavirin and Interferon or beta globulin is administered as a combination therapy. For herpes, a recombinant alpha interferon can be used as a combination therapy. In some embodiments of the invention, a (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl thiourea derivatives or (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl urea derivatives is used in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-fungal, amoebicidal, trichomonocidal, analgesic, anti-neoplastic, anti-hypertensives, anti-microbial and/or steroid drugs, to treat antiviral infections. In some preferred embodiments, viral infections are treated with a combination of one or more (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl thiourea derivatives or (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl urea derivatives with one or more of beta-lactam antibiotics, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, neomycin, gramicidin, bacitracin, sulfonamides, nitrofurazone, nalidixic acid, cortisone, hydrocortisone, betamethasone, dexamethasone, fluocortolone, prednisolone, triamcinolone, indomethacin, sulindac, acyclovir, amantadine, rimantadine, recombinant soluble CD4 (rsCD4), anti-receptor antibodies (for rhinoviruses), nevirapine, cidofovir (Vistide), trisodium phosphonoformate (Foscarnet), famcyclovir, pencyclovir, valacyclovir, nucleic acid/replication inhibitors, interferon, zidovudine (AZT, Retrovir), didanosine (dideoxyinosine, ddI, Videx), stavudine (d4T, Zerit), zalcitabine (dideoxycytosine, ddC, Hivid), nevirapine (Viramune), lamivudine (Epivir, 3TC), protease inhibitors, saquinavir (Invirase, Fortovase), ritonavir (Norvir), nelfinavir (Viracept), efavirenz (Sustiva), abacavir (Ziagen), amprenavir (Agenerase) indinavir (Crixivan), ganciclovir, AZDU, delavirdine (Rescriptor), rifampin, clathiromycin, erythropoietin, colony stimulating factors (G-CSF and GM-CSF), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nucleoside inhibitors, adriamycin, fluorouracil, methotrexate, asparaginase and combinations thereof. A potentiator can be any material which improves or increase the efficacy of the pharmaceutical composition or acts as an immunomodulator. One such potentiator is triprolidine and its cis-isomer which is used in combination with more (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl thiourea derivatives or (5-aryl- 1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl urea derivatives and optionally another therapeutic agent and or anti-viral agent. Triprolidine is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,114,951 (1992). Another potentiator is procodazole, 1H-benzimidazole-2-propanoic acid; -(2-benzimidazole) propionic acid; 2-(2-carboxyethyl)benzimidazole; propazol. Procodazole is a non-specific immunoprotective agent against viral and bacterial infections used with the compositions claimed herein. It is effective with one or more (5-aryl- 1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl thiourea derivatives or (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl urea derivatives in treating viral infections and can be combined with one or more other therapeutic agents. The combination therapy can be sequential, that is the treatment with one agent first and then the second agent, or it can be treatment with both agents at the same time. The sequential therapy can be within a reasonable time after the completion of the first therapy before beginning the second therapy. The treatment with both agents at the same time can be in the same daily dose or in separate doses. For example treatment with one agent on day 1 and the other on day 2. The exact regimen will depend on the disease being treated, the severity of the infection and the response to the treatment. 2. Unit dosage The compounds of the present invention may administered in a unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art. Such methods include combining the compounds of the present invention with a carrier or diluent which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. Typically, the formulations are prepared by uniformly mixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. A pharmaceutical carrier is selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Each carrier must be acceptable In the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the subject. This carrier can be a solid or liquid and the type is generally chosen based on the type of administration being used. Examples of suitable solid carriers include lactose, sucrose, gelatin, agar and bulk powders. Examples of suitable liquid carriers include water, pharmaceutically acceptable fats and oils, alcohols or other organic solvents, including esters, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, suspensions, solutions and/or suspensions, and solution and or suspensions reconstituted from non-effervescent granules and effervescent preparations reconstituted from effervescent granules. Such liquid carriers may contain, for example, suitable solvents, preservatives, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, inlets, sweeteners, thickeners, and melting agents. Preferred carriers are edible oils, for example, corn or canola oils. Polyethylene glycols, e.g. PEG, are also good carriers. Dosage forms (compositions suitable for administration) comprise from about 1 milligram to about 1000 milligrams of active ingredient per dosage unit. Preferably the dosage forms will contain from about 10 mg to about 500 mg. In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.5 to about 95% by weight based on the total weight of the dosage unit. 3. Pharmaceutical Kits The present invention also includes pharmaceutical kits useful, for example, for the treatment of hepatitis infection, which comprise one or more containers containing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl thiourea derivatives or (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl urea derivatives. Such kits can further include, if desired, one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such as, for example, containers with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional containers, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Printed instructions, either as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to be administered, guidelines for administration, and/or guidelines for mixing the components, can also be included in the kit. In the present disclosure it should be understood that the specified materials and conditions are important in practicing the invention but that unspecified materials and conditions are not excluded so long as they do not prevent the benefits of the invention from being realized. Specific examples of pharmaceutical acceptable carriers and excipients that may be used to formulate oral dosage forms of the present invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,903,297 to Robert, issued Sep. 2, 1975. Techniques and compositions for making dosage forms useful in the present invention are described herein below. Oral formulations suitable for use in the practice of the present invention include capsules, gels, cachets, tablets, effervescent or non-effervescent powders or tablets, powders or granules; as a solution or suspension in aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion. The compounds of the present invention may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste. The formulations for oral administration may comprise a non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable, inert carrier such as lactose, starch, sucrose, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, mannitol, sorbitol, cyclodextrin and cyclodextrin derivatives and the like. Capsule or tablets can be easily formulated and can be made easy to swallow or chew. Tablets may contain suitable binders, lubricants, diluents, disintegrating agents, coloring agents, flavoring agents, flow-inducing agents, and melting agents. A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more additional ingredients. Compressed tables may be prepared by compressing the active ingredient in a free flowing form (e.g., powder, granules) optionally mixed with a binder (e.g., gelatin, hydroxypropylmethlcellose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (e.g., sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked carboxymethyl cellulose) surface-active or dispersing agent. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth, or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes, and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum, and the like. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient. Tablets may also optionally be provided with an enteric coating to provide release in parts of the gut other than the stomach. Formulatons suitable for topical administration in the mouth wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier include lozenges hich may comprise the active ingredient in a flavored carrier, usually sucrose and cacia or tragacanth; gelatin, glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier. Topical applications for administration according to the method of the present invention include ointments, cream, suspensions, lotions, powder, solutions, pastes, gels, spray, aerosol or oil. Alternately, a formulation may comprise a transdermal patch or dressing such as a bandage impregnated with an active ingredient and optionally one or more carriers or diluents. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethylsulfoxide and related analogues. The oil phase of the emulsions of the composition used to treat subjects in the present invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. This phase may comprise one or more emulsifiers. For example, the oily phase comprises at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil or a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up an emulsifying was, and the wax together with the oil and/or fat make up the emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation include Tween 60, Span 80, cetosteryl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate and sodium lauryl sulphate, paraffin, straight or branched chain, mono-or dibasic alkyl esters, mineral oil. The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties, the properties required and compatibility with the active ingredient. The compounds may also be administered vaginally for example, as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient. Such carriers are known in the art. Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising, for example, cocoa butter or a salicylate. Formulations suitable for nasal administration may be administered in a liquid form, for example, nasal spray, nasal drops, or by aerosol administration by nebulizer, including aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations for nasal administration, wherein the carrier is a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, of less than about 100 microns, preferably less than about 50 microns, which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e., by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending systems which are designed to target the compound to blood components or one or more organs. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampoules and vials. Extemporaneous injections solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. In general, water, a suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose (glucose), and related sugar solutions and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions. Solutions for parenteral administration preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing agents, and if necessary, buffer substances. Antioxidizing agents such as sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid, either alone or combined, are suitable stabilizing agents. Also used are citric acid and its salts and sodium EDTA. In addition, parenteral solutions can contain preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride, methyl- or propyl-paraben, and chlorobutanol. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, a standard reference text in this field. Intravenously, the most preferred doses can range from about 1 to about 10 mg/kg/minute during a constant rate infusion. (5-Aryl-1,2,4-thiadizol)-3-yl derivatives or (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl urea derivatives can be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage can be administered in divided doses of two, three, or four times daily. The (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl- derivatives or (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl urea derivatives can be given in one or more doses on a daily basis or from one to three times a week. The present invention additionally include administering compounds of the herein described formula for the use in the form of veterinary formulations, which may be prepared, for example, by methods that are conventional in the art. Useful pharmaceutical dosage forms for administration of the compounds of this invention are illustrated as follows: Capsules A large number of unit capsules are prepared by filling standard two-piece hard gelatin capsules each with 100 milligrams of powdered active ingredient, 150 milligrams of lactose, 50 milligrams of cellulose, and 6 milligrams magnesium stearate. Soft Gelatin Capsules A mixture of active ingredient in a digestible oil such as soybean oil, cottonseed oil or olive oil is prepared and injected by means of a positive displacement pump into gelatin to form soft gelatin capsules containing 100 milligrams of the active ingredient. The capsules are washed and dried. Tablets A large number of tablets are prepared by conventional procedures so that the dosage unit was 100 milligrams of active ingredient, 0.2 milligrams of colloidal silicon dioxide, 5 milligrams of magnesium stearate, 275 milligrams of microcrystalline cellulose, 11 milligrams of starch and 98.8 milligrams of lactose. Appropriate coatings can be applied to increase palatability or delay absorption. Injectable A parenteral composition suitable for administration by injection is prepared by stirring 1.5% by weight of active ingredient in 10% by volume propylene glycol and water. The solution is made isotonic with sodium chloride and sterilized. Liposomes can also be used for injectable compositions. Suspension An aqueous suspension is prepared for oral administration so that each 5 ml contain 100 mg of finely divided active ingredient, 200 mg of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, 5 mg of sodium benzoate, 1.0 g of sorbitol solution, U.S.P., and 0.025 ml of vanillin. G. METHOD OF TREATMENT The method of treatment can be any suitable method which is effective in the treatment or prevention of the particular virus or viral infection that is being treated or prevented. Treatment can be oral, rectal, topical, parenteral or intravenous administration and the like. The method of applying an effective amount also varies depending on the viral infection being treated and the desired blood level. It is believed that parenteral treatment by intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular application of (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl thiourea derivatives or (5-aryl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl urea derivatives, formulated with an appropriate carrier, additional viral inhibiting compound or compounds or diluent to facilitate application will be the preferred method of administering the compounds to mammals or warm blooded animals. The following example is illustrative and is not meant to be limiting to the invention. H. TEST METHODS Prevention Test Uninfected cells were pretreated with the compound for one week, three weeks, four weeks and five weeks respectively by combining the drug with the CEMSS cells. At the end of the culture period, the cells were washed free of the test compound and the cells were used as target cells to titrate a stock solution of HIV virus. Briefly a known virus stock was titrated in each cell line by addition virus to the round bottom microtiter plate at known dilutions (1:1 through 1:1000) and the amount of virus required to productively infect and kill the CEMSS cells was quantified. Endpoint quantification was performed by XTT assay. XTT Staining of Screening Plates After 6 days (or the experimental period) of incubation at 37 C. in a 5% carbon dioxide incubator, the test plates were analyzed by staining with the tetrazolium dye, XTT. XTT-tetrazolium is metabolized by the mitochondrial enzymes of metabolically active cells to a soluble formazan product, allowing the rapid quantitative analysis of the inhibiting of HIV-induced cell killing by an anti-HIV test substance. On day 6 post-infection, plates are removed from the incubator and observed. The use of round bottom microtiter plates allows rapid macroscopic analysis of the active of a given test compound by the evaluation of pellet size. The results of the macroscopic observations were confirmed and enhanced by further microscopic analysis. XTT solutions are prepared daily as a stock of 1 mg/ml in PBS. Phenazine methosulfate (PMS) solution is prepared at 15 mg/ml in PBS and sorted in the dark at 20 C. XTT/PMS stock is prepared immediately before use by diluting the PMS in 1:100 into PBS and adding 40 ml per ml of XTT solution. Fifty microliters of XTT/PMS is added to each well of the plate and the plate is reincubated for 4 hours at 37 C. Adhesive plate sealers are used in place of the lids and the sealed plate is inverted several times to mix the soluble formazan product. The plated is read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm with a Molecular Devices Vmax plate reader. Percent cell reduction, percent cell viability, IC 25,50, 95 can then be calculated. EXAMPLE 1 CEMSS cells were treated in vitro with (5-phenyl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl thiourea for from 1 to 5 weeks. The cells were then challenged with HIV 1 after treatment for 1 week, 3 weeks, 4 weeks and 5 weeks respectively. The concentrations of HIV required to infect the cells was measured in L/well. Cell Treatment Week 1 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5 Control -CEMSS 0.5 L 0.25 L 0.3 L 0.25 L (5-phenyl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)- 0.13 L 0.13 L 2 L 25 L 3-yl thiourea 7 g/ml (5-phenyl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)- 0.25 L 0.25 L 2 L 25 L 3-yl thiourea 15 g/ml (5-phenyl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)- 0.25 L 0.25 L 2 L 25 L 3-yl thiourea 30 g/ml After 4 weeks of treatment with (5-phenyl-1,2,4-thiadiazol)-3-yl thiourea there was a 100 fold increase in the ability to protect cells from infection with HIV at all dose levels.

This is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/081,384, filed May 19, 1998, now abandoned. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention is a method of treating viral infections, notably HIV. The pharmaceutical composition contains one or more benzimidazole derivatives, notably a thiabendazole compound. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION HIV and other viral infections are one leading cause of death. HIV is a disease in which a virus is replicated in the body which attacks the bodys immune system. The HIV virus is not easily destroyed nor is there a good mechanism for keeping the host cells from replicating the virus. Herpes Simplex is another viral infection which is difficult, if not impossible, to cure. A method of treating these diseases and other viral infections is highly desirable. A material which targets the HIV virus and inhibit viral replication is highly desirable. Several drugs have been approved for treatment of this devastating disease, including azidovudine (AZT), didanosine (dideoxyinosine, ddI), d4T, zalcitabine (dideoxycytosine, ddC), nevirapine, lamivudine (epivir, 3TC), saquinavir (Invirase), ritonavir (Norvir), indinavir (Crixivan), and delavirdine (Rescriptor). See M. I. Johnston D. F. Hoth, Science, 260(5112), 1286-1293 (1993) and D. D. Richman, Science, 272(5270), 1886-1888 (1996 An AIDS vaccine (Salks vaccine) has been tested and several proteins which are chemokines from CD8 have been discovered to act as HIV suppressors. In addition to the above synthetic nucleoside analogs, proteins, and antibodies, several plants and substances derived from plants have been found to have in vitro anti-HIV activity. However, HIV virus is not easily destroyed nor is there a good mechanism for keeping the host cells from replicating the virus. Thus, medical professionals continue to search for drugs that can prevent HIV infections, treat HIV carriers to prevent them from progressing to full-blown deadly AIDS, and treat the AIDS patient. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 are persistent viruses that commonly infect humans; they cause a variety of troubling human diseases. HSV type 1 causes oral fever blisters (recurrent herpes labialis), and HSV type 2 causes genital herpes, which has become a major venereal disease in many parts of the world. No fully satisfactory treatment for genital herpes currently exists. In addition, although it is uncommon, HSV can also cause encephalitis, a life-threatening infection of the brain. (The Merck Manual, Holvey, Ed., 1972; Whitley, Herpes Simplex Viruses, In: Virology, 2nd Ed., Raven Press (1990)). A most serious HSV-caused disorder is dendritic keratitis, an eye infection that produces a branched lesion of the cornea, which can in turn lead to permanent scarring and loss of vision. Ocular infections with HSV are a major cause of blindness. HSV is also a virus which is difficult, if not impossible to cure. Hepatitis is a disease of the human liver. It is manifested with inflammation of the liver and is usually caused by viral infections and sometimes from toxic agents. Hepatitis may progress to liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and eventually death. Several viruses such as hepatitis A, B, C, D, E and G are known to cause various types of viral hepatitis. Among them, HBV and HCV are the most serious. HBV is a DNA virus with avirion size of 42 nm. HCV is a RNA virus with a virion size of 30-60 nm. See D. S. Chen, J. Formos. Med. Assoc., 95(1), 6-12 (1996). Hepatitis C infects 4 to 5 times the number of people infected with HIV. Hepatitis C is difficult to treat and it is estimated that there are 500 million people infected with it worldwide (about 15 time those infected with HIV). No effective immunization is currently available, and hepatitis C can only be controlled by other preventive measures such as improvement in hygiene and sanitary conditions and interrupting the route of transmission. At present, the only acceptable treatment for chronic hepatitis C is interferon which requires at least six (6) months of treatment and or ribavarin which can inhibit viral replication in infected cells and also improve liver function in some people. Treatment with interferon with or without Ribavarin however has limited long term efficacy with a response rate about 25%. Hepatitis B virus infection lead to a wide spectrum of liver injury. Moreover, chronic hepatitis B infection has been linked to the subsequent development of hepatocellular carcinoma, a major cause of death. Current prevention of HBV infection is a hepatitis B vaccination which is therapeutically effective. However, vaccination is not effective in treating those already infected (i.e., carriers and patients). Many drugs have been used in treating chronic hepatitis B and none have been proven to be effective, except interferon. Treatment of HCV and HBV with interferon has limited success and has frequently been associated with adverse side effects such as fatigue, fever, chills, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, mild alopecia, psychiatric effects and associated disorders, autoimmune phenomena and associated disorders and thyroid dysfunction. Because the interferon therapy has limited efficacy and frequent adverse effects, a ore effective regimen is needed.

The thiazolyl derivatives are prepared according to the method described in Brown et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 83 1764 (1961) and Grenda et al. J. Org. Chem., 30, 259 (1965). C. Dosage and Dosage Delivery Forms The type of compound and the carrier and the amount will vary widely depending on the species of animal or human, body weight, and virus or viral infection being treated. The dosage administered will vary depending upon known factors, such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the age, health and weight of the recipient; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent treatment; the frequency of treatment; and the effect desired. The benzimidazole is preferably micronized or powdered so that it is more easily dispersed and solubilized by the body. Processes for grinding or pulverizing drugs are well known in the art. For example, a hammer mill or similar milling device are used. The preferred particle size is less than about 100 and preferably less than 50. The dosage administered will vary depending upon known factors such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular active ingredient, and its mode and route of administration; age, sex, health, metabolic rate, absorptive efficiency and/or weight of the recipient; nature and extent of symptoms; kind of concurrent treatment, frequency of treatment; and/or the effect desired. Dosage forms (compositions) suitable for internal administration contain from about 1.0 milligram to about 5000 milligrams of active ingredient per unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions, the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.5-95% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. Based on the body weight of the patient, the dosage may be administered in one or more doses several times per day or per week. Multiple dosage units may be required to achieve a therapeutically effective amount. For example, if the dosage form is 1000 mg, and the patient weighs 40 kg, one pill will provide a dose of 25 mg per kg for that patient. It will provide a dose of only 12.5 mg/kg for a 80 kg patient. The compounds have shown dose responsiveness in vivo against viruses and cancers in mice at 500 mg/kg, 2500 mg/kg, 3500 mg/kg, 4000 mg/kg, 5000 mg/kg and 6000 mg/kg. Generally a dosage effective in mice translates to about {fraction (1/12)} of the dosage required in humans. By way of general guidance, for humans a dosage of as little as about 30 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight and up to about 10000 mg per kg of body weight is suitable. Preferably from 250 mg/kg to about 5000 mg/kg of body weight is used. Most preferably the doses are between 100 mg/kg to about 3000 mg/kg of body weight. However, a dosage of between about 2 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight to about 400 mg per kg of body weight is also suitable for some indications. Intravenously, the most preferred doses may range from about 1 to about 1000 mg/kg/minute during a constant rate infusion. Benzimidazole derivatives may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three, or four times daily. The benzimidazole derivatives are given in one or more doses on a daily basis or from one to three times a week. The benzimidazole derivatives may also be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittant throughout the dosage regimen. Generally, the dosage in man is lower than for small warm blooded mammals such as mice. A dosage unit may comprise a single compound or mixtures thereof with other compounds or other viral inhibiting compounds or anti-viral compounds. The dosage unit can also comprise diluents, extenders, carriers and the like. The unit may be in solid or gel form such as pills, tablets, capsules and the like or in liquid form suitable for oral, rectal, topical, intravenous injection or parenteral administration. The benzimidazole derivatives are typically mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This carrier can be a solid or liquid and the type is generally chosen based on the type of administration being used. The active agent can be coadministered in the form of a tablet or capsule, as an agglomerated powder or in a liquid form. Examples of suitable solid carriers include lactose, sucrose, gelatin and agar. Capsule or tablets are easily formulated and can be made easy to swallow or chew; other solid forms include granules, and bulk powders. Tablets may contain suitable binders, lubricants, diluents, disintegrating agents, coloring agents, flavoring agents, flow-inducing agents, and melting agents. Examples of suitable liquid dosage forms include solutions or suspensions in water, pharmaceutically acceptable fats and oils, alcohols or other organic solvents, including esters, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, suspensions, solutions and/or suspensions reconstituted from non-effervescent granules and effervescent preparations reconstituted from effervescent granules. Such liquid dosage forms may contain, for example, suitable solvents, preservatives, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, diluents, sweeteners, thickeners, and melting agents. Oral dosage forms optionally contain flavorants and coloring agents. Parenteral and intravenous forms would also include minerals and other materials to make them compatible with the type of injection or delivery system chosen. Examples of Formulation The benzimidazole derivatives of this invention are administered as treatment for viral infections, including retroviral, by any means that produces contact of the active agent with the agents site of action in the body. The anti-viral compounds (active ingredients) of this invention are administered to inhibit virus growth or viral infections by any means that produces contact of the active ingredient with the agents site of action in the body of a mammal or animal. They can be administered by any conventional means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals, either as individual therapeutic agents or in a combination of therapeutic agents. They can be administered alone, but generally are administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The benzimidazole derivatives are administered in oral dosage forms as tablets, capsules (each of which includes sustained release or timed release formulations), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions, syrups, and emulsions. The benzimidazole derivatives may also be administered in intravenous (bolus or infusion), intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular form, all using dosage forms well known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical arts. In the methods of the present invention, the compounds herein described in detail can form the active ingredient, and are typically administered in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents, excipients, or carriers (collectively referred to herein as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or carrier materials) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, that is, oral tablets, capsules, elixirs, syrups and the like, and consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices. For instance, for oral administration in the dosage unit form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable, inert carrier such as lactose, starch, sucrose, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, mannitol, sorbitol and the like. For oral administration in liquid dosage form, the oral drug components are combined with any oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth, or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes, and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum, and the like. The benzimidazole derivatives can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamallar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, or phosphatidylcholines. Benzimidazole derivatives may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxylpropylmethacrylamide-phenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxide-polylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, copolymers of polylactic and polyglycolic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacylates, and crosslinked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels. The active ingredient can be administered orally in solid dosage forms, such as capsules, tablets, and powders, or in liquid dosage forms, such as elixirs, syrups, and suspensions. It can also be administered parentally, in sterile liquid dosage forms. Gelatin capsules may contain the active ingredient and powdered carriers, such as lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like. Similar diluents can be used to make compressed tablets. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of hours. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric coated for selective disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can contain coloring and flavoring to increase patient acceptance. In general, water, a suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose (glucose), and related sugar solutions and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions. Solutions for parenteral administration preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing agents, and if necessary, buffer substances. Antioxidizing agents such as sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid, either alone or combined, are suitable stabilizing agents. Also used are citric acid and its salts and sodium EDTA. In addition, parenteral solutions can contain preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride, methyl- or propyl-paraben, and chlorobutanol. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, a standard reference text in this field. Useful pharmaceutical dosage forms for administration of the compounds of this invention are illustrated as follows: Capsules A large number of unit capsules are prepared by filling standard two-piece hard gelatin capsules each with 100 to 500 milligrams of powdered active ingredient, 5-150 milligrams of lactose, 5-50 milligrams of cellulose, and 6 milligrams magnesium stearate. Soft Gelatin Capsules A mixture of active ingredient in a digestible oil such as soybean oil, cottonseed oil or olive oil is prepared and injected by means of a positive displacement pump into gelatin to form soft gelatin capsules containing 100-500 milligrams of the active ingredient. The capsules are washed and dried. Tablets A large number of tablets are prepared by conventional procedures so that the dosage unit was 100-500 milligrams of active ingredient, 0.2 milligrams of colloidal silicon dioxide, 5 milligrams of magnesium stearate, 50-275 milligrams of microcrystalline cellulose, 11 milligrams of starch and 98.8 milligrams of lactose. Appropriate coatings may be applied to increase palatability or delay absorption. Injectable A parenteral composition suitable for administration by injection is prepared by stirring 1.5% by weight of active ingredient in 10% by volume propylene glycol and water. The solution is made isotonic with sodium chloride and sterilized. Suspension An aqueous suspension is prepared for oral administration so that each 5 ml contain 100 mg of finely divided active ingredient, 200 mg of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, 5 mg of sodium benzoate, 1.0 g of sorbitol solution, U.S.P., and 0.025 ml of vanillin. The present invention also includes pharmaceutical kits useful, for example, for the treatment of HIV infection, which comprise one or more containers containing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a benzimidazole derivative. Such kits may further include, if desired, one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such as, for example, containers with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional containers, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Printed instructions, either as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to be administered, guidelines for administration, and/or guidelines for mixing the components, may also be included in the kit. In the present disclosure it should be understood that the specified materials and conditions are important in practicing the invention but that unspecified materials and conditions are not excluded so long as they do not prevent the benefits of the invention from being realized. One or more benizmidazoles can be used in a single treatment. The benzimidazoles can be combined with other anti-viral agents or potentiators. Potentiators are materials which affect the bodys response to the anti-viral agent. In the case of HIV an adjunct therapy with AZT, TC-3 or the protease inhibitors is preferred. D. Adjunct Therapy One or more benzimidazole derivatives can be combined with other antiviral agents or potentiators. Potentiators are materials which affect the bodys response to the anti-viral agent. In the case of HIV an adjunct therapy with AZT, TC-3 or protease inhibitors is effective. In the case of hepatitis, cyclovir, famciclovir or valacyclovir, Ribavirin, interferon or combinations of Ribavirin and Interferon or beta globulin is administered as an adjunct therapy. For herpes, a recombinant alpha interferon can be used. The adjunct therapy can be sequential, that is the treatment with one agent first and then the second agent, or it can be treatment with both agents at the same time. The sequential therapy can be within a reasonable time after the completion of the first therapy before beginning the second therapy. The treatment with both agents at the same time can be in the same daily dose or in separate doses. For example treatment with one agent on day 1 and the other on day 2. The exact regimen will depend on the disease being treated, the severity of the infection and the response to the treatment. E. Method of Treatment The method of treatment can be any suitable method which is effective in the treatment of the particular virus type that is being treated. Treatment may be oral, rectal, topical, parenteral or intravenous administration and the like. The method of applying an effective amount also varies depending on the virus or viral infection being treated. It is believed that parenteral treatment by intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular application of the benzimidazole compounds, formulated with an appropriate carrier, additional viral inhibiting compound or compounds or diluent to facilitate application will be the preferred method of administering the compounds to warm blooded animals. The method of treating viral infections may also be by oral, rectal, topical, parenteral or intravenous administration. The actual time and dosage will depend on the virus being treated and the desired blood levels. The following examples are illustrative and are not meant to be limiting to the invention. The following examples illustrate the effectiveness of thiabendazole, 2-(4-thiazolyl)-1H-benzimidazole, against HIV and the benzimidazoles derivatives against a number of viruses. Thiabendazole is effective at totally suppressing virus production in chronically infected cells. The extra cellular viral count goes effectively to zero or non-detectable levels. Thiabendazole does not kill the chronically infected cells though it does reduce the rate of cell proliferation at active concentrations. Thiabendazole does not affect CD 4 expression in uninfected cells. At effective concentrations thiabendazole slows but does not alter the normal cellular RNA or protein synthesis of either infected or non-infected cells. Thiabendazole is effective in a variety of chronically infected cell types (this effect is not cell type specific.) Thiabendazole is effective against a variety of HIV virus strains. (Not virus strain specificalthough some variance by strain is observed; SK-1IIIBRF) Also thiabendazole is not effective on SIV in vitro or in vivo. After 20 months no resistant virus strains to thiabendazole have developed in tests designed to do so. Resistance develops in six months or less in this test for existing HIV drugs with resistance strains for protease inhibitors developing in about 3-4 months. Thiabendazole does not adversely affect the activity of existing HIV drugs, AZT, 3TC, ddC, ddl or protease inhibitors (saquinavir and indinavir) in acutely infected cells, nor do any of these existing drugs interfere with the efficacy of thiabendazole in chronically infected cells. It is used in combination with these drugs. Thiabendazole is also effective against protease inhibitor resistant viruses. Thiabendazole confers temporary suppression of viral production from 4 to 80 days after treatment stops. This is unique and a useful feature whenever one has problems with compliance. The results of these studies are summarized in detail below: EXAMPLE 1 HIV Testing HIV Virus Replication Study Thiabendazole was tested in chronically infected HIV virus. These cell populations contain integrated copies of the HIV genome and constitutively produce HIV at relatively high levels (CEM-SK1, U937-SKI and H9-SK1 from Frederick Research Center, Maryland) or are latently infected and only produce virus after stimulation with phorbol esters, tumor necrosis factor or IL6 (U1 and ACH2). Virus products was reduced in all cell lines tested and the compounds did not stimulate virus production form the latently infected cells. Reductions in virus production were observed when quantifying supernatant reverse transcriptase activity, supernatant p24 as well as intracellular p24, indicating the compounds inhibit virus production at a step of replication prior to production of intracellular proteins. Quantification of the infectivity of virions produced from the infected cells demonstrates reductions in the number of infectious virions in parallel with reductions in supernatant RT or p24, indicating that the compounds reduce the amount of virus produced, but not the quality of the virions. Inhibition of virus production from the chronically infected cells was observed at concentrations which were nontoxic to the target class. Thiabendazole inhibited virus production at concentrations great than 1-10 g/ml. Toxicity to the chronically infected cells was similar to that observed with the uninfected cells. Evaluation of thiabendazole on chronically infected cells was performed by evaluation of thymidine (DNA), uridine (RNA) and leucine (protein) incorporation into cellular macromolecules. Inhibition of cellular macromolecule synthesis paralleled the toxicity of the tow compounds as would be expected and did not occur at lower nontoxic concentrations found to inhibit virus production from the chronically infected cells. After 28 days of treatment with these compounds on chronically infected cells, the toxicity of the compounds to the target cells appeared similar in both uninfected and chronically infected cells. The compounds do not preferentially kill HIV-infected cells. Reductions in the level of virus production were stable and were observed at concentration greater than 10 g/ml for thiabendazole. These results suggest that thiabendazole can quickly reduce the level of virus production from cell populations chronically infected with HIV-1 and the antiviral effect is maintained with prolonged compound exposure. This reduction of virus production occurs at concentrations which are nontoxic to the host cell and which have no effect on the synthesis of cellular DNA, RNA and protein. Virus Resistance Studies Chronically infected HIV cells were cultured in the presence of thiabendazole at 1 g/ml for the first month, 5 g/ml for month two, 10 g/ml for the third month, 20 and 40 g/ml for the fourth month and 80 g/ml for the fifth and sixth months. At the end of each month, the cells were evaluated for virus production compared to chronically infected cells not treated with the compounds. For each of the six months of treatment experience, no change in the antiviral effect was noticed and the toxicity of remains identical. Thiabendazole remains active against HIV and that resistance was not rapidly achieved via the selection of resistant viruses or adaptation of the cells to prevent compound induced toxicity. Virus production remains totally suppressed from cultures treated with thiabendazole at 40 and 80 g/ml. Reappearance of Virus Production from Chronically Infected Cells Previously Treated Chronically infected cells which were treated with compound for prolonged periods were washed free of compound and cultured to determine if, and when, virus production would resume. Cultures in which treatment resulted in the total elimination of virus production were used in these assays. These cultures included chronically infected cells cultured in the presence of 20, 40, and 80 g/ml of thiabendazole. Within 4 days virus production resumed from the cells cultured in the presence of the lower concentrations of each compound (20 g/ml and 4 g/ml). Virus production resumed at the 40 g/ml concentration of thiabendazole by day 12. At the highest concentrations virus production was observed at approximately day 70. Infectability of Cells Treated with Thiabendazole Cells which were pretreated with thiabendazole for a long period of time were washed free of compound and used as a target cell population. The cells were split into 3 populations and labeled Group 1,2 or 3. Group I was treated with the compound for 24 hours (at the same concentration used in the prolonged treatment phase), washed free of compound and cultured in the presence of infectious virus and fresh compound. Group 2 was pretreated for 24 hours, washed free of compound and cultured in the presence of infectious virus only. Group 3 was cultured for both the pretreatment and the infection phases in fresh medium only (no virus or compound). Virus production from the cell populations was identical irrespective of the culture conditions. These results indicate that the chronically infected cells treated for prolonged periods were not super infected with HIV. These same benzimidazole derivatives are effective against viruses including other types of HIV, influenza, rhinoviruses and herpes viruses. Additional Chronic HIV studies Chronic HIV-1 infected cells U1 were derived from an acute HIV-1 infection of the promonocytic cell line, U937. The chronic HIV-1 infected cells, ACH-2 were derived from an acute HIV-1 infection of the T cell line, A3.01. These cells were cultured in medium and the phorbol ester, PMA. PMA causes the cells (both U1 and ACH-2) to be activated and not divide but it also causes the U-1 cells to differentiate. This results in fewer cells in the PMA-treated cultures than the media alone cultures. Cell viability was measured when these cell lines were treated with the test compound. Both cell lines constituitively produce a small amount of HIV-1. ACH-2 cell lines tend to produce more HIV-1 than U1 cells as shown by p-24 ELISA. When either cell line is cultured in the presence of PMA there is an increase in the quantity of HIV-1 produced as measured by the p-24 antigen ELISA. In addition, the number of institute positive HIV mRNA expressing cells per microscopic field is measured. Comparisons can be made from these numbers since the same number of cells were adhered to the glass slides for each drug concentration (1010 6 cells/ml). These cells were treated with test samples. Thiabendazole at 60 g/ml suppressed replication in the HIV monocytes by 74% and the T-cell HIV replication was increased by 26%. The positive control was interferon which suppressed HIV monocytes replication by 80%. AZT showed no activity in this model. 2-(Methoxycarbonylamino)benzimidazole suppressed replication in the HIV monocytes by 9% and the T-cell HIV replication was increased by 44%. The positive control was interferon which suppressed HIV monocytes replication by 80% and suppressed T-cell HIV replication by 60%. Acute HIV Testing In an in vitro acute model for HIV 2-(methoxycarbonylamino)benzimidazole inhibited viral replication by 100% at 4 g/ml and AZT inhibited viral replication by 98% at 1 g/ml. 2-(4-thiazolyl)-1H-benzimidazole inhibited viral replication by 98% at 60 g/ml. The therapeutic index (TI), the ratio of the toxic dose of drug to efficacious dose of drug for 2-(4-thiazolyl)-1H-benzimidazole is 2.8 versus 12, 500 for AZT. The TI for 2-(methoxycarbonylamino)benzimidazole is 1.8. In Vivo Herpes In an in vivo herpes screening test of 2-(4-thiazolyl)-1H-benzimidazole at a dose of 200 mg/kg dose, 10% of the mice survived with a 10.4 mean death date; at 100 mg/kg dose 50% of the mice survived with a 9.2 mean death date. The positive control was acyclovir at 75 mg/kg dose; 60% of the mice survived with a mean death date of 17.2 days. In the same test 2-(methoxycarbonylamino)benzimidazole showed no activity. Other Tests Both 2-(4-thiazolyl)-1H-benzimidazole and 2-(methoxycarbonylamino) benzimidazole were tested in an in vitro influenza model and showed no activity. In an in vivo model for influenza 2-(4-thiazolyl)-1H-benzimidazole was tested at 200 mg/kg, 67% of the mice survived with a mean death date of 8 days; at 100 mg/kg, 62% survived with a mean death date of 8.7 days. The positive control was amantadine (75 mg/kg) with 100% of the mice surviving for 21 days. 2-(Methoxycarbonylamino) benzimidazole was not active in the same test. Both 2-(4-thiazolyl)-1H-benzimidazole and 2-(methoxycarbonylamino) benzimidazole were tested in an in vitro herpes model and showed no activity. Both 2-(4-thiazolyl)-1H-benzimidazole and 2-(methoxycarbonylamino) benzimidazole were tested in an in vitro rhinovirus model and compared to A-36683. The therapeutic index (TI), the ratio of the toxic dose of drug to efficacious dose of drug, for 2-(4-thiazolyl)-1H-benzimidazole is 1-2 and for 2-(methoxycarbonylamino) benzimidazole is 1-3 versus 1000-3200 for A-36683.

PGE 2 -sensitive receptors have been sub-divided into four subtypes, EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4, and these receptors have a wide distribution in various tissues. The effects associated with EP1 and EP3 receptors may be considered as excitatory, and are believed to be mediated by stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover or inhibition of adenyl cyclase activity, with resulting decrease in intracellular levels of cyclic AMP. In contrast, the effects associated with EP2 and EP4 receptors may be considered as inhibitory, and are believed to be associated with a stimulation of adenyl cyclase and an increase in levels of intracellular cyclic AMP. Especially, EP4 receptor may be considered to be associated with smooth muscle relaxation, anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory activities, lymphocyte differentiation, antiallergic activities, mesangial cell relaxation or proliferation, gastric or enteric mucus secretion, or the like.

Moreover, the invention relates to methods of controlling harmful fungi with mixtures of the compounds I, II, III and IV and to the use of the compounds I, II, III and IV for the preparation of such mixtures. The compounds of the formula I, their preparation and their action against harmful fungi have been disclosed in the literature (WO-A 96/01,256 and WO-A 96/01,258).

It was an object of the present invention to provide mixtures which display an improved activity against harmful fungi combined with a reduced total amount of active ingredients applied (synergistic mixtures) with a view to reducing the rates of application and to improving the spectrum of action of the known compounds. Accordingly, we have found that this object is achieved by the mixture defined at the outset. Moreover, we have found that better control of the harmful fungi is possible by applying the compounds I and II or III or IV simultaneously together or separately or by applying the compounds I and II or III or IV in succession than when the individual compounds are used. In particular, the formula I represents carbamates in which the combination of the substituents corresponds to one line of the table which follows: TABLE 1 No. T R n I.1 N 2-F I.2 N 3-F I.3 N 4-F I.4 N 2-Cl I.5 N 3-Cl I.6 N 4-Cl I.7 N 2-Br I.8 N 3-Br I.9 N 4-Br I.10 N 2-CH 3 I.11 N 3-CH 3 I.12 N 4-CH 3 I.13 N 2-CH 2 CH 3 I.14 N 3-CH 2 CH 3 I.15 N 4-CH 2 CH 3 I.16 N 2-CH(CH 3 ) 2 I.17 N 3-CH(CH 3 ) 2 I.18 N 4-CH(CH 3 ) 2 I.19 N 2-CF 3 I.20 N 3-CF 3 I.21 N 4-CF 3 I.22 N 2,4-F 2 I.23 N 2,4-Cl 2 I.24 N 3,4-Cl 2 I.25 N 2-Cl, 4-CH 3 I.26 N 3-Cl, 4-CH 3 I.27 CH 2-F I.28 CH 3-F I.29 CH 4-F I.30 CH 2-Cl I.31 CH 3-Cl I.32 CH 4-Cl I.33 CH 2-Br I.34 CH 3-Br I.35 CH 4-Br I.36 CH 2-CH 3 I.37 CH 3-CH 3 I.38 CH 4-CH 3 I.39 CH 2-CH 2 CH 3 I.40 CH 3-CH 2 CH 3 I.41 CH 4-CH 2 CH 3 I.42 CH 2-CH(CH 3 ) 2 I.43 CH 3-CH(CH 3 ) 2 I.44 CH 4-CH(CH 3 ) 2 I.45 CH 2-CF 3 I.46 CH 3-CF 3 I.47 CH 4-CF 3 I.48 CH 2,4-F 2 I.49 CH 2,4-Cl 2 I.50 CH 3,4-Cl 2 I.51 CH 2-Cl, 4-CH 3 I.52 CH 3-Cl, 4-CH 3 The compounds I.12, I.23, I.32 and I.38 are especially preferred. The general formula II particularly represents oxime ethers where X is oxygen and Y is CH or X is amino and Y is N. Compounds II which are furthermore preferred are those where Z is oxygen. Compounds II which are equally preferred are those where R is alkyl and benzyl. Compounds II which are particularly preferred with a view to their use in the synergistic mixtures according to the invention are those compiled in the tables which follow: TABLE B No. ZR II.1 OCH 2 CH 2 CH 3 II.2 OCH(CH 3 ) 2 II.3 OCH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 II.4 OCH(CH 3 )CH 2 CH 3 II.5 OCH 2 CH(CH 3 ) 2 II.6 OC(CH 3 ) 3 II.7 SC(CH 3 ) 3 II.8 OCH(CH 3 )CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 II.9 OCH 2 C(CH 3 ) 3 II.10 OC(Cl)CCl 2 II.11 OCH 2 CHCHCl (trans) II.12 OCH 2 C(CH 3 )CH 2 II.13 OCH 2 (cyclopropyl) II.14 OCH 2 C 6 H 5 II.15 OCH 2 -4-FC 6 H 4 Relative to the CY or CCH or CN double bonds, the compounds of the formulae I, II and III can exist in the E or in the Z configuration (relative to the carboxylic acid function). Accordingly, they can be used in the mixture according to the invention in each case as pure E or Z isomers or as an E/Z isomer mixture. The E/Z isomer mixture or the Z isomer are preferably used, the Z isomer being especially preferred. The CN double bonds of the oxime ether groups in the side chain of the compounds I can exist in each case as the pure E or Z isomers or as E/Z isomer mixtures. The compounds I can be used in the mixtures according to the invention both as isomer mixtures and as pure isomers. Preferred with a view to their use are, in particular, compounds of the formula I where the terminal oxime ether group of the side chain is in the cis configuration (OCH 3 relative to ZR). Due to their basic character, the compounds I, II, III and IV are capable of forming adducts or salts with inorganic or organic acids or with metal ions. Examples of inorganic acids are hydrohalic acids such as hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid and hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid. Suitable organic acids are, for example, formic acid, carbonylic acid and alkanoic acids such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and propionic acid, and also glycolic acid, thiocyanic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, oxalic acid, alkylsulfonic acids (sulfonic acids having straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms), arylsulfonic acids or -disulfonic acids (aromatic radicals such as phenyl and naphthyl which have attached to them one or two sulfo groups), alkylphosphonic acids (phosphonic acids having straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms), arylphosphonic acids or -diphosphonic acids (aromatic radicals such as phenyl and naphthyl which have attached to them one or two phosphornic acid radicals), it being possible for the alkyl or aryl radicals to have attached to them further substituents, eg. p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid, 2-phenoxybenzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid etc. Suitable metal ions are, in particular, the ions of the elements of the second main group, in particular calcium and magnesium, and of the third and fourth main group, in particular aluminum, tin and lead, and of the first to eighth sub-group, in particular chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and others. Especially preferred are the metal ions of the elements of the sub-groups of the fourth period. The metals can in this case be in the various valences which they can assume. When preparing the mixtures, it is preferred to employ the pure active ingredients I, II, III and IV, with which further active ingredients against harmful fungi or other pests such as insects, arachnids or nematodes, or else herbicidal or growth-regulating active ingredients or fertilizers can be admixed, if so desired. The present invention relates to binary mixtures of compounds I with a compound II, III or IV; however, ternary or quaternary mixtures, which comprise 3 or 4 components, respectively, may also be employed. A preferred example of three-component mixtures are mixtures of compounds of the formula I, III and IV, where the compounds IV.1, IV.4, IV.5 and IV.10, especially preferably the compound IV.5 (epoxiconazole), are preferred as component IV. The mixtures of the compounds I and II or III or IV, or the simultaneous joint or separate use of the compounds I, II, III and IV, are distinguished by an outstanding activity against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi, in particular from the classes of the Ascomycetes, Deuteromycetes, Phycomycetes and Basidiomycetes. Some of them act systemically and can therefore be employed as foliar- and soil-acting fungicides. They are especially important for controlling a large number of fungi on a variety of crop plants such as cotton, vegetable species (eg. cucumbers, beans and curcubits), barley, grass, oats, coffee, maize, fruit species, rice, rye, soybeans, grapevine, wheat, ornamentals, sugar cane, and a variety of seeds. They are particularly suitable for controlling the following phytopathogenic fungi: Erysiphe graminis (powdery mildew) on cereals, Erysiphe cichoracearum and Sphaerotheca fuliginea on curcubits, Podosphaera leucotricha on apples, Puccinia species on cereals, Rhizoctonia species on cotton, rice and lawn, Ustilago species on cereals and sugar cane, Venturia inaequalis (scab) on apples, Helminthosporium species on cereals, Septoria nodorum on wheat, Botrytis cinera (gray mold) on strawberries, vegetables, ornamentals and grapevines, Cercospora arachidicola on peanuts, Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides on wheat and barley, Pyricularia oryzae on rice, Phytophthora infestans on potatoes and tomatoes, Pseudoperonospora species on cucurbits and hops, Plasmopara viticola on grapevines, Alternaria species on vegetables and fruit, and Fusarium and Verticillium species. Furthermore, they can be used in the protection of materials (eg. in the protection of wood), for example against Paecilomyces variotii. The compounds I, II, III and IV can be applied simultaneously together or separately or in succession, the sequence, in the case of separate application, generally not having any effect on the result of the control measures. The compounds I and II are normally used in a weight ratio of from 100:1 to 0.1:1, preferably 70:1 to 5:1, in particular 50:1 to 1:1 (II:I). The compounds I and III are normally used in a weight ratio of from 10:1 to 0.1:1, preferably 5:1 to 0.5:1, in particular 3:1 to 0.2:1 (III:I). As a rule, the compounds I and IV are used at a weight ratio of from 10:1 to 0.1:1, preferably 10:1 to 0.2:1, in particular 5:1 to 0.2:1 (IV:I). The application rates of the mixtures according to the invention are, in the case of the compounds I, from 0.005 to 0.5 kg/ha, preferably 0.005 to 0.5 kg/ha, in particular 0.01 to 0.3 kg/ha, depending on the nature of the desired effect. Correspondingly, in the case of the compounds II, the application rates are, as a rule, from 0.1 to 10 kg/ha, preferably 0.5 to 5 kg/ha, in particular 1 to 4 kg/ha. Correspondingly, in the case of the compounds III, the application rates are, as a rule, from 0.01 to 1 kg/ha, preferably 0.05 to 0.5 kg/ha, in particular 0.1 to 0.5 kg/ha. In the case of the compounds IV, the application rates are generally from 0.01 to 1 kg/ha, preferably 0.05 to 1 kg/ha, in particular 0.05 to 0.5 kg/ha. For seed treatment, the application rates of the mixture are generally from 0.001 to 100 g/kg seed, preferably 0.01 to 50 g/kg, in particular 0.01 to 10 g/kg. If phytopathogenic harmful fungi are to be controlled, the separate or joint application of the compounds I and II or III or IV or of the mixtures of the compounds I, II, III and IV is effected by spraying or dusting the seeds, the plants or the soils before or after sowing of the plants, or before or after plant emergence. The fungicidal synergistic mixtures according to the invention, or the compounds I, II, III and IV, can be formulated for example in the form of ready-to-spray solutions, powders and suspensions or in the form of highly concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for spreading or granules, and applied by spraying, atomizing, dusting, spreading or pouring. The use form depends on the intended purpose; in any case, it should guarantee as fine and uniform as possible a distribution of the mixture according to the invention. The formulations are prepared in a manner known per se, eg. by adding solvents and/or carriers. It is usual to admix inert additives, such as emulsifiers or dispersants, with the formulations. Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, eg. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, of alkyl- and alkylarylsulfonates, of alkyl, lauryl ether and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octadecanols or of fatty alcohol glycol ethers, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene, or of the naphthalenesulfonic acids, with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl- or nonylphenol, alkylphenyl polyglycol ethers or tributylphenyl polyglycol ether, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene or polyoxypropylene alkyl ethers, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignin-sulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose. Powders, materials for spreading and dusts can be prepared by mixing or jointly grinding the compounds I and II or III or IV or the mixture of the compounds I and II, III or IV with a solid carrier. Granules (eg. coated granules, impregnated granules or homogeneous granules) are normally prepared by binding the active ingredient, or active ingredients, to a solid carrier. Fillers or solid carriers are, for example, mineral earths such as silica gel, silicas, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, and fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders or other solid carriers. The formulations generally comprise from 0.1 to 95% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 90% by weight, of one of the compounds I, II, III or IV, or of the mixture of the compounds I and II or III or IV. The active ingredients are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum HPLC. The compounds I, II, III, or IV or the mixtures, or the corresponding formulations, are applied by treating the harmful fungi or the plants, seeds, soils, areas, materials or spaces to be kept free from them with a fungicidally active amount of the mixture, or of the compounds I, II, III or IV in the case of separate application. Application can be effected before or after infection by the harmful fungi. The fungicidal activity of the compounds and of the mixtures is demonstrated by the following experiments: The active ingredients, separately or together, are formulated as a 10% emulsion in a mixture of 70% by weight of cyclohexanone, 20% by weight of Nekanil LN (Lutensol AP6, wetting agent having emulsifying and dispersing action based on ethoxylated alkylphenols) and 10% by weight of Emulphor EL (Emulan EL, emulsifier based on ethoxylated fatty alcohols) and diluted with water to give the desired concentration. Evaluation is carried out by determining the infected leaf areas in percent. These percentages are converted into efficacies. The expected efficacies of the mixtures of the active ingredients are determined using Colbys formula R. S. Colby, Weeds 15, 20-22 (1967) and compared with the observed efficacies. Colbys formula: Exyzxyz/100 E expected efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the mixture of the active ingredients A, B and C at concentrations of a, b and c x efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using active ingredient A at a concentration of a y efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using active ingredient B at a concentration of b z efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using active ingredient C at a concentration of c The efficacy (w) is calculated as follows using Abbots formula: w(1)100/ is the fungal infection of the treated plants in % and is the fungal infection of the untreated (control) plants in % An efficacy of 0 means that the infection level of the treated plants corresponds to that of the untreated control plants; an efficacy of 100 means that the treated plants are not infected. EXAMPLES 1-9 Activity Against Puccinia recondita on Wheat (leaf rust of wheat) Leaves of wheat seedlings cv. Frhgold in pots were dusted with leaf rust spores ( Puccinia recondita ). The pots were then placed for 24 hours into a chamber at high atmospheric humidity (90 to 95%) and 20 to 22 C. During this time, the spores germinated, and the germination tubes penetrated the plant tissue. The next day, the infected plants were sprayed to run-off with an aqueous spray mixture made with a stock solution of 10% of active ingredient, 63% of cyclohexanone and 27% of emulsifier. After the spray coating had dried on, the test plants were grown in the greenhouse for 7 days at from 20 to 22 C. and a relative atmospheric humidity of 65 to 70%. The extent of rust development on the leaves was then determined. The visually determined values for the percentage of diseased leaf area were converted into efficacies as % of the untreated control. An efficacy of 0 means the same disease level as in the untreated control. An efficacy of 100 means a disease level of 0%. The expected efficacies for combinations of active ingredients were determined using Colbys formula (Colby, S. R. (Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations, Weeds, 15, p. 20-22, 1967) and compared with the observed efficacies.

The test plants were subsequently placed in a greenhouse at from 20 to 22 C. and a relative atmospheric humidity of 75 to 80%. After 7 days, the extent of mildew development was determined visually as disease level in % of the entire leaf area. The visually determined values for the percentage of diseased leaf area were converted into efficacies as % of the untreated control.

microbicides", "abstract": "Novel oxiranyl-triazolinethiones of the formula in which R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are each as defined in the description, a process for preparing the novel substances and their use as microbicides in crop protection and in the protection of materials. The present invention relates to novel oxiranyl-triazolinethiones, to a process for their preparation and to their uses as microbicides. It is already known that numerous azolylmethyl-oxirane derivatives have fungicidal properties (cf. EP-A 0 094 564, EP-A 0 196 038 and WO-A 96-38 440). Thus, for example, 3-(2-chloro-phenyl)-2-(4-fluoro-phenyl)2-(4,5-dihydro-5-thiono-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-methyl-oxirane can be used for controlling fungi. The activity of this substance is good; however, it is sometimes unsatisfactory at low application rates. This invention, accordingly, provides novel oxiranyl-triazolinethiones of the formula in which R 1 represents alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogenoalkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and 1 to 5Halogen atoms, optionally halogen-substituted cycloalkyl having 3 to 7 carbon atoms, naphthyl or phenyl which is optionally mono- to trisubstituted by identical or different substituents from the group consisting of halogen, nitro, phenyl, phenoxy, alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, alkoxy having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogenoalkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and 1 to 5Halogen atoms, halogenoalkoxy having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and 1 to 5Halogen atoms and halogenoalkylthio having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and 1 to 5Halogen atoms, R 2 represents phenyl which is optionally mono- to trisubstituted by identical or different substituents from the group consisting of halogen, alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, alkoxy having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, halogenoalkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and 1 to 5Halogen atoms, halogenoalkoxy having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and 1 to 5Halogen atoms and halogenoalkylthio having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and 1 to 5Halogen atoms and R 3 represents alkoxyalkyl, isopropyl or n-dodecyl. The substances according to the invention contain two asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms and can therefore be obtained in the form of diastereomers or enantiomers. The present invention relates both to the individual isomers and to their mixtures. Furthermore, it has been found that oxiranyl-triazolinethiones of the formula (I) or (Ia) are obtained when oxirane derivatives of the formula in which R 1 and R 2 are each as defined above are reacted with isocyanates of the formula R 3 NCO(III), in which R 3 is as defined above, if appropriate in the presence of a catalyst and if appropriate in the presence of a diluent. Finally, it has been found that the novel oxiranyl-triazolinethiones of the formula (I) or (Ia) have very good microbicidal properties and can be used both in crop protection and in the protection of materials for controlling undesirable microorganisms. Surprisingly, the oxiranyl-triazolinethiones of the formula (I) or (Ia) according to the invention have better microbicidal activity, in particular fungicidal activity, than the constitutionally most similar prior-art compounds of the same direction of action. Thus, the substances according to the invention surpass 3-(2-chloro-phenyl)-2-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-2-(4,5-dihydro-5-thiono-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-methyl-oxirane with respect to the fungicidal properties. The formula (I) or (Ia) provides a general definition of the oxiranyl-triazolinethiones according to the invention. R 1 preferably represents methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, iso-butyl, tert-butyl, fluoro-tert-butyl, difluoro-tert-butyl, cycloalkyl having 3 to 6 carbon atoms which is optionally mono- to trisubstituted by identical or different substituents from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine and bromine, preferably represents naphthyl or preferably represents phenyl which may be mono- to trisubstituted by identical or different substituents from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, nitro, phenyl, phenoxy, methyl, ethyl, tert-butyl, methoxy, ethoxy, trifluoromethyl, trichloromethyl, difluoromethyl, difluorochloromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, difluoromethoxy and trifluoromethylthio, R 2 preferably represents phenyl which may be mono- to trisubstituted by identical or different substituents from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl, methoxy, ethoxy, trifluoromethyl, trichloromethyl, difluoromethyl, difluorochloromethyl, trifluorometboxy, difluoromethoxy and trifluoromethylthio, and R 3 preferably represents alkoxyalkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkoxy moiety and 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety and also preferably represents isopropyl or n-dodecyl. Particular preference is given to oxiranyl-triazolinethiones of the formula (I) or (Ia) in which R 1 represents phenyl which may be mono- to trisubstituted by identical or different substituents from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, nitro, phenyl, phenoxy, methyl, ethyl, tert-butyl, methoxy, ethoxy, trifluoromethyl, trichloromethyl, difluoromethyl, difluorochloromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, difluoromethoxy and trifluoromethylthio, R 2 represents phenyl which may be mono- to trisubstituted by identical or different substituents from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl, methoxy, ethoxy, trifluoromethyl, trichloromethyl, difluoromethyl, difluorochloromethyl, trifluorometboxy, difluoromethoxy and trifluoromethylthio, and R 3 represents alkoxyalkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkoxy moiety and 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety and also represents isopropyl or n-dodecyl. The substituent definitions mentioned can be combined with one another at will. Moreover, individual definitions may not apply. The oxirane derivatives required as starting materials for preparing the substances according to the invention can be present in the thiono form of the formula or in the tautomeric mercapto form of the formula It is therefore possible that the substances according to the invention can be derived both from the thiono form of the formula (II) and from the mercapto form of the formula (IIa).

These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents, liquefied gases under pressure, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers. If the extender used is water, it is also possible to use for example organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. The following are mainly suitable as liquid solvents: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water. Liquefied gaseous extenders or carriers are to be understood as meaning liquids which are gaseous at standard temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellants such as halogenated hydrocarbons, or else butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Suitable solid carriers are: for example ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates.

The compositions used for protecting industrial materials generally comprise the active compounds in an amount of from 1 to 95% by weight, preferably from 10 to 75% by weight. The use concentrations of the active compounds according to the invention depend on the species and the occurrence of the microorganisms to be controlled, and on the composition of the material to be protected. The optimum amount to be used can be determined by test series. In general, the use concentrations are in the range from 0.001 to 5% by weight, preferably from 0.05 to 1.0% by weight, based on the material to be protected. It is possible to increase the activity and the activity spectrum of the active compounds to be used according to the invention in the protection of materials, or of the compositions, concentrates or, quite generally, formulations preparable therefrom, by adding, if appropriate, other antimicrobially active compounds, fungicides, bactericides, herbicides, insecticides or other active compounds to increase the activity spectrum or to obtain effects, such as, for example, additional protection against insects.

This application is a 371 of PCT/JP98/02579 filed Jun. 11, 1998. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a novel tricyclic pyrrole or pyrazole derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. This invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition which comprises said tricyclic pyrrole or pyrazole derivative or a salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, especially a pharmaceutical composition which is useful as a drug for the prevention and treatment of central nervous system diseases such as sexual disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression and sleeping disorders. BACKGROUND ART With the advance of aging society, improvement and betterment of living conditions for the aged have been reconsidered, so that attention has been focused on the prevention and treatment of diseases which have so far been disregarded as diseases (e.g., sexual disorders and the like). Though the role of the 5-HT 2C receptor which is mainly distributed in the central nerve has not been sufficiently revealed, it is considered that this receptor is related to the central nervous system diseases such as sexual disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression and sleeping disorders ( Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs, 2 (4), 317 (1993)). In consequence, it is believed that the 5-HT 2C receptor ligand is effective for the prevention or treatment of the aforementioned diseases, particularly diseases which have so far been disregarded as diseases and have no effective therapeutic method (e.g., sexual disorders and the like). Regarding tricyclic pyrrole or pyrazole derivatives which are 5-HT 2C receptor ligands, a tricyclic pyrrole derivative fused with a benzene ring (EP 657426-A), a tricyclic pyrazole derivative fused with a benzene ring (EP 700905-A) and the like have been reported. In addition, a tricyclic pyrrole or pyrazole derivative which is fused with a pyrazine ring, a pyridine ring, a thiophene ring, a furan ring or a pyrrole ring is reported as a retinoid antagonist in International Publication WO 96/13478, and a compound having a tricyclic pyrrole or pyrazole nucleus which is fused with an aromatic heterocyclic ring and also has a substituent on a carbon atom of the pyrrole or pyrazole ring in said nucleus is reported as a dopamine receptor ligand in International Publication WO 95/07893. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION As a result of extensive studies on a unknown tricyclic pyrrole or pyrazole derivative in which an amino group is linked at the 1-position via an alkylene chain and which is fused with an unsaturated heterocyclic ring, the inventors of the present invention have found that a novel tricyclic pyrrole or pyrazole derivative was possessed of high selectivity and affinity for the 5-HT 2C receptor and accomplished the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a novel tricyclic pyrrole or pyrazole derivative represented by the following general formula (I) which shows high selectivity and affinity for the 5-HT 2C receptor, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (each symbol in the above formula means as follows; Y ring: an unsaturated five-membered ring which may have 1 to 3 of one or more types of hetero atom(s) each selected from the group consisting of a nitrogen atom, an oxygen atom and a sulfur atom or an unsaturated six-membered ring having 1 or 2 nitrogen atom(s), X: a bond or a carbon atom, V: a nitrogen atom or a group represented by a formula CH, A: a straight or branched lower alkylene group which may be substituted with a halogen atom or a cycloalkyl group, R 1 and R 2 : may be the same or different from each other and each represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, or R 1 and R 2 or A may form a nitrogen-containing saturated heterocyclic ring together with the adjacent nitrogen atom, R 3 and R 4 : may be the same or different from each other and each represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a hydroxyl group, a lower alkoxy group, an amino group, a mono- or di-lower alkylamino group, a lower alkanoylamino group or a halogen atom, and R 5 to R 9 : may be the same or different from one another and each represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, a hydroxyl group or a lower alkoxy group, with the proviso that, when 6 and R 9 do not exist and that, when X is a bond, then 7 and R 8 do not exist).

This reaction can be carried out under a cooling to heating condition, if necessary in a sealed reaction tube, in the presence or absence of an appropriate solvent and if necessary in the presence of an appropriate base. Production method 2 (In the above reaction scheme, R 3-9 , V, X, Y, The compound (I) of the present invention can be produced by reducing a nitrile compound represented by the general formula (III). This reaction can be carried out under a cooling to heating condition, preferably at room temperature, using an appropriate reducing agent in the presence or absence of an appropriate inert solvent such as diethyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, methylene chloride, benzene or toluene, preferably ethers (e.g., tetrahydrofuran and the like), and if necessary in the presence of an appropriate Lewis acid. Aluminum chloride or the like can be used as the Lewis acid, and complex hydride (e.g., lithium aluminum hydride) can be used as the reducing agent. Alternatively, this reaction can be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation on a metal catalyst, preferably palladium-carbon catalyst, platinum oxide or Raney nickel, using an appropriate solvent such as ethyl acetate, an alcohol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetic acid or a mixture thereof. Production Method 3 (In the above reaction scheme, R 1 , R 3-9 , V, X, Y, The compound (I) of the present invention can be produced by reduction or deprotection of a compound represented by the general formula (IV). When E is an azido group or the like, this reduction can be carried out under a cooling to heating condition, preferably at room temperature, using an appropriate reducing agent in the presence or absence of the same appropriate inert solvent used in the production method 2, preferably in ether (e.g., tetrahydrofuran and the like), and if necessary in the presence of an appropriate Lewis acid such as aluminum chloride. As the reducing agent, complex hydride (e.g., lithium aluminum hydride) can be used. Alternatively, this reaction can be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation on a metal catalyst, preferably palladium-carbon catalyst, platinum oxide or Raney nickel, using an appropriate solvent such as ethyl acetate, an alcohol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetic acid or a mixture thereof, or by using triphenylphosphine. When E is a nitro group or the like, the reduction can be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation on a metal catalyst using an appropriate solvent such as ethyl acetate, an alcohol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetic acid or a mixture thereof. Alternatively, this reaction can be carried out under a cooling to heating condition in the presence or absence of an appropriate solvent and in the presence of an acid catalyst using a metal (e.g., iron or tin). When E is a group such as an amino group protected with a commonly used protecting group, it can be converted into amino group by carrying out its deprotection in the usual way. For example, when the protecting group is a phthalimido group, an acetamido group, or the like, a similar method described in Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley Sons, Inc. can be used, and when the protecting group is benzyloxycarbonyl group, a usual reduction method can be used. Production Method 4 (In the above reaction scheme, R 1-9 , V, X, Y, The compound (I) of the present invention can be produced by N-alkylation of the compound of general formula (Ia) produced in the production methods 2 and 3. This reaction can be carried out under a cooling to heating condition in the presence or absence of an appropriate solvent using an appropriate alkylation agent, preferably a lower alkyl halide (e.g., propyl iodide), if necessary in the presence of an appropriate base as an acid scavenger. Alternatively, a reductive alkylation reaction can be carried out as the alkylation reaction. That is, the starting compound can be reacted with an appropriate lower alkyl aldehyde (e.g., propanal) under a cooling to heating condition in the presence or absence of an appropriate inert solvent, using a reducing agent such as a boron hydride reagent (e.g., sodium triacetoxyborohydride), if necessary in the presence of an acid catalyst, preferably an inorganic or organic acid.

Its isolation and purification can be carried out by employing generally used chemical methods such as extraction, concentration, evaporation, crystallization, filtration, recrystallization and various chromatographic techniques. Various types of isomers can be separated by selecting appropriate starting material compound or making use of the difference in physical properties between isomers. For example, optical isomers can be prepared as stereochemically pure isomers by selecting appropriate starting material or can be separated by carrying out racemic resolution of racemic compound (e.g., a method in which a compound is derived into diastereomer salts with a general optically active acid and then subjected to optical resolution). In addition to the compounds which will be described later in the Examples, the following compounds can be obtained without requiring special experiments, using the aforementioned production methods, the production methods of the Examples and Reference Examples of this invention, the production methods known to those skilled in the art and modifications thereof. 2-(6-Methoxy-1H-thieno3,4-gindazol-1-yl)ethylamine, 2-(1H-pyrazolo3,4-e1,2benzisothiazol-1-yl)ethylamine, 2-(1H-pyrazolo3,4-dbenzofurazan-1-yl)ethylamine, 2-(1H-pyrazolo3,4-d-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-1-yl)ethylamine, 2-(7-methoxy-1H,6H-pyrrolo2,3-gindazol-1-yl)ethylamine, 2-(1H,6H-pyrazolo3,4-ebenzimidazol-1-yl)ethylamine and 2-(1H,6H-pyrazolo3,4-ebenzotriazol-1-yl)ethylamine. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY Since the compound of the present invention has strong affinity and selectivity for the 5-HT 2C receptor and is effective in animal models, it is useful for the treatment of central nervous system diseases such as sexual disorders (e.g., impotence and the like), eating disorders (e.g., obesity, bulimia, anorexia and the like), anxiety, depression and sleeping disorders. Selectivity and affinity of the compound of the present invention for the 5-HT 2C receptor and its evaluation in an animal model using rats were confirmed by the following methods. A. Binding test The 5-HT 2C and 5-HT 2A receptors: Carried out by 3 H 5-HT binding assay in accordance with the method of A. Pazos et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 106, 539-546 (1985) or S. Havlik and S. J. Peroutka, Brain Res., 584, 191-196 (1992). Using the above method, a drug concentration which inhibits 50% of receptor binding of ligand (IC 50 value) was calculated, and a Ki value which represents affinity for the receptor was obtained by the following formula. KiIC 50 /(1 L/Kd ) (L: ligand concentration, Kd: dissociation constant) The results are shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 Binding test (Ki, nM) Test compound 5-HT 2C receptor 5-HT 2A receptor Example 20 0.8 18 Example 37 0.5 8.7 Example 55 4.1 50 Thus, the compound of the present invention showed high affinity for the 5-HT 2C receptor and about 10 times higher selectivity in comparison with that for the 5-HT 2A receptor. B. Animal Test Using Rats Induction of penile erection in rats: It is known that penile erection is induced by the 5-HT 2C receptor stimulation (Berendsen Broekkamp, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 135, 179-184 (1987)). Test compound was administered to rats, and the frequency of penile erection during 30 minutes after the administration was measured to obtain the minimum effective dose by which statistically significant reaction was observed. As the result, compounds showing high activity, as a minimum effective dose of from 0.003 to 1 mg/kg, sc, were found among the compounds of the present invention. Thus, the compound of the present invention is effective in an animal model using rats and therefore is useful for the treatment of central nervous system diseases such as sexual disorders (e.g., impotence and the like). The pharmaceutical composition which contains one or two or more of the compound (I) of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, hydrates thereof, solvates thereof and the like as the active ingredient is prepared into tablets, powders, fine granules, granules, capsules, pills, solutions, injections, suppositories, ointments, adhesive preparations and the like by using commonly used pharmaceutical carriers, fillers and other additives and administered orally (including sublingual administration) or parenterally. Clinical dose of the compound (I) of the present invention in human is optionally decided by taking into consideration symptoms, weight, age, sex and the like of each patient to be treated, as well as the route of administration and the like, but the compound may be orally administered in a dose of generally from 10 mg to 1,000 mg, preferably from 50 mg to 200 mg, per day per adult, and the daily dose may be divided into 1 to several doses per day, or administered by intravenous injection in a dose of generally from 1 mg to 500 mg, preferably from 5 mg to 100 mg, per day per adult, and the daily dose may be divided into 1 to several doses per day or administered by intravenous drip infusion within the range of from 1 hour to 24 hours per day. Since the dosage varies under various conditions as described in the foregoing, a smaller dosage than the above range may be sufficient enough in some cases. The solid composition for use in the oral administration according to the present invention is used in the form of tablets, powders, granules and the like. In such a solid composition, one or more active substances are mixed with at least one inert diluent such as lactose, mannitol, glucose, hydroxypropylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, polyvinyl pyrrolidone or aluminum magnesium silicate. In the usual way, the composition may contain other additives than the inert diluent, such as lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate), disintegrating agents (e.g., calcium cellulose glycolate), stabilizing agents (e.g., lactose) and solubilization assisting agents (e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid). If necessary, tablets or pills may be coated by sugar coating or with a film of a gastric or enteric substance, such as sucrose, gelatin, hydroxypropylcellulose or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate. The liquid composition for use in oral administration includes pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, elixirs and the like and contains a generally used inert diluent such as purified water or ethanol. In addition to the inert diluent, this composition may also contain auxiliary agents such as a solubilizing or solubilization assisting agent, a moistening agent and a suspending agent, as well as sweeteners, flavors, aromatics and antiseptics. The injections for use in parenteral administration include aseptic aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions and emulsions. Examples of the diluent for use in the aqueous solutions and suspensions include distilled water for injection use and physiological saline. Examples of the diluent for use in the non-aqueous solutions and suspensions include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, plant oil (e.g., olive oil), alcohol (e.g.,. ethanol) and polysorbate 80 (trade name). Such a composition may further contain additive agents such as a tonicity agent, an antiseptic, a moistening agent, an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent, a stabilizing agent (e.g., lactose) and a solubilizing or solubilization assisting agent. These compositions are sterilized by filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, blending of a germicide or irradiation. Alternatively, they may be used by firstly making into sterile solid compositions and then dissolving them in sterile water or a sterile solvent for injection use prior to their use.

mixtures", "abstract": "A fungicidal mixture, comprising a) a carbamate of the formula I, in which X is CH or N, n is 0, 1 or 2 and Y is halogen, C 1 -C 4 -alkyl or C 1 -C 4 -haloalkyl, it being possible for the radicals Y to be different if n is 2, or a salt or adduct thereof, and b) an oxime ether carboxamide of the formula II in which R represents hydrogen or halogen in a synergistically effective amount. This application is a 371 of PCT/EP98/02911, filed May 18, 1998. The present invention relates to a fungicidal mixture which comprises a) a carbamate of the formula I, in which X is CH or N, n is 0, 1 or 2 and Y is halogen, C 1 -C 4 -alkyl or C 1 -C 4 -haloalkyl, it being possible for the radicals Y to be different if n is 2, or a salt or adduct thereof, and b) an oxime ether carboxamide of the formula II in which R represents hydrogen or halogen in a synergistically effective amount. Moreover, the invention relates to methods for controlling harmful fungi using mixtures of the compounds I and II and to the use of the compounds I and the compounds II for preparing such mixtures. The compounds of the formula I, their preparation and their activity against harmful fungi are disclosed in the literature (WO-A 93/15,046; WO-A 96/01,256 and WO-A 96/01,258). Also disclosed are the compounds of the formula II, their preparation and their activity against harmful fungi (WO-A 95/18,789). It is an object of the present invention to provide mixtures which have improved activity against harmful fungi combined with a reduced total amount of active ingredients applied (synergistic mixtures), with a view to reducing the application rates and to improving the activity spectrum of the known compounds I and II. We have found that this object is achieved by the mixture defined at the outset. Moreover, we have found that better control of harmful fungi is possible by applying the compounds I and the compounds II simultaneously, that is either together or separately, or by applying the compounds I and the compounds II in succession than when the individual compounds are used. The formula I in particular represents carbamates in which the combination of the substituents corresponds to a row of the following table: No. X Y n I.1 N 2-F I.2 N 3-F I.3 N 4-F I.4 N 2-Cl I.5 N 3-Cl I.6 N 4-Cl I.7 N 2-Br I.8 N 3-Br I.9 N 4-Br I.10 N 2-CH 3 I.11 N 3-CH 3 I.12 N 4-CH 3 I.13 N 2-CH 2 CH 3 I.14 N 3-CH 2 CH 3 I.15 N 4-CH 2 CH 3 I.16 N 2-CH(CH 3 ) 2 I.17 N 3-CH(CH 3 ) 2 I.18 N 4-CH(CH 3 ) 2 I.19 N 2-CF 3 I.20 N 3-CF 3 I.21 N 4-CF 3 I.22 N 2,4-F 2 I.23 N 2,4-Cl 2 I.24 N 3,4-Cl 2 I.25 N 2-Cl, 4-CH 3 I.26 N 3-Cl, 4-CH 3 I.27 CH 2-F I.28 CH 3-F I.29 CH 4-F I.30 CH 2-Cl I.31 CH 3-Cl I.32 CH 4-Cl I.33 CH 2-Br I.34 CH 3-Br I.35 CH 4-Br I.36 CH 2-CH 3 I.37 CH 3-CH 3 I.38 CH 4-CH 3 I.39 CH 2-CH 2 CH 3 I.40 CH 3-CH 2 CH 3 I.41 CH 4-CH 2 CH 3 I.42 CH 2-CH(CH 3 ) 2 I.43 CH 3-CH(CH 3 ) 2 I.44 CH 4-CH(CH 3 ) 2 I.45 CH 2-CF 3 I.46 CH 3-CF 3 I.47 CH 4-CF 3 I.48 CH 2,4-F 2 I.49 CH 2,4-Cl 2 I.50 CH 3,4-Cl 2 I.51 CH 2-Cl, 4-CH 3 I.52 CH 3-Cl, 4-CH 3 Particular preference is given to the compounds I.12, I.23, I.32 and I.38. In the formula II, R is hydrogen or a halogen atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, especially hydrogen, fluorine and chlorine, in particular hydrogen or fluorine. In relation to the CN double bonds, the compounds of the formula II can be present in the E or the Z configuration (in relation to the carboxylic acid function). Accordingly, they can be used in the mixture according to the invention in each case either in the form of a pure E or Z isomer or else in the form of an E/Z isomer mixture. The E/Z isomer mixture or the E isomer is preferably used, the E isomer being especially preferred. The CN double bonds of the oxime ether groups in the side chain of the compounds II can exist in each case in the form of pure E or Z isomers or in the form of E/Z isomer mixtures. The compounds II can be used in the mixtures according to the invention as isomer mixtures or else as the pure isomers. With a view to their use, compounds II which are particularly preferred are those where both oxime ether groups in the side chain are in the E configuration (E/E). Owing to the basic character of their nitrogen atoms, the compounds I and II are capable of forming salts or adducts with inorganic or organic acids or with metal ions. Examples of inorganic acids are hydrohalic acids such as hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid and hydriodic acid, and furthermore, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid. Suitable organic acids are, for example, formic acid, carboxylic acid and alkanoic acids, such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and propionic acid, and also glycolic acid, thiocyanic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, oxalic acid, alkylsulfonic acids (sulfonic acids having straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals of 1 to 20 carbon atoms), arylsulfonic acids or aryl disulfonic acids (aromatic radicals, such as phenyl and naphtbyl which carry one or two sulfo groups), alkylphosphonic acids (phosphonic acids having straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals of 1 to 20 carbon atoms), arylphosphonic acids or aryl diphosphonic acids (aromatic radicals such as phenyl and naphthyl, which carry one or two phosphonic acid radicals), it being possible for the alkyl or aryl radicals to carry further substituents, for example p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, p-amino salicylic acid, 2-phenoxybenzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, etc. Suitable metal ions are, in particular, the ions of the elements of the first to eighth sub-groups, in particular chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, and furthermore of the second main group, in particular calcium and magnesium, and of the third and fourth main groups, in particular aluminum, tin and lead. The metals can exist in the various valencies which they can assume. When preparing the mixtures, it is preferred to employ the pure active ingredients I and II, to which further active ingredients against harmful fungi or other pests, such as insects, arachnids or nematodes, or else herbicidal or growth-regulating active ingredients or fertilizers can be admixed, if so required. The mixtures of the compounds I and II, or the simultaneous joint and separate use of the compounds I and II, exhibit outstanding activity against a wide range of phytopathogenic fungi, in particular from the classes of the ascomycetes, basidiomycetes, phycomycetes and deuteromycetes. Some of them act systemically and can therefore be employed as foliar and soil-acting fungicides. They are especially important for controlling a large number of fungi in a variety of crop plants, such as cotton, vegetable species (e.g. cucumbers, beans, tomatoes, potatoes and cucurbits) barley, grass, oats, bananas, coffee, maize, fruit species, rice, rye, soya, grapevine, wheat, ornamentals, sugarcane and a variety of seeds. They are particularly suitable for controlling the following phytopathogenic fungi: Erysiphe graminis (powdery mildew) in cereals, Erysiphe cichoracearum and Sphaerotheca fuliginea in. cucurbits), Podosphaera leucotricha in apples, Uncinula necator in grapevines, Puccinia species in cereals, Rhizoctonia species in cotton, rice and lawns, Ustilago species in cereals and sugarcane, Venturia inaequalis (scab) in apples, Helminthosporium species in cereals, Septoria nodorum in wheat, Botrytis cinerea (gray mold) in strawberries, vegetables, ornamentals and grapevines, Cercospora arachidicola in groundnuts, Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides in wheat and barley, Pyricularia oryzae in rice, Phytophthora infestans in potatoes and tomatoes, Plasmopara viticola in grapevines, Pseudoperonospora species in hops and cucumbers, Alternaria species in vegetables and fruit, Mycosphaerella species in bananas and Fusarium and Verticillium species. Furthermore, they can be used in the protection of materials (e.g. in the protection of wood), for example against Paecilomyces variotii. The compounds I and II can be applied simultaneously, either together or separately, or in succession, the sequence, in the case of separate application, generally not having any effect on the result of the control measures. The compounds I and II are usually used in a weight ratio of 10:1 to 0.1:1, preferably 5:1 to 0.2:1, in particular 3:1 to 0.3:1. Depending on the kind of effect desired, the application rates of the mixtures according to the invention are, in particular in agricultural crops, from 0.01 to 8 kg/ha, preferably 0.1 to 5 kg/ha, in particular 0.1 to 3.0 kg/ha. The application rates of the compounds I are from 0.01 to 1 kg/ha, preferably 0.05 to 0.5 kg/ha, in particular 0.05 to 0.3 kg/ha. Correspondingly, in the case of the compounds II, the application rates are from 0.01 to 1 kg/ha, preferably 0.02 to 0.5 kg/ha, in particular 0.05 to 0.3 kg/ha. For seed treatment, the application rates of the mixture are generally from 0.001 to 250 g/kg of seed, preferably 0.01 to 100 g/kg, in particular 0.01 to 50 g/kg. If phytopathogenic harmful fungi are to be controlled, the separate or joint application of the compounds I and II or of the mixtures of the compounds I and II is effected by spraying or dusting the seeds, the plants or the soils before or after sowing of the plants, or before or after plant emergence. The fungicidal synergistic mixtures according to the invention, or the compounds I and II, can be formulated, for example in the form of ready-to-spray solutions, powders and suspensions or in the form of highly concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for broadcasting or granules, and applied by spraying, atomizing, dusting, broadcasting or watering. The use form depends on the intended purpose; in any case, it should guarantee as fine and uniform a distribution as possible of the mixture according to the invention. The formulations are prepared in a manner known per se, e.g. by adding solvents and/or carriers. It is usual to admix inert additives, such as emulsifiers or dispersants, with the formulations. Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, e.g. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, alkyl- and alkylarylsulfonates, alkyl sulfates, lauryl ether sulfates and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octadecanols, or of fatty alcohol glycol ethers, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene or of the naphthalenesulfonic acids with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenol ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl- or nonylphenol, alkylphenol polyglycol ethers, tributylphenyl polyglycol ethers, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers or polyoxypropylene alkyl, ethers alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignosulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose. Powders, materials for broadcasting and dusts can be prepared by mixing or jointly grinding the compounds I or II or the mixture of the compounds I and II with a solid carrier. Granules (e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules or homogeneous granules) are usually prepared by binding the active ingredient, or active ingredients, to a solid carrier. Fillers or solid carriers are, for example, mineral earths, such as silicic acids, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, and fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders or other solid carriers. The formulations generally comprise from 0.1 to 95% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 90% by weight, of one of the compounds I or II or of the mixture of the compounds I and II. The active ingredients are employed in a purity from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum or HPLC). The compounds I or II, or the mixtures, or the corresponding formulations, are applied by treating the harmful fungi, their habitat, or the plants, seeds, soils, areas, materials or spaces to be kept free from them with a fungicidally effective amount of the mixture, or of the compounds I and II in the case of separate application. The application can be effective before or after infection by the harmful fungi. The synergistic activity of the mixtures according to the invention was demonstrated by the following experiments: USE EXAMPLE 1 Curative activity against Puccinia recondita on wheat (wheat leaf rust) Leaves of potted wheat seedlings of the variety Frhgold were dusted with spores of leaf rust ( Puccinia recondita ). Thereafter, the pots were kept for 24 hours in a chamber of high atmospheric humidity (90 to 95%) and 20 to 22 C. During this time, the spores germinated and the germinal tubes penetrated into the leaf tissue. The next day, the infected plants were sprayed to run off point with an aqueous formulation of active ingredient prepared from a stock solution consisting of 10% of active ingredient, 63% of cyclohexanone and 27% of emulsifier. After the spray coating had dried on, the test plants were kept for 7 days in a greenhouse at from 20 to 22 C. and 65 to 70% of relative atmospheric humidity. Thereafter, the extent of rust fungus development on the leaves was determined. Evaluation was carried out by determining the infected leaf areas in percent. These percentages were converted into efficacy. The efficacy (E) was calculated as follows, using Abbots formula: E(1 )100/ corresponds to the fungal infection of the treated plants in % and corresponds to the fungal infection of the untreated (control) plants in % An efficacy of 0 means that the infection level of the treated plants corresponds to that of the untreated control plants; an efficacy of 100 means that the treated plants were not infected. The expected efficacies of the active ingredient mixtures were determined using Colbys formula R. S. Colby, Weeds 15, 20-22 (1967) and compared with the observed efficacies. Colbys formula:Exyxy/100 E expected efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the mixture of the active ingredients A and B at the concentrations a and b x efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using active ingredient A at a concentration of a y efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using active ingredient B at a concentration of b The test results are shown in Tables 2 and 3.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to new N-(indolyl-cycloalkyl) azetidine derivatives which are useful as pharmaceuticals for the treatment of diseases caused by disorders of the scrotonin-affected neurological systems, such as depression and anxiety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Pharmaceuticals which enhance serotonergic neurotransmission are useful for the treatment of many psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety. The first generation of non-selective serotonin-affecting drugs operated through a variety of physiological functions which endowed them with several side-effect liabilities. The more currently prescribed drugs, the selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), act predominately by inhibiting 5-HT, which is released at the synapses, from being actively removed from the synaptic cleft via a presynaptic scrotonin transport carrier. The present invention relates to a new class of molecules which have the ability to act at the 5-HT transporter. Such compounds are therefore potentially useful for the treatment of depression as well as other serotonin disorders. Described in WO 95/20588 are compounds of general formula: Wherein R and R 1 are each independently hydrogen or C 1-4 alkyl, or R and R 1 are linked to form an azetidine ring.

The present invention accordingly provides methods of treatment or prevention of these maladies, the methods comprising administering to a mammal, preferably a human, in need thereof pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound of this invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. This invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise one or more compounds of this invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination or association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients. The compositions are preferably adapted for oral or subcutaneous administration. However, they may be adapted for other modes of administration. The compositions of the invention may be formulated with conventional excipients, such as a filler, a disintegrating agent, a binder, a lubricant, a flavoring agent and the like. They are formulated in conventional manner, for example, in a manner similar to that use for known antihypertensive agents, diuretics and -blocking agents. Applicable solid carriers or excipients can include one or more substances which may also act as flavoring agents, lubricants, solubilizers, suspending agents, fillers, glidants, compression aids, binders or tablet-disintergrating agents or an encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the finely divided active ingredient. In tablets, the active ingredient is mixed with a carrier having the necessary compression properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain up to 99% of the active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include, for example, calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine, low melting waxes and ion exchange resins. Liquid carriers may be used in preparing solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups and elixirs. The active ingredient of this invention can be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as water, an organic solvent, a mixture of both or pharmaceutically acceptable oils or fat. The liquid carrier can contain other suitable pharmaceutical additives such as solubilizers, emulsifiers, buffers, preservatives, sweeteners, flavoring agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, colors, viscosity regulators, stabilizers or osmo-regulators. Suitable examples of liquid carriers for oral and parenteral administration include water (particularly containing additives as above e.g. cellulose derivatives, preferably sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols e.g. glycols) and their derivatives, and oils (e.g. fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil). For parenteral administration the carrier can also be an oily ester such as ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate. Sterile liquid carriers are used in sterile liquid form compositions for parenteral administration. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions which are sterile solutions or suspensions can be utilized by, for example, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection. Sterile solutions can also be administered intravenously. Oral administration may be either liquid or solid composition form. Preferably the pharmaceutical composition is in unit dosage form, e.g. as tablets or capsules. In such form, the composition is sub-divided in unit dose containing appropriate quantities of the active ingredient; the unit dosage forms can be packaged compositions, for example packeted powders, vials, ampoules, prefilled syringes or sachets containing liquids. The unit dosage form can be, for example, a capsule or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any such compositions in package form. In order to obtain consistency of administration, it is preferred that a composition of the invention is in the form of a pharmaceutically effective unit dose. Suitable unit dose forms include tablets, capsules and powders in sachets or vials. Such unit dose forms may contain from 0.1 to 100 mg of a compound of the invention and preferably from 2 to 50 mg. Still further preferred unit dosage forms contain 5 to 25 mg of a compound of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention can be administered orally at a dose range of about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg or preferably at a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. Such compositions may be administered from 1 to 6 times a day, more usually from 1 to 4 times a day. The following specific examples illustrate the synthetic procedures for the preparation of intermediates and invention compounds and should not be construed as limiting the scope of this disclosure. Those skilled in the art of organic synthesis may be aware of still other routes to prepare compounds of this invention. Reactants and intermediates are either commercially available or can be prepared according to standard literature procedures. In accordance with the present invention, compounds of formula I may be prepared by Scheme I. Thus, a compound of formula (2) is reacted with a compound of formula (3) in the presence of a reducing reagent such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride, and acetic acid in a solvent such as dichloroethane at 23 C. to give a compound of formula I in accordance with the procedure described by Abdel-Magid, Carson, Harris, Maryanoff and Shah in J. Org. Chem . 1996, 61, 3849. In accordance with the present invention, compounds of formula (3) may be prepared by Scheme II. Thus a compound of formula (4) is reacted with 1,4-cyclohexanedione monoethylene ketal, potassium hydroxide in methanol at 65 C. to give compounds of formula (5) as described by Wustrow et al. in J. Med. Chem . 1997, 40, 250. Hydrogenation to a compound of formula (6) can be realized by treatment in suitable solvents such as an alcohol, but not limited to ethanol with H 2 and 5% Pd/C. Hydrolysis to a compound of formula (3) can be carried out using 1N HCl in a 1:1 mixture of THF and water. In accordance with the present invention, compounds of formula (2) may be prepared by Scheme III. Thus, a compound of formula (7) is prepared by reaction of N-benzhydryl-3-hydroxyazetidine with methanesulfonyl chloride and triethylamine in a solvent such as dichloromethane. Compound (7) is reacted with a compound of formula (9) in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in a solvent such as acetonitrile to yield a compound of formula (8). Deprotection of the azetidine nitrogen with ammonium formate in an alcoholic solvent such as methanol yields a compound of formula (2). Compounds of formula (2) where X is NR are prepared according to scheme IV. Standard N-alkylation methods may be used to convert a compound of formula (9) where R is hydrogen to a compound of formula (9) where R is alkyl. While the reaction schemes above show intermediates substituted only by R 3 groups, the presence of optional R 4 and R 5 groups in these compounds is understood. The present invention further provides a compound of the invention for use as an active therapeutic substance. Compounds of formula I are of particular use in the treatment of diseases affected by disorders of the serotonin. The present invention further provides a method of treating depression and anxiety in mammals including man, which comprises administering to the afflicted mammal an effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutical composition of the invention. The following examples are presented to illustrate rather than limit the present invention. EXAMPLES The 5-HT transporter affinity of the compounds of this invention was established in accordance with standard pharmaceutically accepted test procedures with representative compounds as follows: Rat Brain 3 H-Paroxetine Binding Assay (RB 5HT Transporter): The following assay was used to determine a compounds affinity for the 5-HT transporter. A protocol similar to that used by Cheetham et. al. ( Neuropharmacol . 1993, 32, 737) was used. Briefly, frontal cortical membranes prepared from male S.D. rats were incubated with 3 H-paroxetine (0.1 nM) for 60 min. at 25 C. All tubes also contained either vehicle, test compound (one to eight concentrations), or a saturating concentration of fluoxetine (10 M) to define specific binding. All reactions are terminated by the addition of ice cold Tris buffer followed by rapid filtration using a Tom Tech filtration device to separate bound from free 3 H-paroxetine. Bound radioactivity was quantitated using a Wallac 1205 Beta Plate counter. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine IC 50 values which were converted to K i values using the method of Cheng and Prusoff ( Biochem. Pharmacol . 1973, 22, 3099): Inhibition of 3 H-5-HT Uptake by cells Possessing the Human 5-HT Transporter (HC 5HT Transporter): A human carcinoma cell line (Jar cells) possessing low endogenous levels of the 5-HT-transporter are seeded into 96 well plates and treated with staurosporine at least 18 h prior to assay. Staurosporine greatly increases the expression of the 5-HT-transporter. On the day of assay, vehicle, excess of fluoxetine, or test compound is added to various wells on the plate. All wells then receive 3 H-5-HT and are incubated at 37 C. for 5 min. The wells are then washed with ice cold 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4) buffer and aspirated to remove free 3 H-5-HT. 25 l of 0.25 M NaOH is then added to each well to lyse the cells and 75 l scintillation cocktail (Microscint 20) added prior to quantitation on a Packard TopCount machine. Tubes with vehicle represent total possible uptake, radioactivity counted in tubes with fluoxetine represent nonspecific binding/uptake and is subtracted from the total possible uptake to give total possible specific uptake. This nonspecific binding (usual low in number) is then subtracted from the counts obtained in wells with various test compounds (or different concentrations of test drug) to give specific uptake in the presence of drug. Specific uptake is then expressed as a % of control values and is analyzed using nonlinear regression analysis (Prizm) to determine IC 50 values. If the compound is active at inhibiting 5-HT uptake, its counts will be close to that obtained with fluoxetine. Results from these two assays are presented below in Table I.

Starting from corresponding hydroxides or carbonates, salts with alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, for example, sodium, potassium, magnesium, or calcium are formed. Salts with quaternary ammonium ions can also be prepared with, for example, the tetramethyl-ammonium ion. Prodrugs of compounds I-VIII are included in the scope of the instant invention. Aminoacyl-glycolic and -lactic esters are known as prodrugs of amino acids (Wermuth C. G., Chemistry and Industry , 1980:433-435). The carbonyl group of the amino acids can be esterified by known means. Prodrugs and soft drugs are known in the art (Palomino E., Drugs of the Future , 1990;15(4):361-368). The last two citations are hereby incorporated by reference. The effectiveness of an orally administered drug is dependent upon the drugs efficient transport across the mucosal epithelium and its stability in entero-hepatic circulation. Drugs that are effective after parenteral administration but less effective orally, or whose plasma half-life is considered too short, may be chemically modified into a prodrug form. A prodrug is a drug which has been chemically modified and may be biologically inactive at its site of action, but which may be degraded or modified by one or more enzymatic or other in vivo processes to the parent bioactive form. This chemically modified drug, or prodrug, should have a different pharmacokinetic profile to the parent, enabling easier absorption across the mucosal epithelium, better salt formulation and/or solubility, improved systemic stability (for an increase in plasma half-life, for example). These chemical modifications may be 1) ester or amide derivatives which may be cleaved by, for example, esterases or lipases. For ester derivatives, the ester is derived from the carboxylic acid moiety of the drug molecule by known means. For amide derivatives, the amide may be derived from the carboxylic acid moiety or the amine moiety of the drug molecule by known means. 2) peptides which may be recognized by specific or nonspecific proteinases. A peptide may be coupled to the drug molecule via amide bond formation with the amine or carboxylic acid moiety of the drug molecule by known means. 3) derivatives that accumulate at a site of action through membrane selection of a prodrug form or modified prodrug form, 4) any combination of 1 to 3. Current research in animal experiments has shown that the oral absorption of certain drugs may be increased by the preparation of soft quaternary salts. The quaternary salt is termed a soft quaternary salt since, unlike normal quaternary salts, e.g., RN (CH 3 ) 3 , it can release the active drug on hydrolysis. Soft quaternary salts have useful physical properties compared with the basic drug or its salts. Water solubility may be increased compared with other salts, such as the hydrochloride, but more important there may be an increased absorption of the drug from the intestine. Increased absorption is probably due to the fact that the soft quaternary salt has surfactant properties and is capable of forming micelles and unionized ion pairs with bile acids, etc., which are able to penetrate the intestinal epithelium more effectively. The prodrug, after absorption, is rapidly hydrolyzed with release of the active parent drug. Certain of the compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms, including hydrated forms, are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Certain of the compounds of the present invention possess one or more chiral centers and each center may exist in the R(D) or S(L) configuration. The present invention includes all enantiomeric and epimeric forms as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof. For example, the compound of Example 1 is a mixture of all four possible stereoisomers. The compound of Example 6 is one of the isomers. The configuration of the cyclohexane ring carbon centers may be R or S in these compounds where a configuration can be defined. The radioligand binding assay using 3 Hgabapentin and the 2 subunit derived from porcine brain tissue was used (Gee N. S., Brown J. P., Dissanayake V. U. K., Offord J., Thurlow R., Woodruff G. N., The Novel Anti-convulsant Drug, Gabapentin, Binds to the 2 Subunit of a Calcium Channel, J. Biol. Chem ., 1996;271:5879-5776). Compounds can also be assayed for biological activity using a 3Hgabapentin binding assay as described in Suman Chauhan N., et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol ., 1993;244:293-301. TABLE 2 IC 50 (M) at 2 Compound Structure Binding Site Example 1 0.135 Example 2 0.044 Table 2 above shows the binding affinity of the compounds of the invention to the 2 subunit. The compounds of the invention are compared to Neurontin, a marketed drug effective in the treatment of such disorders as epilepsy. Neurontin is 1-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexaneacetic acid of structural formula Gabapentin (Neurontin) is about 0.10 to 0.12 M in this assay. The compounds of the instant invention are expected, therefore, to exhibit pharmacologic properties comparable to gabapentin. For example, as agents for convulsions, anxiety, and pain. The present invention also relates to therapeutic use of the compounds of the mimetic as agents for neurodegenerative disorders. Such neurodegenerative disorders are, for example, Alzheimers disease, Huntingtons disease, Parkinsons disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. The present invention also covers treating neurodegenerative disorders termed acute brain injury. These include but are not limited to: stroke, head trauma, and asphyxia. Stroke refers to a cerebral vascular disease and may also be referred to as a cerebral vascular incident (CVA) and includes acute thromboembolic stroke. Stroke includes both focal and global ischemia. Also, included are transient cerebral ischemic attacks and other cerebral vascular problems accompanied by cerebral ischemia. A patient undergoing carotid endarterectomy specifically or other cerebrovascular or vascular surgical procedures in general, or diagnostic vascular procedures including cerebral angiography and the like. Other incidents are head trauma, spinal cord trauma, or injury from general anoxia, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, hypotension as well as similar injuries seen during procedures from embole, hyperfusion, and hypoxia. The instant invention would be useful in a range of incidents, for example, during cardiac bypass surgery, in incidents of intracranial hemorrhage, in perinatal asphyxia, in cardiac arrest, and status epilepticus. Pain refers to acute as well as chronic pain. Acute pain is usually short-lived and is associated with hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. Examples are postoperative pain and allodynia. Chronic pain is usually defined as pain persisting from 3 to 6 months and includes somatogenic pains and psychogenic pains. Other pain is nociceptive. Still other pain is caused by injury or infection of peripheral sensory nerves. It includes, but is not limited to pain from peripheral nerve trauma, herpes virus infection, diabetes mellitus, causalgia, plexus avulsion, neuroma, limb amputation, and vasculitis. Neuropathic pain is also caused by nerve damage from chronic alcoholism, human immunodeficiency virus infection, hypothyroidism, uremia, or vitamin deficiencies. Neuropathic pain includes, but is not limited to pain caused by nerve injury such as, for example, the pain diabetics suffer from. Psychogenic pain is that which occurs without an organic origin such as low back pain, atypical facial pain, and chronic headache. Other types of pain are: inflammatory pain, osteoarthritic pain, trigeminal neuralgia, cancer pain, diabetic neuropathy, restless leg syndrome, acute herpetic and postherpetic neuralgia, causalgia, brachial plexus avulsion, occipital neuralgia, gout, phantom limb, bum, and other forms of neuralgia, neuropathic and idiopathic pain syndrome. A skilled physician will be able to determine the appropriate situation in which subjects are susceptible to or at risk of, for example, stroke as well as suffering from stroke for administration by methods of the present invention. The compounds of the invention are also expected to be useful in the treatment of depression. Depression can be the result of organic disease, secondary to stress associated with personal loss, or idiopathic in origin. There is a strong tendency for familial occurrence of some forms of depression suggesting a mechanistic cause for at least some forms of depression. The diagnosis of depression is made primarily by quantification of alterations in patients mood. These evaluations of mood are generally performed by a physician or quantified by a neuropsychologist using validated rating scales, such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Numerous other scales have been developed to quantify and measure the degree of mood alterations in patients with depression, such as insomnia, difficulty with concentration, lack of energy, feelings of worthlessness, and guilt. The standards for diagnosis of depression as well as all psychiatric diagnoses are collected in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) referred to as the DSM-IV-R manual published by the American Psychiatric Association, 1994. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter with the central nervous system. Within the general context of inhibition, it seems likely that GABA-mimetics might decrease or inhibit cerebral function and might therefore slow function and decrease mood leading to depression. The compounds of the instant invention may produce an anticonvulsant effect through the increase of newly created GABA at the synaptic junction. If gabapentin does indeed increase GABA levels or the effectiveness of GABA at the synaptic junction, then it could be classified as a GABA-mimetic and might decrease or inhibit cerebral function and might, therefore, slow function and decrease mood leading to depression. The fact that a GABA agonist or GABA-mimetic might work just the opposite way by increasing mood and thus, be an antidepressant, is a new concept, different from the prevailing opinion of GABA activity heretofore. The compounds of the instant invention are also expected to be useful in the treatment of anxiety and of panic as demonstrated by means of standard pharmacological procedures. MATERIAL AND METHODS Carrageenin-Induced Hyperalgesia Nociceptive pressure thresholds were measured in the rat paw pressure test using an analgesymeter (Randall-Selitto method: Randall L. O. and Selitto J. J., A method for measurement of analgesic activity on inflamed tissue, Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn ., 1957;4:409-419). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (70-90 g) were trained on this apparatus before the test day. Pressure was gradually applied to the hind paw of each rat and nociceptive thresholds were determined as the pressure (g) required to elicit paw withdrawal. A cutoff point of 250 g was used to prevent any tissue damage to the paw. On the test day, two to three baseline measurements were taken before animals were administered 100 L of 2% carrageenin by intraplantar injection into the right hind paw. Nociceptive thresholds were taken again 3 hours after carrageenin to establish that animals were exhibiting hyperalgesia. Animals were dosed with either gabapentin (3-300 mg, s.c.), morphine (3 mg/kg, s.c.) or saline at 3.5 hours after carageenin and nociceptive thresholds were examined at 4, 4.5, and 5 hours postcarrageenin. (R)-2-Aza-spiro4.5decane-4-carboxylic acid hydrochloride was tested in the above carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia model. The compound was dosed orally at 30 mg/kg, and 1 hour postdose gave a percent of maximum possible effect (MPE) of 53%. At 2 hours postdose, it gave only 4.6% of MPE. Compounds can be tested for antihyperalgesic activity using the method described in Bennett G. J., et al., Pain , 1988;33:87-107. Mouse Light/Dark Box The apparatus is an open-topped box, 45 cm long, 27 cm wide, and 27 cm high, divided into a small (2/5) and a large (3/5) area by a partition that extended 20 cm above the walls (Costall B., et al., Exploration of mice in a black and white box: validation as a model of anxiety, Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav ., 1989;32:777-785). There is a 7.57.5 cm opening in the center of the partition at floor level. The small compartment is painted black and the large compartment white. The white compartment is illuminated by a 60-W tungsten bulb. The laboratory is illuminated by red light. Each mouse is tested by placing it in the center of the white area and allowing it to explore the novel environment for 5 minutes. The time spent in the illuminated side is measured (Kilfoil T., et al., Effects of anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs on exploratory activity in a simple model of anxiety in mice, Neuropharmacol , 1989;28:901-905). Rat Elevated X-Maze A standard elevated X-maze (Handley S.L., et al., Effects of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists in a maze-exploration model of fear-motivated behavior, Naunyn-Schiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol ., 1984;327:1-5), was automated as previously described (Field, et al., Automation of the rat elevated X-maze test of anxiety, Br. J. Pharmacol ., 1991;102(Suppl.):304P). The animals are placed on the center of the X-maze facing one of the open arms. For determining anxiolytic effects the entries and time spent on the end half sections of the open arms is measured during the 5-minute test period (Costall, et al., Use of the elevated plus maze to assess anxiolytic potential in the rat, Br. J. Pharmacol ., 1989;96(Suppl.):312p). Marmoset Human Threat Test The total number of body postures exhibited by the animal towards the threat stimulus (a human standing approximately 0.5 m away from the marmoset cage and staring into the eyes of the marmoset) is recorded during the 2-minute test period. The body postures scored are slit stares, tail postures, scent marking of the cage/perches, piloerection, retreats, and arching of the back. Each animal is exposed to the threat stimulus twice on the test day before and after drug treatment. The difference between the two scores is analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnetts t-test. All drug treatments are carried out SC at least 2 hours after the first (control) threat. The pretreatment time for each compound is 40 minutes. Rat Conflict Test Rats are trained to press levers for food reward in operant chambers. The schedule consists of alternations of four 4-minute unpunished periods on variable interval of 30 seconds signaled by chamber lights on and three 3-minute punished periods on fixed ratio 5 (by footshock concomitant to food delivery) signaled by chamber lights off. The degree of footshock is adjusted for each rat to obtain approximately 80% to 90% suppression of responding in comparison with unpunished responding. Rats receive saline vehicle on training days. DBA2 Mouse Model of Anticonvulsant Efficacy All procedures were carried out in compliance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals under a protocol approved by the Parke-Davis Animal Use Committee. Male DBA/2 mice, 3 to 4 weeks old were obtained from Jackson Laboratories Bar Harbour, Me. Immediately before anticonvulsant testing, mice were placed upon a wire mesh, 4 inches square, suspended from a steel rod. The square was slowly inverted through 180 and mice observed for 30 seconds. Any mouse falling from the wire mesh was scored as ataxic (Coughenour L. L., McLean J. R., Parker R. B., A new device for the rapid measurement of impaired motor function in mice, Pharm. Biochem. Behav ., 1977;6(3):351-3). Mice were placed into an enclosed acrylic plastic chamber (21 cm height, approximately 30 cm diameter) with a high-frequency speaker (4 cm diameter) in the center of the top lid. An audio signal generator (Protek model B-810) was used to produce a continuous sinusoidal tone that was swept linearly in frequency between 8 kHz and 16 kHz once each 10 msec. The average sound pressure level (SPL) during stimulation was approximately 100 dB at the floor of the chamber. Mice were placed within the chamber and allowed to acclimatize for one minute. DBA/2 mice in the vehicle-treated group responded to the sound stimulus (applied until tonic extension occurred, or for a maximum of 60 sec) with a characteristic seizure sequence consisting of wild running followed by clonic seizures, and later by tonic extension, and finally by respiratory arrest and death in 80% or more of the mice. In vehicle-treated mice, the entire sequence of seizures to respiratory arrest lasts approximately 15 to 20 seconds. The incidence of all the seizure phases in the drug-treated and vehicle-treated mice was recorded, and the occurrence of tonic seizures were used for calculating anticonvulsant ED 50 values by probit analysis (Litchfield J. T., Wilcoxon F. A simplified method for evaluating dose-effect experiments, J. Pharmacol ., 1949;96:99-113). Mice were used only once for testing at each dose point. Groups of DBA/2 mice (n5-10 per dose) were tested for sound-induced seizure responses 2 hours (previously determined time of peak effect) after given drug orally. All drugs in the present study were dissolved in distilled water and given by oral gavage in a volume of 10 mL/kg of body weight. Compounds that are insoluble will be suspended in 1% carboxymethocellulose. Doses are expressed as weight of the active drug moiety. The compounds of the instant invention are also expected to be useful in the treatment of pain and phobic disorders ( Am. J. Pain Manag ., 1995;5:7-9). The compounds of the instant invention are also expected to be useful in treating the symptoms of manic, acute or chronic, single upside, or recurring depression. They are also expected to be useful in treating and/or preventing bipolar disorder (U.S. Pat. No. 5,510,381). Models of Irritable Bowel Syndrome TNBS-Induced Chronic Visceral Allodynia In Rats Injections of trinitrobenzene sulfonic (TNBS) into the colon have been found to induce chronic colitis. In human, digestive disorders are often associated with visceral pain. In these pathologies, the visceral pain threshold is decreased indicating a visceral hypersensitivity. Consequently, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of injection of TNBS into the colon on visceral pain threshold in a experimental model of colonic distension. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and Surgery Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Janvier, Le Genest-St-Ilse, France) weighing 340-400 g are used. The animals are housed 3 per cage in a regulated environment (201 C., 505% humidity, with light 8:00 am to 8:00 pm). Under anesthesia (ketamine 80 mg/kg i.p; acepromazin 12 mg/kg ip), the injection of TNBS (50 mg/kg) or saline (1.5 mL/kg) is performed into the proximal colon (1 cm from the cecum). After the surgery, animals are individually housed in polypropylene cages and kept in a regulated environment (201 C., 505% humidity, with light 8:00 am to 8:00 pm) during 7 days. Experimental Procedure At Day 7 after TNBS administration, a balloon (5-6 cm length) is inserted by anus and kept in position (tip of balloon 5 cm from the anus) by taping the catheter to the base of the tail. The balloon is progressively inflated by step of 5 mm Hg, from 0 to 75 mm Hg, each step of inflation lasting 30 seconds. Each cycle of colonic distension is controlled by a standard barostat (ABS, St-Di, France). The threshold corresponds to the pressure which produced the first abdominal contraction and the cycle of distension is then discontinued. The colonic threshold (pressure expressed in mm Hg) is determined after performance of four cycles of distension on the same animal. Determination of the Activity of the Compound Data is analyzed by comparing test compound-treated group with TNBS-treated group and control group. Mean and sem are calculated for each group. The antiallodynic activity of the compound is calculated as follows: Activity (%)(group Cgroup T)/(group Agroup T) Group C: mean of the colonic threshold in the control group Group T: mean of the colonic threshold in the TNBS-treated group Group A: mean of the colonic threshold in the test compound-treated group Statistical Analysis Statistical significance between each group was determined by using a one-way ANOVA followed by Students unpaired t-test. Differences were considered statistically significant at p0.05. Compounds TNBS is dissolved in EtOH 30% and injected under a volume of 0.5 mL/rat. TNBS is purchased from Fluka. Oral administration of the test compound or its vehicle is performed 1 hour before the colonic distension cycle. Sub-cutaneous administration of the test compound or its vehicle is performed 30 minutes before the colonic distension cycle. The compounds of the present invention can be prepared and administered in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms. Thus, the compounds of the present invention can be administered by injection, that is, intravenously, intramuscularly, intracutaneously, subcutaneously, intraduodenally, or intraperitoneally. Also, the compounds of the present invention can be administered by inhalation, for example, intranasally. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention can be administered transdermally. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms may comprise as the active component, either a compound of Formula I or a corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of Formula I. For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain from five or ten to about seventy percent of the active compound. Suitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term preparations is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component with or without other carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify. Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example, water or water propylene glycol solutions. For parenteral injection liquid preparations can be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and other well-known suspending agents. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like. The pharmaceutical preparation is preferably in unit dosage form. In such formn the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsules, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. The quantity of active component in a unit dose preparation may be varied or adjusted from 0.1 mg to 1 g according to the particular application and the potency of the active component. In medical use the drug may be administered three times daily as, for example, capsules of 100 or 300 mg. The composition can, if desired, also contain other compatible therapeutic agents. In therapeutic use, the compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of this invention are administered at the initial dosage of about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg/kg daily. A daily dose range of about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg/kg is preferred. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day, if desired. The following examples are illustrative of the synthetic procedures for making the intermediates and final products of the instant invention. They are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. EXAMPLE 1 (cis)-4-Isobutyl-pyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid (see Scheme 3) Step 1: Synthesis of 1,1-Dibromo-4-methyl-pent-1-ene To a stirred solution of carbon tetrabromide (30 g, 90.63 mmol) in dichloromethane (400 mL) at 10 C. was added triphenylphosphine (60 g, 229 mmol) in portions. Internal temperature was kept below 5 C. during the addition, and it was stirred for additional 30 minutes at this temperature after the addition was completed. Isovaleraldehyde 1 (9.4 mL, 87.6 mmol) in methylene chloride (50 mL) was added slowly via a syringe, and the reaction was stirred for 3 hours during which the temperature did not rise above 5 C. After the solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator, pentane (600 mL) was added to the residue. The solid which separated was removed by filtration. Evaporation of solvent gave a light oil which was chromatographed on a silica gel column. The pure compound was eluted with pet ether to afford 1,1-dibromo-4-methyl-pent-1-ene 6 (16.5g,78%). NMR (CDCl 3 ): 6.38 (triplet, 1H), 1.95 (triplet, 2H), 1.70 (m, 1H), and 0.89 (d, 6H).

While stirring, n-butyllithium (1.6 M solution in hexane, 190.8 mL, 305 mmol) was added dropwise in a few minutes. After 1 hour, ethyl chloroformate (15 mL, 154.5 mmol) was added, and the reaction was stirred overnight during which it warmed to room temperature. It was poured onto water and extracted with ether (3250 mL), dried on magnesium sulfate and evaporated. The light oil was flash chromatographed on a silica gel column, and the compound was eluted with 10% ether in pet ether to afford 5-methyl-hex-2-ynoic acid ethyl ester 7 (23.6 g, 92%).

After 45 minutes, methoxymethyl chloride (4.3 mL, 55.76 mmol) in THF (6 mL) was added and then stirred for another 3 hours. The THF was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in hexane, washed with water, and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated to give under reduced pressure to give N-benzyl-N-(methoxymethyl)trimethylsilylmethylamine (10 g). Step 4: (cis)-1-Benzyl-4-isobutyl-pyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester N-Benzyl-N-(methoxymethyl)trimethylsilylmethylamine (4.0 g, 16.8 mmol), followed by TFA (1.0 M solution in CH 2 Cl 2 , 1.0 mL, 1 mmol) were added to a solution of (Z)-5-methyl-hex-2-enoic acid ethyl ester 8 (3.0 g, 19.2 mmol) in methylene chloride (30 mL) maintained at 5 C. under nitrogen atmosphere. After 15 minutes, the bath was removed and stirring was continued overnight. The reaction mixture was washed with saturated NaHCO 3 (10 mL), water (15 mL), brine (20 mL), and dried. The product was purified by chromatography on silica gel, and compound was eluted with 20% ethyl acetate in hexane to give (cis)-1-benzyl-4-isobutyl-pyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester 9 as an oil (2.25 g, 41%).

The reaction mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite, and the filtrate was concentrated to give 3R-(cis)-4-isobutyl-pyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester 10 as an oil. Proton NMR showed the absence of a benzyl group. To the 10 was added 6N HCl (20 mL), and the solution was refluxed overnight. After the solvent was evaporated at reduced pressure crude product was loaded onto a column of Dowax 50WX8-100 ion-exchange resin (30 g) which had been pre-washed to neutral (pH-7) with HPLC grade water. The resin was again washed to pH-7, followed by elution of the compound with 0.5N ammonium hydroxide solution. The solvent was evaporated, and the product was crystallized from methanol-ether to give (cis)-4-isobutyl-pyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid 11 (470 mg). Analysis by tlc (8% NH 4 0H in 95% ethanol, visualized with ninhydrin) indicated the presence of minor fast chromatographic spot (trans-isomer). The mixture was adsorbed onto silica get and chromatographed on a Biotage Flash system. Compound was eluted with 5% NH 4 OH in 95% ethanol. After evaporation of solvent, the product was converted to the HCl salt and reprocessed on ion-exchange column, followed by crystalization from methanol-ether to give (cis)-4-isobutyl-pyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid 11 (320 mg). 1 H NMR (400 MHz, CD 3 OD): 3.46 (dd, 1H), 3.31 (dd, 1H), 3.18 (dd, 1H), 3.15 (m, 1H), 2.49 (m, 1H), 1.63 (m, 1H), 1.47 (m, 1H), 1.25 (m, 1H), and 0.88 (6H).

meanings that are indicated in more detail in the description. The new compounds show a very great affinity to the gestagen receptor. They can be used alone or in combination with estrogens in contraceptive preparations. In addition, they can be used for treating endometriosis. Together with estrogens, they can also be used in preparations for treating gynecological disorders, for treating premenstrual symptoms and for substitution therapy. Based on the androgenic action, they can also be used for male birth control, male HRT and hormone therapy and for treating andrological disease agents. This application claims priority under 35 USC 119 to provisional application Ser. No. 60/082,789, filed Apr. 23, 1998. This invention relates to nonsteroidal compounds, which have a high gestagenic activity. In addition to a large number of steroid compounds with gestagenic action, gestagens that are not steroids are also known (for example from EP 0 253 500 B1 and WO 94/01412, cf. J. Med. Chem. 38 (1995) 4878). This invention describes the compounds of general formula I in which R 1 and R 2 are the same or different and stand for a hydrogen atom, a C 1 -C 5 alkyl group or a halogen atom, and also together with the C-atom of the chain stand for a ring with a total of 3-7 links, R 3 stands for a C 1 -C 5 alkyl group or a partially or completely fluorinated C 1 -C 5 alkyl group, A stands for a monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic ring that is optionally substituted by one or more radicals, selected from halogen atoms, C 1 -C 5 alkyl groups, C 2 -C 5 alkenyl groups CR 5 CR 6 R 7 , whereby R 5 , R 6 and R 7 are the same or different and, independently of one another, mean hydrogen atoms or C 1 -C 5 alkyl groups; hydroxy groups, hydroxy groups that carry a C 1 -C 10 acyl group, a C 3 -C 10 carbalkoxyalkyl group, a C 2 -C 5 cyanalkyl group, a C 3 -C 10 unsubstituted or substituted allyl group, a C 3 -C 10 unsubstituted or substituted propargyl group, a C 2 -C 5 alkoxyalkyl group, a C 1 -C 5 alkyl group that is partially or completely substituted by fluorine atoms, the cyano or nitro group, C 1 -C 5 alkoxy groups, C 1 -C 5 alkylthio groups, mono- or disubstituted C 1 -C 10 amino groups or partially or completely fluorinated C 1 -C 5 alkyl groups, for an ester group COOR 4 , whereby R 4 means a C 1 -C 5 alkyl group, for a C 2 -C 5 alkenyl group CR 5 CR 6 R 7 , whereby R 5 , R 6 and R 7 are the same or different, and, independently of one another, mean hydrogen atoms, halogen atoms, aryl radicals or C 1 -C 5 alkyl groups, for an alkinyl group CCR 5 , whereby R 5 means a hydrogen atom or a C 1 -C 5 alkyl group, for a partially or completely fluorinated C 1 -C 5 alkyl group, B stands for a carbonyl group or a CH 2 group, and Ar stands for a ring system, selected from the group of general partial formulas 2-11, in which radicals X 3a , X 4 , X 6 , X 7 (in partial formula 2), X 4 , X 6 , X 7 (in partial formulas 3 and 4), X 3a , X 3b , X 4 , X 6 , X 7 (in partial formulas 5, 6 and 7) or Y 4 , Y 5 , Y 7 , Y 8 (in partial formulas 8, 9, 10 and 11) are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen atoms, C 1 -C 5 alkyl groups, which in addition can contain a hydroxy group that is optionally etherified with a C 1 -C 5 alkyl group or esterified with a C 1 -C 5 alkanoyl group, partially or completely fluorinated C 1 -C 5 alkyl groups, C 2 -C 5 alkenyl groups CR 5 CR 6 R 7 , whereby R 5 , R 6 , and R 7 have the above-mentioned meaning, alkinyl groups CCR 5 , whereby R 5 has the above-mentioned meaning, radicals X 3a and X 3b also together with the C-atom of benzocondensed ring system 5, 6 or 7 can form a ring with a total of 3-7 links, and moreover, radicals X 4 , X 6 , X 7 (in partial formulas 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) or Y 4 , Y 5 , Y 7 , Y 8 (in partial formulas 8, 9, 10 and 11) are selected from halogen atoms, hydroxy groups, C 1 -C 5 alkoxy groups or C 1 -C 5 alkanoyloxy groups, also if B in general formula I stands for a CH 2 group, Ar in addition stands for a phenyl radical of general partial formula 12, in which R 9 and R 10 are the same or different and mean a cyano group, a nitro group, a halogen atom, a C 1 -C 5 alkyl group, a C 1 -C 5 alkoxy group, a partially or completely fluorinated C 1 -C 5 alkyl group, a C 1 -C 5 alkylthio group, a C 1 -C 5 alkylsulfinyl group or a C 1 -C 5 alkylsulfonyl group, and if B stands for a CH 2 group, the physiologically compatible salts of the compounds of general formula I with acids. The compounds according to the invention are distinguished from the known nonsteroidal compounds with gestagenic action by the substitution pattern on the aryl radical that is on the right in general formula I. In the compounds that are present here, Ar is a benzocondensed, bicyclic ring system, while in the structures that are known from EP 0 253 500 B1 and that can be considered as the closest compounds, a phenyl radical that is substituted in one, two or three places is at this point. The compounds of general formula I according to the invention can be present as different stereoisomers because of the presence of asymmetry centers. Both the racemates and the stereoisomers that are detached are part of the subject of this invention. The substituents that are defined as groups in the compounds of general formula I can have the following meanings in each case. C 1 -C 5 Alkyl groups can readily be a methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-, iso-, tert-butyl group or an n-pentyl, 2,2-dimethylpropyl or 3-methylbutyl group. A methyl or ethyl group is preferred. A fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom can stand for a halogen atom. Here, fluorine, chlorine or bromine is preferred. If R 1 and R 2 together with the C-atom of the chain form a 3-7-membered ring, this is, for example, a cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl ring. The cyclopropyl ring is preferred. For a partially or completely fluorinated C 1 -C 5 alkyl group, the perfluorinated alkyl groups that appear above and of the latter mainly the trifluoromethyl group or pentafluoroethyl group as well as partially fluorinated alkyl groups, for example, the 5,5,5,4,4-pentafluoropentyl group or 5,5,5,4,4,3,3-heptafluoropentyl group are considered. As a C 2 -C 5 alkenyl group, for example, a vinyl-, allyl- or 2,3-dimethyl-2-propenyl group can appear; if aromatic compound A is substituted with an alkenyl group, preferably it is a vinyl group. Representatives of a C 1 -C 5 alkoxy group are selected from methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, iso-propoxy, n-, iso-, tert-butoxy groups or n-pentoxy, 2,2-dimethylpropoxy or 3-methylbutoxy groups. A methoxy or ethoxy group is preferred. C 1 -C 5 Perfluoroalkoxy groups are the corresponding perfluorinated radicals of the C 1 -C 5 alkoxy groups above. Monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic ring A, which can be substituted, is a carbocyclic or heterocyclic aryl radical. In the first case, this is, for example, a phenyl or naphthyl radical, preferably a phenyl radical. As a heterocyclic radical, for example, a monocyclic heterocyclic radical can be, for example, the thienyl, furyl, pyranyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyridyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, furazanyl, pyrrolinyl, imidazolinyl, pyrazolinyl, thiazolinyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl radical, specifically all possible isomers relative to the positions of the heteroatoms. The thienyl radical is preferred as heteroaryl radical A. For R 4 , a methyl, ethyl, n- or iso-propyl group is preferred as a C 1 -C 5 alkyl group in ester group COOR 4 . As a C 1 -C 5 alkyl group for etherification of hydroxy groups, the above-mentioned alkyl groups are suitable, primarily a methyl or ethyl group. As a C 1 -C 5 alkanoyl group for esterification of hydroxy groups, a formyl, acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, isobutyl, valeryl or isovaleryl group is suitable, preferably an acetyl group. If X 3a and X 3b together with the C-atom of the benzocondensed ring system form a 3-7-membered ring, this is, for example, a cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl ring. The cyclopropyl ring is preferred. As a C 1 -C 5 alkanoyloxy group for X 4 , X 6 , X 7 , Y 4 , Y 5 , Y 7 or Y 8 , a formyloxy, acetoxy, propinoyloxy, butyryloxy, iso-butyryloxy, valeryloxy or isovaleryloxy group is suitable, preferably an acetoxy group. The above-mentioned C 1 -C 5 alkyl groups can stand for C 1 -C 5 alkyl within the C 1 -C 5 alkylthio, C 1 -C 5 alkylsulfinyl or C 1 -C 5 alkylsulfonyl group. If the compounds of general formula I (BCH 2 ) are present as salts, this can be in the form of, for example, hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, tartrate or benzoate. If the compounds according to the invention are present as racemic mixtures, they can be separated into pure, optically active forms according to the methods of racemate separation that are familiar to one skilled in the art. For example, the racemic mixtures can be separated by chromatography into pure isomers on an even optically active carrier material (CHIRALPAK AD). It is also possible to esterify the free hydroxy group in a racemic compound of general formula I with an optically active acid and to separate the diastereoisomeric esters that are obtained by fractionated crystallization or by chromatography, and to saponify the separate esters in each case into the optically pure isomers. For example, mandelic acid, camphorsulfonic acid or tartaric acid can be used as optically active acid. Preferred according to this invention are those compounds of general formula I, in which: R 1 and R 2 are the same or different and stand for a hydrogen atom, a methyl or ethyl group, and also together with the C-atom of the chain stand for a cyclopropyl ring, and/or R 3 stands for a C 1 -C 5 perfluoroalkyl group, and/or A stands for a benzene, naphthalene or thiophene ring that is optionally substituted by one or more radicals, selected from fluorine atoms, chlorine atoms, bromine atoms, methyl groups, ethyl groups, (CH 2 ) n group (n3,4,5), which with 2 adjacent C atoms of aromatic compound A forms a ring with n2 links and can contain unsaturations; vinyl groups, hydroxy groups, methoxy groups, ethoxy groups, and/or either X 3a stands for a hydrogen atom or a C 1 -C 5 alkyl group, or X 3a and X 3b are the same or different and stand for a hydrogen atom or a C 1 -C 5 alkyl group and/or X 4 , X 6 and X 7 are the same or different, and stand for, independently of one another, a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, and/or Y stands for a C 1 -C 5 alkyl group or a C 1 -C 5 perfluoroalkyl group, and/or Y 6 , Y 7 and Y 8 are the same or different and, independently of one another, stand for a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, and the other substituents all have the meanings that are indicated in Formula 1. In addition, those compounds of general formula I in which Ar stands for a ring system of partial formula 6, 7, 10 or 11 are preferred.

All above-mentioned compounds are especially preferred in the form of the optical antipodes or the separate diastereomers. In the gestagen receptor bonding test on the gestagenic action using cytosol from rabbit uterus homogenate and from 3 H-progesterone as a reference substance, the new compounds show a strong to very strong affinity to the gestagen receptor (see Table 1). TABLE 1 Competition Factor (Reference Substance Example No. Structure 3 H-Progesterone) (*) (Melting point 141-142 C.) 17 (*) (Melting point 161 C.) 2.0 65 0.17 104 0.1 106 0.55 (*) EP 0 253 500 B1, Example 1 In addition to their gestagenic action, which is pronounced to different degrees depending on the compound of general formula I that is considered, the new compounds also are distinguished by a more or less strongly pronounced affinity to the androgen receptor. The androgen receptor bonding test on androgenic action was carried out using cytosol that consists of rat prostate homogenate and 3 H-methyltrienolone as a reference substance. The new compounds are thus represented relative to the gestagenic compounds from EP 0 253 500 B1 as compounds with a quite novel mix profile, which consists of gestagenic and androgenic action. For the compounds of general formula I according to the invention, in this case all three of the cases that are possible below are found, which based on the competition factors on progesterone receptor (KF Prog ) and androgen receptor (KF Andro ) are classified within the scope of this invention as follows: 1) Compounds with stronger gestagenic action and less pronounced androgenic action (KF Prog 1 and KF Andro 5); 2) Compounds with stronger androgenic action and less pronounced gestagenic action (KF Andro 5 and KF Prog 1); 3) Compounds with pronounced gestagenic and pronounced androgenic action (KF Prog 1 and KF Andro 5). Depending on their classification according to 1), 2) or 3), the new compounds according to the invention can be used for different medical or pharmaceutical purposes. In the case of the compounds that are classified under 1) with stronger gestagenic action and less pronounced androgenic action, these are very effective gestagens, which, like the already numerous known gestagenic compounds, are suitable for preserving pregnancies in the case of parenteral administration and in the case of oral administration. In combination with an estrogen, combination preparations are obtained that can be used for contraception and for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Based on their high gestagenic action, the new compounds of general formula I that are classified under 1) can be used, for example, alone or in combination with estrogens in contraceptive preparations. However, all other applications that are known for gestagen are now open to these new compounds (see, e.g., Kontrazeption mit Hormonen Contraception with Hormones, Hans-Dieter Taubert and Herbet Kuhl, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart - New York, 1995). Suitable dosages can be determined as a matter of routine, e.g., by determining the bioequivalency, for example in the pregnancy-maintenance test, relative to a known gestagen for a specific use, for example an amount that is bioequivalent to 30 to 150 g of levonorgestrel for contraception. The dosage of the compounds according to the invention under 1) in contraceptive preparations is preferably to be 0.01 to 2 mg per day. The gestagenic and estrogenic active ingredient components are preferably administered orally together in contraceptive preparations. The daily dose is preferably administered once. As estrogens, all natural and synthetic compounds that are known as estrogenically active are suitable. As natural estrogens, these are especially estradiol and also its longer-acting esters, such as valerate, etc. or estriol. Preferably, however, synthetic estrogens such as ethinyl-estradiol, 14,17-ethano-1,3,5(10)-estratriene-3-17-diol (WO 88/01275), 14,17-ethano-1,3,5(10)-estratriene-3,16,17-triol (WO 91/08219) or the 15,15-diallyl derivatives of the estradiol, and of these especially 15,16-dimethylestradiol (WO 95/04070) can be mentioned. As a synthetic estrogen, ethinylestradiol is preferred. Also, the estratrien-3-aminosulfonates that have become known recently (WO 96/05216 and WO 96/05217), derived from estradiol or ethinylestradiol, which are distinguished by low hepatic estrogeneity, are suitable as estrogens for common use with the compounds of general formula I that are classified under 1). Finally, the 14,15-methylene steroids from the estrane series, especially the 14,15-methylene-17-estradiol as well as the corresponding 3-aminosulfonate derivatives can be mentioned. The estrogen is administered in an amount that corresponds to that of 0.01 to 0.05 mg of ethinylestradiol. The new compounds of general formula I that are classified under 1) can also be used in preparations for treatment of gynecological disorders and for substitution therapy. Because of their advantageous profile of action, these compounds according to the invention are especially well suited for treatment of premenstrual symptoms, such as headaches, depression, water retention and mastodynia. The daily dose in the treatment of premenstrual symptoms is approximately 1 to 20 mg. Analogously to what is already known for other gestagens, the new compounds can also be used for treating endometrioses. Finally, these new compounds can also be used as gestagenic components in the compositions for female birth control that have recently become known and that are distinguished by the additional use of a competitive progesterone antagonist (H. B. Croxatto and A. M. Salvatierra in Female Contraception and Male Fertility Regulation, ed. by Runnebaum, Rabe KieselVol. 2, Advances in Gynecological and Obstetric Research Series, Parthenon Publishing Group1991, page 245; WO 93/17686, WO 93/21927, U.S. Pat. No. 5,521,166). The dosage lies in the range that is already indicated, and the formulation can be carried out as in conventional OC-preparations. The administration of the additional, competitive progesterone antagonist can in this case also be performed sequentially. Those compounds of the general formula, which are to be categorized as above under 2) and 3), i.e., compounds that have a strong androgenic action (androgenic gestagens), can be used for the production of pharmaceutical preparations for male birth control. Currently, in several WHO studies, the contraceptive action of a combination that consists of an orally administered gestagen (Depot-medroxy progesterone acetate, levonorgestrel ester, cyproterone acetate) is tested on men with a parenterally administered androgen (testosterone oenanthate). By contrast, birth control in men is possible with these compounds in one dosage form, specifically an oral dosage form or a dosage form that is to be administered transdermally. In addition, the compounds according to the invention with androgenic action can be used with older males for male HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy). Those compounds of general formula I, which can more likely be classified under 2), i.e., compounds with mainly androgenic action and weaker gestagenic action, can be used for male hormone therapy. Preparations for treating a hyper-gonadism and for treating male infertility and disturbances of potency can be produced with them. For male birth control and for treating the above-mentioned androgenic disease agents, the compounds according to the invention are used in the dosages that are equivalent in action to the testosterone oenanthate amounts that are used in the WHO studies or to the dosage that is already in androgen therapy of compounds used. Amounts that are equivalent in action are those amounts that, in the test on androgenic action on the seminal vesicles and/or prostate of the rat (Hershberger Test) achieve comparable action. For HRT in man, to date a substitution dose of approximately 10 mg/day of testosterone oenanthate is used. For male birth control studies that are performed by the WHO, different testosterone esters (oenanthate, bucyclate, undecanoate) are used in the range of approximately 10-30 mg/day. At this point it should be pointed out that the transitions between 1), 2) and 3), as regards the correlation according to the invention of various indications with these varying mix profiles 1), 2) and 3), are smooth. The compounds that more likely lie on the edge of the indicated KF areas based on their KF Prog and/or KF Andro , can easily be used also for the indications that are assigned to the adjacent mix profile. The compounds of general formula I also partially show actions on the glucocorticoid and/or mineral corticoid receptor. The formulation of the pharmaceutical preparations based on the new compounds is carried out in a way that is known in the art, by the active ingredient, optionally in combination with an estrogen, being processed with the vehicles that are commonly used in galenicals, diluents, optionally taste correctives, etc., and conveyed in the desired form of administration. For the preferred oral administration, especially tablets, coated tablets, pills, suspension or solutions are suitable. For parenteral administration, especially oily solutions, such as, for example, solutions in sesame oil, castor oil and cottonseed oil, are suitable. To increase solubility, solubilizers, such as, for example, benzyl benzoate or benzyl alcohol, can be added. The compounds of general formula I can also be administered continuously by an intrauterine release system (intrauterine systemIUS; e.g., MIRENA); the release rate of the active compound(s), is selected in this case in such a way that the dose that is released daily lies within the already indicated dosage range. It is also possible to incorporate the substances according to the invention in a transdermal system and thus to administer them transdermally. The compounds of general formula I according to the invention can be produced as described below. Production Process 1. A carbonyl compound of general formula II in which A, B, Ar, R 1 and R 2 have the meaning that is indicated in formula I, is reacted with a compound of general formula C n F 2n1 SiR 3 , in which R 3 has the meaning that is indicated in general formula 1, in the presence of a catalyst or with an alkyl metal compound, for example a Grignard reagent or a lithium alkyl, to a compound of formula I. As catalysts, fluoride salts or basic compounds such as alkali carbonates are suitable (J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 111, 393 (1989)). 2. A compound of general formula III in which A, B, R 1 , R 2 and R 3 have the meaning that is indicated in formula 1 and FG means a leaving group, is reacted with a compound ArNHR 11 , whereby R 11 means a hydrogen atom or a C 1 -C 5 acyl group, and Ar has the meaning that is indicated in general formula I, whereby optionally then radical R 11 is cleaved off to obtain a compound of formula I. In this case, the compound of general formula III optionally can be formed only as an intermediate product, e.g., this can be an acid chloride that is formed as an intermediate product from a corresponding carboxylic acid. As leaving groups 3. A compound of general formula IV in which A, R 1 , R 2 and R 3 have the meaning that is indicated in formula I, is reacted with a compound of formula ArNHR 11 , whereby R 11 and Ar have the above-indicated meanings, whereby optionally then radical R 11 is cleaved off, to obtain a compound of formula I with B in the meaning of a CH 2 group. 4. A compound of formula I, which in radical A or in radical Ar contains the grouping aryl-X, whereby aryl means an isocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic compound that corresponds to the definitions that are given for formula I and X means a bromine or iodine atom or the group OSO 2 R 12 , in which R 12 means a C 1 -C 5 perfluoroalkyl group, is reacted under metal catalysis to compound aryl-R 13 according to processes that are known in the art with a compound of formula R 13 -Y, whereby R 13 represents an optionally substituted aryl, ethenyl or ethinyl radical and Y represents a hydrogen atom (J. Org. Chem. 43, 2947 (1978)), group B (OR 14 ) 2 (J. Org. Chem. 58, 2201 (1993)) or Sn(R 15 ) 3 (J. Org. Chem. 52, 422 (1987)) with R 14 and R 15 meaning a phenyl radical or C 1 -C 5 alkyl and R 14 also represents hydrogen, Mg-halogen or an alkali metal atom. 5. In a compound of formula I, which contains an alkoxy or acyloxy substituent in A or Ar, the OH group is released, and optionally etherified or esterified in another reaction or, after conversion into a 1-phenyl-5-tetrazolylether, is completely eliminated by hydrogenation (J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 88, 4271 (1966)). Of all the foregoing process variants, 1. and 2. are suitable for the production of all compounds that fall under general formula I. Compounds of general formula I can be produced with the third variant, in which B stands for a CH 2 group. Using the fourth and fifth process variants, functionalizations of already existing compounds of general formula I can be undertaken. Compounds that were produced according to one of the processes above and in which A is an optionally substituted aromatic ring, optionally can be selectively substituted at this aromatic radical according to known processes. Examples of this process are the catalytic hydrogenation of multiple bonds, nitration and halogenation. The starting materials that are used in the examples are produced as follows: Production of Starting Materials 4-Methyl-4-phenyl-2-oxovaleric acid A Grignard solution that is produced from 26.4 g of magnesium and 162 ml of 2-methyl-2-phenyl-1-chloropropane in 150 ml of diethyl ether was added in drops to 600 ml of oxalic acid diethyl ester at 30 C. After 2 hours at room temperature, it was added to ammonium chloride solution, extracted with diethyl ether, dried (Na 2 SO 4 ) and distilled in fractionated form; 84 g of ethyl ester (boiling point 115-120 C./0.03 hPa), which is dissolved in 1 l of methanol, is obtained, mixed with 500 ml of 1m sodium hydroxide and stirred for 1.5 hours at room temperature. After the methanol is evaporated in a vacuum, the residue is dispersed between water and diethyl ether, the aqueous phase is acidified with hydrochloric acid and extracted with diethyl ether. After concentration by evaporation, 57 g of 4-methyl-4-phenyl-2-oxovaleric acid is obtained as a thick oil. 4,4-Dimethyl-2-oxo-5-hexenoic acid 36 g of 3,3-dimethyl-4-pentenoic acid is obtained as an oil from 50 g of 3,3-dimethyl-4-pentenoic acid methyl ester by saponification with 10% potassium hydroxide. By stirring with thionyl chloride (20 hours, room temperature), the acid chloride is obtained, boiling point 59 C./30 hPa. 16 g of it is stirred with 15 g of trimethylsilylcyanide and 0.16 g of zinc iodide for 4 days. After distillation, 13 g of 4,4-dimethyl-2-oxo-5-hexenoic acid nitrile, boiling point 75-85 C./30 hPa, is obtained. 2 g of it is saturated with 0.6 ml of methanol in 13 ml of hexane while being cooled with ice with hydrochloric-acid gas, and it is mixed for 2 hours with water. From the hexane phase, after drying (Na 2 SO 4 ) and concentration by evaporation, 0.558 g of 4,4-dimethyl-2-oxo-5-hexenoic acid methyl ester, boiling point 48 C./0.003 hPa, is obtained. 0.535 g of it is saponified with 1.3 ml of 3N sodium hydroxide solution, whereby 0.32 g of 4,4-dimethyl-2-oxo-5-hexenoic acid is obtained as a yellowish liquid. 3-(1-Phenyl-cyclobutyl)-2-oxo-propionic acid 10 g of 1-phenyl-cyclobutanecarbonitrile, dissolved in 70 ml of toluene, is mixed with 56 ml of diisobutylaluminum hydride in toluene (1.2 molar) at 72 to 69 C. After 4 hours at 75 C., 30 ml of ethyl acetate is added in drops. After heating to room temperature, additional ethyl acetate and water are added. It is filtered on diatomaceous earth, the organic phase is separated, dried (Na 2 SO 4 ) and concentrated by evaporation. After chromatography on silica gel (hexane with 0-10% ethyl acetate), 7.6 g of 1-phenyl-cyclobutanecarbaldehyde is obtained. 3 g of it is dissolved in 10 ml of tetrahydrofuran and added in drops at 0 C. to a solution, in which previously 5 g of triethyl-2-ethoxyphosphonoacetate in 70 ml of tetrahydrofuran was mixed at 0 C. with 10.3 ml of a 2 molar solution of lithium diisopropylamide in tetrahydrofuran/heptane/ethylbenzene. After 20 hours at room temperature, water is added, it is extracted with ethyl acetate, dried (Na 2 SO 4 ) and concentrated by evaporation. 2 g of this crude product is saponified with 28 ml of 1N sodium hydroxide solution. 1.32 g of the acid, which is heated for 20 hours to 90 C. with 25 ml of 1 molar sulfuric acid while being stirred vigorously, is obtained. After extraction with ether, drying (Na 2 SO 4 ) and concentration by evaporation, 0.89 g of 3-(1-phenyl-cyclobutyl)-2-oxopropionic acid is obtained as a yellowish oil. 3-1-(2-Methoxyphenyl)-cyclopropyl-2-oxo-propionic acid Corresponding to J. Org. Chem. 40 (1975) 3497, 16.7 g of 2-methoxyphenylacetonitrile, 158 ml of lithium triisopropyl-amide (2 mol solution) and 46.7 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane in 96 ml of tetrahydrofuran and 58.6 ml of hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide are reacted with one another. 5.6 g of 1-(2-methoxy-phenyl)-cyclopropyl-carbonitrile, boiling point 104-115 C./0.1 mbar, which was also reacted as described for 3-(1-phenyl-cyclobutyl)-2-oxo-propionic acid, is obtained. 3-1-(2-Methoxyphenyl)-cyclopropyl-2-oxo-propionic acid is thus obtained as an oil. Analogously to the process that is described for 3-(1-phenyl-cyclobutyl)-2-oxo-propionic acid and for 3-1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-cyclopropyl-2-oxo-propionic acid, the acids that are described in Table 2 were obtained.

Then, the solution of 25 g of methallyl bromide and 17 g of trifluoropyruvic acid ethyl ester in 80 ml of tetrahydrofuran is added in drops at boiling heat over 2 hours, and boiled for another hour. Then, while being cooled with ice, saturated ammonium chloride solution and 300 ml of ethyl acetate are added, stirred for 30 minutes at 0 C., and the separated ethyl acetate phase is washed with saturated ammonium chloride solution and three times with water.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a method of treating an individual suffering from benign prostate hyperplasmia and prostate cancer. The prostate gland produces several components of semen in blood and several regulatory peptides. The prostate gland comprises stroma and epithelium cells, the latter group consisting of columnar secretory cells and basal non-secretory cells. The proliferation of these basal cells, as well as stroma cells gives rise to benign prostatic hyperplasmia (BPH) which is one common prostate disease. BPH is a progressive condition which is characterized by the nodular enlargement of the prostatic tissue resulting in obstruction of the urethra. This results in increased frequency of urination, noncuria, poor urine stream, and hesitation or delay in starting the urine flow. Consequences of BPH can include hypertrophy of bladder smooth muscle, decompensated bladder, and increased incidence of urinary tract infection. The development of BPH is considered to be an escapable phenomenon for the aging male population. BPH is observed in approximately 70% of males over the age of 70. Currently in the United States, the method of choice for treating BPH is surgery, e.g., transurethral recession of the prostate. There is no adequate therapeutic drug treatment for BPH. Another common prostate disease is prostatic adenocarcinoma (CaP) or androgen independent prostate cancer, which involves malignant transformation of epithelial cells in the peripheral region of the prostate gland. Androgen independent prostate cancer is presently the most common cancer in men in the United States with 38,000 deaths anticipated for the USA in 1994, and is a significant condition worldwide. Approximately 50% of patients are presented with metastatic disease. However, the only existing treatment for metastatic disease is hormonal therapy, which is not curative. Thus, the metastatic disease is typically fatal. Hormonal therapy consisting of different approaches to blocking the action of androgen on the prostate tumor is effective in controlling only the growth of tumor cells that depend on androgen for growth (hormone-dependent tumor). Unfortunately, hormone-dependent tumor inevitably progresses to more advanced hormone-independent tumor, which cannot be controlled by current treatment. Difficulties in treating prostate cancer arise from a variety of reasons. Although such androgen ablation is a standard therapy for metastatic prostate cancer it is rarely entirely successful because in most individuals the cancer is heterogeneous comprising both androgen dependent and androgen independent cancer cells. Thus, the therapy does not eliminate the androgen independent cells. Chemotherapy, which has been used to treat a number of other cancers, has not proven successful. This is because the vast majority of these androgen independent cells are not actively proliferating and standard chemotherapeutic agents work by selectively killing actively proliferating cells. Radiation therapy, which also is selective for rapidly proliferating cells, has also not proven effective. Surgery has also not proven an effective means for treating advanced disease states. Accordingly, it would be desirable to have new methods for stimulating the death of these slow proliferating cancer cells. It would be particularly desirable to have a new means of treating individuals suffering from prostate cancer, particularly androgen independent cancer. -lapachone (3,4dihydro-s,3-dimethyl-2H-naphthol1,3-b pyran-5,6-clone) is a simple plant product with a chemical structure different from currently used anti-cancer drugs. It is obtained by sulfuric acid treatment of the naturally occurring lapachol, which is readily isolated from Tabebuia avellanedae growing mainly in Brazil, or is easily synthesized from lomatiol, isolated from seeds of lomatia growing in Australia (Hooker, S., et. al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 58:1181-1190 (1936); Goncalves de Lima, O, et al., Rev. Inst. Antibiot. Univ. Recife. 4:3-17 (1962)). -lapachone has been shown to have a variety of pharmacological effects. -lapachone is a topoisomerase I inhibitor but acts by a different mechanism than camptothecin. Numerous -lapachone derivatives have been synthesized and tested as anti-viral and anti-parasitic agent (Goncalves, A. M., et al., Mol. Biochem. Perasitology, 1:167-176 (1980); Schaffner-Sabba, K., et al., J. Med. Chem., 27:990-994 (1984); Li, C., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:187-1842 (1993)). -lapachone and its derivatives, e.g. 3-allyl--lapachone, show anti-trypanosomal effects (Goncalves, A. M., et al., supra), the mechanism of which is unclear. It significantly prolongs the survival of mice infected with Rauscher leukemia virus, probably through inhibition of reverse transcriptase (Schaffner-Sabba, K., et al., supra; Schuerch, A. R., et al., J. Biochem., 84:197-205 (1978)). We taught that -lapachone also inhibits gene expression directed by the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and viral replication (Li, C., et al., supra). -lapachone has also been shown to be a DNA repair inhibitor which sensitizes cells to DNA damaging agents (Boorstein, R. J., et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 118:828-834, (1984); Boothman, D. A., et al., J. Cancer Res., 49:605-612 (1989)). -lapachone is well tolerated in dogs, rats, mice, and chickens. The maximum tolerated dose, when given p.o daily for one month, is 200 mg/kg in rats, and 100 mg/kg in dogs. Higher doses cause gastric ulceration and loss of erythrocytes, but not signs of bone marrow suppression (Ciba-Geigy, personal communication). The previous experience with this compound in humans has been limited. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have now discovered that unexpectedly compounds of the following formulae I and II can be used to selectively stimulate the death of mammalian prostate cells, including both epithelial cell and androgen dependent and independent prostate cancer (CaP) cells, and thus are useful in treating prostate diseases: wherein R and R 1 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydroxy, sulfhydryl, alogen, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl, substituted and unsubstituted alkenyl, substituted and unsubstituted aryl, and substituted and unsubstituted alkoxy, and salts thereof, wherein the dotted double bond between the ring carbons to which R and R 1 are bonded represent an optional ring double bond. Preferred compounds of formula I include those in which at least one of the substituents R and R 1 is hydrogen and/or at least one of said substituents is allyl. Specifically preferred compounds of formula I include -lapachone (i.e., R and R 1 both being hydrogen), allyl--lapachone, particularly 3-allyI--lapachone (i.e. R being allyl and R 1 being hydrogen) and 3-bromo--lapachone (i.e. R being bromo and R 1 being hydrogen). BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows the effect of -lapachone on survival of human prostate cancer cells O, PC-3 cells; DU145 cells. Cell survival was determined by the colony formation assay described below. FIGS. 2A , 2 B, 2 C and 2 D show induction of apoptosis by -lapachone in human prostate cancer cells. DNA laddering, typical feature of apoptosis, was induced in PC-3, D 145 (2A) and LNCaP cells (2B). In 2A, cells were treated with 4 M, -lapachone for 4 hours, followed by incubation in drug-free medium for 4 hours (lane 2,7), 12 hours (lane 3,8), 20 hours (lane 4,9), 44 hours (lane 5, 10). As controls, cells were treated with equal volume of DMSO (lane 1,6). DNA was extracted and subjected to electrophoresis. In 2B, LNCaP cells were treated with -lapachone for 4 hours at concentrations of 0 M (lane 1), 0.5 M (lane 2), 2 M (lane 3), 4 M (lane 4), followed by drug free incubation for 20 hours. To quantify apoptotic fraction, LNCaP cells were treated with or DMSO (2C) or 8 M -lapachone (2D) for 1 hour, followed by incubation in drug-free media for 23 hours before they were subjected to flow cytometric analysis. FIG. 3 shows lack of correlation between -lapachone induced apoptosis and the expression of p53 and bcl-2. A. Expression pattern of p53 and bcl-2 in DU-145 cells (lane 1) and PC-3 cells (lane 2). B,-lapachone did not induce expression of p53 and p21. Lane 1 to 4: PC-3 cells; lane 5 to 8: DU-145 cells. Cells were treated with DMSO (lane 1,5), or -lapachone at 2 M (lane 2,6), 4 M (lane 3, 7) and 8 M (lane 4, 8) for 1 hour, followed by incubation in drug free media for 23 hours. Expressions of p53, p21, and bcl-2 were determined by Western blot assay as described below. FIGS. 4A , 4 B, and 4 C shows induction of apoptosis (A) and differentiation in HL-60 cells (B,C) by -lapachone. In 4A, HL-60 cells were treated with 8 M -lapachone for 24 hours (lane 1). 16 hours (lane 2), 8 hours (lane 3), 4 hours (lane 4), 2 hours (lane 5), 0 hours (lane 6). Cellular DNA was extracted and subjected to gel electrophoresis. To analyze morphological changes induced by -lapachone, HL-60 cells were treated with ethanol (1/1000, v/v) (4B) or 0,8 pM -lapachone dissolved in ethanol (4C) for 6 days before harvest. A thin film of cells were spread on a slide, and stained with modified Wright-Giemsa Stain (Sigma). FIG. 5 shows the effect of -lapachone on tumor volume. The bar represents episodes of administration of -lapachone. FIG. 6 shows the effect in vivo of -lapachone on prostate tumors AT-3.1. FIG. 7 shows the effect in vivo of -lapachone on prostate tumors AT-3.1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION We have now discovered that unexpectedly compounds of the following formulae I and II can be used to stimulate the death of mammalian prostate cells including both epithelial and androgen dependent and independent prostate cancer (CaP) cells. The mammal is preferably a human. Thus, the compounds having the following formulae are useful in treating prostate diseases: wherein R and R 1 are each independently, selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydroxy, sulthyryl (SH), halogen (e.g. fluoro, chloro and bromo), substituted and unsubstituted aryl, substituted and unsubstituted alkenyl, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl and substituted and unsubstituted alkoxy, and salts thereof, wherein the dotted double bond between the ring carbons to which R and R 1 are bonded represent an optional ring double bond. The alkyl groups preferably have from 1 to about 15 carbon atoms, more preferably from 1 to about 10 carbon atoms, still more preferably from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. As used herein, the term alkyl unless otherwise modified refers to both cyclic and noncyclic groups, although of course cyclic groups will comprise at least three carbon ring members. Straight or branched chain noncyclic alkyl groups are generally more preferred than cyclic groups. Straight chain alkyl groups are generally more preferred than branched. The alkenyl groups preferably have from 2 to 15 carbon atoms, more preferably from 2 to about 10 carbon atoms, still more preferably from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms. Especially preferred alkenyl groups have 3 carbon atoms (i.e., 1 -propenyl or 2-propenyl), with the allyl moiety being particularly preferred. Phenyl and naphthyl are generally preferred aryl groups. Alkoxy groups include those alkoxy groups having one or more oxygen linkage and preferably have from 1 to 15 carbon atoms, more preferably from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms. Said substituted R and R 1 groups may be substituted at one or more available positions by one or more suitable groups such as, for example, alkyl groups such as alkyl groups having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms or from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, alkenyl groups such as alkenyl groups having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms or 2 to 6 carbon atoms, aryl groups having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms, halogen such as fluoro, chloro and bromo, and N, O and S, including heteroalkyl, e.g., heteroalkyl having one or more of said hetero atom linkages (and thus including alkoxy, aminoalkyl and thioalkyl) and from 1 to 10 carbon atoms or from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. As the experiments discussed below show, the compounds of formulae I and II are useful in suppressing survival in human ovary and breast cells, and are thus useful in treating ovarian and breast cancer. Compounds of formulae I and II can readily be made or obtained. (See Pardee, A., et al., Cancer Research, 49, 1-8 (1989); Schaffner-Sabba, K., et al., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 27, no. 8 990-994 (1984); S. Hooker, 58, 1181-1197 (1936). Preferred compounds of formula I include -lapachone, 3-allyl--lapachone, 3-bromo--lapachone and 3-OH--lapachone, 3-allyl--lapachone and 3-bromo--lapachone are more preferred. Preferred compounds of formula II include 3-bromo-alpha-lapocleone (compound 4 of Table 1). We have tested a variety of human cancer cells for their sensitivity to compounds of formulae I and II, e.g. -lapachone, a novel inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I (Li, C. J., et al., supra). Human prostate cancer cells were the cancer cells that was most sensitive to -lapachone and its derivatives, these compounds exhibiting enhanced death rates. We believe these cells were induced to undergo a process of programmed cell death (apoptosis) specifically activated in prostate cells after they are deprived of testosterone (Martikainen, P., et al., Cancer Res. 51:4693-4700 (1991)). Results in the nude mouse model demonstrate that compounds of formulae I and II such as -lapachone can inhibit human prostate tumor growth. This compound also causes suppression of survival, albeit at slightly higher concentrations, in human ovary and breast cells. However, typical apoptosis was not detected in any other human cancer cells of epithelial origins including colon, kidney, lung, breast, or ovary exposed to the drug other than the prostate cells. Human hematopoietic leukemia cells (HL-60) were induced to undergo either apoptosis or differentiation depending on the concentration used. The prevalence of p53 inactivation and/or bcl-2 expression in human tumors is generally believed to be at least partially responsible for the general ineffectiveness of current chemo- and radiation therapy for cancer (Berchem, G. J., et al., Cancer Res. 55:735-738 (1995); Lowe, S., et al., Science 266:807-810 (1994)). It is thus important to develop novel anti-cancer drugs that induce cell death in a p53 independent manner. One way such compounds could work is through activation of p53 targeting genes, e.g. p21 (SDI1/WAF1/Cipl), by a p53 independent pathway (Johnson, M., et al. Mol. Carcinogenesis 11:59-64 (1994)i. We have shown that compounds of formulae I and II such as -lapachone, and its derivatives induced apoptosis in the absence of p53 expression ( FIG. 3A ) indicating that it may be p53 independent. There was no significant induction of p53 and p21 ( FIG. 3B ) in human prostate cancer cells during apoptosis, suggesting that the induced apoptosis occurs independent of the p53 pathway. -lapachone and its derivatives induced cell death that also did not correlate with bcl-2 expression and was not protected by ectopically overexpressed bcl-2. These results thus indicate the existence of a cell death program independent of both p53 and bcl-2 can be activated by compounds of formulae I and II such as -lapachone and its derivatives. We have also treated human non-tumor prostate epithelial cells with -lapachone and found that their are proliferative ability was completely halted at concentrations as low as 1-2 M. Epithelial cancer cells from colon, kidney, lung, and other cell lines, are generally resistant to -lapachone (10 to 100 M) (Boorstein, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 118, 828-834 (1984); Boothman, et al. Cancer Res. 47, 5361-5366 (1987)). In general, for the treatment of androgen independent prostate cancer, a suitable effective dose of one or more compounds of formulae I or II will be preferably in the range of 10 to 500,000 g per kilogram body weight of recipient per day, more preferably in the range of 1000 to 50,000 g per kilogram body weight per day, most preferably in the range of 5000 to 25,000 g per kilogram body weight per day. The desired dose is suitably administered once or several more sub-doses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day, or other appropriate schedule. These sub-doses may be administered as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 1 to 20,000 l, preferably 10 to 10,000 g per unit dosage form. Accordingly, one would use an effective amount of these compounds in a method to stimulate the death of prostate tumor cells, particularly androgen independent prostatic tumor cells. One would select a subject having prostatic tumor cells and administer an effective amount of one of the compounds of formulae I or 11 such as 3-allyl--lapachone, 3-halo--lapachone or -lapachone to treat the prostatic tumor cell. Preferably, the subject is a human. Still more preferably, the human has CaP. In treating metastatic disease, because selective nature of the compounds of formulae I and II, one can administer the compounds intravenously. Administration of the compounds of the invention may be by any suitable route including oral, rectal, nasal, vaginal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) with oral or parenteral being preferred. It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with, for example, the condition and age of the recipient. The administrative ingredients may be used in therapy in conjunction with other medicaments. While one or more compounds of formulae I or II may be administered alone, they also may be present as part of a pharmaceutical composition. The compositions of the invention comprise at least one compound of formulae I or II together with one or more acceptable carriers thereof and optionally other therapeutic ingredients, including those therapeutic agents discussed supra. The carrier(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The compositions include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual) or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) administration. The compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., tablets and sustained release capsules, and in liposomes and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the to be administered ingredients with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredients with liquid carriers, liposomes or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. Compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion or packed in liposomes and as a bolus, etc. A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. Compositions suitable for topical administration include lozenges comprising the ingredients in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the ingredient to be administered in a suitable liquid carrier. Compositions suitable for topical administration to the skin may be presented as ointments, creams, gels and pastes comprising one or more compounds of formulae I or II and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A suitable topical delivery system is a transdermal patch containing the ingredient to be administered. Compositions suitable for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising, for example, cocoa butter or a salicylate. Compositions suitable for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range 20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e., by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration, as for example, a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Compositions suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. Compositions suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. To ensure solubility, the compounds are preferably dissolved in a non-ionic solubilizer such as an ethylene oxide ester-ether and fatty acid glycerides commercially available as Cremphor EL (BASF).

All documents mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference. The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples. These examples are provided to aid in the understanding of the invention and are not construed as a limitation thereof. EXAMPLES General Comments The following reagents and procedures were employed as specified in the examples. Chemicals -lapachone was kindly provided by Dr. A. Matter (CIBA-GEIGY Ltd., Switzerland). It was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 20 mM concentration, aliquoted, and kept at 20 C. Cell Cultures All cell lines used in this study are obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.) unless specified otherwise. Cells were maintained at 37 C. in 5% CO2 in complete humidity. Human prostrate tumor cells PC-3, DU145, and LNCaP were grown in Dulbeccos modified Eagles Medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 mM L-glutamine. HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia cell line) was cultured in RPMI medium with 10% heat inactivated FCS. MCF-7 and 21 MT (human breast epithelial cell line), kindly provided by Dr. R. Sager (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Mass.), were cultured in MEM alpha medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1 mg/ml insulin. AD 2780s (human ovary carcinoma), a generous gift from Dr. K. J. Scanlon (City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte), 293 (human kidney epithelial cell line), SW1116 (human colon adenocarcinoma), and human lung carcinoma cell lines (H596, H520) were cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 mM L-glutamine. Hela and Hela-bcl-2 cells (Meikrantz, W., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91:3754-3758 (1994), kindly provided by Drs. W. Meikrantz and R. Schlegel (Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Mass.), were cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 800 g/ml of G418. Colony Formation Assay Exponentially growing cells were seeded (2000 cells/dish) in 60 mm culture dishes and allowed to attach for 48 hours. -lapachone was added in less than 5 I volume (corresponding to a final DMSO concentration of less than 0.1%) directly to dishes from concentrated working solutions in DMSO. Control dishes received DMSO alone at equal volume. After 1 to 4 h, cells were rinsed and drug free medium was added to the cells. Cultures were observed daily for 10 to 20 days, cells were fixed and stained with modified Wright-Giemsa Stain (Sigma). Colonies of greater than 30 cells were scored as survivors. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis of Apoptotic DNA The method of Wesselborg, S., et al., J. Immunol., 150:4338 (1993) was used. Cells were treated with -lapachone, and then incubated in drug-free media. They were harvested and lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, and 0.15 ng/ml RNase. The supernatant of the cell lysate was loaded onto a 2% agarose gel. The electrophoresis was carried out at 24 V for 16 hours. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide. A Polaroid picture was taken after detaining the gel for 1 hour. Flow Cytometry Analysis Cytofluorometric analysis of apoptosis and cell cycle analysis was performed by propodium iodide staining of nuclei as reported previously (Li, C. J., et al., Science 268:429-431 (1995)). Western Blot Analysis Nuclear extract was prepared from exponentially growing cells (Dignam, J. D., et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 11:1475 (1983)). The ECL assay system was used to detect p53 and bcl-2 levels. Briefly, nuclear protein samples (10 g per sample) were electrophoresed in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and then electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was blocked, washed, and incubated with p53, bcl-2, or p21 (Cipl/Waf1) antibody (Oncogene Science, Cambridge, Mass.) at 1:1000 dilution. The filter was then incubated with a secondary antibody that was conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Finally, the filter was developed with detection reagents (RPN 2109:Amersham) and exposed to a hyperfilm-ECL (RPN 2103). Animal Administration In the in vivo animal experiments, -lapachone was formulated into solution with Cremophor EL (BASF). Example 1 Effects of -Lapachone on Prostate Weight Rats in the treated group received -lapachone at 50 mg/kg l.p.. After treatment the average prostate weight was 34572 g for control rats, and 20319 g treated animals. Statistical analysis showed a signficant decrease in prostate weight (p0.000002). These results demonstate that -lapachone indued shrinkage of the prostate gland. Example 2 Effects of -Lapachone on Survival of Human Cancer Cells Human carcinoma cell lines of different histotypes were used to test the anti-survival effect of -lapachone. Androgen independent human prostate tumor cells PC-3 and DU145 were treated with -lapachone in vitro. Cell survival was determined by colony formation assay, -lapachone inhibits proliferation of both cell lines with an IC 100 of 4 to 8 M (FIG. 1 ). LNCaP cells were equally sensitive to -lapachone. 21 MT (a human breast carcinoma cell line) and AD2780s (a human ovary carcinoma cell line) were also relatively sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of -lapachone (IC 100 , 16 M). Proliferation of SW116, a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, was not significantly inhibited by -lapachone up to 128 M, the maximum concentration used. Other cell lines tested, which included H596, H520 (human lung carcinoma cell lines) and 293 (a human kidney epithelial cell line) were also relatively resistant to -lapachone (IC 100 32 M). Seventeen derivatives of -lapachone were tested in PC-3 and DU145 cells in the manner described above. 3-allyl--lapachone and 3-bromo--lapachone were found to be more active than -lapachone against prostate cells (Table 1). TABLE 1 Antisurvival effect of -lapachone and its derivatives against human prostate cancer cells -lapachone and derivatives Activity / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / *Compound of the present invention. Example 3 Induction of Apoptosis by -Lapachone in Human Prostate Cancer Cells Extensive cell death was observed in proliferating human prostate cancer cells after treatment with -lapachone. To determine whether this cell death occurs through necrosis or apoptosis, cells were harvested by trypsinization and their genomic DNA was subjected to gel electrophoresis. As shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B , -lapachone induced a typical DNA laddering in human prostate cancer cells, consistent with cell death by apoptosis, a process that is specifically activated in prostate cells after they are deprived of testosterone (Kyprianou, N., et al., Cancer Surv., 11:265-77, (1991)). This -lapachone induced apoptosis was observed in every prostate cell line tested, including PC-3, DU 145, and LNCaP. To test whether quiescent cells are similarly sensitive to -lapachone, both PC-3 and DU145 cells were serum starved for 48 hours before drug treatment. Apoptosis was similarly induced in non-proliferating cells (data not shown). To determine the percentage of apoptotic cells, the fraction of subG1 cells was quantitated with flow cytometry analysis. As shown in FIG. 2C , -lapachone induced apoptosis in 68% of LNCaP cells by 24 hours after initial treatment with -lapachone. In PC-3 cells, apoptosis occurs in 62% by 24 hours (data not shown). Apoptosis, as determined by DNA laddering and chromosome condensation, was not detected in -lapachone treated 21-MT (human breast epithelial cell line), H520 (human lung carcinoma cell lines), SW1116 (human colon adenocarcinoma), A2780s (human ovary carcinoma) cells. Example 4 Apoptosis Induced by -Lapachone is Independent of Expression of p53 and bcl-2. Expression of bcl-2 has been implicated in the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs including prostate cells (Berchem, G. J., et al., Cancer Res. 55:735-738 (1995)). To determine whether apoptosis in prostate cancer cells is due to lack of bcl-2 expression, we measured bcl-2 expression by Western blot assay. As shown in FIG. 3 , bcl-2 expression is high in PC-3 and low in DU145 cells, which does not correlate with their sensitivity to -lapachone induced apoptosis. Hela cells with ectopic overexpression of bcl-2 (hela-bcl-2) (Meikrantz, W., et al., supra) was not significantly resistant to -lapachone in comparison with its parental cell line (IC100 was 16 M in parental cells, and 32 M in Hela-bcl-2 cells) (data not shown). p53 status has been shown to be important for apoptosis in cancer cells provoked by ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs (Lowe, S., et al., Science 266:807-810 (1994)). p 53 was expressed in DU145 cells, but was not detectable in PC-3 cells (FIG. 3 A), although apoptosis was induced in both cell lines (FIG. 2 A). -lapachone treatment did not significantly induce expression of p53 (FIG. 3 B). These results suggest that apoptosis induced by -lapachone is not dependent on P53 expression. Expression of p21 is not significantly upregulated in prostate cancer cells undergoing apoptosis (FIG. 3 B). The effect of -lapachone was also tested in hematopoietic cancer cells. Treatment of HL-60 (p53 -), a human leukemia cell line, with -lapachone also induced apoptosis. Chromosomal laddering was detectable with 4 hours after -lapachone treatment (FIG. 4 A). At sub-apoptotic doses, -lapachone induced an increase in the G1 fraction (data not shown) and morphological in HL-60 cells (FIG. 4 B). Example 5 Inhibition of Human Prostate Tumor Growth In Vivo -lapachone was tested against human prostate tumor in nude mice. A hormone refractory human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line (PC-3) was inoculated into nude mice. Treatment was initiated when tumor reached 100 to 250 mm 3 . Without drug treatment (mouse 5), the tumor grew rapidly and the mouse died when the tumor reached about 400 mm 3 (FIG. 5 ). -lapachone, given at 500 mg/kg, stopped tumor growth (mouse 2, FIG. 5 ). At intermediate dosage (250 mg.kg, mouse 1 and 3), -lapachone also showed intermediate inhibition on tumor growth (FIG. 5 ). Mouse 4 did not develop an appreciable tumor mass under the treatment with -lapachone (500 mg/kg). No sign of drug toxicity was observed. In addition, the in vivo efficacy of -lapachone were determined in a widely used prostate tumor model, Dunning R-3327 rat prostate adenocarcinoma. A highly metastatic and malignant clone (RT-3.1) of Dunning R-3327 prostate adenocarcinoma cells were inoculated into Copenhagen rats. Solid tumor masses were formed one week later. Rats in treatment group received one dose of -lapachone at 50 mg/ml, I.p. Tumor necrosis was observed 24 hours after drug treatment in every treated rats, but not in untreated controls. Tumor volume was measured. The results are set forth in FIGS. 6 and 7 . The invention has been described in detail with reference to preferred embodiments thereof.

TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to novel amino acid derivatives which have immunomodulating activity, antitumor activity and/or hematopoietic stem cell-amplifying activity and are represented by the general formula (I) shown hereinafter, and also it relates to salts of salt-formable ones of said amino acid derivatives. Further, this invention relates to an immunomodulator comprising as active ingredient a novel amino acid derivative represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof, and an antitumor agent comprising as active ingredient a novel amino acid derivative represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof, as well as a hematopoietic stem cell amplifier comprising as active ingredient a novel amino acid derivative represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof. BACKGROUND ART Because many of antitumor agents which have heretofore been clinically used are inherently cytotoxic substances, they are accompanied by the drawbacks that they generally have strong toxicity, can give damages to normal cells along with their ability to prevent growth of cancer cells, and hence can induce strong side-effects. There is accordingly an outstanding demand for novel antitumor agents which have such a mechanism of the activity as different from that of the conventional antitumor agents, show low toxicity and weaker side-effects and are effective for therapeutic treatment of human tumors. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION As a result of an extensive investigation, we, the present inventors, have succeeded in synthesizing novel amino acid derivatives which can be represented by the general formula (I) shown hereinafter, and we have also found that these amino acid derivatives stimulate activation of T cell of mammals and hence have one or more of the immunomodulating activity and the antitumor and/or carcinostatic activities against various tumors and/or cancers, as well as the hematopoietic stem cell-amplifying activity.

No. 5,098,935), because the meanings of R 1 , R 3 , R 4 and y are restricted by the proviso clause, as defined in the general formula (I). BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The novel amino acid derivative according to the present invention, which is represented by the formula (I), can be synthesized by several processes as will be described below. According to one of such synthesis processes, the amino acid derivative of the general formula (I) can be synthesized by reacting a compound of the following general formula (II): R 1 COOH(II) wherein R 1 has the same meaning as defined above in the general formula (I) with an amine compound of the following general formula (III): wherein R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 and y have the same meanings as defined above in the general formula (I) in accordance with a usual reaction for amidating carboxylic acid compounds. This amidating reaction can be conducted, for example, in the absence of any catalyst, or in the presence of a dehydrating condensation agent or in the presence of a base. As said dehydrating condensation agent, a conventional dehydrating condensation agent can be used such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. Illustrative examples of the base include a metal alcoholate such as sodium methoxide, an alkyl metal such as butyl lithium, and a metal hydride such as sodium hydride. Also employable is such a process in which the carboxylic acid compound of the formula (II) is converted into an acid halide by a halogenating reagent such as phosphorus pentachloride or thionyl chloride, followed by the reaction of the acid halide with the amine compound of the formula (III). In this reaction, the synthetic reaction can occasionally be promoted by adding 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, N-hydroxysuccinimide or the like in some instances. For said reaction with the amine compound of the formula (III), an ester of the following formula (IV): R 1 CO 2 R 45 (IV) wherein R 45 represents an alkyl group, a phenyl group or a substituted phenyl group and R 1 has the same meaning as defined above can be used in place of the carboxylic acid compound of the formula (II). As an alternative, where the carboxylic acid compound of the formula (II) contains a hydroxyl-substituted alkyl group as R 1 and can form a lactone ring between the hydroxyl group and the carboxyl group, it is possible to use a lactone compound for said carboxylic acid derivative. For instance, when a carboxylic acid compound of the general formula (II) used is such a carboxylic acid containing a group of the following formula (V): as R 1 , the reaction of a lactone of the following formula (VI): namely, 2-hydroxy-3,4-dimethyl--butyrolactone (see Example 5 given hereinafter) with the amine compound of the formula (III) may be conducted in the presence of an inorganic catalyst or a base. In this reaction, the base usable includes metal alcoholates such as sodium methoxide, an alkyl metal such as butyl lithium, and metal hydrides such as sodium hydride. Further, usable is such a process in which, similarly to the case with making use of the carboxylic acid compound of the formula (II), an ester compound of the aforesaid formula (IV) or a lactone compound such as that of the formula (VI) is converted into an acid halide by a halogenating reagent e.g. phosphorus pentachloride or thionyl chloride, followed by reaction of the acid halide with the amine compound of the formula (III). For conducting each of these reactions, if necessary, it is possible to introduce beforehand the conventional protecting group(s) into the compound(s) to be used in the reaction, and after the reaction, to remove the protecting group(s) from the reaction product so obtained. In the carboxylic acid compound of the formula (II) or the amine compound of the formula (III) to be used, for example, it is possible to protect a hydroxyl group of said compound by tetrahydropyranyl group, trimethylsilyl group or the like, to protect an amino group of said compound by acetyl group, carboxybenzyl group, t-butoxycarbonyl group or the like, to protect a mercapto group of said compound by acetyl group, t-butoxycarbonyl group or the like, and to protect a carboxyl group of said compound by benzyl group, methyl group or the like.

Next, in order to synthesize such an amino acid derivative of the formula (I) in which R 5 is a group OR 42 where R 42 is a C 1 -C 3 alkyl group or is a group (q is as defined above), it is possible to use a process comprising a general esterifying reaction, including, for example, such a process in which a corresponding amino acid compound of the formula (I) where R 42 is a hydrogen atom is reacted with an alcohol compound of the formula HOR 55 (R 55 is a C 1 -C 3 alkyl group or a group in the presence of an acid or a base or in the presence of an esterifying condensation agent, or such a process in which the corresponding compound (I) where R 42 is a hydrogen atom is converted into an acid halide by reaction with a halogenating agent such as thionyl chloride or phosphorus pentachloride, followed by the reaction of the resulting halide with an alcohol of the formula HOR 55 (R 55 is as defined above).

The novel amino acid derivatives of the general formula (I) have a characteristic feature of their action that they stimulate specifically the proliferation of the activated T cells obtained from mouse spleen cells but do not act on the resting T cells. For example, the amino acid derivatives of this invention stimulate the proliferation of such T cells which have been treated with Concanavalin A, or the proliferation of such T cells which co-exist with macrophages. In view of this, the amino acid derivatives of the general formula (I) are expected to modulate the immunological activities of a living mammal owing to that they can increase and activate the clones of helper T cells or effecter T cells. Thus, the amino acid derivative of the formula (I) have potential utility that they are useful as therapeutics and/or preventives for tumors, auto-immune diseases, hematopoietic disorders and the like. The activities of the novel amino acid derivative of the general formula (I) to stimulate the proliferation of T cells will be demonstrated by the following test. Test 1 Effects of the novel amino acid derivatives of the general formula (I) on the proliferation of T cells were investigated by the following procedure. The spleens, which had been excised in sterility from female Fisher 344 rats (12-16 weeks old, purchased from CHARLES RIVER JAPAN, INC), were squeezed in RPMI 1640 medium (a product of NISSUI PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD.) supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum, followed by passage of the resulting cell suspension through a column containing nylon wool fibres, whereby a cell suspension containing an abundant amount of T cells was obtained. This cell suspension was diluted to a level of 110 6 cells/ml with addition of a medium of the same composition as above. The cell-containing medium so obtained was then added with 5 g/ml of Concanavalin A (product of Pharmacia AB), followed by incubation at 37 C. for 4 hours. Four hours later, -methylmannoside was added to the incubated medium to give a concentration of 20 mg/ml of -methylmannoside. After stirring the medium, cells were separated and collected therefrom by centrifugation. The collected cells were suspended at a level of 310 6 cells/ml in a medium of the same composition as above, followed by placing the resulting cell suspension in 100 l portions in a 96-well microplate. Novel amino acid derivatives at various concentrations, which are shown in Table 4, were incorporated in an amount of 100 l as the test compounds to the respective cell suspensions in the plate, followed by incubation at 37 C. for 3 days in an incubator under air atmosphere containing 5% of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, eighteen hours before the completion of the incubation, a solution of 10 Ci/ml of radioactively labeled thymidine (Thymidine 6- 3 H, a product of NEN Company) was added in an amount of 10 l to the cell suspensions under incubation. The cells after the incubation were collected on a filter paper by means of a cell harvester, washed with water and radioactivity of the cells so treated was determined by a liquid scintillation counter. The determined values of the radioactivity of the cells as treated with the test compounds were evaluated on the assumption that the determined value of the radioactivity of the cells untreated, namely tested without addition of the test compound during the incubation of cells was amounting to 100. The so evaluated values are recorded and expressed as rates (%) for stimulating the T cell proliferation which show such extent that the proliferation of T cells is enhanced by the new amino acid derivative of this invention. The test results obtained are shown in Table 4 below. From the results of Table 4, it is evident that the compounds of the general formula (I) according to this invention have excellent activity of stimulating the proliferation of T cells and hence have excellent activities for immunomodulation.

The antitumor activity of the novel amino acid derivatives of the general formula (I) will be demonstrated by the following test. Test 2 The antitumor activity of some amino acid derivatives of the general formula (I) according to this invention was tested in the following manner. A suspension of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells was subcutaneously injected to one of the inguinal parts of each ICR mouse to transplant 410 6 cells/mouse. From the seventh day after the transplantation, a test compound was intraperitoneally injected daily for 7 days at a dose of 50, 5 or 0.5 mg/kg (4 mice per treated group of mice, but 8 mice per untreated control group of mice). On the fifteenth day after the transplantation, a solid cancer was cut out and weighed. A reduction in the weight of solid cancers of the mice in each treated group of mice which was evaluated in comparison with the control group is expressed as rate of inhibiting the tumor growth (%) in Table 5 below. As is presented in Table 5, each compound of the present invention exhibited remarkable activity for inhibition of tumor growth against mouse Ehrlich solid cancer. TABLE 5 Compound No. Tumor growth of Invention Dose (mg/kg) inhibiting rate, % 10 5 31 10 50 58 12 0.5 37 19 5 12 Further, according to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a hematopoietic stem cell amplifier which comprises as active ingredient at least one of the novel amino acid derivative represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof. The novel amino acid derivatives have such another characteristic feature of their activities that they have property to stimulate the proliferation of T cells and also physiological activities of T cells. These amino acid derivatives also show an activity to stimulate production of interleukin-3 (IL-3) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) from T cells see Zoketsu InshiKenkyu no Choryu (in English: Hematopoietic FactorsTrend of Research), compiled and edited by Miura Yoshisada and published from the Chugai Igakusha, Inc. (1991). Cytokines as these interleukins are known to exhibit an activity for stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Because the amino acid derivatives of the general formula (I) according to this invention show the activities to stimulate the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, they are expected to be useful as therapeutics for treating leukopenia, trombocytopenia and the like. The activity of the novel amino acid derivatives of the general formula (I) for inducing proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells will be demonstrated by the following test. Test 3 The activity of some amino acid derivatives of the general formula (I) according to this invention which induces proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells was tested in the following manner. Thus, bone-marrow cells had been prepared from the femurs of male BALB/c mouse (6-7 weeks old), and then a suspension of the bone-marrow cells was overlayed on Lympholite M (product of Cefalane Company), followed by centrifugation under 1500 g for 20 minutes. A lymphocyte fraction was collected, washed three times with alpha MEM medium (product of Gibco Company), and then diluted and suspended in the same medium as above to give a lymphocyte concentration of 710 6 cells/ml. 50 ml of the resulting cell suspension, 50 l of a solution of a test compound in physiological saline, 50 l of a culture supernatant of WEHI-3, 100 l of phosphate-buffered physiological saline, 50 l of a pre-deionized 10% bovine serum albumin solution, 50 l of an L-asparagin solution (200 g/ml), 50 l of a calcium chloride solution (260 g/ml) and 50 l of bovine plasma containing sodium citrate were combined together. The liquid mixture so obtained was poured in portions of 50 l/well on a slide glass (Glass Ware, product of Flaw Laboratory Company). After coagulation of the mixture, the slide glass bearing the coagulated masses was immersed in 10% FBS-added alpha MEM medium, followed by incubation at 37 C. under 5% CO 2 for 7 days. After completion of the incubation, the cells on the slide glass were immobilized with a 25% glutaraldehyde solution. In accordance with the methods proposed by Nagasawa et al. Zoketsu Kan Saibo (Hematopoietic Stem Cells) compiled by takahisa Shimamaro, page 128 (The Nishimura Shoten Co., Ltd.), the immobilized cells were stained for acetylcholinesterase activity which is specific for mouse megakaryocytes, and also the cells were stained with Mayer hematoxylin. Each cell culture so stained was dried and then sealed with a sealing agent. Under a microscope of 100 magnification, the number of megakaryocytic colonies (i.e., the number of cells stained in an orange color) per well was counted. The results are presented in Table 6. As is shown in Table 6, it is evident that the compounds according to the present invention significantly increase the number of colonies of megakaryocytes, in other words, significantly stimulate the formation of megakaryocyte colonies and hence exhibit a remarkable activity to induce proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells.

No. 08/945,779, filed Jan. 26, 1998, now abandoned, which is a 35 U.S.C. 371 application of PCT/GB96/01052, filed May 1, 1996 which claims priority to (1) Great Britain Application No. 9517107.0; (2) Great Britain Application No. 9605440.8; and (3) Great Britain Application No. 9508823.3. FIELD The specification relates to the presentation of bioactives, in which term we include a drug, essential nutrient or any other compound to be administered to the human or animal body in therapy or maintenance of health. In particular, the specification relates to the presentation of such bioactives in a form in which they are lipophilic so that they can pass lipid barriers in the body readily, or to the presentation of two bioactives in the same molecule (where at least one of the bioactives is a fatty acid or fatty alcohol), or to the presentation of bioactives in a form which serves both aims and/or the aims of ready synthesis of such compounds without a chiral centre. From a drug regulatory viewpoint it is a great advantage to have two bioactives presented as a single molecule rather than as two separate entities. There may also be advantages in presenting known bioactives in novel ways. Those advantages include increased lipophilicity, the additive effects of two bioactives which are not normally presented together, and the sometimes synergistic effects of such bioactives. The invention concerns the linking of bioactives (where at least one bioactive is an unsaturated fatty acid) through certain link molecules, specifically geminal dioxo and geminal amino oxo moieties considered in detail later herein, to yield geminal tripartate drugs, the synthesis of a range of compounds and their use in therapy and/or the maintenance of health. Geminal Tripartate Mutual Prodrug Concept Frequently simple ester mutual prodrugs of bioactives are not sufficiently labile in vivo to ensure a sufficiently high rate of conversion of the prodrug to the two desired bioactives. One reason is that for these simple ester mutual prodrugs the ester bond may be resistant to enzymatic attack for either steric or electronic reasons. One way to overcome this problem is to use the geminal tripartate mutual prodrug approach whereby the bioactives are linked via either a geminal dioxo or geminal amino oxo linkage. For example, two bioactive carboxylic acids may be linked as a diester via a geminal dioxo linkage. As outlined in Scheme 1, the first step in the hydrolysis of the general dioxo diester is enzymatic cleavage, either via enzymatic pathway 1 or pathway 2, of one of the mutual bioactive ester bonds with subsequent formation of a highly unstable hydroxymethyl ester which rapidly dissociates in vivo to the other bioactive and an aldehyde. With either pathway both bioactives are generated after only one enzymatic hydrolysis reaction. A further advantage is the opportunity for simultaneously or approximately simultaneous delivery of two different bioactives. For example, a bioactive alcohol may be coupled to an unsaturated fatty acid as an ester/ether via a geminal dioxo linkage. As outlined in Scheme 2, ester hydrolysis leads to formation of the unsaturated fatty acid and an unstable hemiacetal derivative of the bioactive alcohol which rapidly splits into the free bioactive and an aldehyde. Published Material The concepts of linking unsaturated fatty acids to bioactives using the geminal dioxo or geminal amino oxo diester approach such as discussed above has received no great attention in the published patent and general literature with the exception of Terumo K.K. in EPA-0 222 155 which link 5-fluoro uracil to alpha linolenic acid, dihomo gamma linolenic acid, or eicosapentaenoic acid through a group CH(R)-O where Rmethyl etc as, inter alia, anti-cancer agents. Lipid Barriers Many drugs act at the cell membrane surface by combining with cell surface receptors, or alternatively are taken into cells by specific transport systems. However, there are many drugs which, while they act within cells by modifying one of many different functions such as nucleic acid functions, the actions of intracellular enzymes, or the behaviour of systems like the lysosomes or the microtubules, are not able to penetrate cells effectively. There may be no receptors and transport systems with which they can link, or these systems may transport the drug into the cell at a less then optimum rate. Equally drugs may penetrate intracellular membranes such as mitochondrial and nuclear membranes at less than optimum rates. There are other barriers to drug movements which are recognised as important. One of particular significance is the blood-brain barrier, which has many of the characteristics of the cell membrane. There are many drugs which have difficulty in reaching adequate concentrations in the brain because of this barrier. Another is the skin: until a few years ago drugs were applied to the skin only if their purpose was to act on the skin. However, it has been recognised that the skin can be an appropriate route for getting drugs with systemic actions into the body, and as a result more and more compounds are being administered by variations of patch technology. All three types of barriers, the cell membrane and intracellular membranes, the blood-brain barrier and the skin have an important feature in common, they are substantially composed of lipids. What this means is that they are impermeable to primarily water-soluble drugs unless these drugs can be carried across the membrane by a receptor or transport system. In contrast, lipophilic substances are able to cross the barriers more readily without the need for any specific receptor or transport system. Classes of Bioactives Requiring Passage Through Lipid Barriers Drugs whose pharmacokinetic behaviour may be improved by increased lipophilicity, listed by route of entry, are as follows: 1. Cell entry: drugs particularly likely to benefit are those that act primarily intracellularly. These include: a. All anti-inflammatory drugs, whether steroid or non-steroid b. All cytotoxic drugs used in the management of cancer; c. All antiviral drugs; d. All other drugs that have to enter cells in order to achieve optimum effects, in particular drugs which act on DNA or RNA, or on enzymes located intracellularly, or on second messenger systems, or on microtubules, mitochondria, lysosomes, or any other intracellular organelle. e. Steroid hormones and other hormones that act intracellularly, such as oestrogens, progestins, androgenic hormones and dehydroepiandrosterone. 2. Blood-brain barrier: all drugs acting on the central nervous system will have their transport improved by this technique. This includes all drugs used in psychiatry, all drugs used in cerebral infections with any organism or in cerebral cancer and all other drugs acting on nerve cells such as anti-epileptic drugs and others acting on neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntingtons chorea and others. 3. Skin: as with the blood-brain barrier, all drugs that may be required to penetrate the skin to achieve a systemic effect will benefit from their conversion to a fatty acid derivative. For example, the approach discussed is applicable to amino acids. Of particular interest are those which seem to play roles in the regulation of cell function as well as acting as components of proteins. Examples include tryptophan (a precursor of 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT, a key regular of nerve and muscle function), phenylalanine (a precursor of catecholamines) and arginine (a regulator of the synthesis of nitric oxide which also plays important roles in controlling cellular activities). Properties Conferred Generally Generally the compounds proposed herein have many advantages in addition to their lipophilicity. Two moieties of a given fatty acid or even a single moiety may be delivered, in a form which is readily incorporated into the body as an oral, parenteral or topical formation; which is very well tolerated with none of the side effects associated, for example, with free fatty acids; which is not too stable to be properly utilised. When two different fatty acids are to be delivered, the advantages are as before plus the ability to administer simultaneously two materials with different biological actions in a single molecule. This avoids the regulatory problems which ensue when two materials are administered as separate compounds. When two drugs are delivered as separate molecules, regulatory authorities normally require each drug to be studied alone as well as in combination. If the two are combined in a single molecule, only the single molecule needs to be studied, greatly reducing the cost of development. Where actives other than fatty acids are present there are similar advantages. The compounds allow drugs or other compounds to be administered in the form of relatively-lipophilic compounds which release the active moieties relatively easily, and which are well tolerated on oral, topical or parenteral administration. Their lipophilicity enables them to be absorbed partially through the lymphatic system, so by-passing the liver; to cause less gastrointestinal irritation than with many compounds; and to facilitate transport of drugs and other agents across lipophilic barriers such as the skin, the cell membrane and the blood-brain barrier. There is evidence that interesting specific properties in addition to ready passage of lipid barriers can be conferred on many drugs by making them more lipophilic as outlined in scheme 1. These properties include prolonged duration of action, reduction of side effects especially gastro-intestinal, bypassing of first-pass liver metabolism and, potentially, site specific delivery of different materials. Fatty Acid Derivatives; Effects of the Fatty Acids The transport of actives across lipid membranes may be improved by linking them directly or via intermediate links to, in particular, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) or dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), two fatty acids which in themselves have a range of desirable effects. These links also enable bioactive substances to be co-delivered in the same molecule with fatty acids which in themselves have desirable actions, irrespective of any transport advantages. Other fatty acids, such as any of the essential fatty acids (EFAs) and in particular the twelve natural acids of the n-6 and n-3 series EFAs (FIG. 1), can be used. Of these twelve, arachidonic acid, adrenic acid, stearidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid are of particular interest because they in themselves have particularly desirable effects. Furthermore, any fatty acid, suitably C 12 -C 30 or C 16 -C 30 desirably with two or more cis or trans carbon-carbon double bonds may also be of use. Use may be in the form of the fatty acid or the corresponding fatty alcohol. Conjugated linoleic and columbinic acids are examples of fatty acids which in themselves have valuable properties and are likely to be of particular use. References to fatty acids are accordingly to be read herein as to be both forms, except where the chemistry of one or the other specifically is under discussion. The desirable properties of GLA and DGLA however, make them especially valuable for the purpose. The essential fatty acids, which in nature are of the allcis configuration, are systematically named as derivatives of the corresponding octadecanoic, eicosanoic or docosanoic acids, e.g. z,z-octadeca-9,12-dienoic acid or z,z,z,z,z,z-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexaenoic acid, but numerical designations based on the number of carbon atoms, the number of centres of unsaturation and the number of carbon atoms from the end of the chain to where the unsaturation begins, such as, correspondingly, 18:2m-6 or 22:6n-3 are convenient. Initials, e.g., EPA and shortened forms of the name e.g. eicosapentaenoic acid are used as trivial names in some of the cases. FIG. 1 n-6 EFAs n-3 EFAs 18:2 n-6 18:3 n-3 (Linoleic acid, LA) (-Linolenic acid, ALA) -6-desaturase 18:3 n-6 18:4 n-3 (-Linolenic acid, GLA) (Stearidonic acid, SA) elongation 20:3 n-6 20:4 n-3 (Dihomo--linolenic acid, DGLA) -5-desaturase 20:4 n-6 20:5 n-6 (Arachidonic acid, AA) (Eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA) elongation 22:4 n-6 22:5 n-3 (Adrenic acid) -4-desaturase 22:5 n-6 22:6 n-3 (Docosahexaenoic acid, DHA) GLA and DGLA In their own right GLA and DGLA have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, to lower blood pressure, to inhibit platelet aggregation, to lower cholesterol levels, to inhibit cancer cell growth, to reduce dyskinetic movements, to relieve breat pain, to improve calcium absorption and enhance its deposition in bone, to reduce the adverse effects of ionising radiation, to treat various psychiatric disorders, to cause vasodilation, to improve renal function, to treat the complications of diabetes, to dilate blood vessels and so on. Actives linked to GLA and DGLA will therefore not only become more lipophilic, enhancing penetration across all membranes, the skin and the blood brain barrier, but are also likely to exhibit new additional therapeutic effects. Other fatty acis likely to be of especial value in this context are arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid which are major constituents of all cell membranes; adrenic acid; and stearidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid which have ranges of desirable properties similar to those of GLA and DGLA. Fatty acids not included in the fatty acids of FIG. 1 which are of particular interest are conjugated linoleic acid (cLA) and columbinic acid (CA). cLA has a range of interesting effects in treating and preventing cancer, in promoting growth particularly of protein-containing tissues, in preventing and treating cardiovascular disease and as an antioxidant. CA has many of the properties of essential fatty acids. Classes of Actives Having Mutual Efficacy with Bioactive Fatty Acids Kinds of actives to be incorporated in compounds as set out herein may be broadly stated: a) Drugs including antibiotics, antiprotozoals, antipsychotics, antidepressants and NSAIDs and compounds used in the treatment of cardiovascular, respiratory, dermatological, psychiatric, neurological, renal, muscular, gastrointestinal, reproductive and other diseases and in cancer. b) Hormones c) Amino acids d) Vitamins particularly of the B group, and other essential nutrients. e) Cytokines and peptides f) Neurotransmitters and neurotransmitter precursors. g) Phospholipid head groups such as inositol, choline, serine and ethanolamine, which may be linked directly or via the phosphate moiety. h) Aromatic fatty acids as phenylacetic acid, phenyl butyric acid and cinnamic acid which are of particular value in cancer treatment. Efficacy The combination of the therapeutic effect of a drug with the therapeutic effect of a fatty acid may be considered through examples: a) Psychotropic drugs may be linked to fatty acids such as GLA, DGLA, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic or docosahexaenoic acid which have important roles in brain function, so providing a dual therapeutic effect. b) Drugs used for the treatment of cardiovascular disease may be attached to a fatty acid which also has value in such treatment, such as eicosapentaenoic acid which lowers triglyceride levels and inhibits platelet aggregation, or GLA or DGLA which lower cholesterol levels and have vasodilator action, or arachidonic acid which is a potent cholesterol lowering agent, or DHA which has anti-arrhythmic properties. c) Drugs used in the treatment of any form of inflammation may be linked to a fatty acid such as gammalinolenic acid, dihomo-gammalinolenic acid or eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid which also has anti-inflammatory action. d) Drugs used in the management of osteoporosis may be linked to GLA or DGLA which enhance the incorporation of calcium into bone, or to EPA or DHA which reduces urinary calcium excretion. e) Drugs used in skin disease may be linked to GLA or DGLA which have anti-inflammatory effects on the skin. f) Drugs used in cancer may be linked to GLA, DGLA, arachidonic acid, EPA or DHA which have anticancer effects in their own right and which may reverse resistance to anticancer drugs. Concepts Applied to Essential Fatty Acids as Bioactives The essential fatty acids (EFAs) as already referred to, and well known, consist of a series of twelve compounds. Although linoleic acid, the parent compound of the n-6 series, and alpha-linolenic acid, the parent compound of the n-3 series, are the main dietary EFAs, these substances as such have relatively minor roles in the body. In order to be fully useful to the body, the parent compounds must be metabolised to longer chain and more highly unsaturated compounds. In quantitative terms, as judged by their levels in cell membranes and in other lipid reactions dihomogammalinolenic acid (DGLA) and arachidonic acid (AA) are the main EFA metabolites of the n-6 series while eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are the main metabolites of the n-3 series. DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA are important constituents of most of the lipids in the body. As well as being important in themselves they can also give rise to a wide range of oxygenated derivatives, the eicosanoids, including the prostaglandins, leukotrienes and other compounds. The fatty acids likely to be of particular value in therapy are DGLA, AA, EPA and DHA, together with GLA, the precursor of DGLA, stearidonic acid (SA), the precursor of EPA and DPA (22:5n-3), the precursor of DHA, and adrenic acid. Further there are fatty acids such as oleic acid, parinaric acid and columbinic acid that are not EFAs but may have significant effects in the body. One of the most interesting of these is conjugated linoleic acid which as noted earlier has a range of desirable effects. It used to be though that, both in nutrition and in therapy of disease, it was sufficient to supply linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids and the bodyown metabolism would do the rest. It is now widely accepted that this is not true. Different diseases may have different abnormal patterns of EFAs and because of problems in metabolism these cannot simply be corrected by giving linoleic or alpha-linolenic acid. It is therefore appropriate in many situations to provide increased amounts of one of the other EFAs or to give two or more of the EFAs simultaneously. While the EFAs can be supplied in various forms and in various mixtures, it is convenient in both nutrition and in medical treatment to be able to supply the fatty acids as particular molecules. Equally in various situations it may be desirable to give the EFA or other fatty acid in association with an amino acid, vitamin, drug or other molecule which in itself has desirable properties. To date, proposals for administration of two fatty acids simultaneously have been in terms of particular triglycerides, following the natural occurrence of essential fatty acids in triglyceride form. However, triglycerides, unless symmetrical about the 2-carbon, are chiral and that fact, coupled with acyl migration between the alpha and beta positions makes the synthesis of specific triglycerides a difficult task. Such migration may take place after synthesis creating particular problems in a drug regulatory context. The lack of specificity when two fatty acids are present in the same triglyceride molecule creates many problems in synthesis, pharmacology, formulation and stability. Moreover triglycerides can be slow and difficult to synthesise. For purposes of convenient administration of different fatty acids simultaneously or indeed of a single fatty acid in high amounts in well tolerated form, use can be made of the geminal tripartate mutual prodrug approach discussed earlier herein, and in detail later. Chemical Nature Of Bioactives Which May Be Derivatised According To The Present Disclosure The present specification covers tripartate prodrugs in which unsaturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty alcohols are linked to bioactives with an available carboxyl, alcohol, or acidic NH group through a geminal dioxo or geminal amino oxo linkage as appropriate. Classes Of Bioactives By Chemistry (a) Bioactives with a free carboxyl group these may be derivatised as follows: (i) diester coupling with unsaturated fatty acid via geminal dioxo linkage (ii) ester/ether coupling with unsaturated fatty alcohol via geminal dioxo linkage (b) bioactives with a free hydroxyl groupthese may be dervatised as follows: ester/ether coupling with unsaturated fatty acid via geminal dioxo linkage (c) bioactives with an acidic NH group (these include amides, imides, hydantoins, tertiary or N-heterocyclic amines and generally other NH acidic compounds)these may be derivatives as follows: amino/ester coupling with unsaturated fatty acid via geminal amino oxo linkage In all of these categories unsaturated fatty acid (and the derived unsaturated fatty alcohol) represents a member of a group comprising oleic acid (and oleoyl alcohol) and any fatty acid (or corresponding fatty alcohol) with two or more cis or trans double bonds. However, the fatty acids likely to be of most value in this context are the essential fatty acids shown in FIG. 1 and in particular GLA, DGLA, AA, SA, EPA and DHA. For particular purposes conjugated linoleic acid and columbinic acid may be of great interest. In all of these categories, R is either H, fully hydrocarbon in nature or containing heteroatoms (including ring substituted aromatics) corresponding with these definitions. Represents the fatty acid alkyl chain corresponding with these definitions General Discussion Of Synthesis The individual fatty acids may be purified from natural animal, vegetable or microbial sources or may be chemically synthesised by methods known to those skilled in the art or developed hereafter.

The Present Invention According to the present invention there are provided compounds containing geminal dioxo and geminal amino oxo linkages between bioactives containing free carboxyl groups and fatty alcohols and linkages between bioactives containing free carboxyl groups, free hydroxy groups and acidic NH groups and unsaturated fatty acids as discussed above in the section entitled Classes of Bioactives by Chemistry. The present invention is particularly concerned with class (a)i, geminal dioxo diesters of bioactives containing a free carboxyl group, i.e. compounds of the following structure: where R 1 is an acyl group derived from a C 16-30 fatty acid with two or more cis or trans double bonds and particularly an n-6 or n-3 series EFA or conjugated linoleic acid, or columbinic acid, or parinaric acid and R 2 is as R 1 the same or different, or any other nutrient, drug or other bioactive residue released as the active in the body and R 3 is either hydrogen, fully hydrocarbon, or containing heteroatoms, preferably an alkyl group particularly a C 1 -C 4 alkyl group. As a geminal dioxo diester, the general link is disclosed in the literature among many other geminal dioxo diesters but we have seen that its use in therapy in the form of an unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) geminal dioxo diester or as a compound with an UFA at one position and a bioactive (not being an unsaturated fatty acid) at the other, is both undisclosed and particularly significant. Indeed it offers a favourable way to give a singly fatty acid as the geminal dioxo diester. Further, apart from administering individual acids, such geminal dioxo diesters may have value in pharmaceutical formulation as emulsifiers. The UFA geminal dioxo diesters have a wide variety of possible uses. They may be used as pharmaceuticals for the treatment or prevention of diseases in which abnormalities of fatty acids have been identified. They may be added to foods or added to or used as nutritional supplements for those who require the particular fatty acid for the treatment or prevention of diseases. They may also be used in foods or pharmaceuticals for veterinary use. They may further be used for skin care. As advantages or in various particular aspects the invention provides: (i) A convenient and safe way of asministering, for therapeutic or nutritional purposes, one or two unsaturated fatty acid moieties, or one unsaturated fatty acid and one bioactive that is not a fatty acid. (ii) A derivative, of a bioactive required to cross lipid membranes in the body to exert its action whether in entry to a cell or in passing the skin, blood-brain or other barrier, through a geminal dioxo or geminal amino oxo linkage to an essential fatty acid of the natural n-6 or n-3 series and especially GLA or DGLA, AA, SA, EPA or DHA or the related fatty acids cLA or CA. (iii) A fatty acid derivative of a drug such that the drug and fatty acid are mutually efficacious. (iv) A method of improving the transport of a drug across lipid membranes in the body, characterises by the administration of the drug in a form as above. (v) A method of manufacture of a medicament for improved therapy involving transport of a drug across lipid membranes in the body, characterised by incorporating the drug in a medicament in a form as above. (vi) A method of manufacture of a medicament for delivering one or two fatty acids from the list in (ii) above or for delivering one of those fatty acids in association with another active agent. Examples of specific compounds have been given earlier herein; synthesis examples come later. Uses Generally The fatty acids have a large number of desirable biological and therapeutic activities which have been detalied in numerous publications by the inventors and by others. Four of the fatty acids, GLA, DGLA, SA and EPA share a rather broad spectrum of effects which include: 1. Cardiovascular actions including vasodilatation, lowering of blood pressure, inhibition of platelet aggregation, lowering of triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol levels, elevation of HDL-cholesterol levels and inhibition of smooth muscle proliferation. 2. Anti-inflammatory actions including reduction of formation of pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, and of eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid, reduction of neutrophil migration and the neutrophil respiratory burst, reduction of local inflammatory responses, inhibition of inflammation in various animal models such as uric acid induced inflammation and adjuvant arthritis, and treatment of various inflammatory disorders such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. 3. Immunomodulatory functions including the damping down of excessive immune and allergic responses in animal models such as experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and uveitis, bronchial and cutaneous hyper-reactivity in sensitised animals, leading to the concept that they are of value in human diseases where excessive immune responses play a role. 4. Respiratory actions including bronchodilatation and inhibition of bronchoconstrictor actions. 5. Improvements in calcium balance with increased calcium absorption, reduced calcium excretion, increased deposition of calcium in bones and reduced ectopic deposition of calcium in tissues such as arteries and kidneys. 6. Anticancer effects of three sorts, selective cytotoxic damage and induction of apoptosis in cancer cells but not in normal cells, inhibition of growth by reduction of action of growth factors and interference with second messenger systems required for growth, inhibition of metastasis by various actions including increased expression of E-cadherins and inhibition of proteolytic enzymes such as urokinases, lipoxygenase and matrix metalloproteinases, and inhibition of cancer-associated cachexia. 7. Actions on nerve cells including maintenance of normal nerve membrane structure and fuction and the normal pre- and post-synaptic actions of neurotransmitters. These desirable actions mean that this group of fatty acids can be used in the treatment of may different disorders including cardiovascular disorders of many types, inflammatory disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ulcerative colitis and Chrons disease, respiratory disorders including asthma, psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, alcoholism, attention deficit disorder, depression and Alzheimers disease, neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis and Huntingtons chorea, renal and urinary tract disorders including various types of renal inflammatory disease and urinary calcium stones, metabolic disorders including osteoporosis and ectopic calcification, and gastrointestinal ulcerative and inflammatory diseases. Although conjugated linoleic acid (cLA) has not been nearly as widely tested as, say GLA or EPA, it also seems to have a wide range of actions including effects valuable in the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. GLA, DGLA, AA and columbinic acid have desirable actions on the skin and are particularly valuable in the treatment of skin diseases such as atopic eczema, psoriasis, urticaria and allergic reactions. AA is often regarded as a potentially harmful fatty acid. However, it is an essential constituent of all normal cell membranes and has been found to be present in low levels in various illnesses including atopic eczema, schizophrenia (Horrobin et al, Schizophrenia Res. 1994; 13: 195-207) and cardiovascular disorders (Horrobin, Prostaglandins Leukotr. EFAs 1995; 53: 385-96). AA is likely to be of particular value in these situations and also other psychiatric disorders such as alcoholism and attention deficit disorder where levels are also often low. DHA shares some of the above actions of the EFAs but is found in particularly important amounts in cell membranes and especially in the membranes of the heart, the retina and the brain. DHA also has potent anti-inflammatory and desirable cardiovascular effect. DHA is likely to be of particular value in cardiovascular disorders, in retinal and visual disorders including retinitis pigmentosa, senile macular degeneration and dyslexia, and in psychiatric and neurological disorders including schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, depression, alcoholism, Alzheimers disease and other forms of dementia and multiple sclerosis. Infections have also recently been identified as likely to respond to fatty acids, especially to GLA and DGLA, EPA and DHA. Many bacteria are killed by these fatty acids, including strains which are highly resistant to antibiotics, Recent work from a number of laboratories has also shown that these highly unsaturated fatty acids are important in successful responses to diseases like malaria and to protozoal diseases. It is thus apparent that various specific fatty acids are likely to be able to add to the efficacy of drugs and other bioactive substances of almost any class, in both the treatment and prevention of disease, in skin care and in nutrition, as well as having valuable therapeutic effects when given in the form as now proposed by the present invention as a single fatty acid or as two different fatty acids in the same molecule. Of particular value in therapy is that under most circumstances the fatty acids are remarkably non-toxic and can be administered safely in large doses without the risk of important side effects.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention provides novel benzoylphenylurea insecticides and novel methods of inhibiting cockroaches, ants, fleas, and termites. A broad class of benzoylphenylurea insecticides is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,748,356. European Patent Application 263438 discloses that certain N-substituted phenyl-N-substituted benzoyl-N-methylureas are highly safe to beneficial aquatic Crustacea while exhibiting equal or superior insecticidal activities to non-alkylated analogs. Hexaflumuron, a commercially significant benzoylphenylurea, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,468,405. Use of hexaflumuron in methods of controlling termites is disclosed in WO 93/24011. Use of hexaflumuron to control cockroaches is disclosed in WO 94/03066. The compound N-3,5-dichloro-2-fluoro-4-(1,1,2,3,3,3-hexafluoropropoxy)phenyl-N-(2,6-difluorobenzoyl)urea is disclosed in DE 3827133 and European Patent Application A 243,790, but there was no disclosure of the unexpected activity of the compound against cockroaches, ants, fleas, and termites. We have discovered that certain benzoylphenylurea compounds, some of which are novel, have substantially greater activity against cockroaches, ants, fleas, and termites than would have been expected based on comparison with the closest prior art, i.e., hexaflumuron. Another significant property of the novel compounds of the invention is their surprisingly low toxicity to Daphnia. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides a method of controlling cockroaches, ants, fleas, or termites which comprises delivering a effective amount of a compound of the formula (I): wherein R 1 and R 2 are H, methyl, or ethyl, to a location where control of cockroaches, ants, fleas, or termites is desired. More specifically, the invention provides: A method of controlling cockroaches which comprises a compound of the formula (I), in an amount effective to control cockroaches, to a location where control of cockroaches is desired; A method of controlling ants which comprises delivering a compound of the formula (I), in an amount effective to control ants, to a location where control of ants is desired; A method of controlling fleas which comprises delivering a compound of the formula (I), in an amount effective to control fleas, to a location where control of fleas is desired; and A method of controlling termites which comprises delivering a compound of the formula (I), in an amount effective to control termites, to a location where control of termites is desired. The invention also provides novel compounds of the formula (II) wherein R 1 and R 2 are H, methyl, or ethyl, provided that at least one of R 1 and R 2 is methyl or ethyl.

Ant Studies Laboratory ant bait studies were carried out with Red Imported Fire Ant (RIFA) ( Solenopsis inivicta ) and Pharaoh Ant ( Monomorium pharionis ). Chitin synthesis inhibitors, such as the compounds of the invention, control ants by killing the molting larvae and/or pupae and potentially preventing the hatching of eggs. Because adult workers are not affected, control is measured by effects on the brood. The studies involved 3-4 day exposure to bait. These limited exposure studies more accurately represent real world bait availability than continuous exposure.

Formulations In order to facilitate the application of the compounds of formula (I) to the desired locus, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling, the compound is normally formulated with a carrier and/or a surface-active agent. A carrier in the present context is any material with which the compound of formula (1) (active ingredient) is formulated to facilitate application to the locus, or storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including a material which is normally gaseous but which has been compressed to form a liquid. Any of the carriers normally used or known to be usable in formulating insecticidal compositions may be used. Compositions according to the invention contain 0.0001 to 99.9% by weight active ingredient. Preferably, compositions according to the invention contain 0.001 to 10.0% by weight of active ingredient though proportions as low as 0.0001% may be useful in some circumstances. Suitable solid carriers include natural and synthetic clays and silicates, for example natural silicas such as diatomaceous earths; magnesium silicates, for example talcs; magnesium aluminium silicates, for example attapulgites and vermiculites; aluminium silicates, for example kaolinites, montmorillonites and micas; calcium carbonate; calcium sulphate; ammonium sulphate; synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminium silicates; elements, for example carbon and sulfur; natural and synthetic resins, for example coumaronne resins, polyvinyl chloride, and styrene polymers and copolymers; solid polychlorophenols; bitumen; waxes; agar; and solid fertilizers, for example superphosphates. Cellulose based materials, for example wood, sawdust, agar, paper products, cotton linter, or Methocel, as well as the other solid carriers that are themselves attractive to or at least non-repellant to termites are particularly suitable and preferable. Mixtures of different solids are often suitable. For example, a mixture of wood flour and agar formulated as a moisture containing solid would be preferable. Suitable liquid carriers include water; alcohols, for example isopropanol and glycols; ketones, for example acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, isophorone and cyclohexanone; ethers; aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene and xylene; petroleum fractions, for example kerosene and light mineral oils; chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene and trichloroethane; polar organic liquids, such as dimethyl formamide, dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and N-methylpyrrolidone; oils derived from plants, such as corn oil and peanut oil. Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable. for example a mixture of isophorone with a polar organic solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidone, as are mixtures of solid and liquid carriers. Pesticidal compositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a surface-active agent facilitates this process of dilution. Thus it is suitable to use at least one carrier in such a composition which is a surfaceactive agent. For example, the composition may contain at least two carriers, at least one of which is a surface-active agent. A surface-active agent may be an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent; it may be nonionic or ionic. Examples of suitable surface-active agents include the sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sufonic acids; the condensation of fatty acids or aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide; fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitol, sucrose or pentaerytlritol; condensates of these with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide; condensates of these with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide; condensation products of fatty alcohol or alkyl phenols, for example p-octylphenol or p-octylcresol, with ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide sulfates or sulfonates of these condensation products; alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably sodium salts, or sulfuric or sulfonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulfates, sodium salts of sulfinated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sulfonates such as dodecylbenzene sulfonate; and polymers of ethylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. Pesticidal compositions may for example be formulated as wettable powders, dusts, granules, baits, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspension concentrates and aerosols. Wettable powders usually contain 25, 50 or 75% weight of active ingredient and usually contain in addition to solid inert carrier, 3-10% weight of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 0-10% weight of stabilizer(s) and/or other additives such as penetrants or stickers. Dusts are usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar composition to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and are diluted in the field with further solid cairier to give a composition usually containing 0.5-10% weight of active ingredient. Granules are usually prepared to have a size between 10 and 100 BS mesh (1.676-0.152 mm), and may be manufactured by, for example, agglomeration or impregnation techniques. Generally, granules will contain 0.01-75% weight active ingredient and 0-10% weight of additives such as stabilizers, surfactants, slow release modifiers and binding agents. The so-called dry flowable powders consist of relatively small granules having a relatively high concentration of active ingredient. Of particular interest in current practice are the water dispersible granular formulations. These are in the form of dry, hard granules that are essentially dust-free, and are resistant to attrition on handling, thus minimizing the formation of dust. On contact with water, the granules readily disintegrate to form stable suspensions of the particles of active material. Such formulation contain 90% or more by weight of finely divided active material, 3-7% by weight of a blend of surfactants, which act as wetting dispersing, suspending and binding agents, and 1-3% by weight of a finely divided carrier, which acts as a resuspending agent. Baits are prepared by, for example, combining a mixture of a suitable food source, such as sawdust for termites or grain or meal for cockroaches, with an amount of active ingredient sufficient to provide the desired result; for example, from about 0.001 % to about 20% weight active ingredient and forming the mixture into a paste by the addition of about 1% to 5% of a water based binder such as agar. The paste-like mixture may be applied as is or may be packed into a housing such as a hollowed out wooden dowel or a plastic tube or bait station. In other embodiments, sheets of paper or cardboard can be sprayed with or dipped in a diluted formulation containing the active ingredient. Baits are a preferable embodiment of the present invention. Emulsifiable concentrates usually contain, in addition to a solvent and, when necessary, co-solvent, 10-50% weight per volume active ingredient, 2-20% weight per volume emulsifiers and 0-20% weight per volume of other additives such as stabilizers, penetrants and corrosion inhibitors. Suspension concentrates are usually compounded so as to obtain a stable, non-sedimenting flowable product and usually contain 10-75% weight active ingredient, 0.5-15% weight of dispersing agents, 0.1-10% weight of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, 0-10% weight of other additives such as defoamers, corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble; certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be present dissolved in the formulation to assist in preventing sedimentation or as anti-freeze agents for water. Aqueous dispersions and emulsions are compositions which may be obtained by diluting a wettable powder or a concentrate with water. The said emulsions may be of the water-in-oil or of the oil-in-water type, and may have a thick mayonnaise-like consistency. The method of applying a compound of Formula (I) to combat termites comprises applying the compound, conveniently in a composition comprising the compound of Formula (I) and a carrier as described above, to a locus or area to be treated for the termites, such as soil or timber, already subject to infestation or attack by termites or intended to be protected from infestation by termites. The active ingredient is, of course, applied in an amount sufficient to effect the desired action of combatting termite infestation. This dosage is dependent upon many factors, including the carrier employed, the method and conditions of the application, whether the formulation is present at the locus in the form of a film, or as discrete particles or as a bait, the thickness of film or size of particles, the degree of termite infestation, and the like. Proper consideration and resolution of these factors to provide the necessary dosage of the active ingredient at the locus to be protected are within the skill of those versed in the art. In general, however, the effective dosage of the compound of the invention at the locus to be protectedi.e., the dosage to which the termite has accessis of the order of 0.001 to 1.0% based on the total weight of the composition, though under some circumstances the effective concentration may be as little as 0.0001% or as much as 2%, on the same basis. When used to control cockroaches, it is preferred to use the active ingredient in a treated bait or as a surface treatment. When used to control ants, it is preferred to use the active ingredient in a liquid bait or granular bait. When used to control termites, it is preferred to use the active ingredient in a cellulose based bait. When used to control fleas, it is preferred to use the active ingredient on a treated substrate. Suitable formulations include granular, paste, or dust cockroach bait, SP or WP cockroach and/or flea sprayables, cellulose-based termite baits, liquid or granular ant baits, feed-through or topical animal treatment for fleas. We claim: 1. A method of controlling ants which comprises delivering a compound of the formula (I) wherein R 1 and R 2 are H, methyl, or ethyl, provided that at least one of R 1 and R 2 is methyl or ethyl, in an amount effective to control ants, to a location where control of ants is desired. 2. An ant bait comprising a compound of the formula wherein R 1 and R 2 are independently selected from the group consisting of H, methyl, or ethyl, provided that at least one of R 1 and R 2 is methyl or ethyl. 3.

divalent metallic compound in an amount more than 30 ppm and not more than 2300 ppm in terms of a divalent metal based on the organophosphorous compound. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an organophosphorous composition comprising, as a principal component, an organophosphorous compound represented by the general formula (1): wherein R 1 and R 2 represent an organic group or a halogen atom, and m and n represent an integer of 0 to 4, provided that R 1 and R 2 may be the same or different when m or n is an integer of 2 to 4, and a predetermined amount of a divalent metallic compound. The present invention also relates to a method of producing the organophosphorous composition represented by the general formula (1). The present invention relates to an organophosphorous composition comprising an organophosphorous compound represented by the general formula (4): wherein R 1 , R 2 , m and n are as defined above and A represents an organic group which is the same as or different from that of R 1 and R 2 , which is derived from the organophosphorous compound represented by the general formula (1) in the organophosphorous composition, and a predetermined amount of a divalent metallic compound. The present invention also relates to a polyester composition comprising polyester having a predetermined amount of a phosphorous atom related to an organophosphorous compound wherein an organic group (A) in the general formula (4) is an ester-forming functional group (B), and a predetermined amount of a divalent metallic compound, and a method of producing the same. The organophosphorous composition comprising the organophosphorous compound represented by the general formula (1) or (4) is used for various purposes, for example, raw materials for polymer compounds, lubricating oils, antioxidants for organic compounds, flame retarders, plasticizers, bactericides, color protection agents, polymerization initiators and the like. Particularly, those wherein an organic group (A) in the general formula (4) is an ester-forming functional group (B) are useful as a copolymer component of the polyester, and are capable of producing a flame-retardant polyester. 2. Description of the Related Art Organophosphorous compounds (also referred to as DOP, hereinafter) such as 6-oxo-(6H)-dibenzo-(c,e)(1,2)-oxaphosphorine, which are presented by the general formula (1), have hitherto been disclosed in production methods described in Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. Sho 49-45397 and Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. Sho 50-17979, and recent publications such as Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. Hei 10-1490, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. Hei 7-145185, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. Hei 8-99983 and Published Japanese Translation No. Hei 10-510545 of the PCT Application. DOP has been produced by reacting an orthophenylphenol compound (also referred to as OPP, hereinafter) represented by the general formula (2): wherein R 1 , R 2 , m and n are as defined above, with a phosphorous compound such as phosphorous trihalide (PX 3 : X represents a halogen atom), condensing the reaction product with heating in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts catalyst containing zinc chloride to produce a compound represented by the general formula (3): wherein R 1 , R 2 , m and n are as defined above and X represents a halogen atom, and hydrolyzing the compound (also referred to as DOP-X, hereinafter) with water under heating. In such a method, however, a zinc compound such as zinc chloride as the Friedel-Crafts catalyst used in the production of DOP-X is remained in the resulting DOP. Since the divalent metallic compound such as zinc compound forms a complex with DOP thus forming an insoluble matter during the reaction between DOP and the other organic compound, DOP containing a small amount of the divalent metal is required. In case a compound derived from DOP, as a flame retarder component, is used in a copolymer component of the polyester, an antimony compound such as antimony trioxide used as a polymerization catalyst of the polyester is reduced by DOP, thereby causing a problem that the resulting polyester is blackish. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a composition containing DOP, which does not form a complex during the reaction between DOP and an organic compound and can satisfactorily maintain a color tone of the resulting polyester even in case of using a compound derived from DOP in a copolymer component of a polyester. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method which can produce DOP whose zinc content is reduced to the degree where a complex is not formed during the reaction with an organic compound, and to provide a method which can produce DOP capable of satisfactorily maintaining a color tone of the resulting polyester even in case of using a DOP-derived compound in a copolymer component of a polyester. A still another object of the present invention is to provide the DOP derivative composition described above, and to provide a polyester having a good color tone and a method of producing the same using the DOP derivative composition.

The method of producing the polyester composition of claim 19 , wherein an antimony compound is used as a condensation catalyst of the polyester. As a result of obtaining such a new knowledge that the reduction of an antimony compound is suppressed in case a divalent metal compound is present in a DOP derivative compound used in a copolymer component of a polyester. The divalent metal compound is incorporated in the amount to the degree where a complex is not formed in DOP based on the knowledge according to the present invention. Controlling the amount of the divalent metal compound based on DOP can attained the objects described above. By incorporating the divalent metal in the amount, which exceeds 30 ppm, based on DOP, the color tone of the polyester using the DOP-derived compound is maintained satisfactorily. From such a point of view, the amount of the divalent metal based on DOP is preferably controlled to 50 ppm or more. It is presumed the suppression of the reduction of the antimony compound is the result of the prior reduction of the divalent metal compound to the antimony compound. On the other hand, when the amount of the divalent metal based on DOP increases, a complex is liable to be formed during the reaction with an organic compound, thereby forming an insoluble matter. In case the polyester is spun, the operation properties tend to be lowered due to an increase in back pressure. Therefore, the amount of the divalent metal is preferably controlled to 500 ppm or less, more preferably 300 ppm or less, and most preferably 200 ppm or less, based on DOP. A control of the content of the divalent metal within the predetermined range is easier than purification by complete removal of a catalyst residue after the synthesis of DOP, and is useful to simplify the purification step after the synthesis of DOP. As the divalent metal, for example, various metals are used. To attain the objects described above, zinc is preferably used as a catalyst for producing DOP and is also preferable in view of the preparation of the above organophosphorous composition. Usually, a halogen compound produced during the production is remained in the organophosphorous composition containing DOP as a principal component; the content of the halogen compound is preferably controlled to 250 ppm or less in terms of an amount of a halogen atom based on DOP. The smaller the amount of the halogen atom based on DOP, the better. The amount of the halogen atom is preferably controlled to 150 ppm or less. By reducing the amount of the halogen content, the formation of the reaction impurity (for example, dimerization of a diol component such as ethylene glycol into diethylene glycol) during the production of a polyester using a DOP-derived compound, thereby making it possible to prevent a decrease in melting point of the polyester and to improve the heat resistance. Those, which are obtained by substantially removing an organic compound other than DOP, e.g. OPP as a raw material of DOP, from the organophosphorous composition containing DOP as the principal component, are superior in whiteness, and do not require a melt-purification step such as vacuum distillation, thus making it possible to simplify the purification step. Such an organophosphorous composition is usually in the form of powder, and the powdered substance is easy to handle and is superior in solubility in an organic solvent and productivity. The sentence does not substantially contain an organic compound other than DOP refers to the case where the purity of DOP in the organophosphorous composition is high to the degree where the organophosphorous composition is in the form of powder, for example, the case where the content of the organic compound other than DOP in the organophosphorous composition is 10000 ppm or less. In the method of producing DOP of the present invention, by using DOP-X and water in an equimolar ratio in the hydrolysis step, the formation of a waste liquor containing a hydrogen halide gas (e.g. hydrochloric acid waste liquor, etc.) is suppressed and, moreover, the hydrogen halide gas can be quantitatively separated and the content of a halogen compound in DOP can be reduced. By providing, as a purification step (b) for improving the purity of the resulting DOP, a step of cyclodehydration after furthers hydrolyzing DOP, the catalyst residue, halogen compound and impurity contained in OPP can be efficiently removed. In the production of DOP-X, by subjecting to a step (c) of remarkably purifying by washing crude OPP as a raw material in an organic solvent, the content of an organic compound other than the desired compound in DOP-X and DOP can be reduced and the purity of DOP-X and DOP can be improved by a simple operation. By subjecting to the step of hydrolyzing to DOP-X after subjected to the purification step (a), not only the removal of the catalyst residue, halogen compound and impurity contained in OPP, but also the control of the content of a zinc compound in DOP can be effectively conducted. According to such a production method of the present invention, the content of the catalyst residue, halogen compound, and organic compound other than the desired compound contained in OPP can be reduced. It is preferable to control the content of the zinc compound and that of the halogen compound based on DOP so that they are the same as those in the DOP composition. Preferred are powdered products wherein the organic compound other than DOP, such as OPP as a raw material, was substantially removed. The organophosphorous composition comprising the organophosphorous compound represented by the general formula (4) derived from the organophosphorous compound in the organophosphorous composition containing DOP as a principal component, and a predetermined amount of the divalent metal compound, is a DOP derivative incorporated with an organic group (A) appropriately according to various purposes of DOP, and also contains a predetermined amount of the divalent metal compound similar to the organophosphorous composition containing DOP as the principal component. Typical examples of the organic group (A) include an organic group containing an ester-forming functional group (B), and the DOP derivative having an organic group represented by the general formula (5) is used as the copolymer component of the polyester, thereby imparting the flame retardancy to the polyester. The polyester composition, which contains the organophosphorous compound represented by the general formula (5) as the ester-forming component and the divalent metal compound in an amount not less than 1 ppm and not more than 150 ppm in terms of an amount of a divalent metal, exhibits good heat resistance and flame retardancy. Those, which contain the divalent metal compound in an amount not less than 1 ppm and not more than 150 ppm in terms of an amount of a divalent metal based on the polyester, have an improved color tone of the polyester and exhibits good stability. In case the amount of the divalent metal is less than 1 ppm based on the polyester, when using an antimony compound as a polymerization catalyst of the polyester, the reduction of the antimony compound can be not sufficiently suppressed and the color tone of the polyester is not sufficiently improved. On the other hand, when the amount of the divalent metal exceeds 150 ppm, the thermal stability of the polyester is lowered and, moreover, the divalent metal forms a complex with a dye during the dyeing of the polyester, thereby causing a discoloration referred to as chameleon discoloration, which is not preferable. Therefore, the amount of the divalent metal is preferably controlled to 50 ppm or less, and more preferably 30 ppm or less. As the divalent meal, zinc is preferable because it is superior in improvement in color tone of the polyester. It is preferable in view of the heat resistance and flame retardancy that the polyester composition contains the organophosphorous compound represented by the general formula (5) as the ester-forming component of the polyester in an amount not less than 500 ppm and not more than 500000 ppm in terms of a content of a phosphorous atom. The larger the content of the phosphorous atom, the better the flame retardancy. Therefore, the content of the phosphorous atom is preferably controlled to 2000 ppm or more, and more preferably 3000 ppm or more. On the other hand, when the content of the phosphorous atom increases, lowering of the physical properties of the polyester and lowering of the operation properties in the production of the polyester tend to occur, the content of the phosphorous atom is preferably controlled to 15000 ppm or less, and more preferably 6500 ppm or less. The polyester composition of the present invention can be produced by various methods, it is preferable to use, as a dicarboxylic acid component and/or a diol component, a compound represented by the general formula (5) (wherein the organic group (A) of the compound (DOP derivative compound) represented by the general formula (4) is an ester-forming functional group (B)) containing a predetermined amount of the divalent metal in the method of producing a polyester from an ester-forming component containing the dicarboxylic acid component and diol component. When using an antimony compound as the polymerization catalyst of the polyester, the reduction of the antimony compound is suppressed by a predetermined amount of the divalent metal compound in the organophosphorous composition, which is preferable. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The method of preparing the organophosphorous composition comprising an organophosphorous compound (DOP) represented by the general formula (1): wherein R 1 and R 2 represent an organic group or a halogen atom, and m and n represent an integer of 0 to 4, provided that R 1 and R 2 may be the same or different when m or n is an integer of 2 to 4, and a predetermined amount of a divalent metallic compound according to the present invention is not specifically limited as far as the divalent metal compound is contained in the organophosphorous composition in the predetermined amount based on DOP. The organophosphorous composition may be those containing a predetermined amount of the divalent metal compound as impurity of DOP as a result of the production of DOP, or may be prepared by separately incorporating the divalent metal compound into DOP so that the amount of the divalent metal compound is a predetermined amount. Examples of the divalent metal compound include zinc compound, manganese compound, magnesium compound, calcium compound, barium compound, copper compound, iron compound, cobalt compound and the like. Examples of the organic group as for R 1 and R 2 in the general formula (1) include hydrocarbon group (e.g.,straight-chain or branched alkyl group having about 1 to 4 carbon atoms; aryl group such as phenyl group; aralkyl group such as benzyl group; cycloalkyl group); alkoxy group,aryl group and aralkyl group corresponding to the hydrocarbon group ; and carboxyl group or ester group thereof. Examples of the halogen atom include chlorine atom, bromine atom and the like. DOP is prepared in the following manner, for example, an orthophenylphenol compound (OPP) represented by the general formula (2): wherein R 1 , R 2 , n and m are as defined above, is reacted with phosphorous trihalide (PX 3 : X represents a halogen atom such as chlorine atom, bromine atom or the like) and the reaction product is condensed with heating in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts catalyst to produce a compound (DOP-X) represented by the general formula (5): wherein R 1 , R 2 , n and m are as defined above and X represents a halogen atom. A molar ratio of OPP to phosphorous trihalide (OPP:phosphorous trihalide) is usually from about 1:1 to 1:2, and preferably from about 1:1.1 to 1:1.5. Examples of the phosphorous trihalide include phosphorous trichloride, phosphorous tribromide and the like. Usually, phosphorous trichloride is used as the phosphorous trihalide. Since almost of the halogen compound remained in the organophosphorous composition of the present invention is derived from the phosphorous trihalide, the content of the halogen compound when using phosphorous trichloride as the phosphorous trihalide is the same as that of a chlorine compound. As the Friedel-Crafts catalyst, zinc chloride is preferably used. There can be employed, for example, metal halide (e.g. cuprous chloride, cupuric chloride, tin chloride, mercury chloride, iron chloride, etc.), metallic zinc, metallic aluminum, metallic copper, or oxide of these metals, which can be converted into a halide in the reaction system, in addition to zinc chloride. The catalyst is used so that the organophosphorous composition of the present invention contains at least a predetermined amount of the divalent metal compound, usually is used in an amount within the range from about 0.05 to 3 parts by weight, and preferably from about 0.1 to 1 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of OPP. The reaction temperature is usually within the range from about 30 to 250 C., and preferably from about 50 to 230 C. The reaction time varies depending on the reaction conditions such as reaction temperature, amount of the catalyst and the like, usually is within the range from about 3 to 35 hours, and preferably from about 5 to 15 hours. The completion of the reaction is judged by a point of time where the evolution of a hydrogen halide gas caused with the progress of the reaction is terminated. Then, hydrolyzing DOP-X with water under heating produce DOP. The reaction temperature of the hydrolysis is within the range from about 50 to 250 C., while the reaction time is within the range from about 1 to 10 hours. The amount of water is not specifically limited as far as it is an equimolar amount or more relative to the amount of DOP-X. In case DOP-X and water react in an equimolar ratio,a waste liquor containing a hydrogen halide gas (e.g. hydrochloric acid waste liquor, etc.) is not produced and the hydrogen halide gas can be quantitatively separated, which is preferable. According to the method of reacting DOP-X and water in an equimolar ratio, DOP-X and water react in a molar ratio of 1:1 and the reaction is conducted while removing the hydrogen halide gas produced during the reaction according to the production rate of the hydrogen halide gas. The completion of the reaction is judged by a point of time where the evolution of a hydrogen halide gas caused with the progress of the reaction is terminated. When using excess amount of water in the hydrolysis, DOP is further hydrolyzed and, therefore, the hydrolyzate of DOP is converted into DOP by cyclodehydration with heating after isolating the hydrolyzate of DOP. The cyclodehydration with heating is usually conducted at about 110-180 C. under reduced pressure within the range from about 10 to 15 kPa. The hydrolysis can also be conducted in the presence of an organic solvent. Examples of the organic solvent include aromatic solvents such as toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene and the like. The amount of the organic solvent is 1000 parts by weight or less, and preferably 500 parts by weight or less, based in 100 parts by weight of OPP as the raw material. DOP is usually produced in such way. The organophosphorous composition of the present invention is prepared so that a predetermined amount of the divalent metal compound is contained in the resulting DOP in the production process of DOP and that the content of the halogen compound and that of the organic compound other than DOP are reduced. The organophosphorous composition may take any form of bulk, flock, flake and powder, preferably is in the form of powder. The organophosphorous composition can be formed into powders by using various means such as pulverization. The powdered organophosphorous composition can be obtained by removing impurities in the organophosphorous composition using the following method. In the method of producing DOP, the organophosphorous composition of the present invention can be prepared by a method (a) of purifying DOP-X after its production and a method (b) of purifying DOP-X after its hydrolysis. In the method (a) of purifying DOP-X after its production, the catalyst residue and halogen compound can be removed and the content of the divalent metal compound in the resulting purifying DOP-X after its production can be controlled. Impurities contained in OPP can also be removed. Specific examples of the method (a) include a method (a1) of washing with an organic solvent, a method (a2) of vacuum distillation and a method (a3) of recrystallization. Examples of the organic solvent in the method (a1) include aromatic solvents such as toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene and the like. Among these organic solvents, toluene is preferable because it sufficiently dissolves impurities in OPP. The amount of the organic solvent is 0.05% by weight or more based on DOP-X and DOP-X can be washed with a small amount of the organic solvent. The upper limit of the amount of the organic solvent is not defined, preferably is 50% by weight or less based on DOP-X. The washing/purification of DOP-X is conducted by adding a predetermined amount of the organic solvent, dissolving DOP-X with stirring and removing the supernatant. The method (a2) of vacuum distillation is conducted at about 220-250 C. under reduced pressure of about 133 Pa. The method (a3) of recrystallization is conducted by recrystallizing from alcohol. Among these purification methods (a), the method (a1) is preferable because of its simple operation. In the method (b) of purifying DOP after its hydrolysis, the purity of DOP is enhanced by removing the catalyst residue, halogen compound and impurities contained in OPP. DOP thus obtained is superior in whiteness because of high purity, and is in the form of fine powder. In the purification method (b), when using an excess amount of water in the hydrolysis of DOP-X, the hydrolyzate of DOP is isolated and then the hydrolyzate of DOP is subjected to the purification (b1) in order to conduct cyclodehydration with heating. The hydrolyzate of the purified DOP is converted into a white crystal. The purification (b1) of the hydrolyzate of DOP is appropriately conducted in the presence or absence of the organic solvent on hydrolysis. In case (b1-1) the organic solvent is absent on hydrolysis, the hydrolyzate of DOP is purified by the method of distilling the hydrolyzate of DOP, the method of recrystallization, or the method of adding an alkaline metal hydroxide, followed by heating, decoloring and deposition with acid. In the method of distillation and method of recrystallization, the same method as that of the purification methods (a) can be employed. Examples of the alkaline metal hydroxide include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide and the like. In the decoloring treatment, activated carbon, activated china clay or the like is used. In the deposition with acid, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid or the like is used. In case (b1-2) the organic solvent is present on hydrolysis, the purification is conducted by separating the aqueous layer, optionally washing the oil layer with water several times while heating under pressure, removing residual water from the oil layer and subjecting to a decoloring treatment. If necessary, the hydrolyzate of DOP is purified by washing with water, washing with the organic solvent and filtration. In the decoloring treatment, the same method as described above can be employed. In case the hdyrolysis reaction is conducted by using water in an equimolar amount relative to the amount of DOP-X, DOP is obtained as the reaction product. Therefore, the resulting DOP is subjected to the purification (b2) after the completion of the reaction. The purification (b2) of DOP can be conducted by the method of adding the organic solvent to DOP, followed by cooling, filtration of the product and washing with the organic solvent, the method of distillation or the method of recrystallization (b2-1). DOP obtained by the hydrolysis reaction using water in an equimolar amount relative to the amount of DOP-X can be subjected to the purification (b2-1) of DOP. Alternatively, the resulting DOP can also be subjected to the same purification (b2-2) by adding hot water and hydrolyzing DOP thereby converting into a hydrolyzate (b1: any of b1-1 and b1-2). In this case, the hydrolyzate of DOP is subjected to cyclodehydration after the purification (b2-2). The purification (b2) of DOP can also be conducted after the purification (b1) of DOP. Among these purification methods (b), the method of further hydrolyzing the resulting DOP and purifying the hydrolyzate of DOP, followed by cyclodehydration is preferable (b2-2). The same operation as that of (b1-1) is preferable as the purification means in (b2-2). When the hydrolysis reaction is conducted by using water in an equimolar amount relative to the amount of DOP-X, a hydrochloric acid waste liquor is not produced and DOP can be efficiently purified by the hydrolysis, thereby making it possible to enhance the purity of DOP. The content of the organic compound other than DOP can be reduced by the method (c) of using high-purity OPP as the raw material, in addition to the method described above. The high-purity OPP is usually prepared by washing OPP having a purity of 80% or higher with an organic solvent. Examples of the organic solvent include aromatic solvents such as toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene and the like. Among these organic solvents, toluene is preferable because it sufficiently dissolves impurities in OPP. The amount of the organic solvent is 0.05% by weight or more based on OPP and OPP can be washed with a small amount of the organic solvent. The upper limit of the amount of the organic solvent is not defined, preferably is 50% by weight or less based on OPP. The washing/purification of OPP is conducted by adding a predetermined amount of the organic solvent, dissolving OPP with stirring and removing the supernatant. The method of synthesizing OPP is described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. Sho 50-18444, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. Sho 55-33417, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. Sho 56-20533, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. Sho 62-4442 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. Hei 5-201904. According to these methods, however, dibenzofuran, o-cyclohexenylcyclohexane, 2-cyclohexylphenol or the like as a starting material of OPP is remained as impurity in the resulting OPP. The organophosphorous composition comprising DOP as a main component according to the present invention can be prepared by the production methods described above, and can also be prepared by separately incorporating a divalent metal compound in DOP. Specific examples of the divalent metal compound to be separately incorporated include acetates such as zinc acetate, manganese acetate, magnesium acetate, calcium acetate, barium acetate, copper acetate, iron acetate and cobalt acetate; chlorides; and hydroxides. DOP in the organophosphorous composition comprising a predetermined amount of the divalent metal compound thus obtained according to the present invention is derived into an organophosphorous compound represented by the general formula (4): wherein R 1 and R 2 represent an organic group or a halogen atom, m and n represent an integer of 0 to 4, provided that R 1 and R 2 may be the same or different when m or n is an integer of 2 to 4, and A represents an organic group which is the same as or different from that of R 1 and R 2 . The organophosphorous compound represented by the general formula (4) also contains a predetermined amount of the divalent metal compound. The derivation of DOP into the organophosphorous compound represented by the general formula (4) can be conducted, for example, by the method of the Michael addition reaction of DOP to an ,-unsaturated carboxylic acid compound, the method of adding to an aldehyde compound, a carbonyl compound or the like, the method of adding to an oxirane compound, the method of reacting with an aromatic compound such as phenol compound capable of reacting with DOP in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts catalyst, or the method of reacting with a compound having a hydroxyl group capable of conducting dehydration condensation with DOP. In the general formula (4), the organic group (A) is not specifically limited and the organic group (A) is not limited to those, which are directly introduced into the derivative. In case the organic group (A) has a functional group, it includes those obtained by reacting the functional group with an organic compound on or after the introduction of the organic group (A) having a functional group into DOP. Examples of the organic group (A) include various groups. An organophosphorous compound having an organic group containing an ester-forming functional group (B) such as hydroxyl group, carboxyl grouop, carboxylate group or the like, which is represented by the general formula (5), is used as a polyester-forming component, thereby imparting the heat resistance and flame retardancy to the polyester. Specific examples of the organophosphorous compound having an ester-forming functional group (B), which is represented by the general formula (5), include those represented by the following chemical formulas (a) to (z) and (z1) to (z4). The polyester composition comprising a predetermined amount of the organophosphorous compound represented by the general formula (5) as an ester-forming component of the polyester, and a divalent metal compound in a predetermined amount based on the polyester according to the present invention can be produced in the method of producing a polyester from an ester-forming component comprising a dicarboxylic acid component and a diol component by using the organophosphorous composition comprising the organophosphorous compound represented by the general formula (5) as the ester-forming component of the polyester, and a predetermined amount of a divalent metal compound according to the present invention. The amount of organophosphorous compound represented by the general formula (5) is preferably not less than 500 ppm and not more than 50000 ppm in terms of the content of a phosphorous atom in the polyester. Such a polyester is described, for example, in Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. Sho 55-41610. Examples of the dicarboxylic acid component include aromatic dicarboxylic acids such as terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 1,5-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, 4,4-diphenyldicarboxylic acid, bis(4-carboxyphenyl)ether, bis(4-carboxyphenyl)sulfone, 1,2-bis(4-carboxyphenoxy)ethane, 5-sodium sulfoisophthalic acid, 2,5-dibromoterephtalic acid and tetrabromoterephthalic acid; aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as adipic acid, azelaic acid and sebacic acid; and alicyclic dicarboxylic acids such as hexahydroterephthalic acid and lower alcohol ester thereof. Examples of the diol component include ethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol, trimethylene glycol, tetramethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, 1,4-cyclohexanediol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, polyethylene glycol, bisphenol A, bisphenol S and the like. As the polymerization method and polymerization catalyst, there can be used those, which have conventionally been used in the prodcution of the polyester, without any limitation. Various additives such as stabilizers and matting agents are optionally added. In the production of the polyester, the organophosphorous composition comprising the organophosphorous compound having an organic group as an ester-forming functional group, which is represented by the general formula (5), and a predetermined amount of a divalent metal compound according to the present invention can be applied in case of employing any of the ester interchange method and direct esterification method. In case of using any method, an antimony compound as a polymerization catalyst is added in the polymerization reaction. The reduction of the antimony catalyst is suppressed by a predetermined amount of the divalent metal compound in the organophosphorous composition. Examples of the antimony catalyst include antimony compounds such as antimony trioxide, antimony pentaoxide, antimony glycolate, antimony glycollate, antimony acetate, antimony phenolate and the like. In the production of the polyester composition of the present invention, an organophosphorous composition containing an organophosphorous compound represented by the general formula (5) and a predetermined amount of a divalent metallic compound can be used, as described above. The polyester composition of the present invention can also be produced by adding a divalent metallic compound before or after the esterification or ester interchange, or before polymerization, in the production of a polyester using the organophosphorous compound represented by the general formula (5). EXAMPLES The Examples of the present invention will now be described, but the present invention is not limited to the following Examples. In the Examples, parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise stated.

Further, the novel polymorphic crystals (A) to (C) according to the present invention are characterized by the powder X-ray diffraction pattern and/or IR absorption peaks of donepezil represented by the following formula: This application is the national phase under 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT International Application No. PCT/JP98/05405 which has an International filing date of Dec. 1, 1998, which designated the United States of America. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel polymorphic crystals (A) to (C) of donepezil (1-benzyl-4-(5,6-dimethoxy-1-indanone)-2-ylmethylpiperidine, free compound) as a precursor for production of donepezil hydrochloride (chemical name: 1-benzyl-4-(5,6-dimethoxy-1-indanone)-2-ylmethylpiperidine hydrochloride) having an excellent action as a medicament disclosed in Example 4 of JP-A 64-79151 (EP-A 296560, U.S. Pat. No. 4,895,841), specifically as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent for senile dementia, and in particular as a prophylactic and therapeutic agent for Alzheimers disease, and an industrial process for producing the same. Hereinafter, polymorphic crystals (A) to (C) are referred to as types (A) to (C), respectively. PRIOR ART Donepezil hydrochloride is a therapeutic agent having an inhibitory action on acetylcholinesterase for treating a variety of senile dementia, is particularly useful as a prophylactic, therapeutic and ameliorating agent for Alzheimer-type senile dementia and is on the market or under development in all the countries of the world. Donepezil hydrochloride is produced by first producing donepezil which is a free compound and then converting it into a hydrochloride. On the one hand, donepezil is, in itself, an excellent medicament but is also used as a precursor for production of donepezil hydrochloride. Accordingly, donepezil preferably has such physical properties as to allow it to occur in the form of crystals not being sticky but being dry in order to achieve excellent filtering properties after crystallization and to facilitate recovery of its filter cake by scraping. However, crystals of donepezil excellent in handling properties is not known so far. Further, the presence of polymorphic crystals of donepezil is not known. In a method described in Example 4 of JP-A 64-79151, a crude donepezil product was purified by column chromatography, and residues obtained by concentrating desired fractions were immediately converted into a hydrochloride. Accordingly, donepezil has not been obtained as crystals. However, it goes without saying that donepezil in the form crystals not being sticky but being dry is preferable because of excellent filtering properties, easy scraping and handling. Further, in the prior art, the desired compound is purified by column chromatography (methylene chloride system), but purification by column chromatography requires a large amount of solvent and the column is discarded after use, and is thus very disadvantageous in production cost. In addition, the used solvent is evaporated in a large amount into the atmosphere, and therefore, the column chromatography is preferably not used if possible from the viewpoint of working environment or environmental protection. Further, because donepezil according to the present invention is a raw material of a medicament, the solvent remaining therein should be as low as possible and simultaneously be an uninfluential solvent in order to prevent its unpleasant effect on the human body. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present inventors extensively studied to improve the problems described above. As a result, they found that the novel polymorphic crystals (A) to (C) of donepezil described below are very dry, can be purified without using column chromatography and have a very low content of residual solvent, and therefore these crystals are a very preferable raw material as a medicament, thus completing the present invention. That is, the present invention provides three kinds of novel polymorphic crystals (A) to (C) of donepezil which are capable of purification without using column chromatography, are dry and thus excellent in handling properties, and have an extremely low content of residual solvent, and an industrial process for producing the same. The present invention specifically relates to the novel polymorphic crystals (A) to (C) of donepezil represented by the following formula: which are characterized by a powder X-ray diffraction pattern and/or IR absorption peaks in potassium bromide.

Novel crystals (A) to (C) of donepezil according to the present invention also give different results in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under the following conditions and have crystal forms completely different from each other (see FIGS. 4 to 6 ). Measurement Method and Conditions for Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) About 3 to 6 mg sample was weighed. The amount of the sample was 2.0820 mg for type A, 5.660 mg for type B and 4.540 mg for type C, respectively. Thermal analysis was conducted under the following conditions: Reference: empty Scan speed: 10 C./min. Sampling: 1.0 sec. Upper limit: 130 C. Lower limit: Room temperature Thermocouple: PL Hereinafter, a process for producing these novel crystals of donepezil is specifically described. Donepezil in the present invention refers to a free compound of donepezil hydrochloride described in Example 4 of JP-A 64-79151, that is, 1-benzyl-4-(5,6-dimethoxy-1-indanone)-2-ylmethylpiperidine. The novel crystals (A) to (C) of donepezil according to the present invention can be obtained by the conventional crystallization procedures, but to achieve any of the crystals certainly, seed crystals in a desired crystal form are preferably added for crystallization. Here, the seed crystals mean a very small amount of crystals of known crystal form. (1) Type A Crystals 1-1) A solution of donepezil/methanol-denatured ethanol is crystallized at 10 C. or less within 20 hours (see Example 1). 1-2) Seed crystals of type A are added to a donepezil solution which is then crystallized at 20 C. or less within 1 hour (see Example 2). 1-3) Donepezil is dissolved in methanol-denatured ethanol, and then seed crystals of type A are added to crystallize under cooling (see Example 17). (2) Type B Crystals 2-1) A solution of donepezil/THF is concentrated (see Example 3). 2-2) A solution of donepezil/methanol-denatured ethanol is crystallized at 10 C. or less for 20 hours or more (see Example 4). 2-3) Seed crystals of type B are added to a donepezil solution which is then cooled at 15 C. or less and crystallized at 20 to 30 C. within 2 hours (see Example 5). 2-4) Seed crystals of type B are added to a donepezil solution which is then crystallized at 15 C. or less within 1 hour (see Example 6). 2-5) Donepezil is dissolved in methanol-denatured ethanol, and then seed crystals of type B are added to crystallize under cooling (see Example 18). (3) Type C Crystals 3-1) A solution of donepezil/methanol-denatured ethanol is cooled to 10 C. or less, and after crystal precipitation, it is heated to 20 C. or more and then cooled to 10 C. or less to crystallize (see Example 7). 3-2) A solution of donepezil/methanol-denatured ethanol is cooled, and after crystal precipitation, it is crystallized at 15 to 25 C. (see Example 8). 3-3) Donepezil/methanol-denatured ethanol is gradually cooled (see Example 9). 3-4) Seed crystals of type C are added to a donepezil solution and the resulting mixture is cooled to 15 C. or less, then crystallized at 25 to 35 C. for 2 hours or more, and further crystallized at 15 C. or less (see Examples 10 to 13). 3-5) Donepezil and seed crystals of type C are suspended in a solvent at 20 to 40 C. (see Examples 14 to 16). 3-6) Donepezil is dissolved in methanol-denatured ethanol, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize in a warm water bath (see Example 19). 3-7) Donepezil is dissolved in methanol, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize in a warm water bath (see Example 20). 3-8) Donepezil is dissolved in ethanol, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize in a warm water bath (see Example 21). 3-9) Donepezil is dissolved in isopropanol, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize in a warm water bath (see Example 22). 3-10) Donepezil is dissolved in acetone, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize at room temperature (see Example 23). 3-11) Donepezil is dissolved in methyl ethyl ketone, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize at room temperature (see Example 24). 3-12) Donepezil is dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize at room temperature (see Example 25). 3-13) Donepezil is dissolved in toluene-denatured ethanol, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize in a warm water bath (see Examples 26 and 27). 3-14) Donepezil is dissolved in 2-ethoxyethanol, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize in a warm water bath (see Example 28). 3-15) Donepezil is dissolved in THF, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize under cooling (see Example 29). 3-16) Donepezil is dissolved in 1,4-dioxane, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize at room temperature (see Example 30). 3-17) Donepezil is dissolved in 1,3-dioxolane, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize under cooling (see Example 31). 3-18) Donepezil is dissolved in 1,2-dimethoxyethane, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize under cooling (see Example 32). 3-19) Donepezil is dissolved in methyl acetate, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize under cooling (see Example 33). 3-20) Donepezil is dissolved in ethyl acetate, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize in a warm water bath (see Examples 34 and 35). 3-21) Donepezil is dissolved in isopropyl acetate, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize in a warm water bath (see Example 36). 3-22) Donepezil is dissolved in acetonitrile, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize under cooling (see Example 37). 3-23) Donepezil is dissolved in ethyl benzene, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize at room temperature (see Example 38). 3-24) Donepezil is dissolved in cyclohexane, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize in a warm water bath (see Example 39). 3-25) Donepezil is dissolved in diethyl ether, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize at room temperature (see Example 40). 3-26) Donepezil is dissolved in methanol and water, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize at room temperature (see Example 41). 3-27) Donepezil is dissolved in acetonitrile and water, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize under cooling (see Examples 42 and 43). 3-28) Donepezil is dissolved in acetone and hexane, and then seed crystals of type C are added to crystallize at room temperature (see Example 44). The crystallization solvents in the processes 1-2), 2-3), 2-4), 3-4) and 3-5) described above are not limited, and any solvents in which donepezil is soluble more or less, or a mixture of such solvents, can be used. However, preferable examples include lower alcohols, specifically methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, methanol-denatured ethanol etc. The amount of the solvent used is not also limited and is varied depending on the type of solvent, lot size etc. Generally, it is used, per g of donepezil, in an amount of 1 to 100 ml, preferably 2 to 50 ml, more preferably 3 to 10 ml. The operation conditions other than described above, for example the presence or absence of stirring, are not also limited, and crystallization may be conducted with or without stirring. The crystallization temperature is not limited either, but good results can be obtained by conducting crystallization usually at a temperature of an ice-cold water bath to a room temperature to warm water bath. Addition of seed crystals is also arbitrary, but upon addition thereof, the desired polymorphic crystals can be certainly obtained in a shorter time. The crystallization time is also varied depending on these operation conditions, but may be usually 30 min. to 24 hours or so. The precipitated crystals can be collected by a usual filtration method such as gravity filtration, filtration under suction (under reduced pressure), centrifugation etc. The novel polymorphic crystals (A) to (C) according to the present invention are dry and can thus be collected very easily in a shorter time, thus exhibiting excellent physical properties in handling and production efficiency. The crystals thus collected by filtration can be made completely free of residual solvent certainly and easily by a usual drying method such as spontaneous drying, drying under reduced pressure (in vacuo), heating drying, heating drying under reduced pressure, etc. As the effect of the present invention, there can be obtained crystals of donepezil which are preferable and excellent in handling properties, that is, not being sticky but being dry, excellent in filtering properties after crystallization and capable of easily recovering its filter cake by scraping. Although any novel crystals (A) to (C) of donepezil according to the present invention have excellent handling properties, type C is particularly excellent in handling property, and type A and B follow in this order. Further, as compared with a product in the prior art (purification by column chromatography), the novel crystals (A) to (C) of donepezil according to the present invention have a significantly low content of residual solvent and free of highly toxic methylene chloride, and are thus a very preferable raw medicine as a medicament.

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of N-alkyl sulfenimides. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel process for converting N-alkyl sulfenamides to N-alkyl sulfenimides. 2. Description of Related Art Sulfenimides have been used commercially as vulcanization accelerators and are said to be useful as pesticides. Sulfenimides have been made in the past by placing an N-alkyl sulfenamide in an organic solvent and converting the sulfenamide to the sulfenimide by the addition of anhydrous HCl gas. In this case, the amine hydrochloride salt is formed as a by-product. The amine hydrochloride salt is then removed by filtration or extraction and the product is isolated by crystallization and filtration. Alternatively, sulfenimides can be made from N-alkyl sulfenamides by placing the N-alkyl sulfenamide in an anhydrous organic solvent and adding an organic acid anhydride. This reaction produces the desired sulfenimide along with the free acid and the N-alkyl amide corresponding to the N-alkyl group of the starting sulfenamide and the acid anhydride used. Sulfenimides have also been made by the reaction of a sulfenyl chloride with an amine in an anhydrous solvent. Reactions of sulfenamides with carbonyl compounds have been reported in the past. However, none of the these reactions has been found to produce a sulfenimide as the major product of the reaction. U.S. Pat. No. 2,860,142 discloses a process for the conversion of sulfenamides to sulfenimides comprising treating an N-alkyl or N-cycloalkyl benzothiazolyl-2-sulfenamide with acetic anhydride or a homolog thereof, with or without the presence of a second solvent, at about 25 to about 75 C., for an appropriate period that can range from about 10 minutes to 24 hours. The resulting sulfenimide is isolated by crystallization, dilution, or by stripping off the solvent. The yields are very good. U.S. Pat. No. 3,151,122 discloses a process for the preparation of N-alkyl- and N-cycloalkylbis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimides comprising treating the corresponding 2-benzothiazolylsulfenamide under substantially anhydrous conditions with an acid having an ionization constant K a above 110 3 at 25 C. The compounds are useful as accelerators in the vulcanization of any of the recognized sulfur-vulcanizable rubbers and show good resistance to scorch. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,079,305 and 5,189,174 disclose heterocyclic thiol sulfenimide compounds that are said to be useful as accelerators in the curing of natural and/or synthetic rubbers. The compounds can be represented by the formula: Herein each of A 1 and A 2 , independently, is at least one heterocyclic ring containing one or more nitrogen atoms therein, or at least one heterocyclic ring containing one or more nitrogen atoms and (1) one or more hydrocarbyl substituents; or (2) one or more electron withdrawing groups; or (3) one or more electron releasing groups, wherein A 1 alternatively is thiazyl or a dithiocarbamoyl, and wherein R is: (a) a hydrogen atom, or (b) a hydrocarbyl radical having from 1 to 16 carbon atoms, or (c) the hydrocarbon radical of (b) wherein one or more of the carbon atoms is an oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom, or a substituted nitrogen atom wherein the substituted group is an alkyl and, in combination with the nitrogen atom, forms a heterocyclic ring having a total of one to seven carbon atoms, or (d) the hydrocarbyl radical of (b) containing a halogen, an amino, a cyano, an alkoxy, a hydroxy, or an alkoxycarbonyl. When the heterocyclic thiol sulfenimide compound is utilized as an accelerator for rubber, improved cure rates, longer scorch delay, and better reversion resistance are said to be obtained in comparison to conventional sulfenamides. U.S. Pat. No. 5,204,481 discloses a process for producing N-alkyl or N-cycloalkyl-2-benzothiazolyl sulfenimides wherein aliphatic hydrocarbons are used as a reaction medium in converting N-alkyl or N-cycloalkyl-2-benzothiazolyl sulfenamides to the corresponding sulfenimides by reaction with an acid. Ignatov et al., Zhurnal Obshchei Khimii , 47(5):1096-1103 (1977) studied the reactions of 2-benzothiazolylsulfeneamide and N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolylsulfenamide with acetic acid, acetyl chloride, acetic anhydride, benzoyl chloride, picryl chloride, butyl acetate, maleic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, hydrochloric acid, trichloroacetic acid, thioacetic acid, and hydrogen sulfide. This enabled the authors to determine the optimum conditions for the synthesis of bis-2-benzothiazolylsulfenimide and N-cyclohexyl bis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimide, which compounds are said to have valuable properties as general purpose rubber vulcanization accelerators. The disclosures of the foregoing are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In the process of the present invention, a sulfenamide is converted to a sulfenimide by a reaction with an aldehyde. The process is carried out by placing an N-alkyl sulfenamide in an appropriate organic solvent, then adding a stoichiometric excess of an aldehyde, heating the mixture to boiling and removing the water formed in the reaction until the reaction is complete. The product thus formed can be isolated by filtration from the reaction mixture or by evaporation of the reaction solvent, followed by crystallization of the crude reaction product, and filtration from a suitable solvent. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a process for the preparation of sulfenimides comprising: mixing, in a hydrocarbon solvent, a sulfenamide of the formula with an aldehyde of the formula R 4 CHO where X is a sulfur atom, a CN group, or a CC group, R 1 and R 2 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and aryl or may be joined to form a saturated or unsaturated ring or aromatic ring, R 3 is alkyl or cycloalkyl, and R 4 is a hydrocarbon radical wherein the carbon bearing the aldehyde function is bonded only to other carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl ring, or a heteroaromatic ring; and heating the mixture at a temperature and for a period of time sufficient to convert the sulfenamide to the sulfenimide. The reaction can be represented by the equation: In a particularly preferred embodiment, the reaction can be represented by the equation: In light of the reported reaction of N-cyclohexyl 2-benzothiazolylsulfenamide with acetone, and the reaction of 2-benzothiazolylsulfenamide with cyclohexanone, the reaction of N-cyclohexyl 2-benzothiazolylsulfenamide with an aldehyde to form N-cyclohexyl bis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimide in high yield is surprising and unexpected. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS As disclosed above, the present invention is directed to a process for preparing a sulfenimide by reacting a sulfenamide of the structure: with an aldehyde of the structure R 4 CHO. In the formula for the sulfenamide, X is a sulfur atom, a CN group, or a CC group. Thus, the ring shown in the formula will be of one of the following structures: R 1 and R 2 in the formula can be the same or different and can be hydrogen, alkyl, or aryl, or can be joined to form a saturated or unsaturated ring or an aromatic ring.

The ring may be substituted with any substituent that will not adversely affect the properties of the sulfenimide to be formed for the application to which it is to be put. It is most preferred that such a ring, when present, be phenyl. In the formula for the sulfenamide, R 3 is a straight or branched chain alkyl moiety, which term is intended to include cycloalkyl, preferably of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, isomers of the foregoing, and the like. It is preferred that R 3 be alkyl of one to eight carbon atoms, and more preferred that it be of one to four carbon atoms.

In the practice of the present invention, aldehydes are used to convert the sulfenamides to sulfenimides. These aldehydes are of the structure R 4 CHO, in which R 4 is a hydrocarbon radical wherein the carbon bearing the aldehyde function is bonded only to other carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl ring, or a heteroaromatic ring. More specifically, R 4 may be an aromatic ring which may be substituted with alkyl, hydroxyl, alkoxy, or ester groups. It may also be a heterocyclic ring, provided that the ring carbon atom bearing the aldehyde function has no other substituents.

A representative sampling of some of the products that may be made by means of the process of the present invention is listed below: N-cyclohexyl bis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimide, N-tert-butyl bis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimide, N-isopropyl bis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimide, N-tert-octyl bis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimide, N-sec-butyl bis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimide, N-iso-butyl bis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimide, N-tert-amyl bis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimide, N-iso-amyl bis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimide, N-(2-ethylhexyl) bis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimide, N-cyclohexyl bis(2-pyridyl)sulfenimide, N-tert-butyl bis(2-pyridyl)sulfenimide, N-isopropyl bis(2-pyridyl)sulfenimide, N-tert-octyl bis(2-pyridyl)sulfenimide, N-sec-butyl bis(2-pyridyl)sulfenimide, N-iso-butyl bis(2-pyridyl)sulfenimide, N-tert-amyl bis(2-pyridyl)sulfenimide, N-iso-amyl bis(2-pyridyl)sulfenimide, N-(2-ethylhexyl) bis(2-pyridyl)sulfenimide, N-cyclohexyl bis(2-pyrimidyl)sulfenimide, N-tert-butyl bis(2-pyrimidyl)sulfenimide, N-isopropyl bis(2-pyrimidyl)sulfenimide, N-tert-octyl bis(2-pyrimidyl)sulfenimide, N-sec-butyl bis(2-pyrimidyl)sulfenimide, N-iso-butyl bis(2-pyrimidyl)sulfenimide, N-tert-amyl bis(2-pyrimidyl)sulfenimide, N-iso-amyl bis(2-pyrimidyl)sulfenimide, N-(2-ethylhexyl) bis(2-pyrimidyl)sulfenimide, N-cyclohexyl bis2-(4-phenyl)thiazolylsulfenimide, N-tert-butyl bis2-(4-phenyl)thiazolylsulfenimide, N-isopropyl bis2-(4-phenyl)thiazolylsulfenirnide, N-tert-octyl bis2-(4-phenyl)thiazolylsulfenimide, N-sec-butyl bis2-(4-phenyl)thiazolylsulfenimide, N-iso-butyl bis2-(4-phenyl)thiazolylsulfenimide, N-tert-amyl bis2-(4-phenyl)thiazolylsulfenimide, N-iso-amyl bis2-(4-phenyl)thiazolylsulfenimide, and N-(2-ethylhexyl) bis2-(4-phenyl)thiazolylsulfenimide. The process of the present invention is carried out by placing an N-alkyl sulfenamide in an appropriate organic solvent, then adding a stoichiometric excess of an aldehyde, heating the mixture to boiling, and removing the water formed in the reaction until the reaction is complete. The product thus formed can be isolated by filtration from the reaction mixture or by evaporation of the reaction solvent, followed by crystallization of the crude reaction product and filtration from a suitable solvent. The reaction solvents useful in the process of the present invention can be aliphatic hydrocarbons, which may be straight chain, branched chain, or cyclic; aromatic hydrocarbons, in which the aromatic ring may be substituted with alkyl groups or halogens; dialkyl ethers; or halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons. Examples of solvents that can be used include hexane, heptane, octane, isooctane, cyclohexane, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, chloroform, methylene chloride, ethylene dichloride, methyl chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, and the like. Processes currently known in the art typically use either anhydrous hydrogen chloride, or an acid anhydride to convert sulfenamides to sulfenimides. A by-product in the case of the anhydrous HCl is the amine hydrochloride corresponding to the sulfenamide used. In the case of the acid anhydrides, a by-product is the amide corresponding to the acid anhydride and the amine portion of the starting sulfenamide employed. Handling anhydrous HCl gas (and other strong mineral acids or acidic materials that can induce the desired transformation) is, however, a hazardous operation requiring special equipment to vaporize and transport the gas and to protect workers from the extremely corrosive and toxic material. Further, the amine hydrochloride by-product must be separated from the reaction mixture and then recovered by neutralization with a base, generating a salty waste stream. Where acid anhydrides are employed, the reagent is of a lower order of acute toxicity but is still corrosive to bodily tissues and must be handled with care. Again, the by-product amides must be hydrolyzed with acid or base to regenerate the amine, leaving the acid as a waste stream that must be discarded or subjected to further processing to regenerate the anhydride. It is an advantage of the present invention that the aldehydes used as one of the reactants are not corrosive, as are the acids and acid anhydrides used in the prior art. Thus, they are easier to handle in a manufacturing environment and are noncorrosive to most commonly used metal equipment. A by-product of the reaction of the present invention is the imine corresponding to the amine of the sulfenamide and the aldehyde starting materials employed. This by-product is easy to wash off the product and can easily be reconverted back to the starting aldehyde and the amine by simply boiling the by-product with water and a small amount of acid as a catalyst. The raw materials may then be isolated by a simple distillation. The amine thus generated can be used to produce more of the starting sulfenamide and the aldehyde can be recycled to produce more sulfenimide. Accordingly, the process of the present invention advantageously produces very little in the way of waste that must be discarded. In greater detail, to prepare sulfenimides according to the process of the present invention, the sulfenamide used as the starting material is placed in a reaction vessel equipped with an overhead condenser along with a solvent that is inert with respect to all the reactants. The vessel must be able to be heated to the boiling point of the solvent employed, and arranged so that the water produced in the reaction may be separated from the liquid as it refluxes. The concentration of the starting sulfenamide is chosen so that the reaction mixture can be stirred and so that the slurry of the final product in the reaction mixture will be fluid enough to permit easy processing. In practice, the concentration of starting sulfenamide in the solvent will be generally less than 50 weight percent. The aldehyde is added to the mixture of sulfenamide and solvent. The mole ratio of aldehyde to the starting sulfenamide must be at least 0.5:1.0, and preferably should be at least 0.75:1.0 or more. However, a molar ratio greater than 1.5:1.0 has no beneficial effect and may hinder the isolation of the final product. The reaction mixture is then heated and stirred until it boils and distillate collects in the overhead condenser. Water is separated from the refluxing liquid, and the dry condensate may be returned to the reaction. This refluxing process is continued until no more water separates from the refluxing liquid, or until chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture shows that the reaction is complete. The reaction mixture is then cooled to near ambient temperature, whereupon the sulfenimide product crystallizes and can then be isolated by filtration and dried. The rate and extent of the reaction can be improved by the addition of a small amount of an acid catalyst at the start of the reaction. The acid catalyst can be a strong Lewis acid, such as anhydrous aluminum trichloride, or a weak organic acid, such as benzoic acid. Strong acids are known to react with sulfenamides to form sulfenimides when used in stoichiometric equivalent amounts, but in the practice of the present invention, much smaller amounts, about one weight percent of the reagents, are effective in accelerating the rate of the reaction. Other materials can also accelerate the rate of the transformation. Surprisingly, the addition of a quantity of anhydrous calcium chloride will accelerate the reaction nearly as well as the addition of an acid. As little as one percent by weight of calcium chloride has a noticeable effect. The degree of enhancement increases as the loading of calcium chloride increases. The rate enhancement is not due simply to the desiccant property of the anhydrous salt, since the water evolved in the reaction still collects with the distillate; and in a comparative reaction, the addition of a different drying agent, anhydrous sodium sulfate, had no effect on the reaction. When an inorganic solid, such as calcium chloride, is used, the reaction mixture may be filtered while it is still hot and the product is in solution, in order to remove the salt so that it will not contaminate the organic product. The advantages and important features of the present invention will be more apparent from the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of N-cyclohexyl bis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimide Using Benzaldehyde A glass reaction flask was assembled with a mechanical paddle stirrer, a Dean-Stark trap with a water-cooled condenser arranged for reflux, a thermocouple, and an electric heating mantle. The flask was charged with 52.6 grams of N-cyclohexyl 2-benzothiazolylsulfenamide, 150 mL of heptane, and 21.2 grams of benzaldehyde. The mixture was stirred and heated to the boiling point. As the mixture boiled and the reaction progressed, water collected in the bottom of the Dean-Stark trap. The extent of the reaction was determined by measuring the amount of water collected in the trap and by periodically removing small samples of the reaction solution for analysis by high performance liquid chromatography. The process continued until approximately 95 percent of the starting sulfenamide was converted to the desired sulfenimide. This required 11 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to ambient temperature, and the product formed a crystalline precipitate. The solid product was filtered and washed with a quantity of fresh heptane and thoroughly dried. The yield of product was 38.5 grams, 89.7 percent of the theoretical yield. EXAMPLE 2 Preparation of N-cyclohexyl bis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimide Using Benzaldehyde and Benzoic Acid Catalyst An apparatus was assembled as in Example 1. The flask was charged with 52.6 grams of N-cyclohexyl 2-benzothiazolylsulfenamide, 150 mL of heptane, 21.2 grams of benzaldehyde, and 1.1 grams of benzoic acid. The mixture was heated as in Example 1. In this case, the reaction required only five hours of heating to achieve 95 percent conversion to products. The yield of filtered, washed, and dried product was 38.5 grams, 89.7 percent yield. EXAMPLE 3 Preparation of N-cyclohexyl bis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimide Using 2-furaldehyde An apparatus was assembled as in Example 1. The flask was charged with 52.6 grams of N-cyclohexyl 2-benzothiazolylsulfenamide, 150 mL of heptane, and 19.2 grams of 2-furaldehyde. The mixture was heated as in Example 1. In this case the reaction required 10 to 12 hours of heating to achieve 95 percent conversion to products. The yield of filtered, washed, and dried product was 38.1 grams, 88.8 percent yield. EXAMPLE 4 Preparation of N-tert-butyl bis(2-benzothiazolyl)sulfenimide Using Benzaldehyde An apparatus was assembled as in Example 1. The flask was charged with 47.2 grams of N-tert-butyl-2-benzothiazolylsulfenamide, 150 mL of heptane, and 21.2 grams of benzaldehyde. The reaction mixture was heated as in Example 1. In this case the reaction required nearly 20 hours to proceed to 70 to 80 percent conversion. The product was isolated and dried as in Example 1. The yield of product was 27.7 grams, 68.7 percent of the theoretical yield. EXAMPLE 5 Preparation of N-cyclohexyl bis2-(4-phenyl)thiazolylsulfenimide Using Benzaldehyde An apparatus was set up as in Example 1. The flask was charged with 29.0 grams of N-cyclohexyl-2-(4-phenyl)thiazolylsulfenamide, 75 mL of heptane, 10.6 grams of benzaldehyde, and 0.55 gram of benzoic acid. The reaction mixture was heated as in Example 1. The reaction required nine hours to reach approximately 95 percent conversion. The product was isolated and dried as in Example 1. The yield was 18.1 grams, 75.3 percent of theory.

"abstract": "Asymmetrical bis benzotriazoles of the formula I where G 2 is perfluoroalkyl of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably CF 3 , and where G 2 does not contain said group are red-shifted and due to the asymmetry are particularly soluble and useful in a host of applications including automotive coatings, thermoplastics and especially in adhesive compositions, themselves useful in solar panels and other laminate structures. This is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 09/303,583, filed on May 3, 1999, claims allowed and issue fee paid. The instant invention pertains to novel asymmetrical bisbenzotriazole compounds which are red-shifted, are particularly soluble due to that asymmetry and which are useful in a host of end-use applications. BACKGOUND OF THE INVENTION Although benzotriazoles with just hydrogen at the 5-position of the benzo ring are photostable and useful in adhesive formulations, they lack red-shifted absorbance toward longer UV wavelengths which would make them more useful in giving added protection to the substrates. U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,091 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,410,071 described the preparation of benzotriazoles substituted at the 5-position of the benzo ring with alkyl- or aryl-sulfonyl moieties. It is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,280,124 that by introducing a higher alkyl or aryl sulfoxide or sulfone at the 5-position of the benzo ring of the benzotriazole, the resulting benzotriazole exhibits enhanced absorption in the near visible range (over 350 nm). Such sulfone substituted products were shown to be useful in automotive coatings applications. Copending patent applications Ser. Nos. 08/961,127 and 09/234,880 teach that an electron withdrawing moiety at the 5-position of the benzo ring of the benzotriazole is advantageous for similar reasons. Additionally, these copending patent applications teach that such an electron withdrawing group dramatically increases the photostability of these benzotriazole UV absorbers in automotive coatings. It is known in the art that the concomitant use of a hindered amine light stabilizer with a UV absorber such as a benzotriazole provides excellent stabilization in many polymer compositions as summarized by G. Berner and M. Rembold, New Light Stabilizers for High Solids Coatings, Organic Coatings and Science and Technology, Vol. 6, Dekkar, New York, pp 55-85. The benzotriazole UV absorbers represent a special class of commercial UV absorbers as described above. Only a few references refer to substitution on the benzo ring by an aryl or alkyl sulfoxide or sulfonyl moiety. U.S. Pat. No. 3,218,332 discloses benzotriazoles substituted at the 5-position of the benzo ring by a lower alkyl sulfonyl moiety. However, this patent deals with putting reactable groups, namely alkenyl groups, at the 3-position on the phenyl ring and is of little relevance to the instant application. U.S. Pat. No. 5,268,450 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,091 disclose polymer compositions and a process for the production of substituted aryl thio and aryl sulfonyl benzotriazoles which are covalently bound to polymers, such as poly(phenylene sulfide), RYTON, Phillips Petroleum. U.S. Pat. No. 5,280,124 discloses benzotriazoles with only higher alkyl or aryl sulfinyl or sulfonyl moieties at the 5-position of the benzo ring which are useful for protecting thermoset automotive coatings. The copending patent applications mentioned above teach the use of certain electron withdrawing groups including some sulfonyl groups at the 5-position of the benzo ring for the stabilization of automotive coatings. Japanese Patent No. 92-352228 discloses the use of 5-ethylsulfonyl benzotriazoles with the 3-position of the phenyl ring being unsubstituted or substituted by methyl for the UV protection of dust proof poly(vinyl chloride) resin films. These compounds when studied in the instant adhesive compositions were found to be quite insoluble and totally useless for the instant adhesive compositions. By contrast, when a tertiary alkyl group is inserted at the 3-position of the phenyl ring, the solubility of the thus substituted benzotriazole in adhesive composition is surprisingly enhanced. The instant compounds exhibit enhanced broadened absorption characteristics particularly in the long wavelength UV region (over 350 nm) when compared with compounds of the prior art. Additionally, the instant compounds have surprising and unexpectedly high solubility in adhesives making them especially well suited for use in adhesive formulations. The effect of UV light on laminated articles that are exposed to the sun or other sources of UV light are of great concern to the manufacturers of such articles. Over time, constant or repeated exposure to UV light can result in dye and/or pigment fade for dyes and/or pigments used in such articles and in the degradation or breakdown of the adhesives, polymers or other materials used in the construction of the articles. The aforementioned fading and degradation shorten the useful life of the articles in question, making protection from UV light exposure an issue of great importance to the manufacturers of such articles. Molecules known as UV absorbers are generally known in the art. However, due to the differences discussed above between the various UV absorber classes, it is the benzotriazoles and articles containing them which will be discussed here. Due to the incompatibility and low solubility of certain benzotriazoles, a need exists for selected benzotriazoles that are highly soluble and which would provide added protection in the 350 to 400 nm region of the ultraviolet. T. Nagashima et al., J. Non-Cryst. Solids, 178 (1994), 182, report Recently ultraviolet light (UV) shielding glass, which is UV absorbing over the range of long wavelengths (320-400 nm) to avoid sunburn effects, has become an important issue because of the possible hazard of skin cancer due to depletion of the ozone layer. In addition, articles which incorporate the selected benzotriazoles of the instant invention are useful in protecting interior structures, textiles and fabrics from UV induced photodegradation such as in automotive applications. Bisbenzotriazoles such as 2,2-methylene-bis4-tert-octyl-6-(2H-benzotriazolyl-2-yl)phenol, TINUVIN 360 (Ciba) are are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,299,521. While useful, these compounds are not red-shifted. German 1,670,951 describes generically both symmetrical and asymmetrical alkylene-bisbenzotriazoles, but specifically only some symmetical bisbenzotriazoles which are outside of the scope of the instant claims. None of the compounds described in German 1,670,951 are substituted by a perfluroalkyl moiety, such as by CF 3 , and as is -seen in instant Example 6, these symmetrical bisbenzotriazoles are insoluble in adhesive compositions. U.S. Pat. No. 4,812,498 describes symmetrical bisbenzotriazoles as stabilizers for polycarbonate resins. The bisbenzotriazoles are symmetrical in structure, do not contain perfluoroalkyl moieties, and are clearly outside the scope of the instant compounds. EP 924,203 A1 describes bisbenzotriazole compounds each containing a polymerizable moiety and polymers made therefrom. None of these prior art bisbenzotriazoles is red-shifted or contains a perfluoroalkyl group. The instant compounds are clearly distinguished from these prior bisbenzotriazoles. U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,219, British patent application 2,319,035, copending application Ser. Nos. 09/234,880 and 09/303,583 all describe both symmetrical and asymmetrical red-shifted bisbenzotriazoles. Quite surprisingly, these red-shifted benzotriazoles are amazingly soluble in adhesives making them especially well-suited for the instant applications. Copending application Ser. No. 09/234,880 also teaches symmetrical bisbenzotriazoles which are substituted on the both benzo rings by a perfluoroalkyl moiety and asymmetrical bisbenzotriazoles which is substituted on one benzo ring by a perfluoroalkyl moiety and where the other benzo ring is unsubstituted. There is a clear line of demarcation between the instant bisbenzotriazoles are also asymmetrical but where one benzo ring is subsituted by a perfluoroalkyl moiety, and the other benzo ring is substituted by a different electron withdrawing moiety.

The instant invention also pertains to a stabilized adhesive composition, suitable for use as an adhesive layer in a laminated article or multilayer construction, which comprises (a) an adhesive; and (b) an effective stabilizing amount of a highly soluble, red-shifted, photostable benzotriazole of formula I. The effective stabilizing amount of a benzotriazole of formula I is 0.1 to 20% by weight based on the adhesive. The adhesive of component (a) is selected from the group consisting of the pressure sensitive adhesives, the rubber-based adhesives, the solvent or emulsion based adhesives, the hot melt adhesives and natural-product based adhesives.

The instant invention also pertains to a composition stabilized against thermal, oxidative or light-induced degradation which comprises, (a) an organic material subject to thermal, oxidative or light-induced degradation, and (b) an effective stabilizing amount of a compound of formula I. Preferably, the organic material is a natural, semi-synthetic or synthetic polymer, especially a thermoplastic polymer. Most preferably, the polymer is a polyolefin or polycarbonate, especially polyethylene or polypropylene; most especially polypropylene; or the polymer is a styrenic, ABS, a nylon, a polyester such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) or poly(butylene terephthalate), a polyurethane, an acrylate, a rubber modified styrenic, poly(vinyl chloride), poly(vinyl butyral), polyacetal (polyoxymethylene), poly(ethylene naphthalenedicarboxylate), or other blends or copolymers such as poly(ethylene/1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) PETG or an ionomer.

Most preferably, the resin is a thermoset acrylic melamine resin or an acrylic urethane resin. In yet another preferred embodiment of the instant invention, the organic material is a recording material. The recording materials according to the invention are suitable for pressure-sensitive copying systems, photocopying systems using microcapsules, heat-sensitive copying systems, photographic materials and ink jet printing. The recording materials according to the invention are distinguished by an unexpected improvement in quality, especially with regard to the fastness to light. The recording materials according to the invention have the construction known for the particular use. They consist of a customary carrier, for example, paper or plastic film, which has been coated with one or more layers. Depending on the type of material, these layers contain the appropriate necessary components, in the case of photographic materials, for example, silver halide emulsions, dye couplers, dyes and the like. Material particularly suitable for ink jet printing has a layer particularly absorptive for ink on a customary carrier. Uncoated paper can also be employed for ink jet printing. In this case the paper acts at the same time as the carrier material and as the ink-absorbent layer. Suitable material for ink jet printing is, for example, described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,448 which is incorporated herein by reference. The recording material can also be transparent as, for example, in the case of projection films. The compounds of formula I can be incorporated into the carder material as early as the production of the latter, in the production of paper, for example, being added to the paper pulp. A second method of application is to spray the carder material with an aqueous solution of compounds of formula I or to add the compounds to the coating composition. Coating compositions intended for transparent recording materials suitable for projection cannot contain any particles which scatter light, such as pigments and fillers. The dye-binding coating composition can contain a number of other additives, for example, antioxidants, light stabilizers (including also UV absorbers which do not fall under the scope of the UV absorbers of this invention), viscosity improvers, fluorescent brighteners, biocides and/or antistatic agents. The coating composition is usually prepared as follows: the water-soluble components, for example, the binder, are dissolved in water and stirred together; the solid components, for example, fillers and other additives already described, are dispersed in this aqueous medium; and disperison is advantageously carried out by means of devices, for example, ultrasonic systems, turbine stirrers, homogenizers, colloid mills, bead mills, sand mills, high-speed stirrers and the like. The compounds of formula I can be easily incorporated into the coating composition. The recording material according to this invention preferably contains 1 to 5000 mg/m 2 , in particular 50-1200 mg/m 2 , of a compound of formula I. As already mentioned, the recording materials according to the invention embrace a wide field. The compounds of formula I can, for example, be employed in pressure-sensitive copying systems. They can be introduced either into the paper in order to protect the microencapsulated dye precursors there from light, or into the binder of the developer layer in order to protect the dyes formed there. Photocopying systems using light-sensitive microcapsules which are developed by means of pressure are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,416,966; 4,483,912; 4,352,200; 4,535,050; 4,535,463; 4,551,407; 4,562,137 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,330; and also in EP-A 139,479; EP-A 162,664; EP-A 164,931; EP-A 237,024; EP-A 237,025 and EP-A 260,129. In all these systems, the compounds can be put into the dye-receiving layer. The compounds can, however, also be put into the donor layer in order to protect the color formers from light. Photographic materials which can be stabilized are photographic dyes and layers containing such dyes or precursors thereof, for example, photographic paper and films. Suitable materials are, for example, described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,749 which is incorporated herein by reference. The compounds of formula I act here as a UV filter against electrostatic flashes. In color photographic materials, couplers and dyes are also protected against photochemical decomposition. The instant compounds can be used for all types of color photographic materials. For example, they can be employed for color paper, color reversal paper, direct-positive color material, color negative film, color positive film, color reversal film and the like. They are preferably used inter alia for photographic color material which contains a reversal substrate or form positives. Color-photographic recording materials usually contain, on a support, a blue-sensitive and/or a green-sensitive and/or a red-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and, if desired, a protection layer, with the instant compounds being, preferably, either in the green-sensitive or the red-sensitive layer or in a layer between the green-sensitive and the red-sensitive layer or in a layer on top of the silver halide emulsion layers. The compounds of formula I can also be employed in recording materials based on the principles of photopolymerization, photoplasticization or the rupture of microcapsules, or in cases where heat-sensitive and light-sensitive diazonium salts, leuko dyes having an oxidizing agent or dye lactones having Lewis acids are used. Furthermore, the instant compounds can be employed in recording materials for dye diffusion transfer printing, thermal wax transfer printing and non-matrix printing and for use with electrostatic, electrographic, electrophoretic, magnetographic and laser-electrophotographic printers and pen-plotters. Of the above, recording materials for dye diffusion transfer printing are preferred, for example, as described in EP-A 507,734. The instant compounds can also be employed in inks, preferably for ink jet printing, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,098,477 which is incorporated herein by reference. The compounds of this invention exhibit superior hydrolytic stability, handling and storage stability as well as good resistance to extractability when present in a stabilized composition. The methodology to make the instant compounds is described in the prior art. The intermediates needed to make the instant compounds are largely items of commerce. In general polymers which can be stabilized include 1. Polymers of monoolefins and diolefins, for example polypropylene, polyisobutylene, polybut-1-ene, poly-4-methylpent-1-ene, polyisoprene or polybutadiene, as well as polymers of cycloolefins, for instance of cyclopentene or norbornene, polyethylene (which optionally can be crosslinked), for example high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), branched low density polyethylene (BLDPE). Polyolefins, i.e. the polymers of monoolefins exemplified in the preceding paragraph, preferably polyethylene and polypropylene, can be prepared by different, and especially by the following, methods: a) radical polymerisation (normally under high pressure and at elevated temperature). b) catalytic polymerisation using a catalyst that normally contains one or more than one metal of groups IVb, Vb, VIb or VIII of the Periodic Table. These metals usually have one or more than one ligand, typically oxides, halides, alcoholates, esters, ethers, amines, alkyls, alkenyls and/or aryls that may be either - or -coordinated. These metal complexes may be in the free form or fixed on substrates, typically on activated magnesium chloride, titanium(III) chloride, alumina or silicon oxide. These catalysts may be soluble or insoluble in the polymerisation medium. The catalysts can be used by themselves in the polymerisation or further activators may be used, typically metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkyl halides, metal alkyl oxides or metal alkyloxanes, said metals being elements of groups Ia, Ia and/or IIIa of the Periodic Table. The activators may be modified conveniently with further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups. These catalyst systems are usually termed Phillips, Standard Oil Indiana, Ziegler (-Natta), TNZ (DuPont), metallocene or single site catalysts (SSC). 2.

The alkyd resin lacquers which can be stabilized against the action of light and moisture in accordance with the instant invention are the conventional stoving lacquers which are used in particular for coating automobiles (automobile finishing lacquers), for example lacquers based on alkyd/melamine resins and alkyd/acrylic/melamine resins (see H. Wagner and H. F. Sarx, Lackkunstharze (1977), pages 99-123). Other crosslinking agents include glycouril resins, blocked isocyanates or epoxy resins. The lacquers stabilized in accordance with the invention are suitable both for metal finish coatings and solid shade finishes, especially in the case of retouching finishes, as well as various coil coating applications. The lacquers stabilized in accordance with the invention are preferably applied in the conventional manner by two methods, either by the single-coat method or by the two-coat method. In the latter method, the pigment-containing base coat is applied first and then a covering coat of clear lacquer over it. It is also to be noted that the compounds of the present invention are applicable for use in non-acid catalyzed thermoset resins such as epoxy, epoxy-polyester, vinyl, alkyd, acrylic and polyester resins, optionally modified with silicon, isocyanates or isocyanurates. The epoxy and epoxy-polyester resins are crosslinked with conventional crosslinkers such as acids, acid anhydrides, amines and the like. Correspondingly, the epoxide may be utilized as the crosslinking agent for various acrylic or polyester resin systems that have been modified by the presence of reactive groups on the backbone structure. When used in two-coat finishes, the compounds of the instant invention can be incorporated in the clear coat or both in the clear coat and in the pigmented base coat. When water-soluble, water miscible or water dispersible coating are desired ammonium salts of acid groups present in the resin are formed. Powder coating composition can be prepared by reacting glycidyl methacrylate with selected alcohol components. The instant benzotriazoles are made by conventional methods for preparing such compounds. The usual procedure involves the diazotization of a substituted o-nitroaniline followed by coupling the resultant diazonium salt with a substituted phenol and reduction of the azobenzene intermediate to the corresponding desired benzotriazole. The starting materials for these benzotriazoles are largely items of commerce or can be prepared by normal methods of organic synthesis. While the instant benzotriazoles with their enhanced durability are particularly suited for automotive coating applications, it is contemplated that they will also be espeically useful in other applications where their enhanced durability is required such as in solar films and the like. The following examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed to limit the instant invention in any manner whatsoever.

EXAMPLE 6 Bisbenzotriazole Solubility in Adhesive To measure the solubility of the instant bisbenzotriazole UV absorber in an adhesive composition, the compound is added to a typical adhesive GELVA 263 (Solutia) which is a 44.5% solution of a polyacrylate in a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane. The polyacrylate is a copolymer of methyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate and glycidyl methacrylate. The test compound is dissolved in 5 mL of ethyl acetate, toluene or a mixture of ethyl acetate and toluene. To the solution is added 5 g of GELVA 263. 2-3 mL of the resulting solution is place into individual watch glasses. Solubility is then evaluated based upon observed crystallization once the solvent has evaporated. Observations start after several hours and then continue over a period of several weeks. The solubility values given in the table below are approximate maximum concentrations where no sign of subsequent crystallization is evident. Solubilities are reported in weight of total bisbenzotriazole added to GELVA 263 as is. From these data, it is clear that some of the instant bisbenzotriazoles are considerably more soluble in adhesives, in this case GELVA 263, than some bisbenzotriazoles of the prior art. The use of many UV absorbers in adhesive compositions has been limited in the past by the limited solubility and compatibility of some UV absorber compounds. By using the selected instant bisbenzotriazoles, the use levels for the UV absorber can be raised substantially to add greatly to increased stabilization protection afforded by the instant compound. This is further augmented by the excellent photostability and red-shifted nature of the instant bisbenzotriazoles.

EXAMPLE 31 Polycarbonate The durability of the instant benzotriazoles in thermoplastic substrates is determined by incorporating various test compounds into solvent cast films of polycarbonate resins. The free standing films are mounted into cardboard holders, secured in metal frames and exposed in an Atlas C165 Xenon-arc Weather-Ometer under dry conditions according to ASTM G26 for 1100 and 2200 hour exposure.

Films are cast using a calibrated drawdown bar to prepare 1 mil thick film after drying. There is an increase in durability obtained with a benzotriazole substituted on the 5-position of the benzo ring with a trifluoromethyl moiety. EXAMPLE 32 Pigmented Polyacetal The following example shows an improvement in color protection of a pigmented polyacetal formulation for a bisbenzotriazole substituted on the 5-position of the benzo ring with a trifluoromethyl moiety. The test additives are dry blended with polyacetal pellets (DELRIN 500P NC010, DuPont) using a Turbula mixer. The dry blend is extruded and pelletized using a twin screw extruder at a melt temperature of about 410 F. (210 C.). The pellets are molded into test plaques (220.060) using an injection molder operated at 410-420 F. (204-216 C.). The plaques are exposed in a Xenon-arc Weather-Ometer according to automotive test procedure SAE J1885. Exposure is measured in terms of the total irradiation, measured in kilojoules per square meter (kj/M 2 ). Color change in the exposed samples is determined by measuring the color of the exposed samples compared to the unexposed samples as color difference (E) according to ASTM D2244. EXAMPLE 33 Poly(butylene terephthalate) The following example illustrates the superior performance of a bisbenzotriazole substituted on the 5-position of the benzo ring with a trifluoromethyl group in protecting poly(butylene terephthalate) as measured by gloss retention.

The dry blends are extruded and pelletized using a twin screw extruder at 465-490 C. The pellets are molded into test plaques (220.060) using an injection molder operated at 475-515 F. (246-268 C.). The plaques are exposed in a Xenon arc Weather-Ometer according to ASTM G26 test method A. Gloss is measure at 600 on the unexposed and exposed samples using a glossmeter according to ASTM D523. Gloss retention %(gloss exposed sample/gloss of unexposed sample)100. EXAMPLE 34 Polystyrene Polystyrene films (crystalline polystyrene obtained from Chevron, free of zinc stearate and mineral oil) are solvent case from solutions in methylene chloride. These films are exposed to UV light as described in Example 31. The samples contain no hindered amine stabilizer and are monitored for color change after 1000 hours exposure, for loss of UV absorber and for physical integrity (cracking or catastrophic film failure). EXAMPLE 35 Poly(methyl methacrylate) The durability of the instant benzotriazoles in thermoplastic substrates is determined by incorporating various test compounds into solvent cast films of a poly(methyl methacrylate) resin. The free standing films are mounted into cardboard holders, secured in metal frames and exposed in an Atlas C165 Xenon-arc Weather-Ometer under dry conditions according to ASTM G26 for 1100 and 2200 hour exposure. Loss of UV absorber is determined by monitoring the loss of diagnostic UV absorption as described earlier. Performance is measured by a change in color or the physical integrity of the film, or in loss of absorbance of the UV absorber at max. Poly(methyl methacrylate), medium molecular weight, Aldrich, is dissolved in methylene chloride at room temperature along with between 1 and 3% by weight of test benzotriazole, based on the PMMA resin. Films are cast using a calibrated drawdown bar to prepare 1 mil thick film after drying. There is an increase in durability obtained with a bisbenzotriazole substituted on the 5-position of the benzo ring with a trifluoromethyl moiety. EXAMPLE 36 Polyurethane An acrylic polyol (RK 4037, DuPont) which is 75% solids in methyl amyl ketone is used in these experiments. The molecular weight is 7000-9000 and the OH number is 145. To 595 g of the acrylic polyol are added 26.2 g of butyl acetate, 5.8 g of ethyl acetate and 0.4 g of 50% strength FC 439 (flow control aid, 3M). Bis(1-octylocy-2,2,6,6-tetra-methylpiperidin-4-yl) sebacate (0.75 g TINUVIN 123, Ciba), 1% by weight based on resin solids, is added to the mixture. To 2.43 g of the above mixture is added 0.9 g of DESMODUR N-3390 (Bayer), an aliphatic polyisocyanate, 90% solids. The UV absorber is incorporated into the acrylic polyol component. The polyurethane formed is applied as a coating onto a quartz disc by spin coating at 1000 rpm for two seconds. The wet coating is cured at 260 F. (127 C.) for 30 minutes. UV spectra are collected using a -9 spectrophotometer from Perkin Elmer every half nm at 120 nm/min using a slit width of 2 nm. Loss rates are measured from a 1.4 mil coating. The absorbance of the long wavelength UV absorbance band is around 2.3 before weathering. Weathering is done according to SAE J-1960 (exterior automotive weathering conditions): 0.55 watts/sq. in. at 340 nm using inner and outer borosilicate filters, 40 straight irradiance with no water spray; 20 light plus front spray; 60 light and 60 dark plus rear spray (condensation). Black panel temperature in light cycle is 702 C. and relative humidity of 50-55% in light cycle and 100% in dark cycle. The loss of long wavelength absorbance band is followed after approximately every 200 hours. This test shows that the instant bisbenzotriazoles are especially durable in polyurethane films as judged by low loss rates. EXAMPLE 37 Poly(vinyl chloride) Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) films of GEON 27 (Geon Co.) are solvent cast as described in Example 31 in warm tetrahydrofuran (THF) and then exposed in an Atlas C165 Weather-Ometer as described in Example 31. This test shows that the instant bisbenzotriazoles are especially durable in PVC films as judged by low loss rates. EXAMPLE 38 Coating Composition A high solids thermoset acrylic clear coat is prepared by mixing an experimental acrylic polyol resin and hexamethoxymethylmelamine (Resimene 747, Monsanto) at a solids ratio of 60/40. The dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid catalyst (Nacure 5225; King Industries) is added at 0.70% by weight. A flow aid Modaflow (Monsanto) is added at 0.25% by weight to form a model acrylic melamine resin system. The model clear coat is reduced with xylene to a viscosity of 26-27 second using a Zahn 2 cup and applied via a conventional air spray at 50 psi (3.5 Kg/cm 2 ) over a 13 (2.54 cm7.62 cm) quartz slide. Cure is achieved by baking the slide for 30 minutes at 260 F. (127 C.). The clear coat is stabilized with 1% by weight of a hindered amine light stabilizer, bis-(1-octyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-yl) sebacate, (TINUVIN 123, Ciba). The various test benzotriazole UV absorbers are incorporated at the 5 mmol % by weight in the clear coat. The film thickness on the quartz slides range from 1.15 to 1.41 mils (0.029 to 0.036 mm). The films on the quartz slides are weathered according to the following conditions in Xenon Arc Weather-Ometer with a controlled irradiance at 6500 W, using inner quartz and outer borosilicate S-type filter. The irradiation cycle is as follows: 40 minutes of straight irradiation with no water spray, followed by 20 minutes of light plus front spray, followed by 60 minutes of light irradiation and finally by 60 minutes dart plus rear spray (condensation). The setting is at 0.55 W/M 2 at 340 nm, 1.98 kJ/hour. In the light cycle the black panel temperature is controlled at 702 C. The relative humidity in the light cycle is in the range of 50-55% and in the dark cycle 100%. The absorbance of the long wavelength UV band as a function of Xenon arc weathering hours are recorded. To follow the loss of UV absorbers from the clear coats, UV spectra are measured initially and after weathering at regular time intervals. The UV spectrophotometer measures absorbance linearly up to 5.5 absorbance units using a reference beam attenuation technique. It is assumed that the degradation products from the UV absorber do not contribute to the UV spectrum. This is tested by following the ratio of absorbance of the band at about 300 nm and the band at about 340 nm. The ratio does not change upon weathering the sample, This suggests that the UV spectrum of the weathered films correspond to the amount of UV absorber remaining in the film with very little if any contribution to the spectrum by photo degradants. Representative bisbenzotriazole test compounds are incorporated into a high solid thermoset acrylic melamine resin at concentrations between 1.93 and 3% by weight to give equal molar concentrations of the test benzotriazole in equal film thickness and sufficient to give a starting absorbance of approximately 2.0 absorbance units. The test samples are exposed for 2000 hours. The test shows that the instant bisbenzotriazoles are especially durable in automotive coatings as judged by low loss rates. What is claimed is: 1.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The compounds of the present invention have a novel structure characterised by the combination of an aminotriazole group, a hydrazide structure and an aromatic-type spacer. The compounds are used in the treatment of pathologies associated with the neuropeptide Y (NPY). DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Various NPY receptor ligands have been described recently. By way of example, there may be mentioned cyclic peptide compounds (WO 9400486), amino acid compounds of arginine (WO 9417035) or non-peptide compounds (WO 9827063). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a peptide of 36 amino acids, related to the peptide YY (PYY) and to pancreatic polypeptides (PP). Originally isolated from pig brain (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 1982, 79, 5485), NPY is widely distributed in mammals at the level of the central and peripheral nervous systems. This neurotransmitter is present in high concentrations in nerve fibres of the brain, but also of the heart, the sympathetic ganglia, blood vessels and smooth muscles of the vas deferens and of the gastrointestinal tract. It is responsible for various physiological effects which are exerted via the intermediary of specific receptors (Y). The latter form a heterogeneous group, 6 sub-types of which have been identified to date: Y 1 to Y 6 (Pharmacological Reviews, 1998, 50, 143). NPY is involved in eating behaviour by strongly stimulating food intake (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 1985, 82, 3940), or by exerting a regulatory role on the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis (J. of Neuroendocrinol., 1995, 7, 273). It also exhibits anxiolytic and sedative properties (Neuropsychopharmacology, 1993, 8, 357), a strong vasoconstrictive ability (Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1984, 85, 519) which induces an increase in blood pressure, and also has an effect on the circadian rhythm (Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 1995, 19, 349). In addition to the fact that the compounds of the invention are new, they have demonstrated an in vivo inhibitory action on food intake and weight gain. That effect is exerted via the intermediary of binding to the NPY receptors. It will thus be possible to use the compounds of the invention in the treatment of pathologies in which an NPY receptor ligand is necessary, especially in the treatment of pathologies associated with eating behaviour disorders or energy balance disorders, such as diabetes, obesity, bulimia, anorexia nervosa, and also in the treatment of arterial hypertension, anxiety, depression, epilepsy sexual dysfunctions and sleep disorders.

Pharmacological Study EXAMPLE A Measurement of the Effect on Food Intake and Weight Development in the Obese Mouse The compounds of the invention were administered in vivo to the obese ob/ob mouse in order to evaluate their influence on food intake and weight development. The animals used are 13- to 18-week-old female ob/ob C57B1/6J mice. They are divided into groups each comprising 4 animals per cage, the cages being fitted with a grating floor, and the mice having free access to food. Before the experiments, the animals are conditioned for a period ranging from 2 to 3 weeks until their food consumption has stabilised. The experiments may be summarised as follows: D14 to D7: conditioning D7 to D3: measurement of the basal food intake D0 to D3: animals treated twice daily, the control groups being given the carrier D0 to D4: daily measurement of food intake and body weight. The test compounds are dissolved, immediately before use, in water, 0.9% sodium chloride, propylene glycol or dimethyl sulphoxide, depending upon their solubility, and are administered intraperitoneally (IP), in a volume of 2.5 ml/kg. The parameters measured are the food intake and the body weight. Results The results are expressed as percentage variation in food intake under treatment compared with the basal food intake; percentage variation in body weight between the first and last day of treatment. By way of example, the results obtained with the compounds of Examples 1 and 6 are as follows Food intake Body weight % variation (D1) % variation Product Dose (mg/kg) Control Treated (D4/D0) Example 1 1 34 45 6.4 Example 6 5 23 34 11.2 EXAMPLE B Meaurement of the in vitro Affinity for NPY Receptors The capacity of the compounds of the invention to bind to NPY receptors was measured on various cell lines, each expressing one of the receptor sub-types studied. Competition binding experiments were carried out using the peptide 125 I-PYY as radioligand at concentrations ranging from 15 to 65 pM. The non-specific fraction is measured in the presence of a concentration of 1 M NPY. The cells are incubated for a period ranging from 1 to 2 hours depending upon the lines, and the radioactivity is collected after filtration over a GF/C filter treated with 0.1% PEI, before being measured. Results The results are expressed as IC 50 . The compounds of the invention appear to be capable of significantly displacing the reference ligand: the IC 50 values vary from a few nanomoles to some hundreds of nanomoles. By way of example, the compounds of Examples 1 and 6 have an IC 50 value of 80 nM and 7 nM, respectively, for the Y 5 receptor. EXAMPLE C Acute Toxicity Study Acute toxicity was evaluated after oral administration of increasing doses of the test compound to groups each comprising 8 mice (266 grams). The animals were observed at regular intervals over the course of the first day and daily for the two weeks following treatment. The compounds of the invention appear to be not very toxic at all.

The cyclopropylglycine derivative shows a selectivity higher than that of the known agonists to metabotropic L-glutamate receptors, and therefore is a metabotropic type agonist to L-glutamate which has excellent characteristics. This application is a CIP of application Ser. No. 09/214,108 filed Dec. 28, 1998 now abandoned. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel cyclopropylglycine derivatives and an agonist comprising the derivative as an active compound. The agonist acts on metabotropic L-glutamate receptors. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Glutamate receptors are roughly categorized into two types, namely, ionotropic type (iGluR) and metabotropic type (mGluR). The receptors of ionotropic type (iGluR) are further categorized into NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid) type and non-NMDA type Jpn. J. Neuropsychopharmacol., 18(5), 345-365 (1996). When NMDA receptors are activated with agonists, they introduce calcium ions (Ca 2 ) into cells to increase the intracellular Ca 2 concentration. In the cells, accordingly, various Ca 2 -dependent enzymes are activated to cause a chain of cellular changes. If the cellular changes proceed over a certain threshold value, the cell is presumed to lose irreversibly its life Folia Pharmacol. Jpn., No. 104, 177-187 (1994). The metabotropic L-glutamate receptors (mGluR) are classified into three groups (Groups-I, -II and -III) based on their sequence homology, intracellular signal transduction pathway, and selectivity of agonists for receptor sub-types. A typical example of the agonist for Group-I is quisqualic acid, which promotes formation of inositol triphosphate (IP 3 ) and variations of intracellular Ca 2 dynamics. The agonists for Group-II and Group-III inhibit intracellular CAMP formation induced by forskolin. In the agonist selectivity, the mGluR of Group-II differs from that of Group-III. Examples of the agonists for mGluR of Group-II include DCG-IV (2S,1R,2R,3R)-2-(2,3-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine and L-CCG-I (2S,1S,2S)-2-(2-carboxycyclopropyl)glycine. Examples of the agonists for mGlu R of Group-III include L-AP4 L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid Japanese Patent Provisional Publications No. 6(1994)-256323 and No. 6(1994)-24970, and Jpn. J. Neuropsychopharmacol., 18(6), 419-425 (1996). The agonists for mGluR of Group-II are known to inhibit release of transmitter at synapses, and consequently to lower the efficiency of synaptic conduction. If the synaptic transmission efficiency is lowered in the central nervous system, the muscles in the kinetic system are presumed to be relaxed. Actually, it has been ascertained by experiments on animals that the agonists for mGluR of Group-II remarkably potentiate anesthesia. These agonists are also known to give sedation (or tranquilizer-like) effect and anti-epileptic effect. Further, since these agonists can protect the neurons cells from death in vivo and in vitro caused by excitatory amino acids, they are expected to be used as neuron protectors. Since the agonists for mGluR of Group-II are utterly new agonists for glutamate receptors and seem to be indispensable for pharmaceutical studies of the central nervous system, they are of great value as reagents for the laboratory study. Folia Pharmacol. Jpn., No. 104, 177-187 (1994). DCG-IV (which is one of the known agonists for mGluR of Group-II) strongly activates the mGluR, and is hence expected to act as a neuron protector. However, since DCG-IV also activates NMDA receptors (which are presumed to be concerned with cell death caused by excitatory amino acids), it is desired to develop a new agonist for mGluR having no NMDA activating component. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel cyclopropylglycine derivative having better selectivity and characteristics than known agonists for glutamic acid receptors of metabolic regulation type. It is another object of the invention to provide a new compound employable as an intermediate for preparing the novel cyclopropylglycine derivative. This invention resides in a cyclopropylglycine derivative having the following formula (I). In the formula (I), each of R 1 and R 2 independently represents a hydroxyl group or an alkoxy group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, each of R 3 and R 4 independently represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and each of X 1 and X 2 independently represents a halogen atom. The invention also resides in an agonist which acts on L-glutamic acid receptors of metabolic regulation type and which comprises the cyclopropylglycine derivative having the formula (I) as an active component. Further, the invention resides in a pharmaceutical composition comprising the cyclopropylglycine derivative having the formula (I) as an active component. The intermediate provided by the invention is a lactam derivative having the following formula (II). In the formula (II), R 2 represents a hydroxyl group or an alkoxy group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, R 3 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and each of X 1 and X 2 independently represents a halogen atom. PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The cyclopropylglycine derivative of the invention has the following formula (I): In the formula (I), each of R 1 and R 2 independently represents a hydroxyl group or an alkoxy group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, and isobutoxy), each of R 3 and R 4 independently represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms (e.g., methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, and isobutyl), and each of X 1 and X 2 independently represents a halogen atom (e.g., fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). The cyclopropylglycine derivative of the invention can be used in the form of a free acid or its salt.

Pharmacological Experiments (1) Action on metabotropic L-glutamate receptors (mGluR) of Group-I Evaluation of depolarization activity In accordance with Shinozakis method Shinozaki et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 98, 1213-1224(1989), the depolarization activities of the above-prepared compounds were measured using spinal specimen enucleated from neonatal rats. With respect to each of the compounds of the invention hydrochlorides of L-I to IV, and D-I to IV and optical isomers of CCG 2-(carboxycyclopropyl)glycine, which was a known agonist for mGluR, the measurement was carried out in the following manner. Under perfusing an artificial cerebrospinal fluid including 0.5 M of tetrodotoxin, depolarization at the ventral root of the spinal cord was caused by the test compound, and extracellularly recorded. The measurement was repeated in the range of 10 3 to 10 7 M of the test compound, and thereby the minimal effective concentration (MEC) was estimated. The activity of each compound was determined on the basis of the ratio of the MEC of the test compound to that of the corresponding optical isomer of COG. The results are set forth in Table 1. TABLE 1 Ratio of the activity of each compound based on that of the corresponding optical isomer of CCG I II III IV L 3 0.3 2 1.5 D 1.5 0.1 0.1 0.01 TABLE 2 Minimal effective concentration (M) of the corresponding optical isomer of CCG I II III IV L 2 200 100 0.3 D 3 0.1 300 5 When 310 5 M of an NMDA antagonist (CPP 3-(RS)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-ylpropyl-1-phosphoric acid or D-AP5 D()-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid) was added to the artificial cerebrospinal fluid, it was confirmed that the depolarization activities of L-I and L-II are hardly affected by the NMDA antagonist. It was also confirmed that L-I causes NMDA-like depolarization at the magnitude of approx.1/33 based on that caused by known DCG-IV (2S,1R,2R,3R)-2-(2,3-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine. This means that the depolarization caused by L-I is practically negligible. When 100 M of an NMDA antagonist (D-AP5) and 100 M of a non-NMDA antagonist (CNQX 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) were incorporated into the artificial cerebrospinal fluid, it was confirmed that the depolarization activities of L-I and -II are hardly reduced by these antagonists although those of L-III, L-IV and D-I to D-IV are inhibited. Furthermore, when 1 mM of an antagonist for mGluR of Group I MCPG, (RS)--methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine was incorporated into the artificial cerebrospinal fluid, it was confirmed that the depolarization activities of L-I and L-II are inhibited by the antagonist. (2) Action on metabotropic L-glutamate receptors(mGluRs) of Group-II Evaluation of the inhibitory activity on monosynaptic reflex In accordance with Ohtsukas method Ohtsuka M., Seitai no Kagaku, 36(4), 325-327, the monosynaptic reflex inhibitory activities of the above-prepared compounds were measured using spinal cord specimen enucleated from neonatal rats in the following manner. The spinal cord was enucleated together with the vertebral column from a neonatal Wistar rat anesthetized with ether, and soaked in an artificial cerebrospinal fluid saturated with a mixed gas of O 2 and CO 2 (95%: 5%). In the artificial cerebrospinal fluid, the spinal cord in the vertebral column was sectioned under a microscope to prepare a spinal cord specimen having the ventral and dorsal roots of L3 to L5. The prepared sample was set in the perfusion system, and then the artificial cerebrospinal fluid saturated with the above mixed gas was made to flow. The test compound was added into the perfusion liquid, and the monosynaptic reflex was measured by the steps of giving a pulse to the dorsal root through an suction electrode, recording the reflex potential at the ventral root, and observing a rapidly responding spike (corresponding to the monosynaptic reflex) and delayed depolarization with nonsynchronous potential drift. The measurement was repeated except that the concentration of the test compound was varied, and thereby the minimal effective concentration (MEC) was estimated. This experiment revealed that the MEC of L-CCG-I (a known agonist for mGluR) is 0.2 M and that the cyclopropylglycine derivative L-I of the invention inhibits the spinal monosynaptic reflex three times as strong as L-CCG-I. Further, the measurement was repeated except that 0.3 mM of an antagonist for mGluR of Group II MCCG-I, (2S,3S, 4S)--methyl-2-(2-carboxycyclopropyl)glycine was incorporated into the artificial cerebrospinal fluid. By this measurement, it was confirmed that the inhibitory activities on the monosynaptic reflex of L-I and L-II are vanished by the antagonist. (3) Summary of pharmacological actions belonging to cyclopropylglycine derivatives of the invention 1) The depolarization activity of L-I was slightly (5%) inhibited by 100 M of D-AP5 (NMDA antagonist), hardly inhibited by CNQX (non-NMDA antagonist), and completely inhibited by 1 mM of MCPG (antagonist for mGluR of Group I). Further, L-I reduced the spinal monosynaptic reflex, but this action was inhibited by MCCG (antagonist for mGluR of Group II). Those results of the experiments indicate that L-I works as an agonist for mGluRs of both Groups-I and -II, and the minimal effective concentration (MEC) suggests that the agonistic effect for Group-II is predominant to that for Group-I. 2) L-II was insensitive to CNQX (non-NMDA antagonist), and hence is presumed to be an agonist for mGluR of Group-I. 3) L-III, L-IV and all D-isomers are presumed to be NMDA agonists. 4) L-III lacks the activity for inhibiting the transporter for glutamic acid although L-CCG-III has that activity.

redistribution from MeHSiCl 2 and Me 3 HSiCl in the presence of a catalyst such as AlCl 3 , which can start a parasitic disproportionation which affects the AHHS produced. In order to avoid this, the method consists in using an inhibitor which neutralizes AlCl 3 after redistribution, The problem which still prevails and on which the present invention is based is related to the fact that during distillation, which aims at separating the required AHHS, the latter are again subjected to the parasitic disproportionation. In order to solve this problem, the invention proposes a method for preparing AHHS comprising steps (a) of redistribution, (b) use of an inhibitor of AlCl 3 and (c) separating and collecting by distillation AHHS formed in the raw reaction mixture of redistribution using three distillation columns I, II,III and proceeding in such a way that, at least in one part of the distillation circuit, the AHHS aimed at are in the presence of the AlCl 3 inhibitor.

The process comprises reacting at least a first nitrogen compound and a second nitrogen compound with a carbonyl compound in the presence of a reducing agent to form a product comprising at least two nitrogen groups; wherein the carbonyl compound comprises at least two carbonyl groups, the first nitrogen compound comprises a first nitrogen group reactive with one carbonyl group of the carbonyl compound and the second nitrogen compound comprises a second nitrogen group reactive with the other (or another) carbonyl group of the carbonyl compound, and wherein at least the first nitrogen compound or at least the second nitrogen compound comprises at least one other functional group. The process is especially suitable for the preparation of (S,S)-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS) of formula (1). The present invention relates to an alkylation process. In particular, the present invention relates to a process for alkylating amino acids. More in particular, the present invention relates to a process for the N-alkylation of amino acids, and especially a process for preparing (S,S)-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid or a salt thereof. Certain compounds having amino acid moieties linked by a group joining their nitrogen atoms have a variety of uses mainly based on their metal chelating properties. Typical examples include their use as corrosion inhibitors, and in detergents, photographic developing solutions, rubber and resin formulations and metal treatments. One particular example is ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS) which has two chiral centres. The S,S-enantiomer of EDDS is preferred because of its biodegradability and its better chelating properties. EDDS is shown in FIG. 1 . Racemic EDDS is usually prepared by the reaction of maleic anhydride with ethylenediamine in NaOH solution, according to the procedure by W. M. Ramsey and C. Kerzerian of the Stauffer Chemical Company, U.S. Pat. No. 3,158,635. (S,S)-EDDS can be manufactured by a variety of different routes. A typical route is the reaction of NaOH with L-aspartic acid and dibromoethane following the protocol of Neal, J. A. and Rose, N. J. (Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 7, No. 11, November 1968, pages 2405-2412, particularly page 2406). However, even though this synthetic route is the one that is typically used it is usually difficult to obtain economic yields of (S,S)-EDDS. Furthermore it is difficult to obtain highly pure (S,S)-EDDS. The present invention seeks to overcome the problems associated with the known processes. In particular, the present invention seeks to provide a process that enables compounds like EDDS, more especially (S,S)-EDDS, to be prepared in high yields, economic yields and/or high purity. According to the present invention there is provided an alkylation process comprising reacting at least a first nitrogen compound and a second nitrogen compound with a carbonyl compound in the presence of a reducing agent to form a product comprising at least two nitrogen groups; wherein the carbonyl compound comprises at least two carbonyl groups, the first nitrogen compound comprises a first nitrogen group reactive with one carbonyl group of the carbonyl compound and the second nitrogen compound comprises a second nitrogen group reactive with the other (or another) carbonyl group of the carbonyl compound, and wherein at least the first nitrogen compound or at least the second nitrogen compound comprises at least one other functional group. There are a number of advantages associated with the present invention. For example, it enables compounds like EDDS, more especially (S,S)-EDDS, to be prepared in high yields. It also enables compounds like EDDS, more especially (S,S)-EDDS, to be prepared in economic yields. It also enables compounds like EDDS, more especially (S,S)-EDDS, to be prepared at a high purity. The present invention also provides a reliable process for preparing optically active compounds, such as (S,S)-EDDS, by use of a substantially aqueous reaction medium/media. Furthermore, the present invention provides a process that allows reduction in situ without requiring the need to isolate any intermediates in the reaction process. In some cases the intermediate or intermediates could be isolated, but preferably the intermediate or intermediates is/are not isolated. In the process of the present invention the first nitrogen compound and/or the second nitrogen compound can comprise more than one additional nitrogen group, which need not be reactive with the carbonyl groups of the carbonyl compound. Also, in the process of the present invention an additional nitrogen compound or additional nitrogen compounds may be reacted. Also, an additional carbonyl compound or additional carbonyl compounds may be reacted, which carbonyl compound or carbonyl compounds can independently comprise one or more carbonyl groups. Also, a mixture of reducing agents may be used in the process of the present invention. In addition, at least the first nitrogen compound and/or at least the second nitrogen compound can comprise an additional functional group or additional functional groups. Other reactive compounds may be present in the reaction medium. Preferably the first nitrogen group and the second nitrogen group are independently selected from a primary amine group or a secondary amine group. Preferably each of the first nitrogen group and the second nitrogen group is a primary amine group, which may be the same or different. Preferably the functional group is an acid group. Preferably the acid group is a carboxylic acid group. Preferably at least the first nitrogen compound or at least the second nitrogen compound comprises at least one chiral centre. More preferably at least the first nitrogen compound and at least the second nitrogen compound comprises at least one chiral centre. Preferably the first nitrogen compound or the second nitrogen compound comprises 1-20 carbon atoms, more preferably 1-12 carbon atoms. Preferably the first nitrogen compound or the second nitrogen compound is an amino acid. Typical amino acids for use in the process of the present invention include any one or more of the 26 or so naturally occurring amino acids listed in standard textbooks, including the derivatives thereof. The amino acid may be any one or more of a neutral amino acid, a basic amino acid or an acidic amino acid. However, preferably the amino acid for use in the process of the present invention is not cysteine. This is because this amino acid has an -SH group which could undergo unwanted side reactions. In the process of the present invention an amino acid having an -amino group (e.g. aspartic acid) can be reacted. Alternatively, or in addition, in the process of the present invention an amino acid having a -amino group (e.g. -alanine) can be reacted. Examples of neutral amino acids that may be used in the present invention include glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, norleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, serine, cystine, threonine, methionine, di-iodotyrosine, thyroxine, dibromotyrosine, tryptophan, proline and hydroxyproline. Examples of basic amino acids that may be used in the present invention include ornithine, arginine, lysine and histidine. Examples of acidic amino acids that may be used in the process of the present invention include aspartic acid, glutamic acid and -hydroxyglutainic acid. The preferred amino acids for the process of the present invention are those with two carboxyl groups and one amino groupi.e. the acidic amino acids listed above. Aspartic acid and glutamic acid are the most preferred of the three. Specific optical isomers, particularly the L-form, are desirable because they increase biodegradability and in some cases, may also improve the chelating effect. Preferably, therefore, the first nitrogen compound or the second nitrogen compound is an acidic amino acid. Preferably the first nitrogen compound or the second nitrogen compound is aspartic acid. Preferably the first nitrogen compound or the second nitrogen compound is an L-amino acid. Preferably the first nitrogen compound or the second nitrogen compound is L-aspartic acid. Alternatively, other amino acids may be reacted in the process of the present invention, such as D- or DL- amino acids, for example D-aspartic acid or DL-aspartic acid, to generate corresponding R,R- or racemic products having at least two nitrogen groups, such as R,R- or racemic EDDS. Preferably the first nitrogen compound is the same as the second nitrogen compound. Preferably at least one of the carbonyl groups of the carbonyl compound is an aldehyde group or a ketone group. Preferably at least one of the carbonyl groups of the carbonyl compound is an aldehyde group or a ketone group, and wherein at least one other of the carbonyl groups of the carbonyl compound is an aldehyde group or a ketone group. Preferably at least one carbonyl group is an aldehyde group. Preferably the carbonyl compound comprises two carbonyl groupsi.e. the carbonyl compound is a di-carbonyl compound. Preferably the carbonyl groups of the carbonyl compound are the same. Preferably the carbonyl compound is a di-aldehyde. Preferably the carbonyl groups of the carbonyl compound are attached to each other or to groups independently selected from any one of saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched or cyclic aliphatic groups (preferably C 1-20 , more preferably C 1-12 ) or aromatic groups (preferably C 1-20 , more preferably C 1-12 ). More preferably the at least two carbonyl groups of the carbonyl compound are attached to each other. Preferably the carbonyl compound is glyoxal. Preferably the reducing agent is any one of hydrogen and a hydrogenation catalyst, Zn/HCl, sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium borohydride, iron pentacarbonyl and alcoholic KOH, or formic acid, or combinations thereof. The process of the present invention can be conducted at any appropriate pH condition. Preferably, though, the process is conducted at a pH in the range of 7-14, more preferably in the range of 9-14 and even more preferably in the range 11-14. The pH may be maintained with alkali (i.e. a base), typically aq. NaOH solution, though a wide variety of water-soluble inorganic and organic bases may be used. In some instances, it will be desirable to add alkali during the reaction. The reaction medium is normally wholly aqueous but the presence of other solvents such as ethanol is not excluded. In some circumstances, alkali (base) may be provided wholly or in part by other components of the reaction medium, particularly when the first nitrogen compound and/or the second nitrogen compound is(are) in salt form. Typically the alkylated product will be generally less soluble than the starting reactants so that the reaction mixture can be diluted to a level at which remaining starting reactant or reactants is(are) soluble, followed by acidification and selective crystallisation of the desired product. Preferably, therefore, the first nitrogen compound and the second nitrogen compound are reacted with the carbonyl compound in an alkaline medium. Preferably the first nitrogen compound and the second nitrogen compound are reacted with the carbonyl compound before addition of the reducing agent. Preferably the product comprising at least two nitrogen groups contains at least one chiral centre, preferably at least two chiral centres. Preferably the carbonyl compound is prepared in situ in the reaction medium. Preferably the product comprising at least two nitrogen groups is EDDS. Preferably the product comprising at least two nitrogen groups is (S,S)-EDDS. The product comprising at least two nitrogen groups may be prepared in salt form by the process of the present invention. Typically, though more preferred for the preparation of (S,S)-EDDS via the reaction of L-aspartic acid with glyoxal and subsequent reduction, the reaction solution of the present invention is preferably acidified with HCl to a pH of between 2 and 5, preferably 2-3 with cooling, for the desired product to crystallise out. The following table presents some preferred parameters for the present invention. Parameters General Range Preferred Range Ratio of N1 N2:CC:RA 1:0.5-8:0.5-4 1:0.8-2:0.8-2 pH 6-14 11-14 Reaction temperature 5 to 65 C. 5 to 40 C.

A preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to an alkylation process comprising reacting at least a first amino acid and a second amino acid with a carbonyl compound in the presence of a reducing agent to form a product comprising at least two nitrogen groups; wherein the carbonyl compound comprises at least two carbonyl groups. With this preferred embodiment, the process of the present invention may include the reaction of an aldehyde or a ketone with an amine as defined in the claims in the presence of hydrogen and a hydrogenation catalyst, whereby reductive alkylation of ammonia or the amine (or reductive amination of the carbonyl compound) takes place. Other reducing agents can be used instead of hydrogen and a catalyst, such as Zn/HCl, sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium borohydride, iron pentacarbonyl and alcoholic KOH, and formic acid. A highly preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to an alkylation process comprising reacting L-aspartic acid with glyoxal in the presence of a reducing agent to form (S,S)-EDDS. Thus, with this highly preferred embodiment, the process of the present invention involves the reductive N-alkylation of amino acids with glyoxal (a dialdehyde) to form a derivative which contains two molecules of the amino acid, linked together through the two nitrogen atoms by an ethyl chain. More specifically, the highly preferred process of the present invention involves reacting L-aspartic acid in aqueous alkaline media with glyoxal, a dialdehyde, to form the corresponding intermediate, which is subsequently reduced with sodium borohydride. From an economic viewpoint, unreacted L-aspartic acid can be recycled. The use of alternate reducing agents such as hydrogen/catalyst is more economically viable. The preferred order of addition is that of the glyoxal to the sodium L-aspartate, followed by the addition of the sodium borohydride. Further glyoxal and sodium borohydride may be added as required. As mentioned above, the carbonyl compound can be prepared in situ in the reaction medium. In this regard, a primary alcohol may be oxidised to the corresponding aldehyde by use of a reduced copper catalyst. The primary alcohol could even be subjected to the catalysed reduction in the presence of an amine. The resultant aldehyde can then be reacted with an amine to form an N-alkylamine by hydrogenolysis (such as in situ hydrogenolysis) of the intermediate. These postulated reaction schemes are presented below: RCH 2 OH RCHO H 2 RNH 2 RCHO RNHCH(OH)R RNHCH(OH)R H 2 RNHCH 2 R H 2 O wherein R represents a suitable alkyl (which may be any one of saturated, unsaturated, unsubstituted, substituted, linear or branched) or aryl group (unsubstituted or substituted). For the process of the present invention, the primary alcohol could be ethylene glycol which could be oxidised to glyoxal with the reduced copper catalyst. Further reaction with L-aspartic acid produces (S,S)-EDDS under the hydrogenolysis conditions. The present invention will now be described only by way of example, in which reference shall be made to the following Figures: FIG. 1 is a representation of EDDS; and FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of the preparation of EDDS by the process according to the present invention. In the following examples, the term conversion refers to the weight of amino acid (i.e. the nitrogen compound) reacted (to form any product) divided by the weight of amino acid present initially 100%. The term selectivity refers to the weight of amino acid reacted to form the desired product divided by the total amount of amino acid reacted 100%. EXAMPLE 1 L-Aspartic acid (5.26 g, 39.5 mmoles) was placed in a reaction flask, followed by distilled water (50 ml). The pH was adjusted to 11.6 with sodium hydroxide solution (6.31 g, 78.8 mmoles, 50% w/w) and glyoxal (5.71 g, 39.4 mmoles, 40 wt % solution in water) was added. After 15 minutes, the solution was cooled (ice/water bath) and sodium borohydride (1.69 g, 44.7 mmoles) was added portion-wise over 1.5 hours. HPLC analysis after this time indicated a yield of 49% (2.81 g) (S,S)-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid on L-aspartic acid. Acidification of the solution to pH 2.7 with HCl resulted in the formation of solids. After 1 hour, the slurry was filtered and the solids were washed with water. The mother liquors and washings were combined and the cake was slurried in water and basified to pH 9.5. HPLC analysis indicated that the mother liquors and washings contained 2.32 g L-asp and 0.14 g (S,S)-EDDS, and the cake contained 0.07 g L-asp and 2.6 g (S,S)-EDDS. This relates to an isolated yield of (S,S)-EDDS of 45%. The conversion of L-aspartic acid was 54.5% and the selectivity to (S,S)-EDDS was 87%. The general reaction scheme is shown in FIG. 2 . EXAMPLE 2 L-Aspartic acid (5.39 g, 40.5 mmoles) was placed in a reaction flask, followed by distilled water (50 ml). The pH was adjusted to 13.53 with sodium hydroxide solution (50% w/w) and glyoxal (5.89 g, 40.6 mmoles, 40 wt % solution in water) was added. After 15 minutes, the solution was cooled (ice/water bath) and sodium borohydride (1.74 g, 46 mmoles) was added portion-wise over 2 hours. HPLC analysis after this time indicated a yield of 56% (S,S)-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid on L-aspartic acid. Acidification with HCl to pH 2.6 afforded an isolated yield of 52% (S,S)-EDDS. The conversion of L-aspartic acid was 63% and the selectivity to (S,S)-EDDS was 90%. The general reaction scheme is shown in FIG. 2 . EXAMPLE 3 L-Aspartic acid (5.26 g, 39.5 mmoles) was placed in a reaction flask, followed by distilled water (50 ml). The pH was adjusted to 13.5 with sodium hydroxide solution (7.71 g, 96.4 mmoles, 50% w/w) and glyoxal (5.71 g, 39.4 mmoles, 40 wt % solution in water) was added. After 1 hour, the solution was cooled to 0 C. (ice/water bath) and sodium borohydride (1.68 g, 44.4 mmoles) was added portion-wise over 15 minutes. The temperature rose to 12 C. HPLC analysis after this time indicated a yield of 58.4% (3.37 g) (S,S)-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid on L-aspartic acid. The conversion of L-aspartic acid was 70.5% and the selectivity to (S,S)-EDDS was 83%. The general reaction scheme is shown in FIG. 2 . EXAMPLE 4 The following table presents some preferred parameters for one aspect of the highly preferred embodiment of the present invention. Parameters General Range Preferred Range Ratio of L-asp:glyoxal:NaBH 4 1:0.5-8:0.5-4 1:0.8-2:0.8-2 pH 6-14 11-14 Reaction temperature 5 to 65 C. 5 to 40 C.

Time of NaBH 4 addition 5 min-8 hrs 15 min-4 hrs In summation, the present invention provides a novel and inventive process for preparing compounds such as EDDS, more especially (S,S)-EDDS. The process of the present invention is very different from the known reactions of glyoxal with an amino acid which have been described in gel formation reactions and to produce browning in the food industry.

This is the US National Stage Application of PCT/EP97/03029 filed Jun. 11, 1997. The present invention relates to a process for preparing a compound of the formula I where R 1 and R 2 are hydrogen or C 1 -C 4 -alkyl and R 3 is C 1 -C 10 -alkyl, phenyl or C 1 -C 4 -alkyl-substituted phenyl. Indanones of the general formula I are important precursors for metallocene complexes which are used as polymerization catalysts. For this purpose, the indanones are reduced and dehydrated; the resulting indene derivatives can be reacted with transition metals to give the corresponding metallocene complexes. Various processes for preparing substituted indanones are known. EP-A1 549 900 describes the synthesis of a substituted benzindanone. In this case, the five-membered ring is constructed in a multistage synthesis by reaction with a malonic ester, alkaline hydrolysis of the diester, thermal decarboxylation, chlorination of the remaining carboxyl group and intramolecular Friedel-Crafts acylation. Owing to its large number of stages, the synthesis is technically very elaborate. EP-A1 567 953 describes a synthesis of indanone derivatives in which the five-membered ring is constructed by reacting an appropriate benzene derivative with a substituted acrylic ester in liquid hydrogen fluoride. EP-A1 587 107 describes the preparation of 2-methylbenzindanone by reacting naphthalene with methacrylic anhydride in the presence of BF 3 /hydrogen fluoride. These synthetic routes are also associated with considerable technical complexity because of the difficulty of handling extremely toxic hydrofluoric acid. Another synthetic route for indanones is described in EP-A1 545 304. In this case, preparation takes place by reacting a benzene derivative with a-haloalkylpropionyl halides, preferably with a-bromoisobutyryl bromide. The disadvantage of this synthesis is the large amount of halogen-containing waste produced. It is an object of the present invention to find a simple synthetic route for preparing benzindanones of the general formula I which overcomes the disadvantages of the known synthetic routes. We have found that this object is achieved by a process for preparing a compound of the formula I where R 1 and R 2 are hydrogen or C 1 -C 4 -alkyl and R 3 is C 1 -C 10 -alkyl, phenyl or C 1 -C 4 -alkyl-substituted phenyl, which comprises reacting a compound II with a compound of the formula III where X is chlorine, bromine or iodine, in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts catalyst in one step to give a compound I. Reaction of compound II with a compound III may result in various isomers. However, the process according to the invention displays a pronounced regioselectivity so that usually only isomer I is observed. In the indanone derivatives I which can be prepared by the process according to the invention, the substituents R 1 and R 2 may, besides hydrogen, be, for example, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl or tert-butyl, with hydrogen being particularly preferred. Among the alkyl radicals, isopropyl should be particularly mentioned, but preferably only one of the radicals R 1 or R 2 is an alkyl radical. The substituent R 3 is introduced via compound III into the target compounds. R 3 is preferably methyl or ethyl, particularly preferably methyl, but other C 1 -C 10 -alkyl radicals, the phenyl radical or C 1 -C 4 -alkyl-substituted phenyl radicals are also suitable. Suitable C 1 -C 10 -alkyl radicals are, besides the abovementioned C 1 -C 4 -alkyls, also the various isomeric pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl and decyl radicals. Suitable phenyl radicals are, besides the preferred unsubstituted phenyl radical, in particular phenyl radicals monosubstituted by methyl or ethyl. The radical X in the compound III can be chlorine, bromine or iodine, and is preferably chlorine. The catalyst used in the process according to the invention is a Friedel-Crafts catalyst. Suitable Friedel-Crafts catalysts are all conventional catalysts of this type, for example AlCl 3 , AlBr 3 , BF 3 , ZnCl 2 , FeCl 3 , SnCl 4 and SbCl 5 , preferably AlCl 3 . The Friedel-Crafts catalyst, especially AlCl 3 , is generally employed in excess, preferably in an amount such that the molar ratio of catalyst to compound III is from 1 to 2, particularly preferably from 1 to 1.5, very particularly preferably from 1.05 to 1.3. All conventional Friedel-Crafts solvents are suitable for the process according to the invention, although carbon disulfide is not very suitable, for example, because of its toxicity. Particularly suitable solvents are chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane and chlorobenzene, particularly preferably methylene chloride. The reaction is preferably carried out at from 30 to 0 C., particularly preferably from 20 to 10 C. However, at the end of the reaction, the temperature can be raised to complete the ring-closure reaction, eg. to 10-40 C., preferably to 20-30 C. The pressure generally has a negligible effect on the reaction so that it is normally carried out under atmospheric pressure. The process according to the invention is distinguished by simple technical manipulation (one-stage process) and small amounts of halogen-containing waste produced. In addition, it displays excellent regioselectivity and affords the required products in very good yields. The following example illustrates the invention: EXAMPLE Preparation of Freshly powdered aluminum chloride (13 g, 97 mmol) was dissolved in 42 ml of CH 2 Cl 2 and cooled to 15 C. Methacryloyl chloride (97%, 8 ml, 8.6 g, 81 mmol) was added dropwise at such a rate that the temperature did not exceed 10 C. A solution of 10.4 g of naphthalene (81 mmol) in 42 ml of CH 2 Cl 2 was then added dropwise at such a rate that the temperature did not exceed 10 C. The solution was stirred at 15 C. for 2 h and at room temperature for 2 h and then hydrolyzed with 300 ml of ice-water. Precipitated aluminum hydroxide gel was dissolved with a little HCl, and the organic phase was removed. The aqueous phase was then extracted three times with 80 ml of CH 2 Cl 2 , and the combined organic phases were washed with saturated NaHCO 3 solution and then with saturated NaCl solution and dried over Na 2 SO 4 . The residue after evaporation of the CH 2 Cl 2 was taken up in ethyl acetate and purified by filtration through a short silica gel column. Renewed evaporation of the solvent afforded a reddish viscous oil which slowly became solid. The 1 H-NMR spectrum was consistent with the literature data (EP 0 545 304). Formation of the isomeric 2-methyl-4,5-benzoindan-3-one, which was also produced in the synthesis in EP 0 545 304, and of 2-methyl-5,6-benzoindan-1-one was not observed. Yield: 15.1 g. We claim: 1.

This application is a 371 of PCT/EP99/00954, filed Feb. 13, 1999. DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to processes for selective hydrolysis of acetals and ketals in the presence of phthalides, which comprise reacting a mixture (M) comprising a) a phthalide of the formula (I) where: R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 : are independently hydrogen, C 1 -C 4 -alkyl or halogen, and b) an acetal or ketal of the formula (II) where: R 5 and R 6 : are independently C 1 -C 6 -alkyl, C 6 -C 10 -aryl or together ethylene, and R 7 and R 8 : are independently C 1 -C 6 -alkyl, or one radical is a hydrogen and the other is a phenyl radical where from 1 to 3 hydrogen atoms of the phenyl radical may be replaced by C 1 -C 6 -alkyl radicals or C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy radicals, or R 7 and R 8 are together C 3 -C 6 -alkanediyl, and a hydrogen atom may be replaced by a hydroxyl group, at from 10 to 200 C. in the presence of from 1 to 10 mol of water, based on the amount of acetal or ketal of the formula (II), to hydrolyze the acetal or ketal of the formula (II) to the corresponding aldehyde or ketone. The present invention further relates to an overall process for preparing purified phthalides and aldehydes or ketones, of which the selective hydrolysis is an integral part and wherein a compound (III) selected from the group consisting of phthalic acid and phthalic acid derivatives of the general formula (III) where: R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are each as defined for the formula (I) R 9 and R 10 are a) independently COOH or COOX, where X is C 1 -C 4 -alkyl, b) either COONY 4 while the other is CONH 2 , Y is C 1 -C 4 -alkyl or hydrogen, c) together COOCO, and from 0 to 20% by weight, based on the acetal or ketal of the formula (II), of a compound (IV) selected from the group consisting of methylbenzene, ring-substituted derivatives of methylbenzene where from 1 to 3 hydrogen atoms of the phenyl radical may be replaced by C 1 -C 6 -alkyl radicals or C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy radicals, cyclohexanone and 2-butanone are reacted electro-chemically in an undivided electrolysis cell to form a mixture (M), comprising phthalides of the formula (I) and aldehydes or ketones of the formula (II). Phthalides of the formula (I) and aldehydes or ketones of the formula (II) (compounds I and II) are useful intermediates, especially for the synthesis of crop protection agents. These compounds are preparable in a particularly economical way from the compounds (III) and (IV) in electrochemical cosyntheses in an undivided electrolysis cell, in which case the compounds (I) and (II) are obtained in the form of the mixture (M) (cf. DE-A-19618854 and the German application with the file reference 19741423.0). However, separation of the resulting mixture (M) using technically simple customary separation processes such as distillation is very difficult, since the acetals/ketals and phthalides form azeotropes in some instances. It is an object of the present invention to provide a technically simple and very economical separation process where the loss of product of value is minimal. We have found that this object is achieved by the above-described process for separating the mixture (M) and the overall process for preparing the compounds (I) and (II). The fact that the process of the present invention achieves the object must be surprising to those skilled in the art. First, it was unforeseeable that the aldehydes or ketones are significantly simpler to separate from the phthalides by distillation than the corresponding acetals or ketals. Secondly, the hydrolysis of acetals or ketals (II) in the presence of phthalides (I) would not have been expected to be economical. The hydrolysis of acetals and ketals is described, for example, in J.Org.Chem. 59 (1994), 3098-3101. According to this reference, acetals and ketals are hydrolyzed in the presence of acids, acidic catalysts or auxiliaries, for example zeolites or ion exchangers, under harsh conditions in some instances, for example in super- critical water, in order that useful space-time yields may be obtained. From this, it would have been expected that existing processes for hydrolyzing acetals or ketals of the formula (II) would not be economical under reaction conditions sufficiently mild to ensure that virtually only the acetal or ketal group and not the ester group of the phthalide is attacked, since the reaction times would be too long. On the other hand, harsher reaction conditions would be expected to cause the formation of by-products (hydrolysis of the phthalide). The selective hydrolysis is particularly efficient in the case of those mixtures (M) comprising a phthalide of the formula (I) where R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are all hydrogen. Preference is given to acetals or ketals of the formula (II) wherein R 7 and R 8 have the following meanings: one radical R 7 or R 8 is hydrogen and the other is selected from the group consisting of p-methoxyphenyl, p-methylphenyl, p-t-butylphenyl, o-methylphenyl and o-methoxyphenyl, the radicals R 7 and R 8 are together 1-hydroxypentane-1,5-diyl, or one radical R 7 or R 8 is methyl and the other is 1-hydroxyethyl. p-tert-Butylbenzaldehyde dimethyl acetal is particularly preferred. The mixtures (M) comprise generally from 10 to 60%, preferably from 30 to 50%, by weight of a phthalide of the formula (I) and from 10 to 60 mol %, preferably from 30 to 50 mol %, of an acetal or ketal of the formula (II). The mixtures (M) may further comprise from 0 to 20% by weight, based on the phthalide of the formula (I), of a compound (III) selected from the group consisting of phthalic acid and phthalic acid derivatives of the general formula (III) where: R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are each as defined for the formula (I) R 9 and R 10 are a) independently COOH or COOX, where X is C 1 -C 4 -alkyl, b) either COONY 4 while the other is CONH 2 , Y is C 1 -C 4 -alkyl or hydrogen, c) together COOCO, and from 0 to 20% by weight, based on the acetal or ketal of the formula (II), of a compound (IV) selected from the group consisting of methylbenzene, ring-substituted derivatives of methylbenzene where from 1 to 3 hydrogen atoms of the phenyl radical may be replaced by C 1 -C 6 -alkyl radicals or C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy radicals, cyclohexanone and 2-butanone. In the mixtures (M), the radicals R 1 to R 4 in the compounds of the formulae (I) preferably have the same meanings as in the compounds of the formula (III). The compounds of the formula (IV) are preferably compounds which serve as starting compounds for the electrochemical conversion to the corresponding compounds of the formula (I). The selective hydrolysis is carried out in the presence of from 1 to 10 mol of water, based on the molar quantity of acetals or ketals of the formula (II). The reaction temperature is within the range from 10 to 200 C., preferably within the range from 80 to 140 C. The pressure at which the reaction is carried out is uncritical and is generally within the range from 0.5 to 10 bar. The selective hydrolysis may be carried out in the presence of catalytic amounts of a mineral acid, of an organic acid or of an acidic ion exchanger, but preferably without the addition of catalyst. The selective hydrolysis may be carried out in the presence of an inert organic solvent, for example acetone, or without a solvent. The hydrolysis is preferably carried out according to one of the following variants: Variant A: The mixture (M) and the water are, via heat exchangers, separately preheated and fed into the reactor. The mixing can be influenced through internal fitments or stirrer optimization. Residence times are set to range from 10 sec to 10 min at a pressure of 3-20 bar and temperatures of 80-180 C. The reaction solution is expanded into a flash drum, the alcohol which is formed becoming substantially vaporized in the process. Variant B: Variant B1 of the present invention is a continuous hydrolysis under atmospheric pressure in a stirred reactor having a column fitted on top: The mixture (M) and the water required for hydrolysis (stoichiometric amount up to 10-fold molar excess) are separately introduced into the vessel and reacted at from 100 to 140 C. in the course of a residence time of from 1 to 60 min. Surprisingly, sufficient water is still available in the reactor under these conditions to ensure complete hydrolysis of the starting material. In a further embodiment (variant B2), the stream of mixture (M) is introduced via a column, ensuring intensive contact between the gaseous water ascending from the vessel and the stream of starting materials trickling down the column packing. This will in some cases permit a further reduction in the residence time in the stirred vessel and/or a better conversion. The mixtures (M) are obtained, for example, by reacting a compound (III) electrochemically in an undivided electrolysis cell together with a compound (IV) in an organic solvent comprising less than 50% by weight of water by reacting a compound (III) electrochemically in an undivided electrolysis cell together with a compound (IV) in an organic solvent comprising less than 50% by weight of water. The preparation of compounds of the formulae (I) and (II) from compounds (III) and (IV) in a coproduction by this process is described, for example, in DE-A-19618854 and 19741423. In this process, the electrode materials used for both cathode and anode are in particular commercially available electrodes composed of graphite or carbon. The electrolyte is customarily a from 2 to 40% strength by weight solution of a compound of the formula (III) in an organic solvent or in a mixture of an organic solvent and water, the mixture generally comprising less than 50% by weight, preferably less than 25% by weight, particularly preferably less than 5% by weight, of water. Suitable organic solvents include in particular aliphatic C 1 -C 4 -alcohols, especially methanol or ethanol, or mixtures of such alcohols with a carboxamide such as dimethylformamide or t-butylformamide. Examples of conducting salts present in the electrolytes are quaternary ammonium salts, such as tetra(C 1 -C 4 -alkyl)ammonium halides or tetrafluoroborates and preferably methyltributyl-ammonium or methyltriethylammonium methosulfate, customarily in amounts of from 0.4 to 10% by weight, based on the electrolyte. When aldehydes are prepared as coproducts, it is advisable to use C 1 -C 6 -alkyl alcohols or ethylene glycol as solvents, since the aldehydes become acetalized and protected from any further oxidation. As regards the other process parameters such as temperature and current density, these are uncritical, as long as they are within the range customary for the electrochemical reaction of organic compounds. They are more particularly specified in DE-A-2510920, for example. The electrolysis is generally carried on until the starting material of the formula (III) and/or the starting material of the formula (IV) has been virtually completely converted into the phthalide of the formula (I) or of the formula (II), respectively. In a preferred embodiment of the electrolysis, once the conversion is sufficient for the molar ratio (E), formed of the proportion of phthalide and the total of the proportion of phthalide and of phthalic acid or phthalic acid derivatives in the electrolyte, is within the range from 0.8:1 to 0.995:1, preferably within the range from 0.83:1 to 0.99:1, and particularly preferably within the range from 0.86:1 to 0.95:1, the electrolyte is discharged from the electrolysis cell. One advantage of the last variant is that the proportion of undesirable by-products is particularly small and unconverted starting material, which essentially can only be removed in the course of the crystallization of the phthalide, as part of the mother liquor, can be put back into the electrolyte. The same is true of the coproduct and its starting compound, the anodic depolarizer. The process is therefore particularly economical. The electrolysis may be carried out both batchwise and continuously. In the continuous embodiment of the process, it is advantageous to harmonize the continuous discharge of the electrolyte and the continuous replenishment of the inert constituents of the electrolyte such as the solvents and conducting salts and also of the starting materials for the electrochemical reaction to one another and to the reaction rate in such a way that the concentration of all constituents of the electrolyte remains substantially constant. This applies especially to the molar ratio (E), which varies within the range defined. In general, the discharged electrolyte is worked up by distillation prior to the selective hydrolysis. This distillative workup is preferably accomplished as follows: Initially, the solvent is distilled out of the electrolyte, followed by a fraction comprising mixture (M). The remaining distillation residue mainly comprises the conducting salt, in general. The distillation of the discharged electrolyte is generally carried out at a pressure of from 1 to 100 mbar and at a temperature of from 100 to 220 C. A thin-film evaporator, for example, is used. The distillation residue, which usually consists essentially of the conducting salt, can be returned into the electrolysis cell. The electrolyte optionally prepurified in this way represents the mixture (M) and is subsequently subjected to the process of selective hydrolysis. Following selective hydrolysis, the resulting reaction mixture, which comprises a phthalide of the formula (I) and the aldehyde or ketone freed from the acetal or ketal of the formula (II), is generally subjected to a fractional distillation. The distillation is carried out according to customary methods. Preferably, at least 2 distinct fractions are collected. One of the fractions comprises essentially only the aldehyde or ketone. Further impurities are generally only present therein in amounts of up to 0.5% by weight. A further fraction comprises a phthalide of the formula (I) as main constituent and, as the case may be, as further impurities, the compounds (III) and also the aldehyde. This fraction is particularly simple to purify further by crystallization when the proportion of these impurities is not more than 20%, preferably not more than 10%, by weight, based on the phthalide of the formula (I). Advantageously, a third distinct fraction is recovered, mainly comprising low boilers. These are by-products having a lower boiling point than the products of value. The crystallization process used for purifying the thus-recovered phthalide of the formula (I), hereinafter called crude phthalide, is not subject to any restriction. The crystallization can be carried out continuously or batchwise, in one or more stages. It is preferable in this context not to add an assistant, especially not to add an organic solvent. The crystallization is preferably carried out in a single stage. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the crystallization is carried out as a fractional crystallization. In the art of fractional crystallization it is customary to term all stages which produce a crystallizate which is purer than the crude phthalide feed purifying stages and all other stages stripping stages. Multi-stage fractional crystallization processes are advantageously operated according to the counter-current principle whereby the crystallizate is separated from the mother liquor in each stage and fed to the particular stage having the next higher degree of purity, while the mother liquor is fed to the particular stage having the next lower degree of purity. The temperature of the solution or melt during the crystallization is advantageously within the range from 10 to 75 C., especially within the range from 20 to 70 C. The solids content in the crystallizer is customarily within the range from 0 to 70 g, preferably within the range from 30 to 60 g, per 100 g of feed. In a further advantageous embodiment of the invention, the crystallization takes place in apparatuses in which the crystals grow on cooled surfaces within the crystallization apparatus, i.e., are immobilized in the apparatus (e.g. layer crystallization process of Sulzer Chemtech (Switzerland) or static crystallization process of BEFS PROKEM (France). Furthermore, the crystallization can be effected by cooling apparatus walls or by evaporating a solution of the crude phthalide under reduced pressure. Suitable for this purpose are in particular from 5 to 30% strength by weight solutions of the crude phthalide in methanol. In the case of crystallization by cooling, the heat is removed via scraped-surface coolers connected to a stirred tank or to a vessel without stirrer. The circulation of the crystal suspension is ensured in this case by means of a pump. Alternatively, it is possible to remove the heat via the walls of a stirred tank having a close-clearance stirrer. A further preferred embodiment of cooling crystallization involves the use of cooling disc crystallizers as manufactured, for example by Gouda (Netherlands). In a further suitable variant for crystallization by cooling, the heat is removed via conventional heat transferors (preferably tube bundle or plate heat transferors). These apparatuses, unlike scraped-surface coolers, stirred tanks having close-clearance stirrers or cooling disc crystallizers, have no means for avoiding crystal layers on the heat-transferring surfaces. If, in operation, a state is reached where the heat transfer resistance has become too high owing to a crystal layer formation, the operation is switched over to a second apparatus. During operation of the second apparatus, the first apparatus is regenerated (preferably by melting of the crystal layer or by flushing the apparatus through with unsaturated solution). If heat transfer resistance becomes too high in the second apparatus, operation is switched back again to the first apparatus, etc. This variant can also be operated with more than two apparatuses in alternation. In addition, the crystallization can be effected by conventional evaporation of the solution under reduced pressure. To separate the mother liquor from the crystallized-out phthalide, any known solid-liquid separation process is suitable. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the crystals are separated from the mother liquor by filtration and/or centrifugation. Advantageously, the filtration or centrifugation is preceded by a (pre)thickening of the suspension, for example by means of one or more hydrocyclones. Centrifugation can be carried out in any known centrifuge which works batchwise or continuously. It is very advantageous to use pusher centrifuges which can be operated in one or more stages. Also suitable are screw sieve centrifuges or screw discharge centrifuges (decanters). A filtration is advantageously effected by means of press filters which can be operated batchwise or continuously, with or without stirrer, or by means of belt filters. In general, filtration can be effected under superatmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure. The solid-liquid separation may be accompanied and/or followed by further process steps for increasing the purity of the crystals or of the crystal cake. In a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, the separation of the crystals from the mother liquor is followed by a single- or multiple-stage washing and/or sweating of the crystals or of the crystal cake. In washing, the quantity of wash liquor is suitably within the range from 0 to 500 g of wash liquor/100 g of crystallizate, preferably within the range from 30 to 200 g of wash liquor/100 g of crystallizate. Examples of suitable wash liquors are a) the solvent, if the crystallization takes place in a solvent, b) pure liquid product, or c) liquid feed. The washing can take place in apparatuses customary for the purpose. It is advantageous to use wash columns in which the removal of the mother liquor and the washing take place in one and the same apparatus, centrifuges which can be operated in one or more stages, or press filters or belt filters. The washing can be carried out on centrifuges or belt filters in one or more stages. The wash liquor can be passed in countercurrent to the crystal cake. Sweating describes a local melting-off of impure regions. The sweat quantity is advantageously within the range from 0.1 to 90 g of molten-off crystallizate/100 g of crystallizate prior to sweating, preferably within the range from 5 to 35 g of molten-off crystallizate/100 g of crystallizate. It is particularly preferable to carry out the sweating on centrifuges or belt filters. A combined wash and sweat in one apparatus can also be suitable. The purity of the phthalide obtained is preferably within the range from 97 to 99.9% by weight, especially within the range from 98.5 to 99.5% by weight. The mother liquor and wash liquor can be returned into the electrolysis cell without further workup, especially if the crystallization was carried out without added assistant and the anodic coproduct was removed beforehand, since it consists essentially of a mixture of phthalide and the corresponding starting compound. The same is true if the crystallization was carried out with the aid of solvents which are also used in the electrolyte. If the crude phthalide was crystallized from a solution or washed with a solution which is not part of the electrolyte, the solvent is distilled off and the distillation residue can then be returned into the electrolysis cell. As already mentioned in the introductory part of the description, the selective hydrolysis is an important step of an overall process for preparing high purity phthalides of the formula (I) together with the acetals in a particularly economical manner in an electrochemical coproduction process. EXPERIMENTAL PART Example 1 The starting 5642 g of p-t-butyltoluene (TBT) and 8681 g of dimethyl phthalate were reacted in an electrolysis similarly to Example 6 of DE-A-19618854, but without cosolvent and with N-methyl-N,N,N-tributylammonium methosulfate 1.2% by weight as conducting salt in 30 kg of MeOH. After the reaction had ended (after consumption of a charge quantity of 4.5 F, based on TBT), the discharge was freed of solvent by distillation, and then the conducting salt and high boilers were removed via a short-path evaporator. The resulting crude product (12185 g) was hydrolyzed in a continuous stirred tank. The crude product of the electrochemical cosynthesis had a p-tert-butylbenzaldehyde dimethyl acetal content of 33% and a phthalide content of 35%. A portion of the crude product (1000 g) was introduced into a stirred tank having a column fitted on top, 62 g of water were added, and the mixture was heated to 106 C. Resulting methanol and the excess water distilled off through the column. The continuous feed of crude product and water into the stirred tank was then started, and a further 10,936 g of crude product were reacted in total. The level in the stirred tank was maintained via an overflow in such a way as to ensure a residence time of 30 min. The temperature was within the range from 102 to 110 C. The acetal conversion was 99.5%, and the crude aldehyde obtained (10,949 g) was 36% pure. 3744 g of pure p-tert-butylbenzaldehyde were recovered as main fraction from the hydrolysis discharge by rectification under reduced pressure. This corresponds to a yield of 61% of p-t-butylbenzaldehyde via the overall process. The selectivity is 83%, having regard to the recycling of the starting materials and intermediates. The bottom 4780 g having a phthalide content of 71% were freed of high boilers via a short-path evaporator and subjected to a crystallization as described in Example 1 of DE-A-19741423. 3224 g of 99% of pure phthalide were obtained. This corresponds to a yield of 54% of phthalide via the overall process. The selectivity is 85%, having regard to the recycling of the starting materials and intermediates. We claim: 1.
