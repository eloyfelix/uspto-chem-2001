Rhodium and iridium complexes with these ligands are suitable for use as homogeneous enantioselective catalysts for the hydrogenation of prochiral compounds, containing carbon double bonds or carbon/hetero atom double bonds. The present invention relates to 1-2-(diphenylphosphino)ferrocenylalkylidene phosphines in the form of racemates and stereoisomers, to a process for their preparation, to iridium and rhodium complexes containing these ligands, and to the use thereof as enantioselective hydrogenation catalysts for the homogeneous hydrogenation of prochiral unsaturated compounds.

Our investigations have revealed that homogeneous hydrogenation of prochiral compounds with rhodium complexes, which contain these ligands give only low optical yields.

In another of its aspects, the invention provides a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I, which comprises reacting a compound of formula III in the presence of an inert solvent at room temperature or at elevated temperature, with a phosphine of formula IV HPR 2 R 3 (IV). The reaction is known per se and is described by T. Hayashi et al. im Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 53, pp. 1136-1151. The preparation of compounds of formula III is also described in this reference or can be carried out in analogous manner. The phosphines of formula IV are known or are obtainable by known methods in analogous manner. The reaction temperature may be in the range from 20 to 150 C., preferably from 40 to 100 C. Suitable solvents are polar protic and aprotic solvents which may be used singly or as mixtures of two or more solvents. Typical examples of solvents are alkanols such as methanol and ethanol, and carboxylic acids such as formic acid and acetic acid. The compounds of formula I are obtained as racemates, mixtures of stereoisomers or as stereoisomers, depending on whether the compounds of formula III are used as racemates, mixtures of stereoisomers or as stereoisomers. Mixtures of stereoisomers can be separated by known methods into the stereoisomers, preferably as a rule by chromatographic methods. The compounds of formula I are isolated and purified by per se known methods, typically by distillation, extraction, crystallisation and/or chromatographic methods. The compounds of formula I are suitable for use as ligands for rhodium and iridium complexes. In another of its aspects, the invention relates to complexes of formulae V and VI, X 1 M 1 YZ(V), X 1 M 1 Y A 1 (VI) wherein X 1 is two C 2 -C 12 olefins or a C 5 -C 12 diene, Z is Cl, Br or I, A 1 is the anion of an oxyacid or complex acid, M 1 is Rh or Ir, and Y is a diphosphine of formula I. The complexes of formula VI are preferred. With respect to the diphosphines of formula I, the same preferences and exemplifications apply as stated previously. X 1 as olefin preferably contains 2 to 6 and, most preferably, 2 to 4, carbon atoms. Ethylene is particularly preferred. Further examples are propene and 1-butene, X 1 as diene preferably contains 5 to 8 carbon atoms. The diene may be an open-chain or mono- or bicyclic diene. The two olefinic groups of the diene are preferably linked through one or two CH 2 groups. Typical examples are 1,3-pentadiene, cyclopentadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, 1,4- or 1,5-heptadiene, 1,4- or 1,5-cycloheptadiene, 1,4- or 1,5-octadiene, 1,4- or 1,5-cyclooctadiene, norbornadiene.

Typical examples of A 1 in formula VI are ClO 4 , FSO 3 , CH 3 SO 3 , CF 3 SO 3 , BF 4 , PF 6 , SbCl 6 , AsF 6 and SbF 6 . Preferably A 1 is ClO 4 , CF 3 SO 3 , BF 4 , PF 6 and SbF 6 . The novel complexes are obtained in per se known manner by the reaction of equimolar amounts of a compound of formula I with a metal complex of formula M 1 (X 1 )Z 2 or M 1 (X 1 ) 2 A 1 , wherein M 1 , X 1 , Z and A 1 have the meanings previously assigned to them. The metal complexes are known, q.v. inter alia EP-A-0 302 021 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,995. The reaction is conveniently carried out under an inert gas atmosphere, typically argon, and expediently in the temperature range from 0 to 40 C., preferably at room temperature. The concurrent use of a solvent or mixture of solvents is advantageous, conveniently selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene), halogenated hydrocarbons (methylene chloride, chloroform, chlorobenzene), alkanols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether), and ethers (diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane) or mixture thereof. The novel complexes can be isolated and purified by conventional methods, or they can be prepared in situ prior to hydrogenation and then used in dissolved from direct as hydrogenation catalyst. The novel complexes are preeminently suitable for use as homogeneous catalysts for the enantioselective hydrogenation of prochiral compounds containing carbon double bonds and carbon/hetero atom double bonds, typically compounds that contain a group selected from CC, CN, CO, CCN and CCO q.v. inter alia K. E. Knig, The Applicability of Asymmetric Homogeneous Catalysis, in James D. Morrison (ed.), Asymmetric Synthesis, Vol. 5, Academic Press, 1985. Examples of such compounds are prochiral olefins, enamines, imines and ketones. Surprisingly high yields are obtained, normally even a quantitative chemical conversion, in short reaction times. Particularly surprising are the very high optical yields which are obtained with the novel complexes. The enantiomer excess (ee) may be more than 90%. It is possible to use racemates, mixtures of stereoisomers or stereoisomers of the complexes of formulae V and VI, mixtures of stereoisomers or stereoisomers being preferred. In another of its aspects, the invention relates to the use of the novel complexes of formulae V and VI as homogeneous catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral compounds containing carbon double bonds or carbon/hetero atom double bonds, especially those containing a CC, CN, CO, CCN or CCO group. The preferred utility is for hydrogenation unsymmetric carbon double bonds, ketimines and ketones. The iridium complex of formulae V and VI is also preferred as catalyst for hydrogenating prochiral N-arylketimines to optically active secondary amines. The rhodium complex of formulae V and VI is preferably used as catalyst for hydrogenating carbon double bonds, for example prochiral carbon double bonds. In yet another of its aspects, the invention provides a process for the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral compounds containing carbon double bonds or carbon/hetero atom double bonds under homogeneous reaction conditions, which process comprises hydrogenating said compounds in the temperature range from 20 to 80 C., and under a hydrogen pressure of 10 4 to 10 7 Pa, in the presence of a catalytic amount of a complex of formula V and VI. Preferred prochiral compounds are those previously mentioned. Unsymmetric ketimines and ketones are known. Suitable N-arylketimines are disclosed, inter alia, in EP-A-0 256 982. N-Aliphatic ketimines are disclosed, inter alia, in EP-A-0 301 457. Such imines can be prepared from the corresponding unsymmetric ketones, which are known and commercially available or obtainable by known methods. Suitable substituted alkenes are described in the publication of K. E. Knig referred to above. The process is preferably carried out in the temperature range from 10 to 50 C. and preferably under a hydrogen pressure of 1.10 5 to 6.10 6 Pa. The amount of catalyst is preferably chosen such that the molar ratio of compound to be hydrogenated (substrate) to the complex of formula V or VI is preferably 10000 to 20, more preferably 5000 to 20, especially 2000 to 40 and, most preferably, 1000 to 50. A preferred mode of carrying out the process comprises the additional concurrent use of an ammonium or alkali metal chloride, bromide or iodide, especially when using the novel iridium catalysts. The amount may typically be 0.1 to 100, preferably 1 to 50 and, most preferably, 2 to 20, equivalents, based on the complex of formula V or VI. The addition of iodides is preferred. Ammonium is preferably tetraalkylammonium containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl groups, and the preferred alkali metal is lithium, sodium and potassium. The hydrogenation can be carried out without, or in the presence of, a solvent. Suitable solvents, which may be used alone or in admixture, are typically: aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene), alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanel and butanol; ethers such as diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane; halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane and chlorobenzene; esters and lactones such as ethyl acetate, butyrolactone or valerolactone; carboxamides and lactams such as dimethyl formamide, dimethyl acetamide and N-methylpyrrolidone. Preferred mixtures are those of alcohols and aromatic hydrocarbons, typically methanol/benzene or methanol/toluene. The preferred solvents is methanol by itself or in admixture with benzene or toluene. The novel hydrogenation process makes it possible to obtain optically pure compounds which are useful intermediates for the synthesis of biologically active compounds, especially in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical sectors. Thus, for example, herbicidally active 5-imidazolecarboxylic acid derivatives which can be used for weed control (EP-A-0 207 563) can be prepared from secondary amines, especially N-carbalkoxymethylamines. The optically pure -aminocarboxylates are suitable for peptide syntheses. Optically pure aminocarboxylic acids which are useful synthesis components can be obtained from unsaturated aminocarboxylic acids. The following Examples illustrate the invention in more detail. The reactions are carried out under argon. The chemical conversion is determined by gas chromatography column DB 17/30 W (15 m), supplier: JCW Scientific INC., USA, temperature program: 60/1 min up to 220 C., T: 10.min 1 . The determination of the optical yield, enantiomer excess ee) is likewise made by gas chromatography column Chirasil-Val, 50 m, supplier: Alltech, USA, T: 150 C., isotherm).

This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/023,718 filed Feb. 13, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,110,447 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The present invention relates to novel cosmetic compositions. More particularly, the invention relates to cosmetic and care compositions comprising at least one film-forming polymer. These novel compositions exhibit improved properties with respect to the prior art, in particular with regard to the fluidity of the composition, the ease of application, the homogeneity of the film, the speed of drying, the resistance of the film to wear, the gloss, the resistance to yellowing, the stability to light and the stability to heat. Film-forming polymers are essential constituents of numerous cosmetic forms, such as, for example, nail varnishes, lacquers and mascaras. They make it possible to deposit the make-up in the form of a film on the surface of the skin, the hair and/or the nails. Normally, at least one so-called plasticizing compound is added to the film-forming polymer, the role of this plasticizing compound being to confer flexibility on the make-up film. This is because the use of a film-forming polymer alone gives a stiff, brittle and fragile film which rapidly wears away. However, the addition of a plasticizer can sometimes lead to other disadvantages, such as yellowing, instability of the composition towards light and/or towards heat, lack of gloss or lack of fluidity. Indeed, nail varnish compositions comprising N-ethyl-o,p-toluenesulphonamide (mixture of the ortho and para isomers) as the plasticizing agent, in combination with a film-forming polymer, are known, in particular from European Patent Application EP-154,679. However, such a combination exhibits the disadvantage of rapidly yellowing and of being unstable when it is exposed to light and/or to heat. The use of a citrate, such as, for example, tributyl acetylcitrate, as a plasticizing agent in combination with a film-forming polymer is also known. To this end, reference may be made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,227,155. However, such compositions lack gloss and fluidity and are difficult to apply. The present invention is targeted at providing a make-up composition exhibiting improved properties with respect to the prior art. The inventors have discovered, surprisingly, that the combination of a film-forming polymer with an ester of citric acid corresponding to the formula (I) (hereinbelow) and of a plasticizing compound of formula (II) (hereinbelow) makes it possible to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art. The present invention relates to a novel composition comprising the combination of: (a) at least one film-forming polymer; (b) at least one citric acid ester of formula (I): in which: R 1 , R 2 and R 3 independently represent H or a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched C 1 -C 30 alkyl chain or a saturated or unsaturated cyclic C 3 -C 30 alkyl chain, wherein at least one of R 1 , R 2 and R 3 is not a hydrogen atom, and R 4 represents a hydrogen atom or an R 4 CO group in which R 4 represents a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched C 1 -C 8 alkyl group or a saturated or unsaturated cyclic C 3 -C 8 alkyl group; and (c) at least one compound of formula (II): in which: represents an ortho or para position of the phenyl group and R and R independently represent a hydrogen atom or a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched C 1 -C 6 alkyl group or a saturated or unsaturated cyclic C 3 -C 6 alkyl group. The combination according to the invention, when it is incorporated in a cosmetically acceptable vehicle, spreads over the skin, mucous membranes, eyelashes, eyebrows, hair or nails with great ease and makes it possible to obtain a homogeneous film which rapidly dries and which exhibits improved resistance and improved gloss with respect to the compositions of the prior art. Such a composition withstands yellowing and is stable towards light and towards heat. The film-forming polymers that can be used in accordance with the present invention can be selected from: keratin derivatives, such as keratin hydrolysates and sulphonic keratins; anionic, cationic, amphoteric or non-ionic chitosan or chitin derivatives; cellulose derivatives, such as hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, methylcellulose, ethyl-hydroxyethylcellulose or carboxymethylcellulose, as well as quaternized cellulose derivatives; mention may in particular be made of nitrocelluloses of the RS or SS type and in particular nitrocellulose type RS, nitrocellulose type RS, nitrocellulose type SS and nitrocellulose type RS; acrylic polymers or copolymers, such as polyacrylates or polymethacrylates; resins of the acrylic, styrene, acrylate-styrene and vinyl type; polyvinylpyrrolidones and vinyl copolymers, such as copolymers of methyl vinyl ether and of maleic anhydride or the copolymer of vinyl acetate and of crotonic acid; polyester polymers, alkyd resins and/or anionic polyester amides which are dispersible in water comprising monomers carrying an SO 3 M functional group, with M representing a hydrogen atom, an ammonium ion NH 4 or a metal ion, such as, for example, an Na , Li , K , Mg 2 , Ca 2 , Cu 2 , Fe 2 or Fe 3 ion. Mention may in particular be made of the polymers described in U.S. Pat.

The composition according to the invention can, in addition, comprise at least one coloring agent, such as conventional pigments or dyes. Pigments are natural or synthetic substances composed of fine particles which, in contrast to dyes, are insoluble in their medium of use, the main function of which is to give a coloring. Different types of pigments are distinguished between: inorganic pigments, metallic pigments, organic pigments, lakes or pearlescent pigments. Lakes are dyes adsorbed on insoluble particles, the combination remaining essentially insoluble in the medium of use. Pearlescent pigments are natural or synthetic substances which scatter and reflect light to give an iridescent or gloss effect. Mention may be made, among dyes, of natural organic dyes, such as cochineal carmine (CI 75 470), or synthetic organic dyes, such as haloacid, azo or anthraquinone dyes.

As mentioned above, the compositions according to the invention can also be provided in the form of an anhydrous or aqueous nail varnish or nail care base. Advantageously, when the composition is intended to be applied to the nails, it contains a total amount of plasticizing agent (compound of formula (I), compound of formula (II) and optionally at least one other plasticizer) preferably ranging from 2 to 20%, more preferably from 5 to 15%, by weight with respect to the total weight of the composition. When the compositions are provided in the form of an anhydrous nail varnish or nail care base, the solvent system preferably represents from approximately 55% to approximately 90% by weight with respect to the total weight of the varnish. This solvent system is composed of a mixture of various volatile organic solvents, such as acetone, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, 2-methoxyethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl acetate, amyl acetate and isopropyl acetate, or alcohols, such as ethanol or isopropanol. The solvent system can also comprise a diluent, such as hexane or octane or alternatively an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as toluene or xylene, in a proportion preferably of from 10 to 35% by weight with respect to the total weight of the varnish. The film-forming material of the varnish is preferably present in a concentration ranging from 5 to 20% by weight with respect to the total weight of the varnish. Mention may in particular be made, among film-forming materials commonly used in nail care base and varnish compositions, of nitrocelluloses of the RS or SS type and in particular nitrocellulose type RS, nitrocellulose type RS, nitrocellulose type SS and nitrocellulose type RS. The varnishes according to the invention can also comprise a resin generally present at a concentration ranging from 0 to 15% by weight with respect to the total weight of the varnish. Mention may in particular be made, among the numerous resins which can be used, of resins of the arylsulphonamide-formaldehyde or arylsulphonamide-epoxy type, in particular the resins known under the trade names SANTOLITE MHP and SANTOLITE MS 80. When the nail varnishes or nail care bases are provided in the aqueous form, they contain a dispersion of a synthetic film-forming substance to which various standard additives can be added, such as a film-forming material, a thickener, a pH regulator, a crosslinking agent, an antifoaming agent, and the like. It is possible, as a synthetic aqueous dispersion, inter alia, to use dispersions of poly(vinyl acetate), of polyurethane, of acrylic polymers or copolymers and of copolymers of poly(vinyl acetate). According to the invention, the synthetic aqueous dispersion preferably represents approximately from 10 to 80% by weight of the varnish. Mention may in particular be made, among the film-forming materials, of water-soluble cellulose derivatives. The varnishes according to the invention can also comprise a resin generally present at a concentration ranging from 0 to 15% by weight with respect to the total weight of the varnish. Mention may in particular be made, among the resins which can be used, of resins of the acrylic, styrene, acrylate-styrene and vinyl type. The anhydrous or aqueous nail varnishes according to the invention can also contain adjuvants commonly used in nail varnishes, such as, for example, U.V. 10% , screening agents. The invention is illustrated in more detail in the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 Nail Varnish Composition A composition according to the invention was prepared comprising: nitrocellulose 19% N-ethyl-o,p-toluenesulphonamide 6% tributyl acetylcitrate 6% pigments 1% hectorite 1.2% isopropyl alcohol 8% ethyl acetate, butyl acetate q.s. for 100% EXAMPLE 2 Comparative Tests Formulae tested: Formula A Formula B Formula C Nitrocellulose 20% 20% 20% N-ethyl-o,p- 12% 6% toluenesulphonamide Tributyl acetylcitrate 12% 6% Ethyl acetate/Butyl q.s. for 100% q.s. for 100% q.s. for 100% acetate (50/50) AStudy of Yellowing: The yellowing after storage for 1 to 4 weeks at 45 C. was evaluated visually. A grade from 0 to 10 was attributed to each sample: 0no coloration 10 very yellow The results are given in the table below: Formula A Formula B Formula C 1 week 1 1 1 2 weeks 2 1 1 3 weeks 3 2 2 4 weeks 4 2 2 It was thus found that the combination of the two plasticizers has very good resistance to yellowing, whereas N-ethyl-o,p-toluenesulphonamide employed alone gave a composition which rapidly yellowed. BMeasurement of the Gloss: Gloss measurements were carried out, using a Micro Tri Gloss Glossmeter sold by the company Byk Gardner, at an angle of 60. These measurements were carried out on the formulae A, B and C described above, and on the formulae A, B and C which derive from the formulae A, B and C by addition of 1% by weight of red pigment. The results are given in the table below: Formula A Formula B Formula C Gloss 80.9 69.8 80.1 Formula A Formula B Formula C Gloss 81.7 75.1 80.3 It was found, from these tests, that the mixture of the two plasticizers made it possible to obtain an excellent gloss, whereas tributyl acetylcitrate employed alone only made it possible to obtain an average result.

"abstract": "The invention provides a method of tracking, identifying, and/or sorting classes or subpopulations of molecules by the use of oligonucleotide tags. Oligonucleotide tags of the invention comprise oligonucleotides selected from a minimally cross-hybridizing set. Preferably, such oligonucleotides each consist of a plurality of subunits 3 to 9 nucleotides in length. A subunit of a minimally cross-hybridizing set forms a duplex or triplex having two or more mismatches with the complement of any other subunit of the same set. The number of oligonucleotide tags available in a particular embodiment depends on the number of subunits per tag and on the length of the subunit. An important aspect of the invention is the use of the oligonucleotide tags for sorting polynucleotides by specifically hybridizing tags attached to the polynucleotides to their complements on solid phase supports.

The resulting optically active hydroxamic acid can be converted to the corresponding optically active primary amines by a Lossen rearrangement. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The invention relates to the enzymatic synthesis of optically active hydroxamic acids and to their conversion to optically active primary amines by a Lossen rearrangement. 2. Background of the Prior Art Hydroxamic acids are compounds of great pharmaceutical interest. Hydroxamic acid derivatives exist which have antibacterial and fungicidal properties (Duda et al., 1965; Hase et al., 1971). Alkylaminopropionohydroxamic acids exhibit hypotensive properties (Coutts et al., 1971). Hypocholesterolaemic actions have also been demonstrated for hydroxamic acids (Ludwig et al., 1967). p-Butoxyphenylacetohydroxamic acid possesses an anti-inflammatory action (Dell et al., 1971) and is used in human medicine. Some hydroxamic acids have been studied for their efficacy against malaria (Hynes, 1970; Hynes Hack, 1972). Enantiomerically pure hydroxamic acids, however, are of particular importance. Their pharmacological activity is higher than that of the racemates. Furthermore, via the Lossen rearrangement, they also open up a new route to chiral primary amines. This class of substances is pharmacologically of great importance as well. Thus chiral -amino alcohols, for example, are used in large amounts as -adrenoceptor antagonists, abbreviated to -blockers. However, the preparation of enantiomerically pure hydroxamic acids by the conventional methods of organic chemistry is expensive. It normally requires a racemate separation or the use of metal-organic catalysts, but the latter are generally unsuitable for the preparation of drugs. Such methods are described for example in DE-PS 2 400 531, EP-A-203 379 and EP-A-268 215. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the invention is therefore to provide a novel method of preparing optically active hydroxamic acids which is not associated with the above-mentioned problems. Surprisingly it has now been found that amides, carboxylic acid esters and carboxylic acids which have a centre of chirality on the -carbon atom can be enantioselectively converted to optically active hydroxamic acids by acyltransferases in the presence of hydroxylamine. The invention therefore provides a method of preparing optically active hydroxamic acids of the general formula wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are different and are a cyclic or linear, aliphatic or aromatic, substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon radical which can optionally contain heteroatoms, said method being characterized in that a racemate of chiral amides, carboxylic acid esters or carboxylic acids of the general formula wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are as defined above and X is NH 2 , OR or OH, R being any organic radical, is reacted with hydroxylamine, NH 2 OH, in the presence of an acyltransferase, and the optically active hydroxamic acid (I) formed is then separated from the unconverted enantiomer of general formula (II). BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a graph plotting, against the reaction time in minutes, the concentration in mM of phenylacetohydroxamic acid (), acetohydroxamic acid () and phenylacetic acid () formed in a representative process of the invention reacting acetamide and phenylacetamide with hydroxylamine in the presence of an acyltransferase from quiescent cells of Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50; FIG. 2 is a graph plotting, against the reaction time in minutes, the concentration in mM of phenylacetohydroxamic acid (), acetohydroxamic acid () and phenylacetic acid () formed in a representative process of the invention reacting acetamide and phenylacetamide with hydroxylamine in the presence of an acyltransferase from a crude extract of Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50; and FIG. 3 is a graph depicting the formation of 2-phenylpropionohydroxamic acid () in mM for the reaction of (R,S)-2-phenylpropionamide () with hydroxylamine in the presence of acyltransferase recovered from Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50, with racemic 2-phenylpropionamide () as the model substrate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION, PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS AND BEST MODE Suitable acyltransferases, i.e. enzymes which transfer the acyl radical to the hydroxylamine, are known per se. They can be isolated for example from the following microorganisms: Mycobacteriaceae, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Arthrobacter, Aspergillus nidulans, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Brevibacterium sp. R312, Methylophilus methylotrophus, Pseudomonas chlororaphis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Rhodococcus rhodochrous Ji and Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50. The microorganism Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 was deposited with DSMZ (Deutsche Samnilung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH) Mascheroder Weg 1b, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany, on Jan. 16, 1995, and assigned DSMZ Accession No. 9675. The acyltransferase isolated from Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 is found to be very particularly suitable. Of all the amidases studied, this one had the highest specific activities and the broadest substrate spectrum. Amidase and acyltransferase activity can be found in the same enzyme. The amidase activity is high too, but the acyltransferase activity is markedly higher, probably because hydroxylamine is a better acyl radical acceptor than water. Thus, by using this special acyltransferase, i.e. the acyltransferase isolated from Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50, hydrolysis of the amides and esters used as starting materials can be extensively avoided. The method according to the invention can be carried out using either a crude extract of the acyltransferase from said microorganisms or a purified form. Using the crude extract has the advantage that the enzyme purification step can be dispensed with. For special applications, however, it is recommended to use purified acyltransferase. In particular, it is found that the catalytic activity of the purified acyltransferase is higher than that of the crude extract, so chemically inert starting materials are preferably reacted with the purified acyltransferase. The recovery and purification of the acyltransferase from Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 is described in Purification and properties of an amidase from Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 which enantioselectively hydrolyzes 2-aryilpropionamides, B. Hirrlinger, A. Stolz H. -J. Knackmuss, Journal of Bacteriology, 1996, vol. 178(12), pp. 3501-3507. The cells or the purified enzyme can be used directly or in immobilized form. Immobilization enables the biocatalyst to have multiple uses and simplifies the working-up of the reaction mixture. Within the framework of the present invention, whole cells or purified enzyme are immobilized by methods known per se. Whole cells are immobilized e.g. with alginate, -carrageenan, polyurethane or polyacrylamides (I. Chibata, T. Tosa T. Sato, 1983, Immobilized Cells in Preparation of Fine Chemicals, Advances In Biotechnological Processes (A. R. Liss, editor), volume 1, pp. 203-222. Purified enzyme is immobilized either by adsorption onto suitable supports (Clite, cellulose), by ionic binding to an ion exchanger resin (DEAE-cellulose, Sephadex), by covalent bonding to a carrier (porous glass beads, cellulose, dextran, agarose) or by inclusion in a gel (alginate, agar, polyacrylamide) (O. R. Zaborsky, 1973, Immobilized Enzymes, CRC Press, Cleveland, Ohio; M. D. Trevan, 1980, Immobilized Enzymes: Introduction and Applications in Biotechnology, Wiley, New York; W. Hartmeier, 1986, Immobilisierte Biokatalysatoren (Immobilized Biocatalysts), Springer, Berlin). As the method according to the invention is an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the pH of the reaction medium is to be taken into consideration. It should generally be in the pH range 5.5 to 9 and preferably in the pH range 6.5 to 7.5. Suitable buffer systems, such as sodium phosphate buffer and Tris/HCl buffer, can be used for this purpose. In principle, it is possible to use any amides, carboxylic acid esters and carboxylic acids as starting materials for the preparation of the desired hydroxamic acids, provided that the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl carbon, i.e. the -carbon atom, is chiral. This means that the substituents present on this carbon atom have to be different. These substituents can be any cyclic or linear, aliphatic or aromatic, substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon radicals and can optionally contain heteroatoms such as oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc. Substituents such as methyl, ethyl, n-pentyl, isopropyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl and naphthyl are found to be particularly suitable. Particularly suitable starting materials are therefore alkylaminopropionic acid, p-butoxyphenylacetic acid, 2-phenylpropionic acid, 2- (6-methoxy-2-naphthyl) propionic acid (naproxen), 2-(3-benzoylphenyl)propionic acid (ketoprofen), 2-methylbutanoic acid, 2-(1-naphthyl)propionic acid and their esters or amides. In general, it is preferable to use the amides of the compounds covered by general formula (I), being more reactive than the corresponding carboxylic acids or carboxylic acid esters. The concentration of the reactants in the reaction medium is not particularly critical. The compounds of formula (I) are generally used in a concentration of 0.5 to 0.001 mol./l and preferably in a concentration of 0.1 mol./l. The concentration of the hydroxylamine is generally 1.0 to 0.1 mol./l and preferably 0.5 to 0.2 mol./l. The ratio of the compounds of formula (I) to hydroxylamine is therefore generally 1:10 to 1:2 and preferably 1:5. The activity of the acyltransferase is generally 3.5 to 37 units/mg protein and preferably 13 units/mg protein (with 2-phenylpropionamide as substrate). The essential advantage of the method according to the invention is to be regarded as the fact that the acyltransferase selectively catalyzes the conversion of only one enantiomer of the racemate of optically active amides, carboxylic acid esters or carboxylic acids, used as starting material, with hydroxylamine to the corresponding hydroxamic acid, while its mirror image remains unchanged in the reaction. The reaction mixture initially obtained directly after the conversion therefore contains the optically pure hydroxamic acid together with the unconverted enantiomer of the starting material. These two components can easily be separated from one another by shaking the reaction mixture with ethyl acetate, diethyl ether or methylene chloride to extract it, the general procedure being as follows: The aqueous reaction solution is adjusted to pH 10 with sodium hydroxide solution. The amide is extracted with one of the above-mentioned organic solvents. The aqueous phase is then adjusted to pH 2 with hydrochloric acid. The hydroxamic acid is then extracted into the organic phase by shaking and is thereby isolated. The optically active hydroxamic acid recovered in this way can then be converted in a manner known per se, by a Lossen rearrangement, to the corresponding optically active and enantiomerically pure primary amine. The invention therefore also provides a method of preparing optically active primary amines of the general formula wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are as defined above, in which method the optically active hydroxamic acid of general formula (I), obtained as described above, is O-acylated, the O-acylated hydroxamic acid is converted to the corresponding isocyanate by heating or by treatment with bases in aprotic solvents, and the isocyanate is reacted with water to give the amine of general formula (III) with the elimination of CO 2 . The Lossen rearrangement therefore proceeds according to the following reaction scheme: Suitable bases are compounds like NaOH, KOH, NaNH 2 and Na 2 CO 3 the nature of the bases used depending on the structure of the desired hydroxamic acid . Examples of convenient aprotic solvents are toluene, benzene or xylene. To decompose the O-acylated hydroxamic acid as quantitatively and as rapidly as possible, temperatures of 100 C. to 150 C., preferably 100 C., are generally convenient. As the absolute configuration of the -carbon atom of the optically active hydroxamic acid used as starting material is retained in the Lossen rearrangement (cf. Campbell Kenyon, 1946), the primary amines obtained as products of the Lossen rearrangement are also optically active. However, in the method according to the invention for the preparation of optically active primary amines, it is not necessary to remove the unconverted enantiomer of the amides, carboxylic acid esters or carboxylic acids used in the preparation of the optically active hydroxamic acids, after the first enzyme-catalyzed reaction, i.e. it is not necessary to use the pure optically active hydroxamic acid. The reaction can also be carried out in such a way that the racemate of the chiral amides, carboxylic acid esters or carboxylic acids is first reacted with hydroxylamine under enzyme catalysis, and the resulting reaction mixture, which contains the unconverted enantiomer of the starting material together with the optically active hydroxamic acid, is reacted with a carbodiimide under protonic catalysis to form an isocyanate and a corresponding urea derivative as intermediates. The isocyanate then reacts immediately with the water contained in the reaction system to give a carbamic acid, which in turn decomposes to carbon dioxide and the desired optically active primary amine. The amine can then easily be separated from the unconverted enantiomer of the starting material. The reaction with carbodiimide has the advantage that the optically active hydroxamic acid obtained in an aqueous reaction system can immediately be processed further, thereby obviating the need for a purification step. The derivatization with a carbodiimide is necessary because the conventional chemical methods of O-acylating hydroxamic acid can only be carried out in aprotic solvents, which are inconvenient for enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Examples of suitable carbodiimides are 1-benzyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) is found to be particularly convenient. This carbodiimide is described for example in Sheehan, J. C., P. A. Cruickshank G. L. Boshart, 1961, A convenient synthesis of water-soluble carbodiimides, J. Org. Chem. 26, 2525-2528. As an excess of hydroxylamine is generally used in the preparation of the optically active hydroxamic acid, it is convenient to remove the excess hydroxylamine before the reaction mixture is reacted with the carbodiimide. This is done by acidifying the reaction mixture to a pH in the range 0 to 2 and preferably in the region of 1. The hydroxylamine then readily decomposes to ammonium and nitrous oxide (cf. Holleman, A. F. E. Wiberg, 1985, Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie (Textbook of Inorganic Chemistry), edition 91-100, p. 591, Walter de Gruyter Verlag, Berlin, N.Y.). After acidification, the reaction mixture is heated at a temperature in the range 40 C. to 100 C., preferably at 80 C., until no further evolution of gas can be observed. A base, for example sodium hydroxide solution, is then added to the reaction mixture in order to adjust the pH to a value of 4 to 6 and preferably to pH 5.0. The derivatization with the carbodiimide is then-performed according to the following general scheme: wherein R 1 to R 5 are as defined above. If, for example, racemic 2-phenylpropionamide is used as the starting material in the method according to the invention, S()-phenylethylamine and R-2-phenylpropionamide are initially obtained according to the following reaction scheme: The desired optically active primary amine can easily be separated from the unconverted enantiomer of the starting material, a possible procedure being as follows: The aqueous reaction solution is acidified to pH 1 with hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate, diethyl ether or methylene chloride. The amide is now in the organic phase. The pH of the aqueous phase is then brought to 10 with sodium hydroxide solution and the amine is extracted with the solvents mentioned. This procedure affords optically active primary amines, such as S()-phenylethylamine, S-2-aminobutane or S-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine, which would otherwise only be accessible by expensive racemate separation. The invention is illustrated in greater detail by means of the Examples below. The procedure for determining the hydroxamic acids was as follows: As bidentate ligands, hydroxamic acids form stable, intensely coloured chelate complexes with iron(III) ions. These trishydroxamatoiron(III) complexes Fe(RCONHO) 3 have an absorption maximum at 500 nm and have a deep red colour to the eye. This property is utilized for the qualitative determination (Buckles, R. E. C. J. Thelen, 1950, Qualitative determination of carboxylic esters. Scope and limitations of hydroxamic acid test. Anal. Chem. 22, 676-678) and quantitative determination (Brammar, W. J. P. H. Clarke, 1964, Induction and repression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa amidase. J. Gen. Microbiol. 37, 307-319) of hydroxamic acids. The iron complex is obtained by mixing a solution containing hydroxamic acid with an iron(III) chloride solution acidified with hydrochloric acid. The extinction is determined by spectrophotometry in a glass cell at 500 nm. Iron(III) chloride solution (modified according to Hoare, D. G., A. Olson D. E. Koshland JR., 1968. The reaction of hydroxamic acids with water-soluble carbodiimides. A Lossen rearrangement. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 90, 1638-1643): FeCl 3 .6H 2 O 13.51 g conc. hydrochloric acid (12M) 3.33 ml H 2 O ad 500 ml The solution was filtered through a filter of pore size 0.45 m to remove turbidity. 600 l of the iron(III) chloride solution acidified with hydrochloric acid were pipetted into 300 l of a sample containing hydroxamic acid hydroxamic acid dissolved in Tris/HCl buffer (30 mM, pH 7.5). A deep red-coloured iron complex formed immediately. The extinction was determined by spectrophotometry. Calibration lines were plotted with acetohydroxamic acid and 2-phenylpropionohydroxamic acid dissolved in Tris/HCl buffer (30 mM, pH 7.5). These showed a linear dependence between extinction and hydroxamate concentration in the range 0.0 to 1.5 mM hydroxamic acid. The molar extinction coefficients ( max 500 nm) determined for acetohydroxamic acid, phenylacetohydroxamic acid and 2-phenylpropionohydroxamic acid were 3500 lmol. 1 cm 1 and 4500 lmol. 1 cm 1 respectively. Enzymatic activities were determined both by means of HPLC and by photometric methods. The photometric measurements were made at room temperature in 1 ml glass cells with a path length of 1 cm. The specific activity is indicated in enzyme units per mg of protein (U/mg). One unit is the enzymatic activity which catalyzes the conversion of 1 mol. of substrate or the formation of 1 mol. of product in one minute. EXAMPLE 1 Cells of Rhodococcus erythropolis MPSO were grown in ammonium-free mineral medium with succinate (10 mM) as the carbon and energy source, ketoprofenamide (1 mM) as the nitrogen source and 3% of complex medium (NB). At the end of the exponential growth phase, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in Tris/HCl buffer (30 mM, pH 7.5) and resuspended in the same buffer to give an optical density (OD 546 nm) of 16.0. 2.75 ml of Tris/HCl buffer (30 mM, pH 7.5) were placed in each of two 25 ml Erlenmeyer flasks with baffles and 54 mg of phenylacetamide (PAA) or 23.6 mg of acetamide were added. The flasks were then incubated at 30 C. in a vibrating water bath until the PAA or the acetamide had completely dissolved. 1 ml of a freshly prepared hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M), freshly neutralized with NaOH (10 M), was added to each flask. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.25 ml of the cellular suspension to each flask. The total volume was 4 ml. The optical density (OD 546 nm) in the experiment was 1.0. The batch contained 0.1 M amide and 0.5 M hydroxylamine. 0.3 ml aliquots of the cellular suspensions were withdrawn at intervals of 2 min and pipetted into 600 l of an iron(III) chloride solution acidified with hydrochloric acid. The cells were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was diluted again in a ratio of 1 to 10 with iron(III) chloride solution. The extinction was measured at 500 nm and the content of phenylacetohydroxamic acid () or acetohydroxamic acid () was determined by means of the appropriate calibration lines (cf. FIG. 1 ). Corresponding batches without quiescent cells were incubated in parallel in order to exclude the production of hydroxamic acid by a chemical reaction. No hydroxamic acid formation could be detected in the control batches over the observation period of 30 min. In a further batch (total volume 4 ml, OD 546 nm1.0), quiescent cells of the MP50 strain were incubated with PAA (100 mM) without hydroxylamine. 0.3 ml of the cellular suspension was withdrawn every 5 min, the cells were removed by centrifugation and the concentration of phenylacetic acid () was determined by means of HPLC. As shown in FIG. 1 , with acetamide and phenylacetamide (PAA) as substrates in the presence of hydroxylamine, Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 shows an acyltransferase activity which is markedly higher than the specific activity of the cells in the hydrolysis of PAA to the corresponding carboxylic acid. The specific activities for the formation of phenylacetic acid and phenylacetohydroxamic acid were 0.54 and 7.83 U/mg protein respectively. Acetohydroxamic acid was formed with a specific activity of 2.22 U/mg protein. EXAMPLE 2 Since acyltransferase activity could be detected in quiescent cells of the MPSO strain in Example 1, the experiments were repeated with crude extracts from induced cells. Again it was possible to detect acyltransferase activity towards PAA and acetamide in the presence of hydroxylamine (FIG. 2 ). The enzymatic hydrolysis of PAA to phenylacetic acid took place with a specific activity of 0.67 U/mg protein. The specific activities in the formation of phenylacetohydroxamic acid and acetohydroxami.c acid were 7.27 U/mg and 7.80 U/mg protein respectively, i.e. more than ten times higher than in the hydrolysis of PAA. The experimental procedure was as follows: Cells of Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 were grown with ketoprofenamide (1 mM) as the nitrogen source and harvested in the late exponential phase. Crude extract was prepared therefrom. 10 l of the crude extract (6.5 g of protein) were diluted with 640 l of Tris/HCl buffer (30 mM, pH 7.5) in an Eppendorf reaction vessel and mixed with 250 l of a freshly neutralized, aqueous hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M). The reaction was started by the addition of 100 l of a methanolic phenylacetamide solution (PAA, 50 mM) or an acetamide solution (50 mM) in Tris/HCl buffer (30 mM, pH 7.5) and took place at room temperature. The total volume was 1 ml. The concentrations of the amide and the hydroxylamine in the reaction were 5 mM and 0.5 M. 100 l of the batch were withdrawn every two minutes and mixed with 800 l of an iron(III) chloride solution acidified with hydrochloric acid. The strongly acidic solution denatured the protein and stopped the enzymatic reaction. Precipitated protein was centrifuged off and the extinction of the supernatant was determined by spectrophotometry at 500 nm. The concentrations of phenylacetohydroxamic acid () and acetohydroxamic acid () were determined by means of the appropriate calibration lines. To determine the amidase activity, 10 l of crude extract were diluted in 0.89 ml of Tris/HCl buffer (30 mM, pH 7.5). The reaction was started by the addition of 100 l of methanolic PAA solution. The total volume was 1 ml and the PAA concentration was 5 mM. 100 l aliquots of the reaction mixture were pipetted at regular intervals into 10 l of 1 N HCl, precipitated protein was centrifuged off and the phenylacetic acid concentration () was determined by means of HPLC. EXAMPLE 3 An acyltransferase activity could be detected in quiescent: cells and in crude extract of the MPSO strain. It still remained to demonstrate whether the amidase activity and the acyltransferase activity did indeed originate from the same enzyme. The formation of hydroxamic acid with amidase purified to homogeneity proved that acyltransferase and amidase were one and the same enzyme (Table 1). As shown in Table 1 below, the acyltransferase activity towards 2-phenylpropionamide was about three times as high as the amidase activity. The formation of acetohydroxamic acid proceeded four times as rapidly as the saponification to acetic acid, and phenylacetohydroxamic acid was even produced nine times as rapidly as phenylacetic acid. Thus, without exception, the amidase from the MP50 strain showed higher specific activities in the formation of hydroxamic acid than in the hydrolysis of the amides to the carboxylic acids. TABLE 1 Specific activities in the formation of carboxylic acids and hydroxamic acids from carboxamides by means of the purified amidase Spec. activity Substrate Product U/mg protein acetamide acetic acid 0.83 acetamide acetohydroxamic acid 3.54 phenylacetamide phenylacetic acid 4.10 phenylacetamide phenylacetohydroxamic acid 36.61 2-phenylpropion- 2-phenylpropionic acid 4.50 amide 2-phenylpropion- 2-phenylpropionohydroxamic 13.02 amide acid For determination of the acyltransferase activity, 10 l of purified amidase (2.6 g of protein) were diluted with 0.64 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) in an Eppendorf reaction vessel. 0.25 ml of a freshly prepared hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M), neutralized with sodium hydroxide solution, was pipetted in. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.1 ml of a methanolic stock solution (50 mM) of the appropriate amide. Acetamide (50 mM) was dissolved in sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) and then added. The total volume was 1 ml. The concentrations of hydroxylamine and the appropriate amide were 0.5 M and 5 mM respectively. Over a period of 20 min, four 0.1 ml aliquots of the reaction mixture were pipetted into 0.8 ml of iron(III) chloride solution acidified with hydrochloric acid, and the extinction of the hydroxamic acid complex was measured by photometry at 500 nm. The concentration of the hydroxamic acids was determined via the appropriate calibration lines. For determination of the amidase activity, the same amount of protein was diluted in 0.89 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) and the appropriate amide (5 mM) was then added. The concentrations of the carboxylic acids formed were measured by means of HPLC. In the reaction with acetamide, the amount of ammonium liberated was determined by the indophenol method. EXAMPLE 4 The fact that acyltransferases, and especially the acyltransferase recovered from Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50, are active as enantioselective catalysts was demonstrated as follows: Racemic 2-phenylpropionamide (2-PPA) was chosen as the model substrate for the studies. The purified enzyme was incubated with (R,S)-2-PPA (5 mM) in the presence of hydroxylamine (0.5 M), the formation of hydroxamic acid being monitored both by means of photometry and by means of ion pair chromatography. The experiments showed that the formation of hydroxamic acid slowed down drastically after 50% conversion of the substrate (FIG. 3 ). Study of the enzymatically formed 2-phenylpropiono-hydroxamic acid (2-PPHA) by means of a chiral HPLC column showed that only one enantiomer of hydroxamic acid was formed up to 46% conversion of the substrate. The formation of 2-phenylpropionic acid could not be observed in the presence of hydroxylamine. The amidase from the MP50 strain was indeed capable of converting racemic 2-PPA enantioselectively to 2-PPHA. The specific activity at the beginning of the reaction was 9.73 U/mg protein for the formation of hydroxamic acid, so it was somewhat below the maximum attained value of 13.02 U/mg (cf. Table 1) . The marked drop in activity was very clearly observable when 50% of the racemic substrate had been converted. Separation of the enzymatically formed hydroxamic acid by means of a chiral HPLC column showed that only one enantiomer appeared up to 46% conversion. The enantiomeric excess was thus greater than 99%. The experimental procedure was as follows: 10 l of purified amidase (2.6 g of protein) were diluted in 0.64 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) in an Eppendorf reaction vessel and then incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 0.25 ml of a freshly prepared and neutralized hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M). The reaction was started by the addition of 0.1 ml of a methanolic solution of (R,S)-2-PPA (50 mM stock solution). The total volume was 1 ml. The concentration of hydroxylamine was 0.5 M. The initial amide concentration was 5 mM. 50 l aliquots of the reaction mixture were pipetted into 5 l of 1 N HCl at regular intervals. Denatured protein was centrifuged off and the concentrations of amide () and hydroxamic acid () were determined by means of ion pair chromatography. The enantiomeric ratio () of the 2-PPHA was studied with a chiral HPLC column (Chiral-HSA). For this purpose, the 2-PPA and 2-PPHA had to be separated first through a Grom-Sil 120 TMS-2CP prepacked column. EXAMPLE 5 The optically pure 2-phenylpropionohydroxamic acid prepared in Example 4 was converted to the corresponding 1-phenylethylamine, also optically pure, by the following procedure: To remove the excess hydroxylamine, the reaction product obtained in Example 4 was first acidified with 1 N HCl. The pH of the solution was then about 0 to 1. Acidification caused the hydroxylamine to decompose to ammonium and nitrous oxide. This decomposition was assisted by keeping the reaction mixture at 80 C. in a water bath for 10 min. When the evolution of gas had ceased, the pH was readjusted to about 5 with sodium hydroxide solution. About 10 times the amount of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) - based on the 2-phenylpropionohydroxamic acidwas then added. The concentration of the 1-phenylethylamine formed was determined by means of ion pair chromatography and its enantiomeric excess was measured with the aid of a chiral HPLC column (Crownpak CR()). EXAMPLE 6 A reaction was carried out with the same reactants as those described in Example 5 except that, every time the enzymatic formation of hydroxamic acid was supposed to be stopped, a separate batch was started. This was done by diluting 10 l of the purified amidase (1.710 3 mg of protein) with 315 l of sodium phosphate buffer (54 mM, pH 7.5) in an Eppendorf reaction vessel and incubating it with 125 l of a freshly prepared and neutralized hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M). The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of 50 l of a methanolic solution of 2-PPA (50 mM). The total volume of each batch was 0.5 ml. The concentrations of 2-PPA and hydroxylamine were 5 mM and 0.5 M. 10 identical batches were started and were stopped at intervals of 10 min by the addition of 50 l of 1 N HCl. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation and 50 l were withdrawn from the batch for HPLC measurements to determine the concentrations of 2-PPA and 2-PPHA. The remaining 500 l were heated for 10 min at 800C in a water batch in order to boil off the hydroxylamine. After the samples had cooled to room temperature, the pH was adjusted to 4.5 by the addition of 29 l of 1 N NaOH. 9.6 mg of EDC (100 mM) were added and the mixture was heated again for one hour at 80 C. The concentration of the 1-phenylethylamine formed was determined by means of ion pair chromatography, as in Example 3, and its enantiomeric excess was measured with the aid of a chiral HPLC column (Crownpak CR()). EXAMPLE 7 To prepare larger amounts of hydroxamic acid, the initial procedure for recovering the enzymatically active material is as follows: A culture medium for growing Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 is prepared first; it has the following composition: NaHPO 4 .12H 2 O 14.0 g KH 2 PO 4 2.0 g CaCl 2 .2H 2 O 0.005 g Fe(III) citrate.7H 2 O 0.02 g MgSO 4 .7H 2 O 1.0 g Trace element solution SL6 1.0 ml (after Pfennig Lipper, 1966) but without EDTA and FeSO 4 Disodium succinate 1.62 g Nutrient broth solution 30 ml Phenylacetonitrile 0.18 g H 2 O ad 1000 ml 10 ml of this medium were inoculated with 0.1 ml of a liquid culture of Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 on nutrient. broth and incubated overnight in an Erlenmeyer flask with baffles, at 30 C., on a shaker at 150 rpm. This culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of fresh medium in an Erlenmeyer flask with baffles, which was incubated under the same conditions for 18 to 24 h. This culture in turn was used as an inoculum for 700 ml of culture medium in a 3 1 Erlenmeyer flask with notches. The cells were harvested by centrifugation in the late exponential growth phase and used, or fast-frozen at 70 C. and stored at 25 C. Cell digestion, crude extract recovery and enzyme purification are carried out as described in Journal of Bacteriology: B. Hirrlinger, A. Stolz H. -J. Knackmuss (1996), Purification and Properties of an Amidase from Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 which Enantioselectively Hydrolyzes 2-Arylpropionamides, Journal of Bacteriology 178 (12), pp. 3501-3507. S-2-Phenylpropionohydroxamic acid was then prepared as follows using the enzymatically active material recovered in this way: 125 U of acyltransferase in the form of whole cells, crude extract or purified enzyme were mixed, using a magnetic stirrer, with 3.2 1 of sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) in a wide-mouth Schott flask with a volume of 10 1. 1.25 1 of a freshly prepared aqueous hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M), adjusted to pH 7 with sodium hydroxide solution, were added and the mixture was stirred for 10 min at room temperature. The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of 3.725 g (0.025 mol.) of (R,S)-phenylpropionamide (dissolved in 500 ml of methanol). The course of the reaction was monitored by means of ion pair chromatography. After 120 min, the conversion of the S enantiomer of the amide to the corresponding hydroxamic acid was complete and the cells were removed by centrifugation, or the crude extract or the purified enzyme was denatured by raising the pH to 10 with sodium hydroxide solution, and then centrifuged off. To separate the enzymatically formed S-2-phenylpropiano-hydroxamic acid from the unconverted R-2-phenylpropionamide, the amide was extracted from the alkaline aqueous solution by shaking with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. The aqueous solution was then adjusted to pH 2 with conc. HCl and re-extracted with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. Removal of the organic solvent under vacuum gave 1.9 g (0.012 mol.) of S-2-phenylpropionohydroxamic acid. The enantiomeric excess, determined by means of measurements with a chiral HPLC column, was 99%. EXAMPLE 8 S-2-Phenylpropionohydroxamic acid was prepared as follows using the enzymatically active material prepared as described in Example 7: 125 U of acyltransferase in the form of immobilized whole cells or immobilized purified enzyme were mixed, using a magnetic stirrer, with 3.2 1 of sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) in a wide-mouth Schott flask with a volume of 10 1. 1.25 1 of a freshly prepared aqueous hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M), adjusted to pH 7 with sodium hydroxide solution, were added and the mixture was stirred for 10 min at room temperature. The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of 3.725 g (0.02s mol.) of (R,S)-2-phenylpropionamide (dissolved in 500 ml of methanol). The course of the reaction was monitored by means of ion pair chromatography. After 120 min, the conversion of the S enantiomer of the amide to the corresponding hydroxamic acid was complete and the immobilized cells or the immobilized enzyme were filtered off and stored for subsequent use in sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) at 4 C. To separate the enzymatically formed S-2-phenylpropiono-hydroxamic acid from the unconverted R-2-phenylpropionamide, the aqueous solution was adjusted to pH with sodium hydroxide solution and the amide was extracted from the alkaline aqueous solution by shaking with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. The aqueous solution was then adjusted to pH 2 with conc. HCl and re-extracted with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. Removal of the organic solvent under vacuum gave 1.9 g (0.012 mol.) of S-2-phenylpropionohydroxamic acid. The enantiomeric excess, determined by means of measurements with a chiral HPLC column, was 99%. EXAMPLE 9 After O-acylation, the enantiomerically pure hydroxamic acids recovered by the methods described in Examples 7 to 9 can be converted to the isocyanate by heating or by treatment with bases in aprotic solvents. After the addition of water, the isocyanate forms an unstable carbamic acid, which reacts further to give the primary amine with the elimination of CO 2 . As the Lossen rearrangement proceeds with retention of the configuration at the migrating carbon atom, the products obtained are optically active primary amines. EXAMPLE 10 The following procedure was adopted for the production of chiral primary amines without prior isolation of the hydroxamic acid: 125 U of acyltransferase in the form of whole cells, crude extract or purified enzyme were mixed, using a magnetic stirrer, with 3.2 1 of sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) in a wide-mouth Schott flask with a volume of 10 1. 1.25 1 of a freshly prepared aqueous hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M), adjusted to pH 7 with sodium hydroxide solution, were added and the mixture was stirred for 10 min at room temperature. The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of 3.725 g (0.025 mol.) of (R,S)-2-phenylpropionamide (dissolved in 500 ml of methanol). The course of the reaction was monitored by means of ion pair chromatography. After 120 min, the conversion of the S enantiomer of the amide to the corresponding hydroxamic acid was complete and the cells were removed by centrifugation, or the crude extract or the purified enzyme was denatured by acidification to pH 1 with conc. HCl, and then centrifuged off. To remove the excess hydroxylamine, the aqueous solution was heated for 30 min at 80 C., with stirring. No further evolution of gas due to decomposing hydroxylamine could then be observed. After the solution had cooled to room temperature, its pH was adjusted to 4.5 with sodium hydroxide solution. For derivatization of the hydroxamic acid, 96 g (0.62 mol.) of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide (EDC) were added to the aqueous solution, with stirring, and the solution was then heated for 2 h at 80 C., with stirring. To separate the R-2-phenylpropionamide remaining from the enzymatic reaction from the S-1-phenylethylamine formed in the Lossen rearrangement, the aqueous solution was acidified to pH 1 with conc. HCl and the amide was extracted by shaking with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. The aqueous solution was then adjusted to pH 10 with sodium hydroxide solution and the amine was isolated by shaking with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. Removal of the solvent under vacuum gave 1.2 9 (0.096 mol.) of S-1-phenylethylamine with an enantiomeric excess of 99%. EXAMPLE 11 Analogously to the procedure described in Example 10, S-1-phenylethylamine was prepared as follows, by a Lossen rearrangement, without prior isolation of the corresponding hydroxamic acid: 125 U of acyltransferase in the form of immobilized whole cells or immobilized purified enzyme were mixed, using a magnetic stirrer, with 3.2 1 of sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) in a wide-mouth Schott flask with a volume of 10 1. 1.25 1 of a freshly prepared aqueous hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M), adjusted to pH 7 with sodium hydroxide solution, were added and the mixture was stirred for 10 min at room temperature. The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of 3.725 g (0.025 mol.) of (R,S)-2-phenylpropionamide (dissolved in 500 ml of methanol). The course of the reaction was monitored by means of ion pair chromatography. After 120 min, the conversion of the S enantiomer of the amide to the corresponding hydroxamic acid was complete and the immobilized cells or the immobilized enzyme were filtered off and stored for subsequent use in sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) at 4 C. To remove the excess hydroxylamine, the aqueous solution was adjusted to pH 1 with conc. HCl and heated for 30 min at 80 C., with stirring. No further evolution of gas due to decomposing hydroxylamine could then be observed. After the solution had cooled to room temperature, its pH was adjusted to 4.5 with sodium hydroxide solution. For derivatization of the hydroxamic acid, 96 g (0.62 mol.) of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) were added to the aqueous solution, with stirring, and the solution was then heated for 2 h at 80 C., with stirring. To separate the R-2-phenylpropionamide remaining from the enzymatic reaction from the S-1-phenylethylamine formed in the Lossen rearrangement, the aqueous solution was acidified to pH 1 with conc. HCl and the amide was extracted by shaking with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. The aqueous solution was then adjusted to pH 10 with sodium hydroxide solution and the amine was isolated by shaking with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride.

This application claims priority from copending provisional application(s) Ser. No. 60/116,541 filed on Jan. 19, 1999. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION One of the most common practices for controlling undesirable plant species is the use of post-emergent selective herbicides. For example, certain compounds which inhibit the enzymes acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and/or 5-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate-dioxygenase (HPPD) are known herbicides which are effective against certain annual and perennial grass and broadleaf weeds. Unfortunately these herbicides cannot be used in all crops, especially cereal crops such as corn, wheat, barley and rice, because of unacceptable crop tolerance. Therefore what is needed in the art is a herbicide which is effective against weeds, while protecting the gramineous crop from injury. It is known, for example from U.S. Pat. No. 4,931,581 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,229,384, that certain benzothiadiazole derivatives have the capability to prevent healthy plants from attack by harmful microorganisms by stimulating the plantsown biological defense system. The term for the plant response on such stimulating agents is systemic acquired resistance (SAR). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a a method for protecting cereal crops from injury caused by a herbicidally effective amount of a herbicide, in particular, selected from the group consisting of AHAS-inhibiting, ACCase-inhibiting and HPPD-inhibiting herbicides, which comprises applying to the crop plant, the seed of the crop, or the soil surrounding the crop or crop seed an effective non-phytotoxic antidotal amount of a benzothiazole derivative of formula I wherein A represents an alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, hydroxy, cyano or nitro group or a group of the formula in which W represents O or S, and R represents a hydroxy, thiol, alkoxy, thioalkyl, amino, alkylamino or dialkylamino group; and X represents CH or N. This invention also includes a safened herbicidal composition which is effective against weeds, but spares the crop. The invention furthermore relates to seeds treated with an effective nonphytotoxic antidotal amount a benzothiazole derivative of formula I. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description and the appended claims. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The invention relates to a method for protecting cereal crops from injury caused by a herbicidally effective amount of herbicides which comprises applying to the crop plant, the seed of the crop, or to the soil surrounding the crop or crop seed an effective non-phytotoxic antidotal amount of a benzothiazole derivative of formula I. Benzothiazole derivatives which are suitable for use in the present invention are the compounds of formula I. Of these, preferred benzothiazole derivatives are the compounds of formula I wherein X represents N, and A is a COSCH 3 group attached to the 7-position of the benzothiazole moiety or a methyl, cyano, hydroxy or difluoromethoxy group attached to the 4-, 5- or 6-position of the benzothiazole moiety. The benzothiadiazole derivatives of formula I wherein A 1 represents a methyl, hydroxy, or a C 1-6 fluoroalkoxy group, are especially preferred for safening seeds, especially barley seeds. As used herein, Halogen means a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, and preferably is fluorine, chlorine or bromine. Generally, when any of the above mentioned moieties comprises an alkyl or alkoxy group, such groups, unless otherwise specified, may be linear or branched and may contain 1 to 6, and preferably 1 to 4, carbon atoms. Examples of such alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl and butyl. Representative alkoxy groups are those such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, and the corresponding branched chain analogs thereof. Generally, when any of the above mentioned moieties comprises a haloalkoxy group, such groups, unless otherwise specified, may be linear or branched and may contain 1 to 6, and preferably 1 to 4, carbon atoms. Examples of such groups are halomethoxy, haloethoxy, halopropoxy, haloisopropoxy, halobutoxy, haloisobutoxy and halo-tertiary-butoxy groups. Haloalkoxy moieties of any groups within the definitions used herein can contain one or more halogen atoms, preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine. Haloalkoxy preferably represents mono-, di-, tri- or perfluoroalkoxy groups, especially difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, pentafluoroethoxy, or 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy, with difluoromethoxy being especially preferred. The alkylamino groups are those wherein the alkyl portion contains 1 to 6, and preferably 1 to 4, carbon atoms, and are typically aminomethyl, 2-aminoethyl and the like. Dialkylamino substituents likewise contain 1 to 6, and preferably 1 to 4, carbon atoms in the alkyl portion, as representative variants include dimethylamino, diethylamino and the like for safening seeds, especially barley seeds. Most preferred are the benzothiazoles selected from the group consisting of 4-difluoromethoxybenzo-1,2,3-thiadiazole, 5-cyanobenzo-1,2,3-thiadiazole, 6-methylbenzo-1,2,3-thiadiazole and 6-hydroxybenzo-1,2,3-thiadiazole. Another preferred group of benzothiazoles are those compounds of formula I wherein X represents CH, and A is a nitro group attached to the 5-position of the benzothiazole moiety. The benzothiazoles of formula I are known in the art and may be prepared by the processes described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,931,581, and 5,229,384, EP 0 039 795 and British Patent 1177972. Herbicides which are suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, AHAS-inhibiting herbicides, ACCase-inhibiting herbicides and HPPD-inhibiting herbicides. Preferred herbicides of the present invention include imidazolinone herbicides such as methyl 6-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl)-m-toluate and methyl 2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl)p-toluate (imazamethabenz-methyl), 5-ethyl-2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5oxo-2-imidazolin-2-y)nicotinic acid (imazethapyr), 2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-y)nicotinic acid, 5-methoxymethyl-2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5oxo-2-imidazolin-2-y)nicotinic acid and 2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl) quinoline-3-carboxylic acid (imazaquin); aryloxyphenoxy propionic acids, such as fenoxaprop including fenoxaprop-P and fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, and clodinafop including clodinafop-propargyl and a mixture of clodinafop-propargyl and cloquintocet; and benzothiopyran derivatives such as (E)-6-1-ethyl-5-(propylsulfonyl)oxypyrazol-4-ylcarbonyl-2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-4-oxo-1,1-dioxide-4H-1-benzothiopyran, 4-(O-methyloxime) and the zinc chelate of (E)-6-1-ethyl-5-hydroxypyrazol-4-ylcarbonyl-2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-4-oxo-1,1-dioxide-4H-1-benzothiopyran, 4-(O-methyloxime). Although many of these herbicides have been used with success in certain crops, they have been found to be phytotoxic in many cereal crops. Surprisingly, it has been found that by applying certain benzothiazole derivatives of formula I to the crop plant, the seed of the crop, or the soil surrounding the crop or crop seed, the herbicide is safened. Safening of cereal crops such as corn, wheat, barley and rice from the post emergence application of herbicides may also be effected by allowing said crop plants to grow until the third to early fourth leaf stage and then spraying with an aqueous solution of the safener either alone, or tank-mixed with at least one of the above-described herbicides. The tank mix should contain effective amounts of herbicide and effective amounts of the safener. Although rates will naturally vary with the particular herbicide and crop, typical rates of application for the safener are about 0.05 kg/ha to 2.0 kg/ha. The application rate of the compound of the herbicides is usually in the range of 0.001 to 2.0 kg/ha, with rates between 0.02-0.5 kg/ha often achieving satisfactory control. In general, the preferred application rate of the herbicides is in the range of 0.01 to 0.5 kg/ha, preferably 0.02-0.3 kg/ha. The optimal rate for a specific application will depend on the crop(s) under cultivation and the predominant species of infesting weed species, and readily may be determined by established biological tests known to those skilled in the art. A wide variety of troublesome weed species can also be effectively controlled in the presence of important agronomic crops such as corn, wheat, barley and rice by safening the crop plants by any conventional seed treatment techniques or uniformly coating the seeds with 0.01 to 0.5 % by weight of the safener. The herbicides can be co-formulated together with the safener in a suitable ratio according to the present invention, together with usual carriers and/or additives known in the art. Accordingly, the present invention further provides a herbicidal composition which comprises a carrier and, as active ingredient, at least one herbicide as defined above and at least one safener compound of formula I as defined above. A method of making such a composition is also provided which comprises bringing the compound of formula I and the herbicidal active ingredient as defined above into association with at least one carrier. It is also envisaged that diflerent isomers or mixtures of isomers of formula I and/or the herbcidal active ingredient may have different levels or spectra of activity and thus compositions may comprise individual isomers or mixtures of isomers. A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which maybe, for example, a plant, seed, foliage, soil, or into the water where the plant grows, or to the roots or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including material which is normally a gas but which has been compressed to form a liquid. The compositions may be manufactured into a variety of formulations suitable for agricultural use, e.g. emulsion concentrates, solutions, oil in water emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, suspension concentrates, dusts, granules, water dispersible granules, tablets, micro-capsules, gels and other formulation types by well-established procedures. These procedures include intensive mixing and/or milling of the active ingredients with other substances, such as fillers, solvents, solid carriers, surface active compounds (surfactants), and optionally, solid and/or liquid auxilaries and/or adjuvants. The form of application, such as spraying, atomizing, dispersing or pouring may be chosen according to the desired objectives and the given circumstances. The biological activity of the active ingredient can also be increased by including an adjuvant in the formulation or the spray dilution. An adjuvant is defined here as a substance which can increase the biological activity of an active ingredient but which, by itself, is not significantly biologically active. The adjuvant can either be included in the formulation as a coformulant or carrier, or can be added to the spray tank together with the formulation containing the active ingredient. As a commodity, the compositions of the present invention are preferably in a concentrated form which is then diluted for use by the end user. The concentrated compositions are typically diluted to a concentration down to 0.001% of active ingredient for application to the target. The typical doses of the herbicide ingredient are usually in the range from 0.01 to 0.5 kg ha and of safener are usually in the range from 0.05 to 2.0 kg/ha. In a preferred embodiment, the herbicide and the safener of formula I are added to the tank mix together each as individual formulations. A preferred embodiment of the present invention thus relates to a kit for the preparation of a spray mixture consisting of two separate containers: (a) a container which comprises at least one safener of formula I, conventional carriers and optional adjuvants; and (b) a container which comprises at least one herbicidal active ingredient, preferably one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of methyl 6-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl)-m-toluate, methyl 2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl)p-toluate, 5-ethyl-2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl)nicotinic acid, 5-methoxymethyl-2-(4-isopropyl-4methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl)nicotinic acid, 2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl) quinoline-3-carboxylic acid; fenoxaprop; clodinafop; (E)-6-1-ethyl-5-(propylsulfonyl)oxypyrazol-4-ylcarbonyl-2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-4-oxo-1,1-dioxide-4H-1-benzothiopyran, 4-(O-methyloxime) and the zinc chelate of (E)-6-1-ethyl-5-hydroxypyrazol-4-ylcarbonyl-2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-4-oxo-1,1-dioxide-4H-1-benzothiopyran, 4-(O-methyloxime), conventional carriers and optional adjuvants. In a preferred embodiment, the kit will consist of two bottles with dispensing means which allow the easy and correct addition of the active ingredients (a) and (b) to the tank mix. The compositions of this invention can be applied to the plants or their environment simultaneously with, or in succession to, other active substances. These other active substances can be fertilizers, agents which donate trace elements, or other preparations which influence plant growth. However, they can also be other fungicides, selective herbicides, insecticides, bactericides, nematicides, algicides, molluscidides, rodenticides, virucides, compounds inducing resistance into plants, biological control agents, such as viruses, bacteria, nematodes, fungi and other microorganisms, repellents of birds and animals, and plant growth regulators, or mixtures of several of these preparations, if appropriate together with other carrier substances conventionally used in the art of formulation, surfactants or other additives which promote application. The present invention is of wide applicability in the protection of crops, trees, residential and ornamental plants against attack by weed species. Preferred crops are cereals, such as corn, wheat and barley, rice, as well as vines and apples. The duration of the protection is normally dependent on the individual compound selected, and also a variety of external factors, such as climate, whose impact is normally mitigated by the use of a suitable formulation. The following examples further illustrate the present invention. It should be understood, however, that the scope of the invention is not limited solely to the particular examples given below.

EXAMPLE 1 Benzothiazole Corn Seed Treatment as Safener for Benzothiopyran Herbicides Titrations of herbicides with untreated seed were used to determine a herbicide dose that would cause approximately 50% injury. Seed treatments were achieved by dissolving the test compounds in acetone at 1 mg/ml then treating six corn seeds at a dose of 1 mg of test compound per seed. The seed treatments were applied one day before planting. The seeds were then planted in cups containing artificial soil, and the cups were placed in aluminum pans. The herbicides were dissolved in 500 ml water. The plants in the aluminum pans were placed in a greenhouse, and the herbicide solutions were added to the aluminum pans. The plants absorbed the herbicides through the water solution taken up through the cups. Water was added to the pans daily throughout the tests. The results of the test were evaluated twelve days after planting and are shown in the following table I.

The respective safener was dissolved in water (formulated material) or 80/20 acetoneAwater (technical material) at the concentration needed to give the desired loading of safener in g per kg seed. This solution was poured onto the seeds and the jar was shaken vigorously until all the seeds were bathed in the safener solution. The seeds were then poured onto a glass plate and left in the fume hood to dry. The dry seeds were planted into greenhouse soil (see below) and were treated with herbicides seven days after planting (post-emergence application). Herbicide treatments were applied in water (formulated material) or in acetonic solution (technical material), respectively. This solution was prepared by dissolving the technical material at a concentration of 0.5% a.i. in acetone containing 0.5% of the adjuvant Triton X-100. The solution was topped up with water to give the final volume needed for the application and was applied with a pneumatic sprayer calibrated to deliver 400 I/ha spray volume. All plants were grown in a mixture of field soil (sandy loam soil with 1.9% organic matter, pH7.7) and compost 1/1.

The benzothiadiazole No. 2 (BION), which controls powdery mildew in cereals by inducing systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in cereals, caused some inherent phytotoxicity in barley when used as a seed treatment. However, at the applied rate of 1 g/kg seed the SAR-compound No. 2 clearly reduced crop injury resulting from the post-emergence application of aryloxyphenoxy propionic acids such as fenoxaprop and clodinafop compared to plants grown from untreated seeds. None of the other benzothiadiazole derivatives used in the tests as a seed treatment caused crop injury in barley, and reduced crop damage of post-emergence treatments of aryloxyphenoxy propionic acids. In particular, Compounds No. 1 and No. 6 displayed marked safening effects to crop injury caused by either fenoxaprop P, clodinafop or the combination of clodinafop and cloquintocet.

PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE COMPOUNDS OF THE INVENTION EXAMPLE 25 In vitro Activity Murine leukaemia L1210 and human colon carcinoma HT-29 were used in vitro. The cells are cultured in RPMI 1640 complete culture medium comprising 10% foetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 50 units/ml of penicillin, 50 g/ml of streptomycin and 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4. The cells are distributed on microplates and are exposed to the cytotoxic compounds for four doubling periods, that is to say 48 hours (L1210) or 96 hours (HT-29). The number of viable cells is then quantified by a calorimetric assay, the Microculture Tetrazolium Assay (J. Carmichael et al., Cancer Res .; 47, 936-942, (1987)). The results are expressed as IC 50 , the cytotoxic concentration that inhibits the proliferation of the treated cells by 50%. In this test, the compound of Example 9 has an IC 50 of 88 nM.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is the U.S. National Phase of PCT/US98/11095 pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 371, which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/049.404, filed Jun. 12. 1997 and U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/052.027, filed Jul. 9. 1997. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to synthetic analogues of naturally occurring antiviral 2,5-oligoadenylates wherein at least one of the nucleoside residues is replaced with a modified nucleoside. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The discovery of the 2-5 oligoadenylates is connected with the study of the mechanisms of interferon action as the cellular response to virus infection 2. The 5-triphosphate of the (2-5) oligoadenylate trimer plays a most important role in the antiviral mechanism induced by interferon 3. It is generally regarded that activation of RNase L by 2-5A is key to the antiviral defense mechanisms. Interferon induces transcription of the enzyme 2-5A synthetase which produces 2,5-linked oligoadenylates upon activation of double-stranded RNA. Previously, the only known biochemical effect of 2-5A is activation of RNase L. This enzyme hydrolyzes mRNA and rRNA, thereby resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis. The activation of RNase L is transient unless 2-5A is continuously synthesized, since 2-5A is rapidly degraded. RNase L activation thus plays a critical role in inhibiting replication, and therefore in defending against infection by viruses. Naturally occurring (2-5)oligoadenylates (both 5-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) have shown different kinds of biological activity 45. Analogues of the natural (2-5)oligoadenylates have been synthesized to achieve new approaches to antiviral and antitumoral therapy 6-13. Biological activities of 5-phosphorylated (2-5)oligoadenylates are connected with the functioning of the (2-5)A system which leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis 3. The mechanism of action of unphosphorylated (2-5)oligoadenylates in many cases is still unknown. Recently, certain sugar-modified trimers of (2-5)oligoadenylates were found to be inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) 14-18. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The compounds of the present invention are useful in inhibiting viral infections in plants and mammals. The compounds and the water-soluble salts thereof are of the formula wherein m is zero, 1, 2 or 3; n is from 1 to 8, preferably 1, 2 or 3; most preferably 1 or 2; R is independently selected from the group consisting of provided that all R may not be R 1 is independently selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl and hydrogen; R 2 is independently selected from the group consisting of oxygen and sulfur. Preferably, all R 1 are hydroxyl and all R 2 are oxygen. According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, R is selected from the group consisting of According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, R is selected from the group consisting of According to yet another preferred embodiment of the invention, the R of the 2,3-terminal nucleoside moiety is Compounds of the invention include, for example, the following core compounds, the 5-mono, di-, and triphosphates thereof, and water-soluble salts of any of them: adenylyl-(2-5)-adenylyl-(2-5)-1-(-D-ribofuranosyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide; adenylyl-(2-5)-1-(-D-ribofuranosyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamideyl-(2-5)-adenosine; 1-(-D-ribofuranosyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamideyl-(2-5)-adenylyl-(2-5)-adenosine; adenylyl-(2-5)-adenylyl-(2-5)-N 6 -benzyladenosine; adenylyl-(2-5)-N 6 -benzyladenylyl-(2-5)-adenosine; N 6 -benzyladenylyl-(2-5)-adenylyl-(2-5)-adenosine; and N 6 -benzyladenylyl-(2-5)-N 6 benzyladenylyl-(2-5)-N 6 -benzyladenosine. The invention also comprises a method of treating viral infection in mammals or plants by administering an antivirally effective amount of a compound according to the above formula, or a water-soluble salt thereof. The invention further comprises an antiviral composition comprising such a compound or water soluble salt in combination with an agricultural carrier or pharmaceutical carrier. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Replacement of the adenine moiety in the (2-5)oligoadenylate trimer core with 1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide (TCA) or with N 6 -(benzylamino)purine (Ade Bn )-moieties has resulted in a new group of inhibitors of HIV-1 replication. Trimer compounds of the present invention and their synthesis intermediates are numbered 1 through 28 as follows for purposes of identification. Compound 29 is the authentic (2-5)oligoadenylate trimer core.

The substitution of sulfur for oxygen in the 2,5-phosphodiester backbone referenced above, introduces chirality into the molecules and introduces a new chemistry of the backbone. The core 2,5-phosphorothioates exhibit increased resistance to phosphodiesterase and phosphatases and new biological activities compared to authentic 2-5A cores. The preparation of the 2,5-phosphorothioates, including fully resolved enantiomers thereof, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,924,624 and is incorporated herein by reference. A mixture of phosphorothioate and phosphodiester linkages is possible in the same oligomer, providing molecules with a mixed phosphodiester/phosphorothioate backbone, as described in PCT/US95/10683, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. While the preparation and examples that follow are directed to oligomers of a base-modified adenosine, the procedure described is equally applicable to the manufacture of oligomers comprising a base-modified cordycepin, or mixed chain of cordycepin and adenosine residues as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,859,768, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. Chemical Synthesis Syntheses of the compounds of the present invention may be achieved by the phosphotriester method using a published approach 19. Synthetic N 6 -benzyladenosine 1 and 1-(-D-ribofuranosyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide 7, obtained by the reaction of microbiological transglycosylation as described before 20, are converted into the corresponding selectively blocked nucleosides 2-6 and 8-11 and corresponding nucleotides 13 and 14, respectively. Thus, treatment of 1 with monomethoxytrityl chloride (MeOTrCl) in pyridine gives the 5-O-monomethoxytrityl derivative 2 (85%). Benzoylation of 2 with benzoyl cyanide (BzCN) in MeCN 19 leads to a mixture of the 2,3-di-O-benzyl 3, 2-O-benzoyl 4, and 3-O-benzoyl 5 derivatives which are isolated by column chromatography (CC) in 38, 13, and 46% yield, respectively. Treatment of 3 with a 2% solution of TsOH in CH 2 CL 2 /MeOh 7:3 affords 2,3-di-O-benzoyl-N 6 -benzyladenosine 6 in 96% yield. Similarly, 7 is converted into the 5-O-monomethoxytrityl derivatives 8-10 in 92, 16, and 57% yield, respectively. Detritylation of 9 leads to the 5-OH derivative 11 in 78% yield. Furthermore, the reaction of the 3-O-benzoylated compounds 5 and 10 with 2-chlorophenyl bis (1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-phosphinate followed by subsequent treatments with 2-(4-nitrophenyl)-ethanol (NpeOH) and then a solution of 4-nitrobenzaldoxin in dioxane/H 2 O/Et 3 N 1:1:1, gives the corresponding nucleoside 2-phosphodiesters 13 and 14 which are isolated by CC (silica gel) in 82 and 48% yield, respectively. The compounds 6, 11, 13, and 14 and the corresponding adenosine derivatives 12 21 and 15 22 are then used in the syntheses of the new. (2-5)oligonucleotide trimers 22-29. Condensation of 2,3-di-O-benzoyl-N 6 -benzyladenosine 6 with the 2-phosphodiester 15 in pyridine in the presence of a mixture of 1H-triazole/2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (TpsCl) 3:1, followed by detritylation, leads to the 5-OH dimer 16 which is isolated by CC in 85% yield. Similar reaction sequences convert compounds 6 and 13, 12 and 13, 11 and 15, and 12 and 14, into the corresponding 5-OH dimers 17-20, isolated in 81, 87, 74, and 76% yield, respectively. The synthesis of 5-OH dimer 21 has been described earlier 22. The transformations of the dimers 16-20 to the trimer level is afforded the same techniques consisting of a condensation step and followed by successive treatment with 2% solution of TsOH, 0.5M DBU (1,8diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene)/(pyridine, and NH 3 /MeOH, respectively, to remove the three different protecting groups. Final purification by CC(DEAE-cellulose)ion exchange gives the trimers 22-28 in good to moderate yields. Biological Utility The compounds of the present invention may be combined with appropriate pharmaceutical or agricultural carriers to form an antiviral composition. For pharmaceutical use, the compounds of the invention may be taken up in pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as, solutions, suspensions, tablets, capsules, ointments, elixirs and injectable composition and the like. They are administered to subjects suffering from viral infection. The dosage administered depends upon the nature and severity of the infection, the disease stage, and, when administered systematically, the size and weight of the infected subject. The compounds are generally administered in the form of water-soluble salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable water soluble salts include, for example, the sodium, potassium or ammonium salts of the active compounds. They are readily dissolved in water or saline solution. Thus, the preferred formulation for pharmacological use comprises a saline solution of the desired compound in salt form. The formulation may further contain an agent, such as a sugar or protein, to maintain osmotic balance. The salt form of the compound is preferred owing to the relatively high acidity (about pH 3) of the acid form of the compounds. The compounds of the invention may be used as a treatment for humans and animals from viral infectives such as Herpes simplex, rhinovirus, hepatitis and other infections of the hepatitis virus family, Epstein Barr virus, measles virus, multiple sclerosis (which may be caused by a viral agent) and the various Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV), such as HIV-1, which causes cutaneous T cell lymphoma, HIV-2, which causes Sezary lymphoma, and HIV-3, which is responsible for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The compounds of the invention inhibit HIV-1 induced syncytia formation. The compounds may be applied topically to treat skin cancers caused by radiation, carcinogens or viral agents. Such skin cancers include cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, Sezary lymphoma, Xeroderma pigmentosium, ataxia telangiectasia and Blooms syndrome. A sufficient amount of a preparation containing a compound of the invention is applied to cover the lesion or affected area. An effective concentration of active agent is between about 10 3 M and 10 5 M, with 10 4 M being preferred. The compounds of the present invention may also be used to treat plant-infecting viruses, particularly tobacco mosaic virus, and other viruses which cause necrosis in turnips, cucumbers, orchids and in other plants. Such viruses include, but are not limited to, tobacco vein mottling virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, vaccinia virus, turnip necrosis virus, and cymbidium orchid virus. The compounds may be administered effectively to plants by topical application by abrasion of the leaf surface, aerosol spray, treatment of the soil, spraying, or dusting. An effective antiviral composition may be formed by combining one or more of the compounds of the invention with a carrier material suitable for agricultural use. The active compound may also be administered by spraying insect vectors such as aphids, thrips and whiteflies which carry virus to plants. The dosage administered depends upon the severity of the infection. The compounds of the invention may be applied to plant seeds prior to germination to control viruses contained in the germ plasm. The seeds may be soaked in a solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG) containing one or more of the compounds. PEG brings the seeds to physiological activity and arrest. The relative concentration of active compound to PEG depends upon the type of seed under treatment. Plants may be effectively treated with an aqueous formulation containing from about 10 1 to about 10 2 M concentration of active ingredient. The compounds of the invention may be applied at very low concentrations. An effective amount of active ingredient on the plant surface is from about 10 8 to about 10 12 mole per cm 2 of plant surface area, with about 10 10 mole to about 10 12 mole per cm 2 being preferred. For the typical tobacco plant, 10 5 M of compound is effective. At this rate, one pound of active ingredient is sufficient to treat 210 8 tobacco plants. For agricultural application, the compounds are advantageously administered in the form of water-soluble salts, e.g. ammonium or potassium salts. Sodium salts are generally avoided in treating edible plants. The compounds of the invention are readily dissolved in water, particularly at such low concentrations. Aqueous formulations for agricultural use may optionally contain a sticker and/or a UV-stabilizer. Such agents are well-known to those skilled in the art. Fatty acids (1%) are useful as spreader sticker agents. Effective UV-stabilizers include, for example, p-aminobenzoic acid. For antiviral use in mammals, the compounds of the invention are administered parenterally, such as intravenously, intraarterially, intramuscularly, subcutaneously or when administered as an anti-cancer agent, intratumorally. The preferred route of administration for antiviral therapy is intravenous injection. The compounds of the invention may be administered to mammals at very low concentrations. The actual dosage administered may take into account the size and weight of the patient, whether the nature of the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic in nature, the age, health and sex of the patient, the route of administration, the nature and stage of the affliction, and other factors. An effective daily dosage of active ingredient, based upon in vivo studies involving other 2-5A analogues, is from about 0.25 g per 70 kg of body weight (approximately 152 lbs) to about 2.5 g per 70 kg of body weight. The preferred daily dosage is about 0.5 g per 70 kg of body weight. Those skilled in the art should readily be able to derive appropriate dosages and schedules of administration to suit the specific circumstance and needs of the patient. It is expected that an effective treatment regimen includes administration of the daily dosage for two days. Treatment is continued at least until the disease condition is substantially abated. Preferably, the therapeutic end point is determined by testing for the continued presence of viral DNA. Such testing can be done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in which the presence of viral DNA is assayed according to conventional PCR. PCR primers of appropriate nucleotide sequences for amplification of viral DNA can be prepared from known viral nucleotide sequences. To obtain DNA for testing, patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells are lysed with an appropriate lysing agent, such as NP-40. Alternatively, testing for the continued presence of the virus can be performed by an antigen-antibody assay using any of the known monoclonal or polyclonal antisera against a protein antigen of the target virus protein coat. For example, an antigen-antibody assay may be employed to detect any of the protein antigen in the virus HIV protein coat, for example, the gp120, p17 or p24. Moreover, the target antigen is not limited merely to coat protein antigens. Antisera can be targeted against a suitable non-coat protein antigen, such as the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) molecule. Monoclonal antibodies to HIV RT are known. Sobol et al., Biochemistry 1991, 30, 10623. Additionally, testing for the presence of the infecting virus during or post-treatment could be accomplished by an assay which assesses the viral load in the patients blood stream. This can be done by determining syncytia formation. See procedure outlined in Henderson et al., Virology, 1991, 182, 186. In addition to administration with conventional carriers, the compounds of the present invention may be administered by a variety of specialized oligonucleotide or nucleic acid delivery techniques. 2-5A and its analogues have been successfully encapsulated in various encapsulating materials, such as in unilamellar liposomes and delivered with the aid of monoclonal antibodies to cells, Bayard et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 1985, 151, 319. Reconstituted Sendai virus envelopes have been successfully used to deliver RNA and DNA to cells, Arad et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1986, 859, 88. Moreover, the virus envelope is not limited to Sendai virus, but could include encapsulation in any retroviral amphotrophic particle. For example, an HIV envelope could be formed from any part or all of the outer protein coat of a non-infectious HIV particle. Such particles as gp 120 can be cloned by known recombinant techniques. These techniques may be utilized for introduction of the present 2-5A oligoadenylate derivatives into cells. It is further contemplated that the compounds of the invention may be administered in the form of prodrugs in which lipophilic groups are attached to, for example, the 5-terminal hydroxyl group of the core compound. Biological Studies Three studies were performed to determine the antiviral activity of the (2-5)oligonucleotide derivatives of the present invention: (i) inhibition of HIV-1-replication, (ii) inhibition of HIV-1 reverse-transcriptase (RT) activity, and (iii) activation of recombinant human GST-RNase L. All compounds were tested at a concentration of 300 M. Inhibition of HIV-1 Replication The infected centers assay as described by Henderson et al., Virology 1991, 182, 186, was used to measure the ability of the trimer core compounds of the invention to inhibit HIV-1 induced syncytia formation, an indicator of HIV-1 replication in T cells. Freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were treated with 2-5A trimer or derivatives for 2 hours and infected with HIV-1 strain IIIB at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 0.1. The infected PBL were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37 C. in a humidified 5% CO 2 in air atmosphere. After 48 hours, the cells were washed twice in Hanks balanced salt solution, serially diluted and seeded into multiple wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. Immediately, 210 5 exponentially growing Sup T1 cells were added to each well; Sup T1 cells readily form a syncytium with a cell which is productively infected with HIV-1. The wells were examined daily for the presence of syncytia, using a tissue culture microscope. The first signs of syncytia formation can be seen in 12 hours, with some complete syncytia developing by 24 hours. Final results were read at 72 hours. Each syncytium was counted as a single infected cell. The number of syncytia per seeded cell is determined and expressed as an infected center per infected cell. The number of syncytia per 10 4 cells was 12116 for the control Sup T1 cells. The data is shown in Table 1. The mean of triplicate determinations is shown; variance did not exceed 5-10%. Inhibition of HIV-1 Reverse-Transcriptase Activity Sup T1 cells were treated with trimer core compound at 300 M for 6 hours and then infected with HIV-1 at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 0.1. At 96 hours post-infection, culture supernatant was removed and HIV-1 RT activity was assayed in triplicate as described by Henderson et al., Virology 1991, 182, 186. Briefly in this method, 25 l of culture supernatant was added to a 50 l cocktail containing 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 20 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 60 mM NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet p-40, 5 g/ml oligodeoxythymidylic acid, 10 g/ml polyriboadenylic acid, 10 M deoxythymidine triphosphate and 1mCi 32 Pthymidine 5-triphosphate. The mixture was incubated at 37 C. for 2 hours. Fifty microliters of the cocktail were then spotted onto diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) paper, dried, washed with 2SSC solution (three times for 10 minutes each time) and 95% ethanol (two times for 5 minutes each time), dried and exposed to radiographic film for 18 to 24 hours at 80 C. The filters were cut and final quantitation was determined by scintillation spectrometry. The data for the HIV-1 RT activity is shown in Table 1 as a percent of RT activity. Control values for RT activity ranged from 15,000 to 16,000 dpm 32 P incorporated. The mean of duplicate determinations is shown in Table 1. Variance did not exceed 5-10%. Activation of Recombinant Human GST-RNase L Human recombinant RNase L was expressed in E. coli (DH5) as a fusion protein of glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Activation of human recombinant GST-RNase L was measured as the percent of poly(U) 32 PpCp hydrolyzed in the presence of authentic 2,5-oligoadenylate trimer core or trimer core analog of the invention as described by Sobol et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1995, 270, 5963. The data is shown in Table 1 as the mean of duplicate determinations. Variance did not exceed 5-10%.

On the other hand, the TCA-containing trimers 26-28 inhibited HIV-1 RT activity by 99.7, 99.7, and 99.5%, respectively; however, the inhibition of HIV-1 RT activity by the Ade Bn -containing trimers 22-25 was dependent on the position of the Ade Bn group in the oligonucleotide chain. The trimer 22, being N 6 -benzyl-substituted at the 5-terminus, inhibited HIV-1 RT activity by 33% compared to the trimers 23-25, which inhibited HIV-1 RT activity by 7.6, 16.7, and 10.6%. The TCA- and Ade Bn -containing (2-5)trimers inhibited recombinant human GST-RNase L activity as a function of the change in structure of the base moiety. The (2-5)trimer 26 with the TCA moiety at the 5-terminus activated GST-RNase L by 87.7%, compared to 50% hydrolysis of poly(U)-3- 32 PpCp with naturally occurring trimer 29. The (2-5)trimers 22-25 with the Ade Bn moiety instead of adenine activated GST-RNase L by 37.4, 34.8, O, and 13.6%, respectively. These data indicate that the adenine moiety at the 2,3-terminus of the (2-5)oligoadenylate trimer core 29 is essential for the activation of recombinant human RNase L.

Phosphorylation of Core Compounds The core compounds of the present invention may be 5-monophosphorylated according to the procedure of Sambrook el al., Molecular CloningA Laboratory Manual, 2 ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, pp. 5.68-5.71 (1989) with ATP with T4 polynucleotide kinase. 5-Monophosphorylation may be determined by reverse-phase HPLC analysis and confirmed by the subsequent hydrolysis of each 5-monophosphate derivative by 5-nucleotidase. Yields of phosphorylation range from 15% to 60%. In the case where the R 2 groups of all internucleotide bonds (Formula I) of the molecule comprise oxygen, i.e., the linkages comprise phosphodiester bonds, the 5-monophosphates are readily prepared by reacting the corresponding unphosphorylated core compound with POCl 3 . The 5-diphosphate and 5-triphosphate of the core compounds of the invention may be prepared by following the procedure of Example 8. EXAMPLE 8 All reactions are performed in glassware oven-dried at 125 C. for 18-24 hr. Core compound (400 OD units at 260 nm) is dissolved in 500 microliters of dry dimethylformamide (DMF) and dried in vacuo in a 10 ml conical flask at 35 C. This process is repeated three times. To the dry residue, 50 micromoles of triphenylphosphine, 100 micromoles of imidazole and 50 micromoles of dipyridinyl disulfide are added. The mixture is dissolved in 500 microliters dry DMF plus 50 microliters of dry dimethylsulfoxide. The solution is stirred with a stirring bar for 2 hr at room temperature. After 2 hr the solution is homogeneous (after 30 minutes, the solution begins to change to yellow). The solution is transferred dropwise to 10 ml of a 1% NaI/dry acetone (w/v) solution. The clear colorless precipitate which forms is the sodium salt of the 5-phosphoroimidazolidate. The precipitate is centrifuged at room temperature, the supernatant is decanted, and the precipitate is washed three times with 10 ml dry acetone. The centrifuging is repeated. The precipitate is dried over P 2 O 5 in vacuo for 2 hr. The precipitate is dissolved in 200 microliters of freshly prepared 0.5 M tributylammonium pyrophosphate in dry DMF. The solution is maintained at room temperature for 18 hr after which time the DMF is removed in vacuo. The residue is dissolved in 0.25M triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (TEAB) (pH 7.5). The 5-di and 5-triphosphate products are separated using a DEAE-Sephadex A25 column (HCO 3 -form; 120 cm) with a linear gradient of 0.25 M to 0.75 M TEAB. Fractions (10 ml) are collected. The product is observed by ultraviolet spectroscopy at 254 mn. The fractions containing the 5-di and 5-triphosphates are separately pooled and dried in vacuo. The TEAB is removed by repeated addition of water followed by lyophilization. The yield of the 5-diphosphate is about 5%; the yield of the 5-triphosphate is about 60%. All references cited with respect to synthetic, preparative and analytical procedures are incorporated by reference. The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof and, accordingly, reference should be made to the appended claims, rather than to the foregoing specification, as indication the scope of the invention.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel heterocyclic compounds which inhibit microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, and to methods for decreasing serum lipids and treating atherosclerosis employing such compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) catalyzes the transport of triglyceride (TG), cholesteryl ester (CE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) between small unilamellar vesicles (SUV). Wetterau Zilversmit, Chem. Phys. Lipids 38, 205-22 (1985). When transfer rates are expressed as the percent of the donor lipid transferred per time, MTP expresses a distinct preference for neutral lipid transport (TG and CE), relative to phospholipid transport. The protein from bovine liver has been isolated and characterized. Wetterau Zilversmit, Chem. Phys. Lipids 38, 205-22 (1985). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis of the purified protein suggests that the transfer protein is a complex of two subunits of apparent molecular weights 58,000 and 88,000, since a single band was present when purified NTP was electrophoresed under nondenaturing condition, while two bands of apparent molecular weights 58,000 and 88,000 were identified when electrophoresis was performed in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). These two polypeptides are hereinafter referred to as 58 kDa and 88 kDa, respectively, or the 58 kDa and the 88 kDa component of MTP, respectively, or the low molecular weight subunit and the high molecular weight subunit of MTP, respectively. Characterization of the 58,000 molecular weight component of bovine MTP indicates that it is the previously characterized multifunctional protein, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Wetterau et al., J. Biol. Chem . 265, 9800-7 (1990). The presence of PDI in the transfer protein is supported by evidence showing that (1) the amino terminal 25 amino acids of the bovine 58,000 kDa component of MTP is identical to that of bovine PDI, and (2) disulfide isomerase activity was expressed by bovine MTP following the dissociation of the 58 kDa-88 kDa protein complex. In addition, antibodies raised against bovine PDI, a protein which by itself has no TG transfer activity, were able to immunoprecipitate bovine TG transfer activity from a solution containing purified bovine MTP. PDI normally plays a role in the folding and assembly of newly synthesized disulfide bonded proteins within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Bulleid Freedman, Nature 335, 649-51 (1988). It catalyzes the proper pairing of cysteine residues into disulfide bonds, thus catalyzing the proper folding of disulfide bonded proteins. In addition, PDI has been reported to be identical to the beta subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase. Koivu et al., J. Biol. Chem . 262, 6447-9 (1987). The role of PDI in the bovine transfer protein is not clear. It does appear to be an essential component of the transfer protein as dissociation of PDI from the 88 kDa component of bovine MTP by either low concentrations of a denaturant (guanidine HCl), a chaotropic agent (sodium perchlorate), or a nondenaturing detergent (octyl glucoside) results in a loss of transfer activity. Wetterau et al., Biochemistry 30, 9728-35 (1991). Isolated bovine PDI has no apparent lipid transfer activity, suggesting that either the 88 kDa polypeptide is the transfer protein or that it confers transfer activity to the protein complex. The tissue and subcellular distribution of MTP activity in rats has been investigated. Wetterau Zilversmit, Biochem. Biophys. Acta 875, 610-7 (1986). Lipid transfer activity was found in liver and intestine. Little or no transfer activity was found in plasma, brain, heart, or kidney. Within the liver, MTP was a soluble protein located within the lumen of the microsomal fraction. Approximately equal concentrations were found in the smooth and rough microsomes. Abetalipoproteinemia is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by a virtual absence of plasma lipoproteins which contain apolipoprotein B (apoB). Kane Havel in The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease , Sixth edition, 1139-64 (1989). Plasma TG levels may be as low as a few mg/dL, and they fail to rise after fat ingestion. Plasma cholesterol levels are often only 20-45 mg/dL. These abnormalities are the result of a genetic defect in the assembly and/or secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) in the liver and chylomicrons in the intestine. The molecular basis for this defect has not been previously determined. In subjects examined, triglyceride, phospholipid, and cholesterol synthesis appear normal. At autopsy, subjects are free of atherosclerosis. Schaefer et al., Clin. Chem . 34, B9-12 (1988). A link between the apoB gene and abetalipoproteinemia has been excluded in several families. Talmud et al., J. Clin. Invest . 82, 1803-6 (1988) and Huang et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet . 46, 1141-8 (1990). Subjects with abetalipoproteinemia are afflicted with numerous maladies. Kane Havel, supra. Subjects have fat malabsorption and TG accumulation in their enterocytes and hepatocytes. Due to the absence of TG-rich plasma lipoproteins, there is a defect in the transport of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin E. This results in acanthocytosis of erythrocytes, spinocerebellar ataxia with degeneration of the fasciculus cuneatus and gracilis, peripheral neuropathy, degenerative pigmentary retinopathy, and ceroid myopathy. Treatment of abetalipoproteinemic subjects includes dietary restriction of fat intake and dietary supplementation with vitamins A, E and K. In vitro, MTP catalyzes the transport of lipid molecules between phospholipid membranes. Presumably, it plays a similar role in vivo, and thus plays some role in lipid metabolism. The subcellular (lumen of the microsomal fraction) and tissue distribution (liver and intestine) of MTP have led to speculation that it plays a role in the assembly of plasma lipoproteins, as these are the sites of plasma lipoprotein assembly. Wetterau Zilversmit, Biochem. Biophys. Acta 875, 610-7 (1986). The ability of MTP to catalyze the transport of TG between membranes is consistent with this hypothesis, and suggests that MTP may catalyze the transport of TG from its site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to nascent lipoprotein particles within the lumen of the ER. Olofsson and colleagues have studied lipoprotein assembly in HepG2 cells. Bostrom et al., J. Biol. Chem . 263, 4434-42 (1988). Their results suggest small precursor lipoproteins become larger with time. This would be consistent with the addition or transfer of lipid molecules to nascent lipoproteins as they are assembled. MTP may play a role in this process. In support of this hypothesis, Howell and Palade, J. Cell Biol . 92, 833-45 (1982), isolated nascent lipoproteins from the hepatic Golgi fraction of rat liver. There was a spectrum of sizes of particles present with varying lipid and protein compositions. Particles of high density lipoprotein (HDL) density, yet containing apoB, were found. Higgins and Hutson, J. Lipid Res . 25, 1295-1305 (1984), reported lipoproteins isolated from Golgi were consistently larger than those from the endoplasmic reticulum, again suggesting the assembly of lipoproteins is a progressive event. However, there is no direct evidence in the prior art demonstrating that MTP plays a role in lipid metabolism or the assembly of plasma lipoprotein. Recent reports (Science, Vol. 258, page 999, 1992; D. Sharp et al, Nature, Vol. 365, page 65, 1993) demonstrate that the defect causing abetalipoproteinemia is in the MTP gene, and as a result, the NTP protein. Individuals with abetalipoproteinemia have no MTP activity, as a result of mutations in the MTP gene, some of which have been characterized. These results indicate that MTP is required for the synthesis of apoB containing lipoproteins, such as VLDL, the precursor to LDL. It therefore follows that inhibitors of MTP would inhibit the synthesis of VLDL and LDL, thereby lowering VLDL levels, LDL levels, cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels in animals and man. Canadian Patent Application No. 2,091,102 published Mar. 2, 1994 (corresponding to U.S. application Ser. No. 117,362, filed Sep. 3, 1993 (file DC21b)) which is incorporated herein by reference), reports MTP inhibitors which also block the production of apoB containing lipoproteins in a human hepatic cell line (HepG2 cells). This provides further support for the proposal that an MTP inhibitor would lower apoB containing lipoprotein and lipid levels in vivo.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of substituted pyrimidines. Pyrimidines, which are substituted in the 4-position by a hydrocarbyloxy or hydrocarbylthio group are of great commercial interest as highly effective pesticides or pharmaceuticals. U.S. Pat. No. 3,498,984 discloses 2-phenyl4-thiopyrimidines with interesting pharmaceutical properties. U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,624 describes herbicidal compositions comprising 2-phenyl-4-oxypyrimidines. The International Patent Applications WO 98/40379 and WO 98/56789 disclose herbicidal 4-oxypyrimidines, in which a 5-membered heteroaromatic group is attached to the 2-position of the pyrimidine moiety. These compounds can be prepared for example in a multi-step process including the steps of treating a benzamidine hydrochloride with a substituted acetylacetate in the presence of a strong base to form a 2-phenylpyrimid-4-one, which is subsequently treated with a halogenating agent, in particular a phosphoryl halide to yield a 4-halo-2-phenylpyrimidine, which is reacted with an alcohol or a thioalcohol. However, this process cannot be used for manufacture of relatively large quantities on an industrial scale due to the high risk of uncontrollable heat generation during the aqueous work up of the halogenation step. W. Schroth et al., disclose the preparation of 1,3-thiazin-6-thiones by condensation of 3,3-dichloroacrolein and thioamides in the presence of trifluoroborane. However, there is no motivation to apply this reaction on the manufacture of substituted pyrimidines, especially, since trifluoroborane is not applicable in large scale productions.

The present invention relates to novel dibenzonaphthyrones, to processes for the preparation thereof, to a process for colouring/pigmenting organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material with dibenzonaphthyrones and to substance compositions comprising dibenzonaphthyrones. Dibenzonaphthyrones of the formula H. D. Becker et al., Aust. J. Chem., 38(1), 97-110, 1985 describe the compounds of formulae (II) to (V). Dibenzonaphthyrones of formulae (VI) to (XIII) are known from J. Indian. Chem. Soc., 45, 35 (1968), J. N. Chatterjea et al. The dibenzonaphthyrone of formula (XIV) is known from Chem. Ber., 117(2), 666-671, 1984, Saalfrank, R. W. et al. The dibenzonaphthyrone of formula (XV) is known from Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr., 5 e sr.,T.9, 826 (1942), Ch. Marschalk et al. The industrial use of dibenzonaphthyrones has been negligible hitherto since their difficult preparation from complicated starting materials is uneconomic and/or the use of oxidising agents containing heavy metals is ecologically unsound. Aust. J. Chem., 38(1), 97-110, 1985, H. D. Becker et al. disclose, for example, the preparation of dibenzonaphthyrone from isoxindigo, which is difficult to obtain synthetically, by base-catalysed isomerisation, or, Chem. Ber. 117(2), 666-671, Saalfrank, R. W. et al., the isomerisation of coumarin, which has to be prepared in several stages, and, Chem. Lett., 1301-1304, 1979, Shibata K. et al., photo-oxidative multiple-stage preparation from flava-nonol compounds, or J. Indian Chem. Soc. 45, 35-44, 1968, Chatterjea, J. N. et al., condensation from coumarin or trans-2,2dimethoxydicyanostilbene. Tet. Left., 39, 4671-4674, 1966, Kubota, T. et al. discloses the preparation of dibenzonaphthyrone by oxidation with potassium permanganate and, Bull.Soc.Chim. Fr., 5 e sr.,T.9, 826 (1942), Ch. Marschalk et al., oxidation with iron chloride or chromic acids. Fluorescing properties of dibenzonaphthyrones, both in solution and in the crystalline state, are mentioned in Aust. J. Chem., 38(1), 97-110, 1985, H. D. Becker et al. The use of dibenzonaphthyrones as colourants is not known. Their difficult preparation makes them too expensive for most purposes. The problem underlying the invention was therefore to find novel dibenzonaphthyrones that are suitable as colourants or fluorescent agents, especially for colouring/pigmenting organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material, but especially high-molecular-weight organic material. In addition, the problem consisted of finding a simpler and cheaper process for the preparation of dibenzonaphthyrones. The present invention relates to novel dibenzonaphthyrones of the general formula (I) wherein A 1 , and A 2 are each independently of the other unsubstituted or mono- to tetra-substituted o-C 6 -C 18 arylene, with the proviso that formula (I) does not represent a dibenzonaphthyrone of the formula o-C 6 -C 18 Arylene is, for example, 1,2-phenylene, 1,2-naphthylene, 2,3-naphthylene, 1,2-phenanthrylene, 2,3-phenanthrylene, 3,4-phenanthrylene or 9,10-phenanthrylene. If o-C 6 -C 18 arylene is substituted, the substituents may, independently of one another, be any desired atoms, groups of atoms or radicals, which, depending on their valency, may be bonded to A 1 or to A 2 by one or more bonds. For example, divalent radicals, such as 1,3-butadien-1,4-ylene or CHCHNH, may then produce an additional 5- or 6-membered ring fused to A 1 and A 2 , with the proviso that formula (I) does not represent a dibenzonaphtyrone of formulae (II) to (XV). The compounds of formula (I) are, for example, symmetric or asymmetric dibenzonaphthyrones. If o-C 6 -C 18 arylene is substituted, the substituent may, for example, be a bridge to a further dibenzonaphthyrone. In that bis-dibenzonaphthyrone structure, two dibenzonaphthyrones may be linked to each other, for example, by an alkylene or cycloalkylene bridge.

Dibenzonaphthyrones may occur in various crystal modifications, as described by H. D. Becker et al., in Aust. J. Chem., 38(1), 97-110, 1985. In the case of polymorphism, in principle any crystal modification is suitable as a colourant. The invention further relates to a process for the preparation of dibenzonaphthyrone of the formula which comprises dehydrating a compound of the formula or a tautomer thereof, to form isoxindigo of formula (XXIIa) and subsequently isomerising, it also being possible for formula (XXIII) to represent compounds of formulae (II) to (XV). The invention further relates to a process for the preparation of a mixture consisting of dibenzonaphthyrones of the formulae wherein A 1 and A 2 are different, which comprises dehydrating a mixture of compounds of the formulae or tautomers thereof, to form a mixture consisting of isoxindigos of the formulae and subsequently isomerising, it also being possible for formulae (XXIII), (XXIV) and (XXV) to represent compounds of formulae (II) to (XV). The compounds of formulae (XXIa) and (XXIb) and tautomers thereof are known from U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,572. It is not necessary to isolate the compound of formula (XXIa) or (XXIb); rather, the reaction mixture obtained in U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,572 can advantageously be further reacted directly. A mixture of a compound of formula (XXIa) and a compound of formula (XXIb) usually consists of a molar ratio of the two compounds in the range of from 100:0.1 to 0.1:100, preferably from 90:10 to 10:90, especially from 95:5 to 5:95, and there is also especially preferred the molar mixing ratio of 1:1. The mixtures are generally prepared from the individual 3-hydroxy-benzofuranonyl compounds by prior mixing, in accordance with generally known methods, or are obtainable directly from a mixed synthesis of two differently substituted phenols with glyoxylic acid. The dehydration can be performed thermally, for example at from 363 to 623K, preferably from 373 to 573 K, in an inert solvent, where appropriate with the addition of a protonic mineral or organic acid, a Lewis acid or an acid earth (such as, for example, Fulcat, montmorillonite, ion-exchanger). Where used, an amount of from 0.01 to 250 mol %, preferably from 1 to 10 mol %, based on the compound of formula (XVIa) or on the molar sum of the compounds (XXIa) and (XXIb), normally suffices. The dehydration is preferably carried out by removing water azeotropically from the reaction mixture using a water separator, with vigorous stirring and refluxing, where appropriate under reduced or elevated pressure. The dehydration can also be performed chemically, the compound of formula (XXIa), or the compounds of formulae (XXIa) and (XXIb), first being reacted with an equimolar amount of an electrophilic reagent and then an acid being eliminated from the resulting product, for example at from 253 to 523 K, preferably at from 323 to 473 K, in an inert solvent, where appropriate with the addition of an organic base, such as, for example, triethylamine, a dialkylaniline, 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-diazabicyclo2.2.2octane (DABCO), pyridine, an alkylpyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or quinoline. An amount of from 0.01 to 250 mol %, preferably from 0.1 to 50 mol %, based on the compound of formula (XXIa), or on the compounds of formulae (XXIa) and (XXIb), normally suffices in that case. If, however, the acid to be eliminated is not volatile under the elimination conditions, it is advantageous to use at least 100 mol % of base, based on the compound of formula (XXIa) or on the compounds of formulae (XXIa) and (XXIb). The acid can thereby be eliminated even at a lower temperature. As inert solvent it is possible to use, for example, an organic solvent that is unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by halogen or nitro, such as C 7 -C 25 aralkyl, especially toluene, C 9 -C 13 aralkyl, or C 6 -C 24 aryl unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by halogen or nitro, such as 1,2-dichlorobenzene, or C 1 -C 24 alkyl unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by halogen or nitro, such as dichloroethane. Suitable electrophilic reagents are, for example, methyl and ethyl esters of mineral acids, such as dimethyl sulfate or dimethylphosphonate, or organic or inorganic acid chlorides, such as thionyl chloride, phosgene, methanesulfonyl chloride, mesyl chloride, tosyl chloride or acetyl chloride, or anhydrides, such as acetic anhydride. A preferred electrophilic reagent is thionyl chloride. The subsequent isomerisation can be carried out thermally and/or with base catalysis. In a preferred embodiment, the isomerisation of the compounds of formulae (XXIIa), or (XXIIc), or (XXIIa), (XXIIb) and (XXIIc) to form (I) is usually base-catalysed. Preference is given to the use of organic bases, such as, for example, tertiary amine bases, such as triethylamine, a dialkylaniline, 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-diazabicyclo2.2.2octane (DABCO), or an aromatic nitrogen base, such as pyridine, alkylpyridine, dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or quinoline, preferably triethylamine, pyridine or quinoline, more preferably triethylamine or pyridine and most preferably pyridine. The isomerisation according to the invention is advantageously carried out in the presence of solvents, especially protic, polar solvents, such as an alcohol, such as, for example, a C 1 -C 6 alcohol. The isomerisation is usually carried out at elevated temperature, normally in the boiling temperature range of the solvent used. The reaction can be observed by hypsochromic colour change. The end of the reaction normally lies in the range of from 1 to 40 hours, whereafter the colour no longer changes. The dibenzonaphthyrone can be further processed in the customary manner; for example the crude product is filtered off, where appropriate washed, dried and, where appropriate, sieved. The invention further relates to a process for the preparation of dibenzonaphthyrone of formulae (I) to (XV) by condensation of 3-oxo-furanonyl with 3-methylene-furanonyl compounds, which comprises condensing a 3-methylene-furanonyl compound of formula (XXXX) with a 3oxo-furanonyl compound of formula (XXXXI) wherein A 1 and A 2 are different, using organic or inorganic acids or bases, to form and subsequently isomerising. The reaction is usually started by bringing a 3-methylene-furanonyl compound into contact with a 3-oxo-furanonyl compound and the condensation catalyst in accordance with methods known per se, for example by mixing the starting materials together or adding one of the starting materials dropwise to the other as described, for example, by J. N. Chaterjea in J. Indian Chem. Soc., 36, 70 (1959). In that literature reference, however, the condensation catalyst used is phosphorus tribromide which is ecologically harmful. Acids or bases may be used as the condensation catalyst. For example, it is possible to use inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, organic acids, such as arylsulfonic acids, especially ptoluenesulfonic acid, or alkanoic acids, formic acid or acetic acid, especially trifluoroacetic acid, and Lewis acids. It is possible to use as bases, for example, organic nitrogen bases, such as triethylamine, piperidine, pyridine, morpholine, or aliphatic alcoholates, such as, for example, methanolate, ethanolate, propanolate or butanolate, or aromatic alcoholates, such as, for example, phenolate. As solvents it is possible to use organic acids, such as, for example, acetic acid, or alcohols, such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol or hexanol, or hydrocarbons, such as, for example, hexane, heptane, or also ethers, such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether or dioxane. The molar ratio of 3-methylene-furanonyl to 3-oxo-furanonyl is normally selected to be in the range of from 1:1 to 3:1 and, preferably, the molar ratio is 1:1. The molar ratio of the condensation catalyst to 3-oxo-furanonyl is normally selected to be in the range of from 0.001:1 to 5:1, preferably in the range of from 0.001:1 to 1:1 and especially in the range of from 0.001:1 to 0.05:1. The reaction temperature selected is preferably a temperature at which the reaction mixture boils; it is in the range of the boiling temperature of the solvent used. The reaction mixture can be worked up by the customary methods, such as, for example, by the addition of water and subsequent repeated extraction of the crude product with an organic solvent, such as toluene. The organic phase containing the crude product can be washed with water and then concentrated by evaporation. If desired, the crude product is combined with methanol and subsequently filtered, the product being obtained as the filter residue. The starting materials for that process are prepared analogously to known processes. 3-Methylene-furanonyl compounds can be prepared, for example, analogously to the procedure of H.-D. Becker, K. Gustafsson, J.Org.Chem. 42, 2966 (1977) from phenols by reaction with glyoxal. 3-Oxo-furanonyl compounds obtained by oxidation of 3-hydroxy-furanonyl compounds can be prepared, for example, according to generally known methods of oxidising hydroxy compounds to keto compounds. Those methods are described, for example, in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, 4th edition, Vol. 4/1a 4/1b. In J. Org. Chem., 56, 6110 (1991), Z-Ma, J. M. Bobbitt describe oxidation using nitroxides. 3-Hydroxy-furanonyl compounds can be prepared analogously to the procedure for 3-hydroxy-benzofuranones which is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,572. Preferably, the bis-isoxindigos (IIb) are prepared from bis-3-oxo-furanonyl compounds of the formula or from bis-3-methylene-furanonyl compounds of the formula Preference is given to preparation from bis-3-oxo-furanonyl compounds (XXXII) by reaction with a 3-methylene-furanonyl compound (XXXIII) or, if desired, with a mixture of two differently substituted 3-methylene-furanonyl compounds (XXXIII). Dibenzonaphthyrones are also obtainable from isoxindigos that isomerise, for example, during the process for colouring/pigmenting high-molecular-weight organic material, preferably at elevated temperatures. The present invention further relates to compositions consisting of from 2 to 10 dibenzonaphthyrones of formulae (I) to (XV), preferably 2 or 3 compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). If the composition consists of three compounds, these may be especially compounds of the formulae wherein A 1 and A 2 are different and the compounds of formulae (XXIII), (XXIV) and (XXV) also represent dibenzonaphthyrone of the formulae (II) to (XV). The molar ratio of the compositions consisting of dibenzonaphthyrones of formulae (XXIII), (XXIV) and (XXV) is usually in the range of from 98:1:1 to 1:98:1 or 1:1:98, preferably in the range of 25:50:25 based on (XXIII):(XXIV):(XXV) and, in the case of two dibenzonaphthyrones, usually in the range of from 99:1: to 1:99. The compositions consisting of from 2 to 10 dibenzonaphthyrones of formulae (I) to (XV) can be prepared from the individual compounds by mixing methods known per se or, in the case of three-component compositions, also by direct synthesis, which is described above. The present invention further relates to a process for the mass-colouring/pigmenting of organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material, especially high-molecular-weight organic material, which comprises admixing at least one dibenzonaphthyrone of formulae (I) to (XV), preferably from 2 to 10, and especially 2 or 3 compounds, with the organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material, especially high-molecular-weight organic material, before processing thereof. If three compounds are admixed, these are preferably (XXIII), (XXIV) and (XXV). The invention further relates, therefore, to a substance composition comprising an organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material, especially high-molecular-weight organic material, and at least one compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or a composition consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) in a colour-producing amount, normally in the range of from 0.01 to 70% by weight, especially from 0.01 to 30% by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 10% by weight, based on the organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material. The present invention further relates to the use of the compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) individually as colourants or fluorescent agents, especially for colouring or pigmenting organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material, especially high-molecular-weight organic material. It is also possible, however, for the compositions according to the invention comprising compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) to be used in the form of mixtures, solid solutions or mixed crystals. Compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) can also be combined with colourants of another chemical class, for example with dyes or pigments, for example those selected from the group of the diketopyrrolopyrroles, quinacridones, perylenes, dioxazines, anthraquinones, indanthrones, flavanthrones, indigos, thioindigos, quinophthalones, isoindolinones, isoindolines, phthalocyanines, metal complexes, azo pigments and azo dyes. Depending on the nature of their substituting and on the polymer to be coloured, the compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) can be used in the form of polymer-soluble dyes or in the form of pigments. In the latter case, it is advantageous to convert the products obtained in the synthesis into a finely dispersed form. That can be done in a manner known per se. Depending on the compound and the intended use, it proves advantageous to use the colourants as toners or in the form of preparations. The high-molecular-weight material may be organic or inorganic and may be synthetic and/or natural material. The high-molecular-weight organic material usually has an average molecular weight of 10 5 -10 7 g/mol. It may be, for example, a natural resin or a drying oil, rubber or casein or a modified natural material, such as chlorinated rubber, oil-modified alkyd resins, viscose, or a cellulose ether or ester, such as ethylcellulose, cellulose acetate, propionate or butyrate, cellulose acetobutyrate or nitrocellulose, but is especially a completely synthetic organic polymer (duroplasts and thermoplasts) as may be obtained by polymerisation, for example by polycondensation or polyaddition. The class of polymers includes, for example, polyolefins, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisobutylene, and substituted polyolefins, such as polymerisates of monomers such as vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, styrene, acrylonitrile, acrylates, methacrylates, fluoropolymers, such as polyfluoroethylene, polytrifluorochloroethylene or tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene mixed polymerisate, and copolymerisates of the mentioned monomers, especially ABS (acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene) or EVA (ethylene/vinyl acetate). From the group of polyaddition and polycondensation resins it is possible to use, for example, condensation products of formaldehyde with phenols, the so-called phenoplasts, and condensation products of formaldehyde and urea or thiourea, also melamine, the so-called aminoplasts, and the polyesters used as surface coating resins, either saturated, such as alkyd resins, or unsaturated, such as maleic resins, and also linear polyesters, polyamides, polyurethanes, polycarbonates, polyphenylene oxides or silicones, and silicone resins. The mentioned high-molecular-weight compounds may be present individually or in mixtures in the form of kneadable compounds, melts or in the form of spinning solutions. They may also be present in the form of their monomers or in the polymerised state in dissolved form as film-formers or binders for paints or printing inks, such as, for example, boiled linseed oil, nitrocellulose, alkyd resins, melamine resins and urea-formaldehyde resins or acrylic resins. Low-molecular-weight materials are, for example, mineral oils, waxes or lubricating greases. The present invention further relates, therefore, to the use of the compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) and of the compositions according to the invention consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) for the production of inks, for printing inks in printing processes, for flexographic printing, screen printing, the printing of packaging, security colour printing, intaglio printing or offset printing, for preliminary printing stages and for textile printing, for office and home use or for graphics, such as, for example, for paper goods, for ball-point pens, felt-tip pens, fibre-tip pens, paperboard, wood, (wood) stains, metal, stamp pads or inks for impact printing processes (with impact printing ink ribbons), for the production of colourants, for paints, for use in industry or advertising, for textile decoration and industrial labelling, for roll coating or powder coating compositions or for automobile paints, for high-solids (low-solvent), water-containing or metallic paints or for pigmented formulations for aqueous paints, for mineral oils, lubricating greases or waxes, for the production of coloured plastics for coatings, fibres, plates or moulded substrates, for the production of non-impact printing material for digital printing, for the thermal wax-transfer printing process, the ink-jet printing process or for the thermal transfer printing process, and also for the production of colour filters, especially for visible light in the range of from 400 to 700 nm, for liquid crystal displays (LCDs) or charge-coupled devices (CCDs) or for the production of cosmetics or for the production of polymeric colour particles, toners, dry copy toners, liquid copy toners or electrophotographic toners. The present invention further relates to the use of substance compositions comprising an organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material, especially high-molecular-weight organic material, and at least one compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or a composition consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) in a colour-producing amount for the production of inks or colourants for paints, printing inks, mineral oils, lubricating greases or waxes, or coloured or pigmented plastics, non-impact printing material, colour filters, cosmetics or toners. The present invention further relates to inks comprising high-molecular-weight organic material and a colour-producing amount of the compound (I) to (XV) or of the composition consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). For example, the inks can be produced by mixing the compounds according to the invention with polymeric dispersants. The mixing of the compounds according to the invention with the polymeric dispersant is preferably carried out by generally known mixing methods, such as stirring or mixing, and the use of an intensive mixer, such as an Ultraturax, is especially to be recommended. When mixing the compounds according to the invention with polymeric dispersants, a water-dilutable organic solvent is advantageously used. The weight ratio of the compounds according to the invention to ink is advantageously selected to be in the range of from 0.0001 to 75% by weight, preferably from 0.001 to 50% by weight, based on the total weight of the ink. The present invention therefore relates also to a process for the production of inks which comprises mixing high-molecular-weight organic material with a colour-producing amount of the compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or compositions thereof consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). The present invention further relates to colourants comprising high-molecular-weight organic material and a compound according to the invention of formulae (I) to (XV), or a composition according to the invention consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV), in a colour-producing amount. The present invention relates, in addition, to a process for the preparation of colourants which comprises mixing a high-molecular-weight organic material and a colour-producing amount of the compound according to the invention of formulae (I) to (XV) or composition according to the invention consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). The present invention further relates to coloured or pigmented plastics or polymeric coloured particles comprising high-molecular-weight organic material and compound (I) to (XV), or composition consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV), in a colour-producing amount. The present invention relates, in addition, to a process for the preparation of coloured or pigmented plastics or polymeric coloured particles which comprises mixing together a high-molecular-weight organic material and a colour-producing amount of the compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or composition consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). The colouring of high-molecular-weight organic substances with the colourants of formulae (I) to (XV) or the compositions consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) is carried out, for example, by mixing such a colourant, optionally in the form of a master batch, into those substrates using roll mills or mixing or grinding apparatus, whereby the colourant is dissolved or finely distributed in the high-molecular-weight material. The high-molecular-weight organic material with the admixed colourant is then processed according to procedures known per se, such as, for example, calendering, compression moulding, extrusion moulding, coating, spinning, casting or injection-moulding, whereby the coloured material acquires its final form. Admixing of the colourant can also be carried out immediately prior to the actual processing step, for example by continuously metering a powdered colourant according to the invention and a granulated high-molecular-weight organic material, and optionally also additional ingredients, such as additives, directly into the inlet zone of an extruder simultaneously, where mixing takes place just before the processing operation. In general, however, prior mixing of the colourant into the high-molecular-weight organic material is preferred, since more uniform results can be obtained. It is often desirable for the purpose of producing non-rigid mouldings or reducing the brittleness thereof to incorporate so-called plasticisers into the high-molecular-weight compounds before shaping. There may be used as plasticisers, for example, esters of phosphoric acid, phthalic acid or sebacic acid. In the process according to the invention, the plasticisers can be incorporated into the polymers before or after the incorporation of the colourant. In order to obtain different colour shades it is also possible to add to the high-molecular-weight organic substances, in addition to the compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) or compositions according to the invention consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV), any desired amounts of constituents such as white, coloured or black pigments. For the colouring of paints and printing inks, the high-molecular-weight organic materials and the compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) or the compositions according to the invention consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV), optionally together with additional ingredients, such as fillers, dyes, pigments, siccatives or plasticisers, are finely dispersed or dissolved in a common organic solvent or solvent mixture. That procedure may comprise dispersing or dissolving each individual component on its own or dispersing or dissolving several components together and only then combining all the components. Processing is carried out in accordance with customary methods, for example by spraying, film-spreading or one of the many printing methods, whereupon the paint or printing ink is advantageously cured thermally or by irradiation, optionally after previous drying. When the high-molecular-weight material to be coloured is a paint, it may be a conventional paint or a special paint, for example an automobile finish, preferably a metal-effect finish containing, for example, metal or mica particles. Preference is given to the colouring of thermoplastics, especially also in the form of fibres, and printing inks. Preferred high-molecular-weight organic materials that can be coloured according to the invention are, very generally, polymers having a dielectric constant2.5, especially polyesters, polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyamide, polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene/acrylonitrile (SAN) or acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene (ABS). More especially preferred are polyesters, polycarbonate, polystyrene and PMMA. Most especially preferred are polyesters, polycarbonate and PMMA, especially aromatic polyesters that can be obtained by polycondensation of terephthalic acid, such as, for example, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polybutylene terephthalate. They can be used in the form of their monomers or copolymers or in the polymerised state in dissolved form as film formers or binders for paints that can be used for the decoration of metal or for decorative colour finishes, and for printing inks used, for example, in the ink-jet printing process, or also for wood stains. Special preference is also given to the colouring of mineral oils, lubricating greases and waxes with the compounds according to the invention. The present invention also relates to mineral oils, lubricating greases and waxes comprising high-molecular-weight organic material and a compound of formulae (I) to (XV), or compositions consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV), in a colour-producing amount. The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of mineral oils, lubricating greases and waxes, which comprises mixing high-molecular-weight organic material with a colour-producing amount of the compound of formulae (I) to (XV), or compositions thereof consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). The present invention also relates to non-impact printing material comprising high-molecular-weight organic material and a compound of formulae (I) to (XV), or compositions consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV), in a colour-producing amount. The present invention relates, in addition, to a process for the preparation of non-impact printing material, which comprises mixing together a high-molecular-weight organic material and a colour-producing amount of the compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or compositions consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). The present invention further relates to a process for the production of colour filters comprising a transparent substrate and a red, a blue and a green coating applied thereto in any desired sequence, which comprises using for the production of the red, blue and green coatings a correspondingly coloured compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or compositions comprising compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). The different-coloured coatings are preferably arranged in such a pattern that they do not overlap over at least 5% of their respective surface area and, most preferably, do not overlap at all. The colour filters can be coated, for example, using inks, especially printing inks, comprising the compounds or compositions according to the invention, or, for example, by mixing a compound or composition according to the invention with a chemically, thermally or photolytically structurable high-molecular-weight material (resist). The further production can be carried out, for example, analogously to EP-A 654 711, by application to a substrate, such as an LCD, subsequent photo-structuring and developing. The invention further includes a transparent substrate coated with a red, a blue and a green coating each of a correspondingly coloured compound of formulae (I) to (XV), or composition consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV), comprising pigmented high-molecular-weight organic material. The sequence in which coating is carried out is not important as a rule. The different-coloured coatings are preferably arranged in such a pattern that they do not overlap over at least 5% of their respective surface area and, most preferably, do not overlap at all. The present invention also includes colour filters comprising a transparent substrate and, applied thereto, a red, a blue and a green coating, each obtainable from a correspondingly coloured compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or from compositions comprising compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). The present invention relates, in addition, to toners comprising high-molecular-weight organic material and a compound of formulae (I) to (XV), or compositions consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV), in a colour-producing amount. The present invention also relates to a process for the production of toners, which comprises mixing together a high-molecular-weight organic material and a colour-producing amount of the compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or compositions consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). The present invention also relates to inks or colourants for paints, printing inks, mineral oils, lubricating greases or waxes, or coloured or pigmented plastics, non-impact printing material, colour filters, cosmetics or toners comprising high-molecular-weight organic material and compound (I) to (XV), or composition comprising an organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material and at least one compound of formulae (I) to (XV), in a colour-producing amount. In a special embodiment of the process according to the invention, toners, paints, inks or coloured plastics are produced by processing master batches of toners, paints, inks or coloured plastics in roll mills or mixing or grinding apparatus. A colour-producing amount of the compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or of compositions consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) means in the present invention normally from 0.0001 to 99.99% by weight, preferably from 0.001 to 50% by weight and especially from 0.01 to 50% by weight, based on the total weight of the material coloured or pigmented therewith. The coloured/pigmented high-molecular-weight materials obtained, such as, for example, plastics, fibres, paints and prints, are distinguished by very high colour intensity, high saturation, good fastness to overspraying, good migration-stability, good fastness to heat, light and weathering and by a high gloss and good IR reflectance behaviour. The high economic efficiency of the process according to the invention compared with previous preparation processes for dibenzonaphthyrones makes those compounds commercially attractive. Dibenzonaphthyrones of formulae (I) to (XV) produce surprisingly brilliant colour finishes of high colour intensity, are additionally distinguished by a high degree of fluorescence and exhibit surprisingly good heat-stability and light-fastness properties in polar plastics. Despite very good solubilities, the dibenzonaphthyrones have surprisingly good migration properties in the coloured material. In mixtures comprising the compounds according to the invention, beautiful shades of colour are obtained. Especially advantageously, asymmetric dibenzonaphthyrones and bis-dibenzonaphthyrones enable further colour shades to be obtained and allow their solubility to be influenced by the choice of the substituting. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of hydroxybenzofuranone, 5,7-di-tert-butyl-3-hydroxy-3H-benzofuran-2-one 300 ml of toluene, 212 g of 97% by weight 2,4-di-tert-butyl-phenol (Fluka), 121.9 ml of 50% by weight aqueous glyoxylic acid (Fluka), and 40 g p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (Fluka, Aldrich) are added in succession, with stirring, to a 1.5 litre multi-necked vessel equipped with stirrer, dropping funnel, water separator, condenser and thermometer. The reaction mixture is then refluxed vigorously while stirring well, during which the water present in the glyoxylic acid and the water of reaction of the first step separates. After a reflux time of approximately 3 hours, the separation of water ceases, leaving a homogeneous, slightly yellow solution of the hydroxybenzofuranone, 5,7-di-tert-butyl-3-hydroxy-3H-benzofuran-2-one. EXAMPLE 2a Dehydration to isoxindigo; in toluene with thionyl chloride and triethylamine The reaction mixture from Example 1 is diluted with 40 ml of a linear C 9 -C 13 alkylbenzene that boils at 548-585 K (Marlican, Hls). Then, under normal pressure and at a heating-bath temperature of up to 415 K, approximately 200 ml of toluene are distilled off. At the end of the distillation, the internal temperature is approximately 393 K. The light-yellow, oily mixture is cooled to an internal temperature of approximately 60 C. and 13.9 ml of triethylamine are added thereto. 79.8 ml of thionyl chloride are then added dropwise from the dropping funnel sufficiently rapidly that the evolution of HCl and SO 2 remains vigorous yet controllable. The addition lasts approximately 75 min, and the internal temperature is 333-340 K. When the formation of gas has virtually subsided, the reaction mixture is stirred for a further hour at 373 K. The heating control of the heating bath is then increased to 473 K. The temperature of the reaction mixture rises to 459 K over a period of approximately 35 min, during which a further 105 ml of toluene distil off. At the same time, a vigorous stream of HCI gas escapes once more. If the evolution of gas is too violent, the heating rate is reduced accordingly. The mixture, which is already deep-red, is then stirred for a further 2 hours at 453-463 K. The thick, dark-red to black crystal suspension is cooled to approximately 423 K; 200 ml of n-butanol followed by 400 ml of ethanol are then added through the condenser. The crystal suspension is stirred under reflux for approximately a further hour, is then cooled to 273-278 K and filtered off. The crystal cake is washed with sufficient cold ethanol (approximately 600 ml) until the filtrate is clearly no longer brown-tinged but is faintly red in colour. The crystalline dye is then dried at 353 K/50 mbar, yielding 186.2 g (76.2% of the theoretical yield based on 2,3-di-tert-butyl-phenol) of fine, deep-red, shiny crystals of 5,7,5,7-tetra-tert-butyl-3,3bibenzofuranylidene-2,2-dione of formula (LIa). melting point: 427-429 K.; elemental analysis: % C % H calc. 78.65 8.25 found 78.40 8.39 EXAMPLE 2b Dehydration to isoxindigo; in 1,2-dichlorobenzene with thionyl chloride and 4-dimethylaminopyridine 10 g of 5,7-di-tert-butyl-3-hydroxy-3H-benzofuran-2-one (prepared as described in Ex. 1a of U.S. Pat.

The temperature is then increased to reflux temperature. After 75 min, the 1,2-dichlorobenzene is distilled off, under reduced pressure at the end. The isoxindigo is crystallised out by adding 30 ml of acetonitrile to the residue, is filtered off, washed with acetonitrile and dried, yielding 6.8 g (73% of the theoretical yield) of 5,7,5,7-tetra-tert-butyl-3,3bibenzofuranylidene-2,2-dione of formula (LIa).

Chem. 38, 687 (1973) are melted with 1.2 g of camphor-10-sulfonic acid at 393 K. A weak stream of nitrogen (1 ml/min) is then passed through the stirred melt for 29 hours. The reaction mixture is then diluted with toluene, washed with water and concentrated by evaporation using a rotary evaporator. 10.8 g of oily 2-tert-butyl-4-phenyl-sulfanyl-phenol are obtained from the residue by column chromatography on silica gel (hexane/ethyl acetate 19:1).

A further 4 g of 50% aqueous glyoxylic acid are then added and boiling is continued for a further 5 hours. The reaction mixture is then washed with water, dried over MgSO 4 and concentrated by evaporation using a rotary evaporator. The addition of 20 ml of hexane to the residue causes 7-tert-butyl-3-hydroxy-5-phenylsulfanyl-3H-benzofuran-2-one to separate in the form of a viscous oil, which is removed and dried in vacuo (9.3 g). 2.45 g of that viscous oil are placed in 10 ml of toluene with 1.1 ml of thionyl chloride and 3 drops of DMF and the reaction mixture is then slowly heated to 373 K at such a rate that the evolution of HCl and SO 2 remains vigorous yet controllable.

EXAMPLE 12a Bis-isoxindigo (LXIa) 22.0 g (0.1 mol) of 5-methoxy-7-tert-butyl-benzofuranone (prepared analogously to H.-D. Becker, K. Gustafsson.: J. Org. Chem. 42, 2966 (1977)), 27.5 g (0.05 mol) of bis(5-cyclohexylidene)-7-tert-butyl-3-oxo-benzofuranone (Example 12) and 1 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid are boiled under reflux in 130 ml of acetic acid for 22 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting precipitate is recrystallised from dichloromethane/methanol and yields 9.2 g of bis-isoxindigo (LXIa). melting point: 532-537 K. EXAMPLE 13 Bis-isoxindigo (LXIIa) 4.9 g (0.02 mol) of 5,7-di-tert-butyl-benzofuranone (H.-D. Becker, K. Gustafsson.: J. Org.

Crystallisation of the pure fractions from methanol yields 1.25 g of bis-isoxindigo (LXIIa). melting point: 577-581 K. EXAMPLE 14 Isoxindigo (LIVa) 300 ml of toluene, 30 g (0.117 mol) of 2,4-dicyclohexylphenol (synthesis, for example, according to: Kozlikovskii, Ya. et al.: Zh. Org. Khim. (1984), 20(1), 121-4), 121.9 ml of 50% aqueous glyoxylic acid and 0.5 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate are added in succession, with stirring, to a 1.5 litre multi-necked vessel equipped with stirrer, dropping funnel, water separator, condenser and thermometer. The reaction mixture is then refluxed vigorously while stirring well, during which the water present in the glyoxylic acid and the water of reaction of the first step separates. After a reflux time of approximately 3 hours, the separation of water ceases, leaving a homogeneous, slightly yellow solution of the hydroxybenzofuranone. The reaction mixture is then diluted with 40 ml of a linear C 9 -C 13 alkylbenzene that boils at 548-585 K. (Marlican, Hls). Then, under normal pressure and at a heating-bath temperature of up to 315 K, approximately 200 ml of toluene are distilled off. At the end of the distillation, the internal temperature is approximately 394 K. The light-yellow, oily mixture is cooled to an internal temperature of approximately 333 K and 13.9 ml of triethylamine are added thereto. 79.8 ml of thionyl chloride are then added dropwise from the dropping funnel sufficiently rapidly that the evolution of HCl and SO 2 remains vigorous yet controllable. The addition lasts approximately 75 min, and the internal temperature is 333-337 K. When the formation of gas has virtually subsided, the reaction mixture is stirred for a further hour at 373 K. The heating control of the heating bath is then increased to 573 K. The temperature of the reaction mixture rises to 495 K over a period of approximately 35 min, during which a further 105 ml of toluene distil off. At the same time, a vigorous stream of HCl gas escapes once more. If the evolution of gas is too violent, the heating rate is reduced accordingly. The mixture, which is already deep-red, is then stirred for a further 2 hours at 453-463 K. The thick, dark-red to black crystal suspension is cooled to approximately 422 K; 200 ml of n-butanol followed by 400 ml of ethanol are then added through the condenser. The crystal suspension is stirred under reflux for approximately a further hour, is then cooled to 273-278 K and filtered off. The crystal cake is washed with sufficient cold ethanol (approximately 600 ml) until the filtrate is clearly no longer brown-tinged but is faintly red in colour. The crystalline dye is then dried at 80 C./50 mbar, yielding 13.5 g (39% of the theoretical yield based on 2,3-dicyclohexylphenol) of fine, deep-red, shiny crystals of 5,7,5,7-tetra-cyclohexyl-3,3bibenzofuranylidene-2,2-dione of formula (LIVa). melting point: 517-524 K. elemental analysis: % C % H calc. 81.04 8.16 found 80.92 8.23 EXAMPLE 15 Process for the Dreparation of dibenzonalhthyrones (L) to (LXII) 0.02 mol of isoxindigo is boiled under reflux in 100 ml of n-butanol 1 and 50 ml of pyridine for a sufficiently long period (normally 10-40 hours) until the red colour of the isoxindigo has completely changed to the yellow colour of the dibenzonaphthyrone. The mixture is then cooled in an ice-bath, and the resulting crystals are filtered off with suction, washed with methanol and dried. 1 In the case of compound LVI, Table 1, methanol is used in order to avoid transesterification.

The mixture is then pre-extruded at 543 K in a 25 mm 1-screw extruder (Collin). The compound is then processed on a microprocessor-controlled injection-moulding machine (Ferromatik FM 40, Klckner). The residence time of the polymer (dependent on the cycle time, screw volume and plastification volume) is 5 min, during which the back pressure and the screw speed are kept low. That promotes homogeneous processing of the plastics material and prevents the generation of heat due to friction. The first injection-mouldings (platelets measuring 65251.5 mm) are discarded. The injection-mouldings produced at temperatures of from 473 K to 573 K in a residence time of 5 minutes are distinguished by excellent colour fastness properties, such as very high heat-stability, high light-fastness, good migration-stability and high colour intensity. The colour fastness properties are compared visually with a standard or are determined colorimetrically.

Background Information The compounds that can be prepared by the process according to the invention and the novel intermediates are valuable intermediates for the production of biologically active substances. For example, 3-amino-2-oxo-pyrrolidines are preferably used as a structural unit for peptide mimetics, which are used as pharmaceuticals. In WO 94/22820, 3-amino-1-phenyl-2-oxo-pyrrolidines substituted at the phenyl ring, for example, are described as intermediates for thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors. Other biologically active compounds containing those -lactams have been studied by Kottirsch et al. (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1993, 3, 1675). In other examples, they are used in highly potent neurokinin NK-2 receptor antagonists according to Deal et al. (J. Med. Chem. 1992, 35, 4195). The majority of the processes used hitherto for the preparation of substituted 3-amino-2-oxo-pyrrolidines consist in first converting the corresponding open-chained methionine compounds into their sulfonium salts and cyclising the latter with strong bases in a suitable solvent. Friedinger et al. (J. Org. Chem. 1982, 47, 104-109) use for that purpose methyl iodide and sodium hydride, which is difficult to handle in a large-scale process. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,484,946, trimethylsulfonium or trimethylsulfoxonium salts are used for the alkylation instead of methyl iodide, which is readily volatile. The cyclisation is then carried out using potassium carbonate. However, the main problem of those procedures, namely the unavoidable release from the methionine precursor of dimethyl sulfide, which is extremely strong-smelling, cannot be avoided in the process just mentioned either. Moreover, the necessary use of expensive aprotic polar solvents such as, for example, DMSO in the cyclisation with potassium carbonate appears to be a further disadvantage. WO 94/22820 mentions a process in which racemic homoserine derivatives, which have been prepared starting from butyrolactone, are cyclised to pyrrolidones by means of triphenylphosphine and azodicarboxylic acid diesters. However, those reagents are not very suitable for use in an industrial process since they are relatively expensive. Moreover, the cyclisation in that variant yields a number of secondary products which are difficult and hence time-consuming and expensive to separate from the desired derivative (K. Nakajima et al. Peptide Chemistry 1983, 77-80). Although L-homoserine is a naturally occurring amino acid, as yet there are known only a relatively small number of syntheses of homoserineamides, for example peptides, that start from homoserine. The reasons therefor are that homoserine and the corresponding N-acyl compounds very readily form the corresponding lactones under acid conditions (J. P. Greenstein, M. Winitz, Chemistry of the Amino Acids, Wiley, New York 1961, Vol. 3, p. 2612). The same also occurs when the carboxy group is activated, as is necessary for the preparation of homoserineamides. Although it is possible to react also N-acylhomoserinelactones with alkylamines and amino acid esters or amino acid salts to form the corresponding amides (Sheradsky et al., J. Org. Chem. 1961, 26, 2710), the reaction requires either very long reaction times or relatively high temperatures. For that reason, this method has not been used for the preparation of complex, optionally optically active compounds. For the preparation of homoserineamides there are used homoserine derivatives in which the hydroxy function is protected by a suitable group. Hitherto, that was achieved either by a trityl group (Barlos et al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. 1986, 1259), by mono- or di-methoxytrityl groups (Beltran et al., Lett. Pept. Sci. 1997, 4, 147), tert.-butyldimethylsilyl group (WO 97/46248) or benzyl groups (Cornille et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 909). The disadvantage of those protecting groups is that they either require expensive chemicals or can be introduced only in a complicated manner. O-Acyl compounds could be simple and inexpensive O-protecting groups. However, the problem with those compounds is that they very rapidly undergo an O-N-acyl shift under basic conditions, with formation of the corresponding N-acylhomoserines. Furthermore, for the preparation of O-acetylhomoserine there has hitherto been described only the reaction of homoserine with acyl anhydrides in perchloric acid which, on account of the explosive tendency of perchlorates, appears to be very disadvantageous and unsuitable for larger batches. The yields are only 51% at the most (Nagani et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1967, 242, 3884). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide a further process for the preparation of -lactams of the general formula I which can advantageously be carried out on an industrial scale, that is to say which avoids the use of critical substances and expensive reagents as far as possible. Within the context of the invention, critical substances are to be understood as being compounds which, when used on a large scale, give rise to particular risks as regards environmental pollution or health and safety at work. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process which allows the -lactams of the general formula I to be prepared without formation of the foul-smelling dimethyl sulfide. A further object of the invention is to provide novel intermediates which can advantageously be used for the synthesis of the -lactams of the general formula I, and to indicate an advantageous use of those intermediates. These and other objects, which are not explained in greater detail but which readily follow from the prior art in an obvious manner, are the subject of a process having the features of the characterising clause of claim 1 . Advantageous developments of the process according to the invention are described in the sub-claims which are dependent on claim 1 .

Within the context of the process according to the invention, a sulfonic acid radical X is to be understood as being any radical derived from a sulfonic acid of the structure HOSO 3 R, wherein R in this connection represents a linear or branched (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl radical or an aryl radical which may optionally be substituted by one or more (C 1 -CB)-alkyl radicals. The mentioned radicals may optionally be substituted by one or more elements from the group halogen, preferably Cl or F. The above-described cyclisation may advantageously be carried out under basic conditions, it being possible to use as the base preferably an alkali hydroxide. The use of aqueous alkali hydroxide solution is especially preferred, and very special preference is given to the use of sodium hydroxide solution for the cyclisation. Compounds of the general formula II that can advantageously be used for the cyclisation possess a sulfonic acid ester as the leaving group X, and the use of the so-called mesyl (OSO 3 Me) group is especially preferred. This process can be applied very especially to compounds of the general formula II wherein R 1 is a p-cyanophenyl or p-carbamoylphenyl radical, while R 2 is advantageously H and R 3 benzyloxycarbonyl. The cyclisation can be carried out at temperatures of from 20 C. to 100 C. Temperatures of from 0 C. to 50 C. are preferably employed in the cyclisation, very especially temperatures of from 10C to 30 C. The synthesis of the compounds of the general formula I can preferably and extremely simply be accomplished from compounds of the general formula II, if II is reacted to form I without being isolated beforehand. The compounds of the general formula II can advantageously be prepared from derivatives of the general formula III wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 are as defined above. The compounds of the general formula III are preferably not isolated before being processed further to form compounds of formula II. The compounds of formula III, in turn, are very especially preferably prepared from compounds of the general formula IV wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 are as defined above and R 4 represents (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-alkoxy, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyloxy, which are optionally linear or branched and are optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms, aryl, such as phenyl or naphthyl, aralkyl, such as benzyl or phenethyl, arylalkyloxy, such as benzyloxy. In principle, any processes for hydrolysis known to the person skilled in the art can be used for the above-mentioned conversion. Advantageously, however, compounds of the general formula IV can be converted into compounds of the general formula III by aminolysis. Special preference is given in this connection to the use of ammonia as the amine; very especially preferably, ammonia can be employed in the form of its aqueous solution. The compound of the general formula IV, in turn, can advantageously be prepared from compounds of the general formula V wherein R 2 , R 3 , R 4 are as defined above and R 5 represents H, or wherein R 3 and R 5 are bonded together via a CO group to form a ring. Before they are reacted to form compounds of the general formula IV, compounds of the general formula V wherein R b 5 is H can be activated preferably by means of acid chlorides (analogously to Houben-Weyl, Volume 15, Part 2, p. 169 ff). Compounds of the general formula V wherein R 3 and R 5 are bonded together via a CO group to form a ring can advantageously be converted into compounds of the general formula IV wherein R 3 represents H. According to the invention, the compounds of the general formula V can advantageously be prepared from the acid addition salts of the general formula VI wherein R 2 1 R 4 are as defined above and Y is the corresponding base of an inorganic acid, by reaction with an acylating reagent derived from R 3 . Within the scope of the invention, an inorganic acid is to be understood as being an acid whose pKa value is less than 2.5, such as, for example, HCl, HBr, H 2 SO 4 , H 3 PO 4 . Phosgene can preferably be used as the acylating reagent. In that case, compounds of the general formula V wherein R 3 and R 5 are bonded together via a CO group to form a ring are obtained. Alternatively, compounds of the general formula VI can be obtained by reaction with acylating reagents from the group of the organic anhydrides, such as, for example, di-tert.-butyl pyrocarbonate, of the activated esters, such as, for example, trifluoroacetic acid ester, acetic acid hydroxysuccinimide ester, or of the halocarbonic esters, such as, for example, benzyloxycarbonyl chloride, allyloxycarbonyl chloride or tert-butyloxycarbonyl fluoride. The above-described acylation can preferably take place in aqueous solution at a pH of from 4 to 9; it is especially preferred to maintain a pH range of from 6.5 to 7.5 in that reaction. The acylation to form compounds of the general formula V wherein R 5 is H can, however, also be carried out in organic solvents in the presence of a tertiary base. Triethylamine may advantageously be used as the tertiary base. The acid addition salt of the general formula VI, in turn, can preferably be prepared from compounds of the general formula VII wherein R 2 is as defined above. The reaction can take place in a mixture of a carboxylic acid R 4 COOH and the carboxylic acid chloride or bromide R 4 COCl or R 4 COBr, respectively, wherein R 4 is as defined above. For that reaction it is advantageous first to mix together the appropriate carboxylic acid R 4 COOH and the corresponding carboxylic acid halide R 4 COHal and then to add the compound of the general formula VII to that mixture. The above-mentioned process is advantageously carried out at a temperature of from 20 C. to 50 C., preferably from 10 C. to 20 C. and especially from 5 C. to 10 C. Another preferred variant for preparing the compound of the general formula V consists in reacting compounds of the general formula VIII wherein the radicals R 2 , R 3 may be as defined above and R 5 represents H, with the reagent R 4 COZ, wherein R 4 is as defined above and Z represents an activating radical. The activating radical Z may in principle be any radical known to the person skilled in the art for that purpose, such as, for example, hydroxysuccinimide, hydroxybenzotriazole, R 4 CO 2 , halogen (The Chemical Synthesis of Peptides, J. Jones, Oxford Press 1991, p. 42 ff). For the acylation of the OH function of formula VIII there are preferably used compounds in which the activating radical Z corresponds to a halogen. In that case, the reaction is very especially preferably carried out in the carboxylic acid corresponding to the carboxylic acid halide as solvent. Especially preferred halides are the chlorides or bromides of the carboxylic acid. Very special preference is given to the embodiment in which the inorganic acid formed in the acylation is buffered by addition of the sodium salt of the corresponding carboxylic acid used as solvent. In a further aspect of the present invention, advantageous novel intermediates of the general formulae V, IV and II and their salts are provided wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 are as defined above, wherein in formula V, when R 2 is H, R 3 may not be H. Preference is given to compounds in which R 2 is hydrogen, R 3 is a benzyloxycarbonyl, tert.-butyloxycarbonyl or trifluoroacetyl radical, R 4 is a methyl radical and R 5 is hydrogen, or in which R 3 and R 5 are bonded together via a CO group to form a ring. X is preferably a halogen or a sulfonic acid ester, very especially preferably an OSO 3 Me group. R 1 is very especially preferably p-cyanophenyl or p-carbamoylphenyl. The advantageous compounds of the general formulae V, IV and II are used according to the invention for the preparation of intermediates of biologically active substances. The present invention is explained again in the scheme below: The cyclisation of II to I is an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution. In principle, any variant known to the person skilled in the art may be employed for that reaction. However, a number of subsidiary products, such as, for example, the removal or substitution of the leaving group, are to be expected in that reaction. For that reason it was very surprising that it was possible to find for the cyclisation, with the choice of leaving groups X, conditions that permit the use of a relatively strong basein this case sodium hydroxidein the presence of a polar protic, cation-stabilising solventin this case waterand nevertheless allow the reaction to proceed as selectively as possible. Those very inexpensive, uncritical reagents, which can readily be used for a large-scale process, are clearly to be preferred over other conditions from the prior art for the intramolecular substitution (dimethyl sulfide is not formed, sodium hydride is not used, no expensive reagents and solvents are required). A further advantage of those preferred reaction conditions is that the optical activity of enantiomerically enriched starting compounds is maintained virtually completely under the conditions according to the invention. In the above-described reaction there are preferably used derivatives of II that contain the p-cyanophenyl or p-carbamoylphenyl group as the radical R 1 , H as R 2 , and a benzyloxycarbonyl radical as R 3 . They yield advantageous compounds for the preparation of pharmaceuticals, as described, for example, in WO 94/22820. The preparation of the compounds of formula II from III can be carried out analogously to processes known from the literature. It is, however, preferred to form a sulfonic acid ester from III and sulfonic acid chloride, which ester can advantageously be reacted further in the manner indicated above, without being isolated as an intermediate, to form I. Special preference is given to the use of the mesyl (OSO 3 Me) group, which can be introduced using mesyl chloride and triethylamine as base. It is astonishing that under the preferred reaction conditions according to the invention it is not the hydrolysis of the sulfonic acid ester II but the cyclisation that is the main reaction. That was not foreseeable. It is also especially advantageous that the compounds of the general formula II do not have to be isolated before they are reacted to form I. They are formed and then preferably reacted in situ. The preparation of the compounds of the general formula III from the compounds of the general formula IV can be carried out by acid or basic hydrolysis of the O-acyl group. Under those conditions, however, partial hydrolysis, for example of the N-acyl group which may be present and of the amide bond, may occur. Under the preferred hydrolysis variant, therefore, the removal of the O-acyl group is carried out by aminolysis. Ammonia is especially preferably used for that purpose, very especially preferably its aqueous solution. Under those conditions, the Q-acyl group is removed selectively. According to the invention it is also not necessary to isolate the compounds of the general formula III. They can also be reacted directly to form compounds of the general formula II. For the present process it is, therefore, extremely advantageous to select a process variant in which, starting from derivatives of the general formula IV to the end product of the general formula I, no intermediate stage is isolated intermediately. Nevertheless, the derivatives of the general formula I are obtained in good to very good yields and with a very high degree of purity. That was surprising and could in no way be foreseen; it is, however, all the more advantageous for a large-scale process since the very cost-intensive handling of isolated intermediate products can be reduced to a minimum. There may be used as solvents for the conversion of III-II any organic solvents that are inert under the given conditions. Special preference is given to ethers, such as, for example, methyl tert.-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, dioxane, hydrocarbons, such as, for example, hexane, cyclohexane, toluene, ketones, such as, for example, acetone, diethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and carboxylic acid alkyl esters, such as, for example, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, n-butyl acetate. Very special preference is given to organic solvents that form a low-boiling azeotrope with water, such as, for example, toluene, methyl isobutyl ketone or n-butyl acetate. Compounds of formula IV, in turn, can preferably be obtained from derivatives V. In the case where the radicals R 3 and R 5 are bonded together via a CO group to form a ring, that is to say an N-carboxylic acid anhydride of the derivative in question is present, the carboxy function of the homoserine derivative does not have to be activated for the coupling. The derivatives are then simply reacted with the chosen amine, yielding compounds of formula IV wherein R 3 is H. The latter can be converted into the corresponding N-acyl compounds in accordance with processes known from the literature by reaction with an acylating reagent derived from R 3 . In the case where R 5 H, the carboxy function is activated before coupling with the amine. That is effected by methods of peptide chemistry known to the person skilled in the art (Houben-Weyl, Volume 15, 2nd part), such as, for example, via mixed anhydrides, activated esters, etc. Reaction with an acid chloride, such as, for example, pivaloyl chloride, to form the mixed anhydride is, however, preferred. The compounds of the general formula V according to the invention can be obtained from homoserine derivatives such as VII by two different methods. Either VII is first acylated at the oxygen to form VI and then processed further at the nitrogen by N-acylation to form V, or compounds of the general formula VIII, which are obtainable from VII by N-acylation, are converted into V by O-acylation. The N-acylation to form the homoserine derivative VIII can be carried out analogously to that of other amino acids (Houben-Weyl, Volume 15, Part 1 and Part 2). In principle there may be used as the acylating reagents any acylating reagents derived from R 3 , such as amino-protecting reagents, C-terminal activated amino acids or peptides. In the isolation of the N-acylhomoserines of formula VIII there was, however, the problem that those compounds, as the free acid, are very unstable and readily cyclise to form the corresponding lactones. That cyclisation is catalysed by acids and, moreover, always occurs when the acid function is activated. It takes place also in the reaction with the activated acid derivative R 4 COZ under the basic conditions which are otherwise customary for acylations. However, if the O-acylation is carried out in, as solvent, the carboxylic acid R 4 COOH corresponding to the reagent R 4 COZ used for the O-acylation, then the desired derivatives V are obtained almost exclusively. Special preference is given to the use of Cl for Z. A base is optionally and advantageously used to buffer the acid that forms during the reaction. The sodium salt of the carboxylic acid used as solvent is advantageously added as the base. The subsidiary product, the lactone, which is also formed in that process but to a lesser extent can be separated from the product mixture in a simple manner by extraction and, after ring-opening, is available for the reaction again. In the second variant, the O-acylation to form derivatives VI is carried out according to the invention in a medium that helps to prevent the N-acylation, since that would be the more rapid reaction. The reaction is, therefore, preferably carried out in a carboxylic acid such as R 4 COOH, to which the appropriate corresponding carboxylic acid halide, preferably carboxylic acid chloride, has previously been added. When the homoserine derivative VII is subsequently added, protection of the amino function of VII takes place by protonation as a result of the strong inorganic acid that forms in the solvent, and acylation of the hydroxy function preferentially occurs. The acid addition salt of the hydroxy-protected homoserine VI is therefore obtained as the product. The use of the dangerous perchloric acid, as is known from the prior art, is thus avoided. Furthermore, the yields in the process according to the invention are markedly better. The further reaction of derivatives VI to form V can in principle be carried out by processes known to the person skilled in the art using an acylating reagent derived from R 3 , such as amino-protecting reagents, C-terminal activated amino acids, peptides, or using phosgene. There was the problem, however, that the O-acylhomoserines VI rapidly undergo an O-N-acyl shift under basic conditions. According to the process of the invention, that can be avoided by maintaining the pH range, if the acylation is carried out in an aqueous medium, at from 3 to 9, preferably from 6 to 7.5. A further possibility is to react the O-acyl compounds VI in anhydrous solvents and triethylamine as base. For the reaction with phosgene, the acid addition salt VI can be used without addition of a base. There come into consideration as linear or branched (C 1 -Ce)-alkyl radicals methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec.-butyl, tert.-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl or octyl, including all possible isomers of constitution. The linear or branched (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl radical includes all the substituents listed above in connection with the (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl radical with the exception of the methyl radical, at least one double bond being present in those radicals. The scope of (C 2 -C 8 )-alkynyl corresponds to that of (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, but at least one triple bond must be present in that case. The radical (C 1 -C 8 )-alkoxy corresponds to the radical (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, with the proviso that it is bonded to the ring via an oxygen atom. (C 2 -C 8 )-Alkoxyalkyl radicals are radicals in which the alkyl chain is interrupted by at least one oxygen function, wherein two oxygens may not be bonded together. The number of carbon atoms indicates the total number of carbon atoms contained in the radical. (C 2 -C 8 )-Alkenyloxy is to be understood as meaning radicals such as (C 2 -C 8 )-alkoxy that have at least one C-C double bond. Radicals containing N, O, P, S atoms are especially alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl radicals of the above-mentioned type that have one or more of those hetero atoms in their chain or that are bonded to the molecule via one of those hetero atoms. (C 3 -C 7 )-Cycloalkyl is to be understood as being cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl or cycloheptyl radicals. There are suitable as halogens fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. An N-bonded amino acid or peptide residue is to be understood as being a compound in which the molecule in question is bonded via its N atom to the a-carbon atom of a carboxylic acid derived from an amino acid, which carboxylic acid may be part of a peptide residue. A C-bonded amino acid or peptide residue is to be understood as being a compound in which the molecule in question is bonded via its N atom to the carbon atom of the carboxyl group of an amino acid, which may be part of a peptide. (C 1 -C 8 )-Acyl is to be understood as being an alkyl radical having from one to eight carbon atoms, which may be linear or branched, that is to say which likewise includes all the possible isomers of constitution, and which is bonded to the molecule via a CO function. Within the scope of the invention, compounds having a stereogenic centre mean racemates as well as the enantiomeric antipodes of those structures. However, for the process according to the invention it is preferred to use enantiomerically enriched homoserine derivatives of the general formula VII. Thus, when the enantiomerically enriched starting materials (D or L) are used, the enantiomerically enriched products of the general formulae V and I (D or L) are obtained with virtually complete stereoconservation. Salts are to be understood as being ionic addition compounds from strong acids such as HCl, HBr, H 2 SO 4 , H 3 PO 4 , CF 3 COOH, p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid and the molecule in question. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The Examples which follow are intended to explain the invention.
