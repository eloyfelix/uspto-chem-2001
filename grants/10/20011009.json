RELATED APPLICATION DATA This application claims priority benefits under 35 U.S.C. 119 based on U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/041,781, filed Mar. 24, 1997, which application is entirely incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Vaccines have been very effective in protecting people from a wide variety of diseases, whether caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi. The ability of vaccines to induce specific protection against such a wide range of pathogenic organisms results from their ability to stimulate specific humoral antibody responses, as well as cell-mediated responses. This invention relates to a process for preparing such vaccines, and particularly to a process for making conjugates that are used in preparing vaccines. Additionally, the process of the invention can be used to produce immunogens and other valuable immunological, therapeutic, or diagnostic reagents. The invention further relates to the vaccines, immunogens, and reagents produced from the conjugates made according to the invention, as well as to the use of these products. It is often very desirable to induce immune responses against polysaccharides. For example, antibodies against a bacterial capsular polysaccharide can provide protection against that bacterium. Many polysaccharides, however, are poorly immunogenic, particularly in infants and young children. Furthermore, in both children and adults, there is usually no booster effect with repeated polysaccharide immunizations, and the principal antibody class is IgM. These features are all characteristic of so called T cell independent (TI) antigens. In many cases, the immunogenicity of polysaccharides can be enhanced by covalently linking proteins or T cell epitope-containing peptides to the polysaccharide. Certain other components, such as lipids, fatty acids, lipopolysaccharides, and lipoproteins, also are known to enhance the immunogenicity of the polysaccharide. As described in the dual conjugate patent application of Mond and Lees, conjugation of a protein to a polysaccharide can enhance the immune response to the protein as well as to the polysaccharide. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,100; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/444,727 (filed May 19, 1995); and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/468,060 (filed Jun. 6, 1995). These patent applications each are entirely incorporated herein by reference. This effect also is described in A. Lees, et al., Enhanced Immunogenicity of Protein-Dextran Conjugates: I. Rapid Stimulation of Enhanced Antibody Responses to Poorly Immunogenic Molecules, Vaccine, Vol. 12, No. 13, (1994), pp. 1160-1166. This article is entirely incorporated herein by reference. In view of this potential for improving the immune response against polysaccharides, there is a need in the art for methods to covalently link proteins or other moieties to polysaccharides. Ideally, the process of covalently linking moieties to a polysaccharide must be done in a way to maintain antigenicity of both the polysaccharide and protein components and to minimize damage to necessary epitopes of each component. Furthermore, the linkage should be stable. Therefore, there is a need for a mild and gentle means for coupling proteins, peptides, haptens, organic molecules, or other moieties to polysaccharides. Vaccines are not the only products that can benefit from an improved procedure for coupling molecules together. For example, certain diagnostic or therapeutic reagents are produced by coupling polysaccharides, high molecular weight carbohydrates, and low molecular weight carbohydrates to solid phase materials (e.g., solid particles or surfaces). Thus, there is a need in the art for improved means for coupling polysaccharides, high molecular weight carbohydrates, and low molecular weight carbohydrates to solid phase materials. Two main methods for coupling molecules together are used. In the first method, the means for coupling entails the crosslinking of a protein (or peptide or other moiety) directly to a polysaccharide (or some other moiety). Sometimes, however, a spacer molecule is needed between the coupled moieties, either to facilitate the chemical process and/or to enhance the immune response to the protein and/or the polysaccharide. In either method, it is usually necessary to activate or functionalize the polysaccharide before crosslinking occurs. Some methods of activating or functionalizing polysaccharides are described in W. E. Dick, et al., Glycoconjugates of Bacterial Carbohydrate Antigens: A Survey and Consideration of Design and Preparation Factors, Conjugate Vaccines (Eds. Cruse, et al.), Karger, Basel, 1989, Vol. 10, pp. 48-114. This excerpt is entirely incorporated herein by reference. Additional activation methods are described in R. W. Ellis, et al. (Editors), Development and Clinical Uses of Haemophilus B Conjugate Vaccines , Marcel Dekker, New York (1994), which book is entirely incorporated herein by reference. One preferred method for activating polysaccharides is described in the CDAP patent applications of Lees, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/124,491 (filed Sep. 22, 1993, now abandoned); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,651,971; 5,693,326; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/482,666 (filed Jun. 7, 1995). These U.S. patents and patent applications each are entirely incorporated herein by reference. The use of CDAP also is described in Lees, et al., Activation of Soluble Polysaccharides with 1-Cyano-4-Dimethylamino Pyridinium Tetrafluoroborate for Use in Protein-Polysaccharide Conjugate Vaccines and Immunological Reagents, Vaccine, Vol. 14, No. 3 (1996), pp. 190-198. This article also is entirely incorporated herein by reference. One specific method of preparing conjugates is through the condensation of amines (or hydrazides) and carboxyls to amides using carbodiimides. The carboxyl nucleophile reacts with the carbodiimide to form a highly reactive but unstable intermediate that can then either hydrolyze or react with an amine to form a stable amide bond. 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) is a water soluble example of this class of carbodiimide reagent. As one example of this reaction, Robbins describes functionalizing Haemophilus influenza (PRP) polysaccharide with hydrazides and condensing this functionalized material with carboxyls on tetanus toxoid. See C. Chu, et al., Infection and Immunity, Vol. 40, 1983, beginning at pg. 245. Additionally, the coupling of a carboxylated polysaccharide to diptheria toxoid by this general process also is described by Robbins. See S. C. Szu, et al., Journal of Experimental Medicine, Vol. 166, 1987, beginning at page 1510. These articles each are entirely incorporated herein by reference. In general, however, there are a myriad of problems when one attempts to use carbodiimide for coupling multivalent ligands (e.g., proteins and polysaccharides) that contain both activatable groups and nucleophiles. The reaction is difficult to control, and it frequently leads to extensive homopolymerization, interchain crosslinking, and reduced antigenicity. A further problem is that the carboxyl-carbodiimide intermediate can undergo an O to N acyl shift, resulting in a stable, unreactive addition product that adds new epitopes to the protein (see G. T. Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., (1996), which document is entirely incorporated herein by reference). Another method of forming conjugates is through the use of active ester intermediates. Reagents that form active ester intermediates include norborane, p-nitrobenzoic acid, NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide), and S-NHS (sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide). NHS esters (or other suitable reagents) can react with nucleophiles like amines, hydrazides, and thiols. The reaction products of NHS esters with amines and hydrazides are particularly stable, forming an amide bond. NHS ester intermediates can be formed in a one step process using carbodiimide (to activate the carboxyls) and NHS (or S-NHS). In this process, NHS (or S-NHS), the carboxyl-containing component, and the amine-containing component are combined, and the carbodiimide is added thereto. Although coupling efficiency often is higher in this reaction than is the case when NHS is not present, problems, such as homopolymerization, interchain crosslinking, and over-crosslinking, can occur in this process. Additionally, other undesirable side reactions can occur and cause problems, as will be described in more detail below. Alternatively, a two step activation process can be used. In this procedure, one attempts to remove or destroy the remaining carbodiimide before adding the component to be crosslinked. In one protocol using EDC and NHS, before adding the protein, the remaining carbodiimide is deactivated with a thiol (e.g., mercaptoethanol). See Grabarek and Gergely, Analytical Biochemistry, Vol. 185 (1990), beginning at pg. 131, which article is entirely incorporated herein by reference. By this method, the amount of carbodiimide present during protein addition is minimized. The addition of the thiol, however, also can hydrolyze the desired NHS ester intermediate. In this two step process, it would be preferable to isolate the NHS ester intermediate. It can be difficult, however, to isolate this intermediate because it is only moderately stable in aqueous media. An additional problem with carbodiimide/NHS procedures is the possible formation of a -alanine derivative resulting from the reaction of carbodiimide with two moles of NHS in a Lossen rearrangement (see Wilchek and Miron, Biochemistry, Vol. 26, beginning at pg. 2155, 1987, which article is entirely incorporated herein by reference). This derivative can react with amines to form an unstable crosslink. Carbodiimide and NHS also have been used to activate oligosaccharides. In such procedures, the reducing ends of oligosaccharides are functionalized with carboxyl groups and then converted to active esters using carbodiimide and NHS in organic solvents. These functionalized oligosaccharides are then coupled to proteins. See Porro, U.S. Pat. No. 5,153,312 (Oct. 6, 1992) for the use of this procedure with an oligosaccharide from Neisseria meningiditis polysaccharide type C. This patent is entirely incorporated herein by reference. The reported overall coupling efficiency, however, is low, and low molecular weight oligosaccharides are used. One reason for the low coupling efficiency is that the oligosaccharides have only one NHS per molecule. It either hydrolyzes or couples. A variety of other reagents are known for introducing NHS esters; however, most of these require dry organic solvents and are unsuitable for use in aqueous media. One exception includes certain uronium salts, such as the reagent O-(N-succinimidyl) N,N,N,N-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TSTU), which are somewhat stable in water, although more so in mixed organic/aqueous media. TSTU has been used to form NHS esters of low molecular weight molecules in organic solvents (see Moller et al., Versatile Procedure of Multiple Introduction of 8-Aminomethylene Blue into Oligonucleotides, Bioconjugate Chemistry, Vol. 6 (1995), pp. 174-178; Lefevre et al., Texas Red-X and Rhodarnine Red-X, New Derivatives of Sulforhodamine 101 and Lissamine Rhodamine B with Improved Labeling and Fluorescence Properties, Bioconjugate Chemistry, Vol. 7 (1996), pp. 482-489; and Bannwarth et al., 219, Bathophenanthroline-ruthenium (II) Complexes as Non-Radioactive Labels for Oligonucleotides which can be Measured by Time-Resolved Fluorescence Techniques, Helvetica Chimica Acta, Vol. 71 (1988), beginning at pg. 2085, which articles each are entirely incorporated herein by reference.) Additionally, TSTU and other uronium salts have been used to form NHS esters of low molecular weight molecules in mixed organic/aqueous media (see Knorr et al.,New Coupling Reagents in Peptide Chemistry, Tetrahedron Letters , Vol. 30, No. 15 (1989), pp. 1927-1930; and Bannwarth and Knorr, Formation of Carboxamides with N,N,N,N-Tetramethyl (Succinimido) Uroniumn Tetrafluoroborate in Aqueous/Organic Solvent-Systems, Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 32, No. 9 (1991), pp. 1157-1160, which articles also are entirely incorporated herein by reference). TSTU also has been used to prepare active esters of solid phase carboxylated beads in organic solvents (see Wilchek et al., Improved Method for Preparing N-Hydroxysuccinimide Ester-Containing Polymers for Affinity Chromatography, Bioconjugate Chemistry, Vol. 5 (1994), pp. 491-492, which article is entirely incorporated herein by reference). Reagents like TSTU are advantageous over the carbodiimide/NHS method because there is a reduced likelihood of various side reactions, such as an O to N shift reaction or a Lossen rearrangement. M. A. Andersson, et al., Synthesis of oligosaccharides with oligoethylene glycol spacers and their conversion into glycoconjugates using N,N,N,N-tetramethyl(succinimido)uronium tetrafluoroborate as a coupling reagent, Glycoconjugate Journal, Vol. 10 (1993), pp. 461-465, which article is entirely incorporated herein by reference, describes the use of TSTU to activate a carboxylated saccharide in a mixed aqueous/organic solvent and the subsequent coupling of this activated material to a protein. Andersson does not describe the use of this method for producing vaccines. European Patent Application No. 0,569,086 A2 (S. J. Danielson et al.) describes the use of TSTU and similar reagents for preparing active esters of insoluble carboxylated substrates and particles. These activated solids are subsequently coupled to biologically relevant molecules to prepare diagnostic reagents. This document is entirely incorporated herein by reference. Despite the various coupling and activation methods described in the various documents mentioned above, there is an on-going need in the art for improved methods for coupling biologically relevant molecules to one another to produce vaccines. Additionally, there is a need in the art for an improved procedure for coupling biologically relevant molecules to non-carboxylated surfaces and particles to produce various reagents. This invention seeks to provide an improved coupling method for producing conjugates for vaccines and immunogens. In addition, these methods will be useful for producing immunological reagents, diagnostic reagents, and therapeutic reagents. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method for producing a conjugate, and advantageously, conjugate vaccines. In this method, a first moiety (e.g., a polysaccharide, a high or low molecular weight carbohydrate, a hydroxylated compound (such as polyvinyl alcohol), etc.) is activated with a uronium salt reagent. The uronium salt reagent is believed to activate carboxyl groups or hydroxyl groups present on the first moiety, although Applicants do not wish to be bound by any specific chemical mechanisms or theories of operation. The first moiety can be present in an aqueous media, in a mixture of an aqueous/organic media, or in an organic media. According to the process of the invention, the uronium salt reagent has a chemical structure corresponding to formula I: wherein: R 1 is defined as wherein R 6 represents the carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, and optionally one or more heteroatoms, which, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, constitute a 5 to 10 membered heterocyclic ring, which may be substituted or unsubstituted. R 2 and R 3 are defined as follows: R 2 represents a hydrogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or an alkynyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms; R 3 represents a hydrogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or an alkynyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms; or R 2 and R 3 , when taken together, represent the carbon, hydrogen, sulfur, nitrogen, and/or oxygen atoms necessary to complete a 5 to 7 membered heterocyclic ring with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, wherein the heterocyclic ring can be substituted or unsubstituted. R 4 and R 5 are defined as follows: R 4 represents a hydrogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or an alkynyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms; R 5 represents a hydrogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or an alkynyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms; or R 4 and R 5 , when taken together, represent the carbon, hydrogen, sulfur, nitrogen, and/or oxygen atoms necessary to complete a 5 to 7 membered heterocyclic ring with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, wherein the heterocyclic ring can be substituted or unsubstituted. X represents an acid anion (e.g., Cl , Br , F , I , PF 6 , and BF 4 ). Other suitable acid anions for use in this invention are described in European Patent Appl. No. 0,569,086. Also, in the method of the invention, a second moiety (e.g., a protein, a peptide, a hapten, a lipoprotein, a carbohydrate, an organic molecule, a spacer molecule, a solid phase material, a homobifunctional reagent, a heterobifunctional reagent, etc.) is mixed with the first moiety. The first moiety is activated and reacts with the second moiety to form a conjugate or a functionalized first moiety. One preferred class of uronium salt reagents for use in the invention includes the salts of formula I wherein the group is a member selected from the group of: Specific reagents of this class include: 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU); 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)- 1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU); 2-(5-Norbornene-2,3-dicarboximido)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TNTU); and O-(N-Succinimidyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TSTU). Other suitable uronium salt activating reagents for use in this invention are described in European Patent Appl. No. 0,569,086. In the method of the invention, the uronium salt reagent can be mixed with the first moiety before the second moiety is mixed with the first moiety. This initiates an activation reaction between the uronium salt reagent and the first moiety. In this first step, the first moiety is activated by the uronium salt reagent, and thereafter, the second moiety is mixed with the activated first moiety. Optionally, the activated first moiety can be isolated from the reaction mixture before the second moiety is mixed in, and then the second moiety can be mixed with the isolated product that includes the uronium salt activated first moiety. As another alternative procedure, the second moiety can be mixed with the first moiety before the uronium salt reagent is mixed with the first moiety. In this manner, when the uronium salt is mixed with the mixture of the first and second moieties, the first moiety is activated by the uronium salt reagent, and the reaction between the activated first moiety and the second moiety proceeds in a single step. A single step reaction process also can occur when the uronium salt reagent and the second moiety are simultaneously mixed with the first moiety. If desired, the first moiety can be functionalized with one or more chemical groups that are capable of being activated by the uronium salt. For example, a polysaccharide can be functionalized with carboxyls. This can be achieved, for example, by activating the first moiety (e.g., a polysaccharide or a high or low molecular weight carbohydrate) with a reagent selected from the group of CNBr, CDAP, and a vinylsulfone reagent, followed by reaction with 6-aminohexanoic acid. The invention further relates to the reaction products produced by the process of the invention. These reaction products may include conjugates (including protein/polysaccharide conjugates) and conjugate vaccines (including protein/polysaccharide conjugate vaccines). The invention also can be used to produce immunogens, immunological reagents, therapeutic reagents, or diagnostic reagents. The invention also relates to methods for using these reaction products for their intended purpose. For example, the invention relates to methods of inducing an immune response in a subject by administering a conjugate vaccine to the subject. As such, the invention can be used to prevent, treat, diagnose, or ameliorate the symptoms of various diseases or ailments. The process of producing a conjugate according to this invention has several advantages over the various methods and processes disclosed in the above-noted documents. None of the documents noted above describes the use of uronium salt reagents to form conjugate vaccines. The process of the invention, on the other hand, is a straightforward and easy method for producing conjugate vaccines. The process of the invention advantageously can be performed in the solution phase and can be used with both carboxylated and non-carboxylated polysaccharides. In addition, the reaction can proceed using small quantities of reagents, allowing one to quickly, efficiently, and inexpensively determine optimum reaction conditions. Unlike many known coupling methods, the process of the invention also allows for direct coupling of the first and second moieties (e.g., the protein and polysaccharide materials). This further simplifies the reaction procedure and reduces the costs. Furthermore, the process of the invention is advantageous because it uses relatively safe reagents and mild reaction conditions (e.g., low pH, no hood or other special facilities). Many polysaccharides, such as PRP polysaccharide, are easily hydrolyzed at extreme pHs. The conditions used during uronium salt activation and coupling are relatively mild and gentle so that important epitopes are retained on the polysaccharide (i.e., minimal modifications of the protein and polysaccharide starting materials are induced). CNBr activation, on the other hand, requires the use of a high pH and a highly toxic reagent under a hood. Another advantage of the invention relates to the one step procedure described above. Because the protein and polysaccharide components (or other moieties) can be mixed together before activation and coupling is initiated, the method of the invention allows one to continue adding fresh reagent and removing excess reagents until a sufficient and desired level of coupling is achieved. This is not readily possible with other activation methods, especially those methods that require activation of the polysaccharide followed by addition of the protein. The method of the invention also allows one to monitor the progress of the coupling during the conjugation procedure, thereby limiting waste or excessive use of the various reagents. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The advantageous aspects of the invention will be more fully understood and appreciated when considered in conjunction with the following detailed description and the attached figure, wherein FIG. 1 illustrates HPLC runs for Samples 1A and 1C in Example 1 described below. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention, polysaccharides, high or low molecular weight carbohydrates, or other moieties are activated with uronium salt reagents, such as TSTU, TNTU, HBTU, or TBTU, so they may be coupled to proteins, haptens, peptides, or other moieties. The invention further relates to the conjugates produced by the method of the invention, which conjugates can be used in preparing vaccines, immunological reagents, diagnostic reagents, therapeutic reagents, immunogens, and the like. The invention also relates to methods of using the conjugates of the invention as vaccines or reagents. The conjugate vaccines of the invention can be administered to a subject to induce an immune response. The procedure of the invention is generally described as follows. A first moiety is reacted with a uronium salt reagent in a suitable environment to transfer an NHS-ester to the first moiety. For example, in accordance with the invention, a polysaccharide can be reacted with TSTU reagent in a base, such as dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) base. This reaction can take place in an aqueous media, in a mixed organic/aqueous media, or in an organic media. Various organic solvents can be used, including acetonitrile, dimethylformamide (DMF), and N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP). A mildly basic pH generally is maintained during the reaction (e.g., 8 to 9.5), if necessary, by adding more base. The second moiety (e.g., a protein) is mixed with the first moiety at some time during this procedure. The amount of uronium salt reagent can be adjusted and the activation time varied to optimize the activation and coupling efficiency. The addition of the uronium salt reagent can be staggered to minimize excess uronium salt reagent in the reaction at any given time. If desired, old or excess uronium salt reagent can be removed, e.g., by dialysis or ultrafiltration, before new reagent is mixed with the protein/polysaccharide mixture. In this manner, one can minimize the amount and percentage of organic solvent in the mixture and also maintain the protein and polysaccharide concentration at an optimum level to facilitate good coupling. This reagent removal step offers a level of control over the coupling because small amounts of activating reagent can be added, as necessary, and the progress of the conjugation reaction procedure can be monitored (e.g., by analyzing aliquots of the reaction mixture). This procedure also offers possibilities for scaling up the conjugation procedure. Those skilled in the art will be capable of determining optimum reaction conditions (such as pH and reaction time), reagent amounts, and reagent concentrations through routine experimentation. Any conjugation procedure can be followed without departing from the invention. For example, in one procedure, a carboxylated polysaccharide is used as the starting material. This can be accomplished by starting with a polysaccharide that naturally contains carboxyl groups, such as Neisseria meningiditis polysaccharide type C (Neisseria PsC). Alternatively, carboxyl groups can be added to a polysaccharide. A variety of procedures are known to those skilled in the art for carboxylating polysaccharides. For example, polysaccharides can be activated with CNBr or CDAP and carboxylated with an appropriate reagent, such as 6-aminohexanoic acid. CNBr activation is described by W. E. Dick, supra., and CDAP activation is described in the patent applications and articles of Lees described above. Vinyl sulfone reagents also can be used to activate polysaccharides, as described in U.S. Provisional Patent Appln. No. 60/017,103 in the name of Andrew Lees, filed May 9, 1996, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/852,733, filed May 7, 1997, which applications are entirely incorporated herein by reference. In a one step protocol according to the invention, the first moiety and the second moiety are mixed first, and the uronium salt reagent then is mixed in. The uronium salt reagent can be added in small amounts at a plurality of different times. The first moiety is activated and reacts with the second moiety. This one step protocol is described in more detail in the following general example. First, a first moiety (e.g., a polysaccharide) is mixed with a second moiety (e.g., a protein). Then, a uronium salt reagent (e.g., TNTU or TSTU) is mixed with this mixture, followed by the addition of a base material (e.g., triethylamine (TEA)). Under this procedure, the operator can continue adding additional TNTU and/or TEA until a sufficient or desired level of coupling is observed. In fact, the reaction procedure and degree of coupling can be determined at various different times by analyzing aliquots of the reaction mixture as the reaction proceeds. In a two step protocol according to the invention, the first moiety (e.g., a polysaccharide) is activated with a uronium salt reagent, and thereafter, the second moiety (e.g., a protein) is mixed with the activated first moiety. The buffer, reagent concentration, time, and temperature conditions, etc. can be selected such that at the time the second moiety (i.e., the component to be linked) is mixed in, the concentration of the activating reagent is too low to cause significant polymerization of that component. Due to the relative stability of the NHS-ester and their multiplicity on the first moiety, there can still be a sufficient number of activated groups on the first moiety molecule at the time the second moiety is mixed in for coupling to take place. In this way, one can avoid the necessity of isolating the activated intermediate of the first moiety. If desired and if the intermediate is stable, however, the reaction product of the uronium salt and first moiety reaction (e.g., the uronium salt activated polysaccharide) can be isolated before the second moiety material (e.g., the protein) is mixed with it. Also, in accordance with the invention, the first moiety can be activated with the uronium salt reagent, isolated, and stored for later use, as long as it remains stable under the isolation and storage conditions. The presence of some uronium salt reagent at the time the second moiety is mixed in may not be detrimental because it can promote coupling of the second moiety to the first moiety by continuing to activate the moieties. Actually, the presence of some excess uronium salt reagent when the second moiety is added in this two step protocol may make the overall procedure somewhat of a blend of the one and two step procedures. In general, at least two mechanisms are available for activating a first moiety. In one mechanism, carboxyl groups on the first moiety are activated, and in the other mechanism, hydroxyl groups are activated. The process of the invention can be used with many polysaccharides because they are or can be carboxylated or hydroxylated. Because many polysaccharides naturally contain carboxyl groups as part of their repeat unit, e.g., Neisseria PsC, a separate carboxylation is not always necessary. Typically, some of these carboxyl groups can be modified without destroying the antigenicity of the polysaccharide. These native carboxyls can be used, or carboxylated arms can easily be added to the polysaccharide, as described in the examples. In other cases, carboxyl groups can be introduced easily, especially with CDAP. For example, CDAP can be used to derivatize Pneumococcal polysaccharide type 14 (Pn 14) with 6-aminohexanoic acid. Amine-containing polysaccharides can be carboxylated using glutaric anhydride. Carboxymethyl dextran can be prepared easily from dextran and chloroacetic acid in base, as described by Inman, Journal of Immunology, Vol. 114, page 704 (1975) (which article is entirely incorporated herein by reference). Methods for converting various functional groups to carboxyl groups also are well known. Note the discussion in G. T. Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., (1996), pg. 187. Thus, many polysaccharides can be carboxylated and activated by the method according to the invention. As noted above, however, it is not a requirement that the first moiety starting material contain carboxyls. Hydroxyl groups on the first moiety also can be activated with uronium salt reagents. As demonstrated in the examples below, the process of the invention can be used with starting materials that do not contain carboxyls (e.g., Pn 14). Thus, using a first moiety material that contains carboxyls should be viewed as optional. Different starting materials can be used in the process according to the invention. For example, the first moiety can be a polysaccharide, a high or low molecular weight carbohydrate, or a hydroxylated compound (e.g., a synthetic hydroxylated compound, such as polyvinyl alcohol or polyethylene glycol). Additionally, the first moiety can be a natural or synthetic material that is either soluble or insoluble in water. Examples of specific polysaccharides for use in the method according to the invention include dextran, carboxylated dextran (such as carboxymethyl dextran), Neisseria meningiditis polysaccharide type C, Pneumococcal polysaccharides (such as Pn 14, Pn 6, Pn 19, and Pn 23), and Haemophilus influenza (PRP) polysaccharide. Examples of suitable high or low molecular weight carbohydrates for use in the invention include sucrose, PRP oligosaccharide, lipopolysaccharide, and lipooligosaccharide. Examples of suitable hydroxylated compounds for use in the invention include polyvinyl alcohol, Ficoll, and polyethylene glycol. In the reaction process of the invention, the activated first moiety reacts with a second moiety present in the reaction mixture. Suitable examples of materials that can be used as the second moiety include proteins, haptens, peptides, lipoproteins, carbohydrates, organic molecules, spacer molecules, solid phase materials, homobifunctional reagents, or heterobifunctional reagents. This second moiety can be a natural or synthetic material that is either soluble or insoluble in water. The process according to the invention can be used to make conjugates of these first and second moieties, including protein/polysaccharide conjugates, glycosolated protein/protein conjugates and the like. Additionally, an activated first moiety (e.g., an activated polysaccharide) can be coupled to an amino or hydrazide surface in the process of the invention to produce reagents. Examples of specific suitable proteins for use in this invention include bovine serum albumin, tetanus toxoid, diptheria toxoid, pertussis toxoid, rib protein, intimin, and gD protein. Examples of suitable peptides for use in the invention include LHRH peptide and CFA/I consensus peptide (see F. J. Cassels, et al., Journal of Industrial Microbiology, 1996 Annual Meeting for the Society of Industrial Microbiology). Examples of suitable lipoproteins for use in the invention include lipoOspA and lipoD. Examples of suitable haptens include PamCys and monophosphorolipid A. Examples of other carbohydrates for use in the invention include glycosolated proteins and horseradish peroxidase. An example of a suitable organic molecule for use in the invention includes biotin hydrazide. Examples of suitable spacer molecules include hexanediamine and adipic dihydrazide. Examples of suitable solid phase materials for use in the invention include ELISA (enzyme-linked imnmunosorbent assay) plates, beads, and chromatography media. Examples of suitable heterobifunctional reagents include hydrazido 3-(2-pyridyl dithio) propionate and mercaptoethyl amine. An example of a suitable homobifunctional reagent for use in the invention includes cystamine. Preferred uronium salt reagents for use according to the invention include the members the following group: 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU); 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU); 2-(5-Norbornene-2,3-dicarboximido)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TNTU); and O-(N-Succinimidyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TSTU). These uronium salts are available from NovaChem. Additionally, TSTU can be obtained from Aldrich. TSTU and TNTU are particularly preferred uronium salt reagents. Because it is a relatively mild reagent, TSTU is a less harmful crosslinker than carbodiimides. Applicants have observed that TSTU appears to cause much less homopolymerization of proteins than does EDC. Various vaccines can be made using conjugates produced by the process of the invention. The vaccines include, but are not limited to, the vaccines set forth below: Diphtheria vaccine Pertussis (subunit) vaccine Tetanus vaccine H. influenzae, type b (polyribose phosphate) S. pneumoniae, all serotypes E. coli, endotoxin or J5 antigen (LPS, Lipid A, and Gentabiose) E. coli, O polysaccharides (serotype specific) Klebsiella, polysaccharides (serotype specific) S. aureus, types 5 and 8 (serotype specific and common protective antigens) S. epidermidis, serotype polysaccharide I, II, and III (and common protective antigens) N. meningiditis, serotype specific or protein antigens Polio vaccine Mumps, measles, rubella vaccine Respiratory Syncytial Virus Rabies Hepatitis A, B, C, and others Human immunodeficiency virus I and II (GP120, GP41, GP160, p24, others) Herpes simplex types 1 and 2 CMV EBV Varicella/Zoster Malaria Tuberculosis Candida albicans, other candida Pneumocystis carinii Mycoplasma Influenzae virus A and B Adenovirus Group A streptococcus Group B streptococcus, serotypes, Ia, Ib, II, and III Pseudomonas aeroginosa (serotype specific) Rhinovirus Parainfluenzae, types 1, 2, and 3 Coronaviruses Salmonella Shigella Rotavirus Enteroviruses Chlamydia trachomatis and pneumoniae (TWAR) Glycoproteins Neo-formans cryptococcus As one specific example of the process of the invention, uronium salts can be used to activate lipopolysaccharides or lipooligosaccharides in the manner described in more detail in the examples below. Thereafter, the activated lipopolysaccharide or lipooligosaccharide can be coupled to a protein for use in a vaccine. Antibodies to lipopolysaccharides and lipooligosaccharides can provide protection against sepsis and non-typeable Haemophilus influenza. Such conjugates of lipopolysaccharides or lipooligosaccharides with a protein (e.g., tetanus toxoid) fall within this invention. In the process of the invention, conjugates can be made wherein the weight ratio of the second moiety to the first moiety in the conjugate is greater than 0.05 mg/mg (e.g., 0.05 mg protein/mg polysaccharide). For protein/polysaccharide conjugate vaccines, the weight ratio of protein to polysaccharide can be greater than 0.05, with a range of 0.05 to 7 being preferred, and the range of 0.1 to 2 mg protein per mg of polysaccharide being particularly preferred. The invention will be described more specifically below in terms of various preferred embodiments and specific examples. These preferred embodiments and specific examples should be construed as being illustrative of the invention, and not as limiting the same. Additionally, certain examples use bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein and/or dextran as a model polysaccharide. Of course, biologically relevant proteins and polysaccharides also can be used in the practice of the invention. Specific examples including biologically relevant proteins and polysaccharides also are included in this application. Many of the specific examples below include the use of DMAP as a base in the reaction process. Many other bases, however, also can be used. For example, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, triethylamine, or diethylisopropylamine also can be used without departing from the invention. The following examples also include various abbreviations, standard procedures, and materials that are well known to those skilled in the art. The following information will help one to more readily understand the information included in the following examples. These definitions apply in the following examples, unless there is an indication to the contrary. Monomeric BSA is used in certain examples because the use of the monomeric protein makes it easier to observe the coupling process as a shift in the molecular weight. The monomeric BSA used in these examples was prepared from Cohn fraction V BSA (from Sigma Chemical Co.) or Intergen low endotoxin BSA (from Intergen Corp.) by brief treatment with 10 mM iodoacetamide in HEPES buffer (described below) at pH 7.3, and then gel filtration on a 2.5100 cm S100HR column (from Pharmacia) as described in Lees, et al., Vaccine, Vol. 14, No. 3, (1996) pp. 190-198 (described above). The dextran was T2000 dextran obtained from Pharmacia. For some experiments, the high molecular weight fraction of the T2000 dextran was used. This material was obtained by passing dextran over a gel filtration column (2.5100 cm S400 HR), as described above. Tetanus toxoid, the various Pneumococcal polysaccharides, the Neisseria meningiditis polysaccharide, and the PRP polysaccharide were obtained from SmithKline Beecham (Rixensart, Belgium). Commercial sources for suitable proteins and polysaccharides for use with the invention include American Tissue Culture Collection of Rockville, Md. and Bema Laboratories of Fla. HEPES buffer (or HE buffer), as used in this application, represents a mixture of 0.15 M hydroxyethyl piperazine N-2-ethane sulfonic acid (HEPES) and 2 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA) to provide a solution having a pH of 7.3. HEPES refers to HEPES alone, without EDTA (pH8). 5HEPES buffer (or 5HE buffer) represents a mixture of 0.75 M HEPES and 10 mM EDTA to provide a solution having a pH of 7.3. 2.5HEPES buffer represents a mixture of equal volumes of 5HEPES buffer and saline. Saline represents a 0.15 M solution of NaCl in water. When high performance liquid chromatographs (HPLC) are conducted, unless indicated to the contrary, a Waters model 626 pump was used with a model 600S controller and a model 486 absorbance detector. Prior to running the HPLC chromatographs, all samples were spin filtered using an ultrafree MC 0.45 m filter unit. The size exclusion HPLC columns used, unless indicated to the contrary, were Phenomenex Biosep G4000 columns (3007.8 mm), equilibrated with 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.3. The run velocity was 1 ml/min. Some runs included the use of a guard column of the same material. Sterile filtering, when performed, was performed on a Millex GV device, unless indicated to the contrary. The pH, as used in this application, refers to apparent pH as measured by a Ross electrode (available from Orion Research) or estimated with colorfast pH paper (available from EM Science.) Furthermore, in this application, unless indicated to the contrary, the presence of amines was determined using a trinitrobenzenesulfonic (TNBS) acid assay, as described by J. Vidal and C. Franci, J Immunol. Meth., Vol. 86, pg. 155 (1986). The presence of hydrazides also was determined using a TNBS assay as described by Qi, et al., Anal. Chem., Vol. 275, pg. 139 (1988). The presence of polysaccharides was determined using the resorcinol/sulfuric acid method of Monsigny, et al., Anal. Chem. Vol. 175, pg. 525 (1988), using the relevant polysaccharide standard. The presence of protein was determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (available from Pierce Chemical Co., of Rockport, Ill.) (an appropriate protein, such as BSA or tetanus toxoid, was used as the standard). All of these cited documents are entirely incorporated herein by reference. Finally, where HPLC is used for determining the extent of conjugation (e.g., mg protein/mg polysaccharide), it is calculated from the initial protein/polysaccharide ratio in the starting materials and the percent of the UV absorbance for the conjugated protein peak (based on the total UV absorbance of the protein), as measured by the HPLC. EXAMPLE 1 In this first example, dextran polysaccharide moieties were coupled to a BSA protein moiety to produce a conjugate. The dextran moieties were both carboxylated and non-carboxylated. Carboxymethyl dextran (CM dextran) was prepared at a concentration of 39 mg dextran/mi in saline by the method of Inman, identified above. The non-carboxylated dextran was present at a concentration of 74 mg/ml in saline. The monomeric BSA protein was present at a concentration of 32 mg/ml in 2.5HEPES buffer having a pH of 7.3. TSTU and DMAP reagents each were present as 0.2 M solutions in DMF. Sample 1A For this Sample, 82 l of the CM dextran material was mixed with 82 l of water and 86 l DMF. At time t0, 10 l TSTU and 10 l DMAP were added to the dextran material. At time t1 minute, an additional 10 l of TSTU was added, and at time t2 minutes, an additional 10 l TSTU was added. During this portion of the procedure, DMAP was added as necessary to maintain the pH of the solution in the range of 8-9. In total, approximately 50 l of DMAP was added. At time t5 minutes, 100 l of the BSA material was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was allowed to react overnight at a temperature of 4 C. to produce the conjugate. Sample 1B In Sample 1B, the procedure for Sample 1A was followed, but T2000 dextran was used in place of the CM dextran material. Sample 1C For Sample 1C, the procedure for Sample 1A was followed, but 82 l of saline was substituted for the CM dextran material used in Sample 1A. This Sample was a control sample illustrating the effects of eliminating the polysaccharide material. The reaction products of Samples 1A through 1C were analyzed by HPLC on a Phenomenex Biosep SEC3000, 7.8150 cm, equilibrated in 0.1 M KPO 4 at a pH of 7.3. It was found that Sample 1A, using CM dextran, produced a BSA/dextran conjugate having about 0.67 mg BSA/mg dextran. Sample 1B, using a non-carboxylated dextran starting material, resulted in a BSA/dextran conjugate having about 0.87 mg BSA/mg dextran. Sample 1C, the control sample which did not include a dextran polysaccharide, showed less than 5% high molecular weight protein. This indicates that only a small amount of dimerization of the protein resulted from the reaction procedure. FIG. 1 illustrates the HPLC runs for Samples 1A and 1C. As shown in the HPLC for Sample 1A, a very pronounced high molecular weight absorbance peak was found for the conjugate. This high molecular weight peak represents the BSA/TSTU/CM dextran conjugate of Sample 1A. The HPLC run for Control Sample 1C, which included saline substituted for the CM dextran polysaccharide, did not exhibit this high molecular weight peak corresponding to a conjugate. This Example demonstrates that uronium salts can be used to produce conjugates of proteins with both carboxylated and non-carboxylated polysaccharides. There is minimal homopolymerization of the protein component in this reaction process. EXAMPLE 2 This Example illustrates that various different polysaccharides can be activated with uronium salt reagents. Furthermore, the polysaccharides in this Example, once activated, were functionalized with either amines or hydrazides. For Samples 2A and 2H, non-carboxylated dextran was used as the polysaccharide. This polysaccharide was activated by the uronium salt reagents and derivatized with both amines (Sample 2A) and hydrazides (Sample 2H). Samples 2B through 2E use clinically relevant Pneumococcal (Pn) capsular polysaccharides. Samples 2F and 2G demonstrate that uronium salt reagents can be used to activate carboxylated polysaccharides, and Sample 2F further demonstrates that this class of reagents can activate a plant polysaccharide. Sample 2I shows use of the invention with a clinically relevant PRP polysaccharide. The experimental protocols for performing the activation and derivatization will be described in more detail below. The following reagents were prepared and used in the various experiments described below, unless there is some indication to the contrary: (a) TSTU reagent prepared as a 0.5 M solution in DMF; (b) DMAP reagent prepared as a 0.5 M solution in water; (c) ethylenediamine reagent prepared as a 1 M solution in water; and (d) adipic dihydrazide solution prepared as a 0.5 M solution in water. Sample 2A Sample 2A was prepared according to the following protocol. 65 l of T2000 dextran, at a concentration of 74 mg/ml, was mixed with 35 l of saline and 100 l of water. At time t0, 20 l of TSTU (0.5 M in DMF) was added to the solution. At time t20 seconds, 20 l of DMAP (0.5 M in water) was added, and then at t1 minute and t1.5 minute, 20 additional l of TSTU was added to the reaction mixture. In total, 60 l of TSTU was added to the dextran starting material. During the procedure, DMAP was added, as necessary, to maintain the pH of the reaction solution in the range of 8 to 8.5. At time t2 minutes, 300 l of 0.67 M ethylenediamine in water was added. After 1 hour, the reaction mixture was desalted on a P6DG column (from BioRad), equilibrated in saline, and pooled. The resulting material was assayed for amines and dextran, and it was determined that the resulting activated polysaccharide contained 9.4 NH 2 /100 KDa dextran. Sample 2B This Sample describes the activation of a biologically relevant polysaccharide using the uronium salts in the process of the invention. At time t0, 20 l of TSTU was added to 0.5 ml of a Pn 14 polysaccharide solution, having a concentration of 10 mg Pn 14/ml in water. Immediately thereafter, 20 l DMAP was added to the solution. At time t1 minute, an additional 20 l of TSTU was added, and at time t1.5 minute, an additional 20 l TSTU was added. A suitable amount of DMAP was added during this procedure to maintain the reaction solution at a pH of about 8.5. At time t2 minutes, 200 l of the 1 M ethylenediamine solution was added. After about 1 hour, the reaction mixture was desalted on a P6DG column (available from BioRad), equilibrated with saline. Assays were performed to determine the presence of amines (NH 2 ) and the polysaccharide, and it was determined that this activated polysaccharide contained 7.6 NH 2 /100 KDa Pn 14. Sample 2C In this Sample, the procedure of Sample 2B was followed, except the starting material was 0.5 ml Pn 6 at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in water. After the initial assay, the samples were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon device (available from Amicon). The sample was rerun on the P6DG column and reassayed. It was determined that the resulting activated Pn 6 polysaccharide contained 10.4 NH2/100 KDa Pn 6. Sample 2D In this Sample, the procedure of Sample 2B was followed, except the starting material was 0.5 ml Pn 19, having a concentration of 10 mg/ml in saline. It was determined that the resulting activated Pn 19 polysaccharide contained 9.9 NH 2 /100 KDa Pn 19. Sample 2E In this Sample, the procedure of Sample 2C was followed, except the starting material was 0.5 ml Pn 23 having a concentration of 10 mg/ml in saline. It was determined that the resulting activated Pn 23 polysaccharide contained 3.4 NH 2 /100 KDa Pn23. Sample 2F For this Sample, the polysaccharide solution was 0.5 ml pectin (citrus fruit pectin available from Sigma) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in water, plus 200 l sodium carbonate (1M), at a pH of about 9.6. At time t0, 20 l of 0.5 M TSTU (in DMF) was added to this polysaccharide solution. Then, at time t1 minute, an additional 20 l of TSTU was added, and the pH was maintained in the range of 9-9.5 using the 1 M sodium carbonate solution. At time t3 minutes, 500 l of 1M ethylenediamine (in water) was added. This reaction mixture was allowed to stand overnight at room temperature, and then it was desalted on a P6DG column (available from BioRad). It was determined that the resulting activated polysaccharide contained 8.4 NH 2 /100 KDa Pectin. Sample 2G For this Sample, 200 l of CM dextran (containing 7.5 carboxyls/100 KDa), at a concentration of 48 mg/ml in saline, was mixed with 200 l of water. At time t0, 20 l of TSTU (0.5 M in DMF) was added to the solution. At time t20 seconds, 20 l of DMAP (0.5 M in water) was added, and then at t1 minute and t1.5 minute, 20 additional l of TSTU was added to the reaction mixture. In total, 60 l of TSTU was added to the CM dextran starting material. During the procedure, DMAP was added, as necessary, to maintain the pH of the reaction solution in the range of 8 to 8.5. At time t2 minutes, 200 l of 0.5 M ethylenediamine (in water) was added. After 1 hour, the reaction mixture was desalted on a P6DG column (from BioRad), equilibrated in saline, pooled, concentrated on a Centricon 30 device (available from Amicon), and desalted again. The resulting material was assayed for amines and dextran, and it was determined that the resulting activated polysaccharide contained 10.6 NH 2 /100 KDa CM dextran. Sample 2H In this Sample, the procedure of Sample 2B was followed, except the starting material was 100 l T2000 dextran having a concentration of 55 mg/ml in water. Also, during the reaction procedure, at time t2 minutes, 200 l of the 0.5 M adipic dihydrazide solution was added instead of the 200 l of 1 M ethylenediamine solution added in the process of Sample 2B. It was determined that the resulting activated T2000 dextran polysaccharide contained 8.9 hydrazide (Hz) per 100 KDa dextran. Sample 2I In this Sample, a PRP polysaccharide was activated using a TNTU uronium salt reagent. To do so, 80 l of 0.3 M TNTU (in NMP) and 48 l of 0.5 M TEA (in NMP) were mixed into 0.5 ml of PRP (at a concentration of 10 mg/ml) in 2M NaCl. After 2 minutes, 250 l of 0.5 M hexanediamine in 0.1 M sodium borate (pH9.3) was added to the above mixture. The reaction proceeded overnight at a temperature of 4 C. The reaction mixture was then desalted on a P6DG column (available from BioRad), equilibrated with saline. The reaction product was assayed for amines and the polysaccharide, and it was determined that the resulting material had 11.4 NH 2 groups/100 kDa PRP. Conclusion Regarding Example 2 This Example illustrates that uronium salt reagents can be used to derivatize a variety of different polysaccharides and to functionalize the polysaccharides with either amines or hydrazides. Proteins or any other second moieties can be substituted for diamine or dihydrazide and coupled to the activated polysaccharides. Also, this Example shows that clinically relevant polysaccharides can be functionalized by the process of the invention, as well as plant polysaccharides. EXAMPLE 3 This Example demonstrates the process of the invention wherein the uronium salt reagents are removed before the protein is coupled to the activated polysaccharide. The polysaccharide starting material was 5 mg of T2000 dextran material, present at a concentration of 74 mg dextran/ml solution (corresponding to about 68 l of the dextran solution). 68 l water, 135 l NMP, 50 l 0.2 M TSTU (in NMP), and 50 l 0.2 M DMAP (in NMP) were added to this dextran solution. The pH at the start was about 9.6, and it dropped from this level. At time t30 minutes, about 1 ml of water was added. The excess reagents were then removed by ultrafiltration using a Filtron Omega 30 K membrane, 10 ml size, to produce 0.5 ml final volume. An additional 1 ml of water then was added, and the resulting mixture was concentrated to about 400 l. The polysaccharide was removed from the apparatus, and an additional 100 l of water was used to rinse the membrane, thereby providing a total volume of about 500 l. BSA monomer was added at a ratio of 1.7 mg BSA/mg dextran to this activated polysaccharide solution. The final BSA concentration was about 7.3 mg/ml. This reaction mixture was allowed to stand overnight at a temperature of about 4 C. An HPLC was conducted (OD 280 nm) to determine the existence of a BSA/dextran conjugate and the amount of BSA material present in the conjugate reaction product. The HPLC was conducted on a Phenomenex SEC3000, 1507.8 cm, equilibrated with 0.1 M KPO 4 , pH7.3, at a run velocity of 1 ml/minute. From HPLC, it was found that 35% of the protein was present in the high molecular weight peak for the conjugate (and 65% was present as free protein). Therefore, the resulting conjugate was found to contain about 0.6 mg BSA/mg dextran. EXAMPLE 4 For this example, the uronium salt reagent and various other reagents were added to the polysaccharide material at different times. Between additions of the uronium salt reagent, excess reagents were removed by ultrafiltration. A solution was prepared containing 15 mg dextran, 15 mg BSA monomer, and 3.33 ml saline. At time t0, 40 l of 0.3 M TNTU (in NMP) and 12 l of 1 M TEA (in NMP) were added to the solution. Then, at time t2 minutes, an additional 6 l of TEA was added. At time t1 hour, the following washing protocol was performed. The mixture was washed by ultrafiltration (on a Filtron Omega 30, 10 ml size). The filtered mixture was diluted to 10 ml with saline and then concentrated to 3 ml. Of this solution, 0.6 ml was removed for analysis. To the remaining polysaccharide solution, TNTU and TEA were added in the same manner as described above. After 1 hour of reaction time, the wash protocol was again repeated. At this time, 0.6 ml again was removed for analysis. The TNTU and TEA addition procedure was repeated a third time and again a fourth time, with the washing protocol as described above provided between these procedures. For these third and fourth additions, however, the amount of TNTU and TEA was doubled. After the fourth addition of TNTU and TEA, after the reaction proceeded for 1.5 hours, the reaction mixture was concentrated to 1.5 ml, and 0.5 ml of this solution was removed for analysis. The remaining material was concentrated to 0.6 ml. 40 l of TNTU and 10 l of TEA were added to the remaining 0.6 ml of material. After 1 hour, the mixture was passed over a S400HR gel filtration column. Through analysis of the samples, it was found that after the first addition, the resulting conjugate material contained about 0.043 mg BSA/mg dextran. After the fourth addition, the conjugate contained 0.17 mg BSA/mg dextran. This Example demonstrates that when the protein and polysaccharide are dilute, there is less coupling then when they are more concentrated. By the repeated addition of reagents, it was possible to significantly increase the amount of coupling. Removal of the used reagent and solvent kept their concentrations low, even when they were added multiple times. EXAMPLE 5 In this Example, a carbohydrate was coupled to a protein using TSTU to form a conjugate. For this procedure, 20 l of 0.5 M TSTU (in DMF, corresponding to about 10 moles TSTU) and 20 l of 0.5 M DMAP (in water) were mixed into 200 l sucrose (corresponding to about 30 moles). At time t1 minute, an additional 20 l of the TSTU solution and 20 l of the DMAP solution were added. At time t1.5 minutes, an additional 20 l of the TSTU solution and another 20 l DMAP were added. Then, at time t2 minutes, 200 l of 32.2 mg/ml BSA (monomeric) in saline was added to the activated sucrose solution. After about 20 seconds, 20 l of 1 M sodium carbonate was added, and then another 20 l of 1 M sodium carbonate was added. After about 20 minutes, the resulting reaction mixture was desalted on a 115 cm P6DG column (available from BioRad), equilibrated with PBS, and the void volumes were pooled. Then, the material was concentrated using a Centricon 30 device (available from Amicon) and again desalted, and finally the void volumes were pooled. The protein content was determined by the BioRad assay, and the carbohydrate content was determined using the resorcinol assay with sucrose as the standard. It was found that the resulting conjugate had 17.5 moles sucrose per mole BSA. This indicated coupling of a low molecular weight carbohydrate to a protein. EXAMPLE 6 Various uronium salts are used in this example to demonstrate that different salts can be used to activate polysaccharides in the process of the invention. In total, four different uronium salts, namely TSTU, TNTU, HBTU, and TBTU, were tested in this Example. All of the starting uronium salts were produced in a 0.3 M solution in NMP. DMAP used in this procedure also was present in a 0.3 M solution in NMP. The BSA protein material is monomeric with a concentration of 64.4 mg BSA/ml. This BSA material was mixed 1:1 (by weight) with 5HEPES buffer (which corresponds to 0.75 M HEPES and 5 mM EDTA to produce a solution having a pH of about 7.3). To carry out the reaction procedure for this Example, 54 l of T2000 dextran at a concentration of 74.4 mg/ml (corresponding to 4 mg dextran) was mixed with 28 l saline, 82 l water, and 86 l NMP in each of four different test tubes. Then, at time t0, 10 l of one of the uronium salts was added to each test tube so that each test tube contained a different uronium salt. 10 l of DMAP also was added to each test tube along with the uronium salt. At time t1 minute, an additional 10 l of the appropriate uronium salt was added to the corresponding test tube, and again at time t2 minutes, an additional 10 l of the appropriate uronium salt was added to the corresponding test tube. During this portion of the reaction procedure, the pH of the solution was maintained in the range of 8-9 with DMAP, and a total of about 50 l of DMAP was needed in each test tube to maintain the pH in this range. At the time t10 minutes, 100 l of the BSA solution was added to each test tube, which amount corresponds to about 1 mg BSA/mg dextran. The reaction in each test tube was allowed to proceed for about 20 hours, at which time the reaction product was assayed by HPLC on a Phenomenex BioSep G4000 (1507.8 cm, 50% 0.1 M KPO 4 , pH7.3, 50% 0.5 M KCl, 1 ml/minute) monitored at 280 nm. The assay results are tabulated below. TABLE 1 Uronium Salt % HMW BSA TSTU 79% TNTU 87% HBTU 36% TBTU 27% These test results confirm that all of the tested uronium salt reagents worked to activate the polysaccharide and supported coupling of the activated polysaccharide to the protein. EXAMPLE 7 This Example demonstrates that TNTU can be used to activate synthetic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The PVA was obtained from Aldrich (catalog number 36,062-7). It was 80% hydrolyzed and had an average molecular weight of 9000 to 10,000. The PVA was solubilized in water, with gentle heating, to a concentration of 20 mg/ml. 250 l of this PVA solution (corresponding to about 5 mg PVA) was mixed with 250 l hexanediamine to provide a solution having a pH of about 8. At time t0, 40 l of 0.3 M TNTU and 24 l 1 M TEA in NMP were added to the PVA solution. Then, at time t1 minute, an additional 12 l of the 1 M TEA solution was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight. A solid lump formed in the solution, and the mixture was warmed to resolubilize the solid. The resultant solution was then dialyzed exhaustively into saline (volume about 3.5 ml). It was determined that the resulting PVA solution, activated with TNTU, was about 0.113 mM in NH 2 , which corresponds to more than 6 NH 2 /100 KDa. This Example demonstrates that a uronium salt (e.g., TNTU in this example) can activate secondary alcohols. Since PVA is a synthetic polymer (not containing carboxyl groups), this shows that the process of the invention can be used to activate synthetic, non-carboxylated polymers. EXAMPLE 8 This Example is provided to demonstrate the one step procedure for simultaneously activating and coupling clinically relevant proteins and polysaccharides. Sample 8A For this sample, the protein starting material, tetanus toxoid, was present in a saline solution at a concentration of 16.8 mg/ml. The polysaccharide used was a PRP polysaccharide, solubilized at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in 2 M NaCl by rotating for one hour at room temperature. The TNTU activating agent was present in a 0.3 M solution in NMP. The TEA used in this Example was present in a 2 M solution in NMP. Finally, the glycine used was at a 2 M concentration in water, adjusted to pH 8. For the reaction procedure, 0.5 ml of the PRP solution (corresponding to 5 mg PRP) was combined with 297 l of the tetanus toxoid solution (corresponding to 5 mg of TT). This mixture was then concentrated to 0.5 ml using a Centricon 50 device (from Amicon). Thereafter, at time t0, 50 l of the TNTU activating agent was added. Approximately 15 seconds later, 20 l of the TEA was added. After 2 hours, 100 l of the glycine reagent was added. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand overnight. Then, the sample was passed over a 150 cm S400HR gel filtration column, equilibrated with saline. The high molecular weight fractions were pooled and assayed for tetanus toxoid and PRP. The material was found to have 0.78 mg tetanus toxoid per mg of PRP. Sample 8B For this Sample, a tetanus toxoid/Neisseria PsC conjugate was prepared using TNTU as an activating agent to activate the Neisseria PsC. This reaction procedure followed the one-step reaction protocol wherein the protein and polysaccharide are first mixed together, and thereafter, the uronium salt activating reagent is added to this mixture. First, 238 l of tetanus toxoid (having a concentration of 16.8 mg/ml) was added to 0.4 ml of Neisseria PsC (having a concentration of 10 mg/ml in saline). This mixture was then concentrated to about 0.3 ml using a Filtron Omega 30 pressure filtration device. 50 l of 0.3 M TNTU (in NMP) was then added to the concentrated protein/polysaccharide mixture. Thereafter, 50 l of 1M TEA (in NMP) was added, and shortly thereafter, an additional 25 l of 1 M TEA was added. The reaction proceeded overnight at 4 C. The mixture was passed over a S400HR gel filtration column (Pharmacia), 150 cm, equilibrated with PBS. The mixture was then sterile filtered on a Millex GV to obtain the high molecular weight fraction. This reaction product was assayed to determine the tetanus toxoid and Neisseria PsC content. It was found that the resulting conjugate contained 0.32 mg TT/mg Neisseria PsC. As is evident from the test results, this Example demonstrates the process of the invention wherein the polysaccharide is activated and coupled with the protein in a single process step. Additionally, this Example demonstrates the usefulness of TNTU in producing clinically relevant conjugates with a carboxyl containing polysaccharide. EXAMPLE 9 This Example describes the use of uronium salt reagents to prepare solid phase reagents. In general, a polysaccharide in liquid media (e.g., aqueous, organic/aqueous mixed, or organic media) is activated with a uronium salt reagent and coupled to an amino-bead, ELISA plate, or other solid phase material. The coupled polysaccharide and solid phase material may be useful, for example, as a diagnostic reagent, such as a solid phase material to absorb specific antibodies for analysis. A more specific example follows. 100 l of Pn 14 (at 10 g/ml) in saline is pipetted into the wells of an amino-functionalized ELISA plate (e.g., Nunc Covalink). 5 l of 0.3 M TSTU (in NMP) is pipetted into each well, followed by 5 l of 0.3 M TEA (in NMP). As controls, saline only, TSTU and TEA only, or Pn 14 only are placed in additional wells. After 1 hour, the wells are washed with saline. The wells are tested for the presence of Pn 14 bound to the ELISA plate using known anti-Pn 14 positive antisera, according to Lees et al., Vaccine, 1996, described above. These ELISA plates then are used for evaluation of anti-Pn 14 antisera. Other polysaccharides can be coupled to solid phase materials as well. Those skilled in the art will be capable of devising coupling schemes for other solid phase reagents, such as amino or hydrazide microbeads (available from Bangs Laboratories) and amino or hydrazide chromatography media (available from Pharmacia). EXAMPLE 10 Various Pneumococcal 14 based reagents and conjugates were prepared in this Example. The Pneumococcal based reagent comprises a biotin-Pn14 conjugate, coupled via a spacer (Sample 10A) or directly to the activated polysaccharide (Sample 10B). Sample 10A The starting material for this procedure was 0.5 ml Pneumococcal type 14 (available from American Tissue Culture Collection of Rockville, Md.) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in water. At time t0, 20 l of 0.5 M TSTU (in DMF) was added to the polysaccharide, followed immediately by the addition of 20 l of DMAP (0.5 M in water). At t1 minute, an additional 20 l of TSTU was added, and an additional 20 l TSTU was added at t1.5 minutes. 200 l of 1 M ethylenediamine (in water) was added at t2 minutes. DMAP was added periodically to the reaction solution throughout this procedure, in order to maintain the pH of the solution at about 8.5. After about an hour, the reaction mixture was desalted on a P6DG column (from BioRad, equilibrated in saline), and the resultant material was assayed for amines and polysaccharides. The material, containing ethylenediamine/TSTU/Pn 14 was determined to contain 7.6 amines/100 kDa Pn 14 at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. The biotin conjugate was then produced. 300 l of the ethylenediamine/TSTU/Pn 14 mixture described above (2 mg/ml) was mixed with 50 l 5HE. Then, 1.6 mg of sulfo NHS LC biotin (available from BioAffinity Systems) in 60 l of 50% DMF was added to the mixture. After 1 hour, the reaction mixture was still TNBS positive, so additional solid LC biotin was added. After 2 total hours, the reaction mixture was desalted on a P6DG column (from BioRad), equilibrated with PBS, and the void volumes were pooled. Sample 10B This Sample was produced in the same manner as Sample 10A, except at time t2 minutes, 250 l of biotincaproic hydrazide (available from Sigma), in 50% DMF was added (the biotin material was poorly soluble). After 1 hour, the undissolved material was removed by centrifuging, and the resulting solution was desalted on a P6DG column (available from BioRad), equilibrated in saline. To confirm the coupling of the biotin with the Pn 14 in these Samples, an assay for biotin was performed by ELISA, as generally described in E. A. Bayer and M. Wilchek, Methods of Enzymology, Vol. 184 (1990), pp. 49-51, which article is entirely incorporated herein by reference. In brief, for this procedure, ELISA immunoassay stripwell plates (available from Nunc Maxisorp) were coated with streptavidin (available from Zymed) at 1 g/ml in PBS and then incubated in a draft-free environment with the indicated concentrations of biotinylated Pn 14 or control Pn 14. A monoclonal anti-Pn 14 was then used to test for binding of the Pn 14 to the streptavidin coated plates. The following table illustrates the test results. TABLE 2 ELISA Absorbance Assay of Pn 14-Biotin or Pn 14 on Streptavidin-Coated Plates (10 minute test results) Pn 14 (g/ml) Sample 10A Sample 10B Pn 14 Alone 1.0 3.311 3.252 0.094 0.333 3.214 2.678 0.097 0.111 2.733 1.805 0.085 0.037 1.980 1.051 0.087 0.012 0.861 0.403 0.095 0.004 0.360 0.216 0.108 0.001 0.166 0.142 0.092 None 0.100 0.105 0.093 Primary Antibody: Monoclonal anti-Pn 14 at 1:2000 Secondary Antibody: Rabbit anti-mouse IgG-3-HRP Substrate: TMB Blocking: None As is apparent from these assay results, unlabeled control Pn 14 did not bind to the streptavidin coated ELISA plates, as indicated by the background level of the absorbance. The conjugate samples, however, did detachably bind to the plates, even at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml. This indicates that Samples 10A and 10B contained Pn 14 labeled with biotin. Sample 10C For this Sample, a clinically relevant conjugate vaccine was synthesized where a tetanus toxoid protein was coupled to a Pn 14 polysaccharide with a spacer. For this procedure, the NH 2 /TSTU/Pn14 material produced in Sample 10A was used. The coupling reaction procedure was conducted as follows, which is the same general coupling procedure described in A. Lees, et al., Vaccine, Vol. 12, No. 13, (1994), pp. 1160-1166, described above. For this coupling procedure, 100 l of 0.75 M HEPES, 10 mM EDTA at a pH of 7.3, and 75 l 0.1 M N-hydroxysuccinimidyl iodoacetate (SIA, available from BioAffinity Systems) in DMF were combined with 1.66 mg of the NH 2 /TSTU/Pn 14 material present in 1.15 ml saline. This reaction produced an iodoacetylated Pn 14 reaction product (Pn 14-SIA). In a separate procedure, 3 mg of tetanus toxoid, at a concentration of 16.8 mg/mil in saline (corresponding to 180 l of solution), was mixed with 100 l of HE and 6 l of 0.1 M N-succinimidyl S-acetylthioacetate (SATA, available from BioAffinity Systems) in DMF. This reaction produced a tetanus protein with protected thiols (TT-SATA). After three hours, the reaction products above were separately desalted on a 115 cm P6DG column (from BioRad), equilibrated in PBS for the tetanus toxoid product and equilibrated in saline for the Pn 14 product. The void volumes of each fraction were concentrated (separately) in a Centricon 30 device (available from Amicon). At this time, 125 l of the TT-SATA reaction product was combined with about 300 l of the Pn 14-SIA reaction product and 50 l of 5HE and 0.5 M hydroxylamine. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight. Then, the reaction was quenched by adding 10 l of 10 mM mercaptoethanol (BME) and allowed to stand for one hour. Then, 10 l of 0.5 M iodoacetamide was added, and this mixture was allowed to stand for 10 minutes. The resulting reaction mixture was passed over an S400HR gel filtration column (available from Pharnacia) (150 cm, equilibrated in PBS, 0.25 ml/minute, about 1 ml/tube), and the void volume fraction was obtained. The resulting conjugate was found to have about 1.5 mg tetanus toxoid per mg of Pn 14. Sample 10D For this Sample, a tetanus toxoid protein was coupled directly to a Pn 14 polysaccharide using TNTU as an activating agent. Therefore, this Sample demonstrates that a clinically relevant protein/polysaccharide conjugate can be produced using a TNTU activating agent. First, Pn 14 polysaccharide and tetanus toxoid protein each were mixed into a saline solution, each at a concentration of about 6.3 mg/ml. Then, at time t0, 24 l of 0.5 M TNTU in NMP was added to the mixture. 12 l of 1 M TEA in NMP was then added. At time t1 minute, an additional 6 l of 1 M TEA was added to the mixture. At time t75 minutes, the reaction was quenched by adding 150 l of 1 M glycine (pH 8). The mixture was fractionated on an S400HR column (equilibrated in PBS), and the high molecular weight fraction was pooled, sterile filtered, and assayed. It was found that the resulting conjugate material contained 0.44 mg tetanus toxoid per mg of Pn 14. In addition to demonstrating that a TNTU uronium salt activating agent can be used to produce a clinically relevant conjugate, this Example demonstrates that the activation step and the coupling step can occur in a one step procedure. Notably, in the procedure of this Example, the protein and polysaccharide are mixed together first, and then the activating reagent (TNTU) is added to this mixture. As the polysaccharide is activated by the activating reagent, the protein is immediately available for coupling in a convenient one step procedure. EXAMPLE 11 In this Example, the immunogenicity of certain conjugates produced using the uronium activating agents was tested. Sample 11A To begin the conjugate preparation procedure, 2.5 mg of Pn 14 polysaccharide and 2.5 mg of tetanus toxoid protein were mixed together in a total volume of 350 l. At time t0, 24 l of 0.5 M TNTU (in NMP) was added, and then 12 l of 1 M TEA (in NMP) was added. At time t1 minute, an additional 6 l of 1 M TEA was added. The reaction was quenched at time t75 minutes by adding 150 l of 1 M glycine (pH8). The reaction mixture was passed over an S400HR gel filtration column, equilibrated in PBS, the high molecular weight fractions were pooled, sterile filtered, and assayed. It was determined that the resulting conjugate had 0.44 mg TT/mg Pn 14. Sample 11B For this Sample, the tetanus toxoid-SATA-SIA-NH 2 /TSTU/Pn 14 conjugate prepared in Example 10C was used. As noted above, this conjugate was found to include 1.5 mg TT/mg Pn 14. Immunogenicity Data Sample 11A and Sample 11B were used in a mouse model to test the immunogenicity of the resulting conjugates. Three groups of mice (having four mice per group) were treated with various different immunogens. One group of mice was treated with vaccine conjugate Sample 11A, one group with vaccine conjugate Sample 11B, and one group with Pn 14 alone. On Day 0 each mouse was vaccinated with a priming dosage of the respective immunogen (each immunogen contained 5 g of Pn 14, either present alone or as part of the conjugate). On Day 14, each mouse received a booster immunization using the same immunogen. The mice were led on Day 28. The sera from the mice of the group were pooled, and an anti-Pn 14 IgG titer as performed giving the following results: TABLE 3 Conjugate Anti-Pn 14 IgG titer Sample 11A 72,900 Sample 11B 110,284 Pn 14 Only 326 As demonstrated by these test results, the two Samples made according to the invention, using uronium salts, induced excellent immunogenic responses in the mice of the group. As expected, Pn 14 alone induced little immunogenic response. EXAMPLE 12 For this example, the immunological and bactericidal properties of a conjugate according to the invention were investigated. In this instance, a tetanus toxoid/Neisseria PsC conjugate was prepared using TNTU as an activating agent. First, 4 mg of tetanus toxoid solution (having a concentration of 19.8 mg/ml) were added to 0.4 ml of Neisseria PsC (having a concentration of 10 mg/ml in saline). The tetanus toxoid material was obtained from Mass Public Health Labs. At time t0, 50 l of 0.3 M TNTU (in NMP) was added to the protein and polysaccharide mixture. Thereafter, 25 l of 2M TEA (in NMP) were added. The reaction proceeded overnight at 4 C. Then, the mixture was passed over a S400HR gel filtration column (Pharmacia), equilibrated with PBS. The high molecular weight fractions were pooled and then sterile filtered by passing the mixture through a Millex GV device (available from Millipore Corp.). It was determined that the resulting conjugate product contained 0.29 mg TT/mg Neisseria PsC. This conjugate material was then used in a mouse model to test the immunogenicity of the resulting conjugates. Each of four mice was vaccinated with a priming dosage of the conjugate containing 2.5 g Neisseria PsC on Day 0. On Day 14, each mouse received a booster immunization of the conjugate in the same amount. The mice were bled on Day 28. The sera from the mice were pooled and assayed by ELISA (0.1 OD end point) for anti-PsC antibodies. Additionally, a bactericidal assay was performed according to the procedure described in K. H. Wong, et al., Journal of Biological Standards, Vol. 5 (1977), beginning at page 197 (this article is entirely incorporated herein by reference). The following test results were obtained: Anti-PsC IgG titer31,019 Bactericidal titer1:320. As is evident from this data, the conjugate according to the invention induced excellent immunogenic responses in the mice of the group. Additionally, an excellent bactericidal effect was induced by the conjugates according to the invention (a bactericidal titer greater than 1:40 is typically considered protective). OTHER FEATURES OF THE INVENTION This invention further relates to vaccines, immunogens, and immunological, therapeutic, and diagnostic reagents that can be prepared from the conjugates produced in accordance with the invention.

Additionally, applicants have described several examples and processes for producing conjugates in accordance with the invention. While these procedures may be further optimized (e.g., optimizing the pH conditions during coupling), such optimization of the process and reaction conditions is a matter of routine experimentation.

Alternatively, the racemic mixture may first be reduced and the resulting racemic alcohol mixture is resolved to isolate one isomer of the alcohol and the remaining process steps are followed.", "related_docs": [], "pct_data": [], "external_files": [{"file": "US06300106-20011009-C00001.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "description", "compounds": ["OCC1CO1", "CCCOC(CC)CCC", "CCC1CO1", "CCC(CCO)OCCO", "C=CCOC(CC)CC=C", "C=CCC(O)CC"]}, {"file": "US06300106-20011009-C00002.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "description", "compounds": ["C=CC=C", "[1CH3]C(=O)C1CC=CCO1 |w:3.2|", "[1CH3]C(=O)C=O", "C"]}, {"file": "US06300106-20011009-C00003.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "description", "compounds": ["C", "[1CH3]C(=O)[C@@H]1CC=CCO1", "[1CH3]C(=O)C1CC=CCO1 |w:3.2|", "OC[C@@H]1CC=CCO1"]}, {"file": "US06300106-20011009-C00004.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "description", "compounds": ["CC(=O)OC[C@H]1CC=CCO1", "C=C([4CH3])OC(C)=O", "[1CH3]C(=O)C1CC=CCO1 |w:3.2|", "O=C(O)[C@@H]1CC=CCO1", "*OC(=O)[C@@H]1CC=CCO1 |$R5;;;;;;;;;$|", "C", "OCC1CC=CCO1 |w:2.1|", "O=C(O)C1CC=CCO1 |w:3.2|", "OC[C@@H]1CC=CCO1"]}, {"file": "US06300106-20011009-C00005.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "description", "compounds": ["CC[C@H](CCO)OCCO", "C", "CCCO[C@H](CC)CCC", "CC[C@@H]1CC=CCO1", "OC[C@@H]1CC=CCO1"]}, {"file": "US06300106-20011009-C00006.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section": "claims", "compounds": ["[1CH3]C(=O)C=O"]}]}, {"publication": {"country": "US", "doc_number": "06300119", "kind": "B1", "date": "20011009"}, "application": {"country": "US", "doc_number": "09273142", "date": "19990319"}, "series_code": "09", "ipc_classes": ["C12N120", "C12N1500", "C12N500", "C07H2104"], "cpc_classes": [], "applicants": [], "inventors": [{"first_name": "Deborah D.", "last_name": "Jaworski", "city": "King of Prussia", "state": "PA", "country": "US"}, {"first_name": "Elizabeth J.", "last_name": "Lawlor", "city": "King of Prussia", "state": "PA", "country": "US"}, {"first_name": "Min", "last_name": "Wang", "city": "King of Prussia", "state": "PA", "country": "US"}], "assignees": [], "title": "Stretococcal ERS", "abstract": "The invention provides gluS polypeptides and DNA (RNA) encoding gluS polypetides and methods for producing such polypeptides by recombinant techniques.

compound Wherein x, y, and z are integers from 0 to 3; and the (poly)ethereal amine is at least one selected from compounds of formula II 1 through II 5 : BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Some herbicides bearing acidic moieties are known to be highly effective and commercially important herbicides useful for combating the presence of a wide variety of unwanted vegetation, including agricultural weeds. Since usually, such acidic herbicides have low solubility in water, they are applied as their derivatives such as metal salts or ammonium salts to enhance the solubility, or esters or amides to enhance movement into plant. For example, N-phosphonomethyl-glycine is formulated in commercial compositions in the form of a water-soluble salt. Herbicidal amine salts of N-phosphonomethylglycine are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,799,758, 3,853,530, 4,140,513, 4,315,765, 4,405,531, 4,481,026, and 4,507,250. These salts are claimed to have uses as plant regulators, herbicides and defoliants. Many of these salts have the counter-cation to N-phosphonomethylglycine anion bearing relatively low molecular weight. Typical of such salts are alkali metal, for example sodium and potassium salts; ammonium salt; and numerous salts having an ammonium, sulfonium or sulfoxonium cation with 1-3 organic groups containing in total 1-6 carbon atoms, for example 2-propylammonium (isopropylammonium), ethanolammonium, ethylenediammonium, trimethylsulfonium or trimethylsulfoxonium. Recent Patent WO 99/05914 reveals the herbicidal compositions promoting herbicidal effectiveness of exogeneous chemical substances. The compositions are the amphiphilic salts having anions of the parent exogeneous chemical substances and cations derived by protonation of one or more polyamine(s) or polyamine derivative(s) each having (a) at least two nitrogen-containing groups, of which a number n not less than 1 are amino groups that can be protonated to form cationic primary, secondary, or tertiary ammonium groups, and (b) at least one hydrocarbyl or acyl group having about 6 to 30 carbon atoms. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A preferred group of the acidic herbicide consists of those that are normally applied post-emergence to foliage of plants. An especially preferred group of foliar-applied herbicide consists of those that are systemic in plants, that is, translocated to some extent from their point of entry in the foliage to other parts of the plant where they can usefully exert their herbicidal effect. This invention relates to the enhancement of the activity of acidic herbicides by the formation of salts using (poly)ethereal amine compounds and also to a method of controlling undesirable vegetation by applying a herbicidally effective amount of the (poly)ethereal amine salts to such vegetation when the latter is in a post-emergent state. These (poly)ethereal ammonium salts are thought to aid the penetration and transport of acidic herbicides into and throughout the plant. These salts contain anions derived from parent herbicides and amphiphilic (poly)ethereal ammonium cation(s). These features are proved to enhance the activity of acidic herbicides. The term herbicidally effective amount designates any amount of the compounds disclosed herein, which will kill a plant or any portion thereof. By plants is meant germinating seeds, emerging seedlings, and established vegetation, including roots and above ground-portions. By the term post-emergent as used herein, is meant the application of the herbicide compound to weed pests, after these pests have emerged from the ground. The present invention provides a (poly)ethereal ammonium salt of acidic herbicides of the following formula I: Wherein x, y, and z are integers from 0 to 3 with the proviso that 0xyz3. Acidic Herbicide-X, Acidic Herbicide-Y, and Acidic Herbicide-Z, same or different that can be used in compositions of the present invention and possess the dissociable proton(s) in their structures include, but are not limited to, the following herbicides. acifluorfen, asulam, benazolin, bentazon, bilanafos, bromacil, bromoxynil, chloramben, clopyralid, cyhalofop, 2,4-D, 2,4-DB, dalapon, dicamba, dichlorprop, diclofop, DNOC, endothall, fenac, fenoxaprop, flamprop, fluazifop, flumiclorac, fluoroglycofen, fomesafen, fosamine, glufosinate, glyphosate, haloxyfop, imazameth, imazamethabenz, imazamox, imazapic, imazapyr, imazaquin, imazethapyr, ioxynil, MCPA, MCPB, MCPP, mecoprop, methylarsonic acid, naptalam, nonanoic acid, picloram, quinclorac, quizalofop, sulfamic acid, 2,3,6-TBA, TCA, and triclopyr. The (poly)ethereal amine(s) II or derivative(s) thereof are preferably selected from compounds of formula II 1 through II 5 : wherein R 1 is a hydrogen, a C 1-26 alkyl, a C 2-6 alkenyl, a C 2-6 alkynyl branched-chain or straight-chain which may or may not be substituted with one or more halogen, hydroxy, C 1-6 alkoxy, (C 1-6 alkyl-) q -amino ( q is an integer of 0, 1, or 2), morpholino, or C 1-6 alkoxycarbonyl group, an aryl, or a heteroaryl which may or may not be substituted with C 1-6 alkyl, C 1-6 haloalkyl, halogen, C 1-6 alkoxy, (C 1-6 alkyl-) q -amino ( q is an integer of 0, 1, or 2), nitro, or C 1-6 alkoxycarbonyl group; R 2 , R 5 , and R 6 are independently C 1-8 alkylene branched-chain or straight-chain, which may contain imine or ether linkage therein and may be substituted by a C 1-6 alkyl group. R 3 and R 4 are a hydrogen atom or a C 1-6 alkyl group, which may be branched or straight and may or may not be substituted with one or more C 1-6 alkoxy, or a group Of R 1 (OR 2 ) m O. R 7 is a hydrogen or a C 1-6 alkyl group. l, m and n is a number from 1 to about 500. m is a number from 0 to about 35. p is an integer of 0 or 1. When m is 1, none of R 1 , R 3 , and R 4 is H and furter R 2 is not ethylene. Many of these (poly)ethereal amine exist as steric or enantiomeric isomers and this invention covers all forms and mixtures of the aforementioned compounds. Most of the (poly)ethereal amines and their derivatives are commercially available. New (poly)ethereal amines II 6 bearing (hetero)aryl moiety were synthesized by the following reaction between (hetero)aryl halide and hydroxyl-amine. The examples of the (poly)ethereal amines II include, but are not limited to, the following (poly)ethereal amines in Tables-1 through -5.

No. 5,721,236 issued Feb. 24, 1998), which in turn is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/312,030 filed on Sep. 26, 1994 (abandoned), which in turn is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/137,435 filed Oct. 15, 1993 (abandoned). BACKGROUND International Publication Number WO92/11034, published Jul. 9, 1992, discloses a method of increasing the sensitivity of a tumor to an antineoplastic agent, which tumor is resistant to the antineoplastic agent, by the concurrent administration of the antineoplastic agent and a potentiating agent of the formula: wherein the dotted line represents an optional double bond, X is hydrogen or halo, and Y is hydrogen, substituted carboxylate or substituted sulfonyl. For example, Y can be, amongst others, COOR wherein R is C1 to C6 alkyl or substituted alkyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl, C7 to C12 aralkyl or substituted aralkyl or -2, -3, or -4 piperidyl or N-substituted piperidyl. Y can also be, amongst others, SO 2 R wherein R is C1 to C6 alkyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl, C7 to C12 aralkyl or substituted aralkyl. Examples of such potentiating agents include 11-(4-piperidylidene)-5H-benzo5,6cyclohepta1,2-bpyridines such as Loratadine. Oncogenes frequently encode protein components of signal transduction pathways which lead to stimulation of cell growth and mitogenesis. Oncogene expression in cultured cells leads to cellular transformation, characterized by the ability of cells to grow in soft agar and the growth of cells as dense foci lacking the contact inhibition exhibited by non-transformed cells. Mutation and/or overexpression of certain oncogenes is frequently associated with human cancer. To acquire transforming potential, the precursor of the Ras oncoprotein must undergo farnesylation of the cysteine residue located in a carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide. Inhibitors of the enzyme that catalyzes this modification, farnesyl protein transferase, have therefore been suggested as anticancer agents for tumors in which Ras contributes to transformation. Mutated; oncogenic forms of ras are frequently found in many human cancers, most notably in more than 50% of colon and pancreatic carcinomas (Kohl et al., Science, Vol. 260, 1834 to 1837, 1993). In view of the current interest in inhibitors of farnesyl protein transferase, a welcome contribution to the art would be compounds useful for the inhibition of farnesyl protein transferase. Such a contribution is provided by this invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Inhibition of farnesyl protein transferase by tricyclic compounds of this invention has not been reported previously. Thus, this invention provides a method for inhibiting farnesyl protein transferase using tricyclic compounds of this invention which: (i) potently inhibit farnesyl protein transferase, but not geranylgeranyl protein transferase I, in vitro; (ii) block the phenotypic change induced by a form of transforming Ras which is a farnesyl acceptor but not by a form of transforming Ras engineered to be a geranylgeranyl acceptor; (iii) block intracellular processing of Ras which is a farnesyl acceptor but not of Ras engineered to be a geranylgeranyl acceptor; and (iv) block abnormal cell growth in culture induced by transforming Ras. One compound disclosed in this invention has been demonstrated to have anti-tumor activity in animal models. This invention provides a method for inhibiting the abnormal growth of cells, including transformed cells, by administering an effective amount of a compound of this invention.

In particular, this invention provides a method for inhibiting the growth of tumors expressing an activated Ras oncogene by the administration of an effective amount of the above described compounds. Examples of tumors which may be inhibited include, but are not limited to, lung cancer (e.g., lung adenocarcinoma), pancreatic cancers (e.g., pancreatic carcinoma such as, for example, exocrine pancreatic carcinoma), colon cancers (e.g., colorectal carcinomas, such as, for example, colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma), myeloid leukemias (for example, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)), thyroid follicular cancer, bladder carcinoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

The administration of the compounds of this invention to patients, to inhibit farnesyl protein transferase, is useful in the treatment of the cancers described above. The tricyclic compounds useful in the methods of this invention inhibit abnormal cellular growth. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that these compounds may function through the inhibition of G-protein function, such as ras p21, by blocking G-protein isoprenylation, thus making them useful in the treatment of proliferative diseases such as tumor growth and cancer. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that these compounds inhibit ras farnesyl protein transferase, and thus show antiproliferative activity against ras transformed cells.

The invention contemplates all such isomers both in pure form and in admixture, including racemic mixtures. Enol forms are also included. The compounds of the invention can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms, e.g., hemi-hydrate.

More preferred compounds useful in this invention are represented by Formulas 500.00, 530.00, 565.00, 580.00, 595.00, 600.00, 608.00, 610.00, 612.00, 618.00, 626.00, 642.00, 644.00, 656.00, 662.00, 801.00, 802.00, 803.00, 804.00 and 805.00, and the compounds of Examples 32 ansd 33. The following processes may be employed to produce compounds of Formula 400.00: Those skilled in the art will appreciate that compounds of Formula 1.0, e.g., Formula 1.4, are represented by the compounds of Formula 400.00. Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that the processes described below for producing compounds of Formula 400.00 (Formula 1.4) are also applicable to the compounds of Formulas 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3. A compound of Formula 405.00 may be reacted with RC(O)L, wherein R is as defined for Formula 1.0, in the presence of a base to produce compounds of Formula 400.00. Representative examples of appropriate bases are pyridine and triethylamine. L designates a suitable leaving group (e.g., Cl or Br). Compounds of Formula 405.00 may be prepared by cleaving the group COOR a from the corresponding carbamates 415.00, for example, via acid hydrolysis (e.g., HCl) or base hydrolysis (e.g., KOH): wherein R a is a group which does not prevent the cleavage reaction, e.g., R a is an optionally substituted alkyl such as ethyl. Alternatively, depending upon the nature of R a , as determined by one skilled in the art, Compound 415.00 may be treated with an organometallic reagent (e.g., CH 3 Li), a reductive reagent (e.g., Zn in acid), etc., to form compounds of Formula 405.00. Compound 415.00 may be prepared from the N-alkyl compound shown as Formula 420.00 below, in the manner disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,282,233 and 4,335,036. It also will be apparent to one skilled in the art that there are other methods for converting Compound 420.00 to Compound 405.00. For example, treatment of Compound 420.00 with BrCN via von Braun reaction conditions would provide nitrile 420.00a. Subsequent hydrolysis of the nitrile under either aqueous basic or acidic conditions would produce Compound 405.00. This method is preferable when there is substitution on the piperidine or piperazine ring. C. The compounds of Formula 400.00 wherein Z is O may be made by an alternative process using direct conversion of the N-alkyl compound 420.00 with an appropriate compound of Formula 410.00 such as a chloroformate (such as phenylchloroformate). An appropriate base, may be added, and heating may be required. Typically, a temperature ranging from 50-150 C. is utilized. Other compounds of the invention can be made by reacting a compound of Formula 400.00, wherein R is phenoxy, with the sodium salt of the appropriate alcohol. Compound 420.00 is prepared as described in part B above. PREPARATION OF SINGLE BOND COMPOUNDS Compounds of Formula 400.00, wherein X is carbon and the bond to carbon 11 (C-11) is a single bond, can be prepared by reducing compounds of Formula 405.00, wherein X is carbon and the bond to C-11 is a double bond, with lithium aluminum hydride in THF. Conversion to final products can be done following the process described above for conversion of compounds of Formula 405.00 to compounds of Formula 400.00. PREPARATION OF DOUBLE BOND COMPOUNDS Compounds of Formula 400.00, wherein X is a carbon atom having an exocyclic double bond to carbon 11, may be prepared from compound 420.00 as described above. Compounds of Formula 420.00 may be produced by the methods disclosed generally in U.S. Pat. No. 3,326,924 or alternatively may be prepared by a ring closure reaction, wherein the desired cycloheptene ring is formed by treating compound 425.00 with a super acid. Suitable super acids for this purpose include, for example, HF/BF 3 , CF 3 SO 3 H (triflic acid), CH 3 SO 3 H/BF 3 , etc. The reaction can be performed in the absence of, or with, an inert co-solvent such as CH 2 Cl 2 . The temperature and time of the reaction vary with the acid employed. For example, with HF/BF 3 as the super acid system the temperature may be controlled so as to minimize side reactions, such as HF addition to the exocyclic double bond. For this purpose, the temperature is generally in the range of from about 5 C. to 50 C. With CF 3 SO 3 H as the super acid system, the reaction may be run at elevated temperatures, e.g., from about 25 C. to about 150 C. and at lower temperatures but the reaction then takes longer to complete. Generally the super acid is employed in excess, preferably in amounts of from about 1.5 to about 30 equivalents. A ketone compound of Formula 425.00 may be formed by hydrolysis of 430.00, e.g., such as by reacting a Grignard intermediate of Formula 430.00 with an aqueous acid (e.g., aqueous HCl). I a in Formula 430.00 represents chloro, bromo or iodo. The Grignard intermediate 430.00 is formed by the reaction of the cyano compound 435.00 with an appropriate Grignard reagent 440.00 prepared from 1-alkyl-4halopiperidine. The reaction is generally performed in an inert solvent, such as ether, toluene, or THF, under general Grignard conditions e.g., temperature of from about 0 C. to about 75 C. Alternatively, other organometallic derivatives of the lalkyl-4-halo piperidine can be employed. The cyano compound of Formula 435.00 is produced by converting the tertiary butyl amide of Formula 445.00 with a suitable dehydrating agent, such as POCl 3 , SOCl 2 , P 2 O 5 , toluene sulfonyl chloride in pyridine, oxalyl chloride in pyridine, etc. This reaction can be performed in the absence of or with a co-solvent, such as xylene. The dehydrating agent such as POCl 3 is employed in equivalent amounts or greater and preferably in amounts of from about 2 to about 15 equivalents. Any suitable temperature and time can be employed for performing the reaction, but generally heat is added to accelerate the reaction. Preferably the reaction is performed at or near reflux. The tert-butylamide of Formula 445.00 may be produced by reaction of a compound of Formula 450.00a and 450.00b, in the presence of base, wherein G is chloro, bromo or iodo. The compound of Formula 450.00a may be formed by hydrolysis of the corresponding nitrile wherein the appropriate cyanomethyl pyridine, such as 2-cyano-3-pyridine, is reacted with a tertiary butyl compound in acid, such as concentrated H 2 SO 4 or concentrated H 2 SO 4 in glacial acetic acid. Suitable tertiary butyl compounds include, but are not limited to, t-butyl alcohol, t-butyl chloride, t-butyl bromide, t-butyl iodide, isobutylene or any other compound which under hydrolytic conditions forms t-butyl carboxamides with cyano compounds. The temperature of the reaction will vary depending upon the reactants, but generally the reaction is conducted in the range of from about 50 C. to about 100 C. with t-butyl alcohol. The reaction may be performed with inert solvents, but is usually run neat. An alternative process for the formation of compounds of Formula 400.00a may involve direct cyclization of Compound 455.00 as shown below. Cyclization to form the cycloheptene ring may be accomplished with a strong acid (e.g., triflic, polyphosphoric, HF/BF 3 ), and may be performed in an inert solvent, such as ether, toluene or THF. The temperature and time may vary with the acid employed, as described in process A above. Compounds of Formula 455.00 wherein ZO may be prepared by treating a compound of Formula 425.00 with an appropriate chloroformate (e.g. ethyl chloroformate) of formula 410.00 in the appropriate solvent, such as toluene, dioxane or xylene, and at a temperature ranging from 50-150 C., preferably 100-120 C. A second method of preparing compounds of Formula 455.00 involves reacting an unsubstituted piperidylidene compound of Formula 460.00 with the appropriate chloroformate (e.g., ethyl chloroformate) of Formula 410.00 in the presence of base, such as pyridine or Et 3 N. Compounds of Formula 460.00 may be produced from the corresponding carbamates of Formula 465.00, via acid hydrolysis, using for example, aqueous HCl, or base hydrolysis using for example, KOH. Alternatively, some compounds can be prepared by treating the carbamate, Formula 465.00, with an organometallic reagent, such as methyl lithium or a reductive reagent, such as Zn in acid, etc., depending upon the nature of the R a group. For example, if R a is a simple alkyl group, CO 2 R a may be cleaved by alkaline hydrolysis at 100 C. The carbamate compounds of Formula 465.00 may be prepared from the appropriate alkyl compound of Formula 425.00 by treatment with a chloroformate, preferably in an inert solvent, such as toluene, with warming to approximately 80 C. Other alternative methods are available for the conversion of 425.00 to 455.00 as previously described (e.g. Von Braun reaction conditions). Compounds of Formula 425.00 may be prepared as described above. SUBSTITUTION ON THE PYRIDINE RING Various methods can be used as described in WO 88/03138 to provide compounds which are substituted on the pyridine ring, i.e., in positions 2-, 3- and or 4-positions of the tricyclic ring system. For example, the cyclization methods described on pages 20-30 of WO 88/03138 can already have the appropriate substituents on the pyridine ring in place. A variety of substituted pyridines are known in the literature and can be employed in these syntheses. Alternatively, the azaketone of Formula XIX (from page 27 of WO 88/03138) wherein R 1 and R 2 are both H can be converted to the appropriately substituted azaketone wherein R 1 and R 2 are non-H substitutents. If both R 1 and R 2 are desired to be non-H substitutents the procedure would be repeated. The azaketone is thus reacted with an oxidizing agent such as MCPBA or H 2 O 2 to produce the corresponding compound in which the nitrogen of the pyridine ring is an N-oxide: wherein one of a, b, c or d is NO and the others are CH or CR 1 or CR 2 . This reaction is normally run at temperatures from 15 C. to reflux, more typically at about 0 C. The reaction is preferably conducted in an inert solvent such as CH 2 Cl 2 for MCPBA or acetic acid for hydrogen peroxide. The azaketone N-oxide of Formula 470.00a can then be reacted with a chlorinating agent such as SO 2 Cl 2 or SOCl 2 to form a compound of Formula 470.00b. Typically, this reaction results in monosubstitution of Cl in the ortho or para-position relative to the N atom of the ring. To provide the disubstituted products, steps 1 and 2 above are repeated Typically, the resulting disubstituted compounds have Cl ortho and para relative to the N atom of the pyridine ring. The mono or disubstituted compounds of Formulas 470.00b and 470.00c above can be reacted with various nucleophiles such as alkoxides, amines, thiols, etc. This will result in compounds where one or both of the Cl substituents are replaced by the nucleophile to provide a compound of Formula 470.00d or a compound easily converted to Formula 470.00d. The substituted ketone of Formula 470.00 can then be converted to the desired compound by the methods described above. Formula 405.00, wherein R 1 or R 2 are chlorine, can be made by the following alternate process. The N-oxide of Formula 415.00 can be treated with POCl 3 to form a 10 compound of Formula 415.01. Typically, this reaction results in mono-substitution of Cl in the ortho or para position relative to the N atom of the ring. The N-oxide of Formula 415.00 can be formed by oxidizing Formula 415.00 with a peroxyacid such as 4-chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Alternatively, the Cl substituted azaketones of formula 470.00b or 470.00c above can be converted to the corresponding derivatives of Formula 405.00 above wherein R 1 and/or R 2 is Cl by methods analogous to those described above. At this point the Cl substituent(s) can be displaced by an appropriate nucleophile to provide the desired substituent. Suitable nucleophiles include alkoxide, amines, thiols, etc. This reaction usually requires higher tempertures (e.g., from about 100 to about 200 C.) than the displacement reaction to produce ketone 470.00d above. It is also usually conducted in a sealed vessel in an inert solvent. The compound of Formula 405.00 is then converted to a compound of Formula 400.00 as described above. PREPARATION OF C5-C6-ENE DERIVATIVES Compounds of formula 400.00 with a double bond between C-5 and C-6 can be prepared by heating a compound of Formula 470.00h in acetic acid with SeO 2 to produce a compound of Formula 470.00i. Compounds of Formula 470.00i can be converted to final products according to methods already described. PREPARATION OF PIPERAZINE ANALOGS Compounds having a piperazine ring bound to the C-11 of the tricyclic nucleus, i.e., Formula 1.0 wherein X is N, are best prepared via alkylation of the appropriately substituted piperazine compound of Formula 700.00 with a compound of Formula 705.00. Compounds of Formula 705.00 contain the appropriately substituted halide (such as Cl, Br, or I) or other similar leaving group (e.g., tosyloxy or mesyloxy). The reaction is usually conducted in an inert solvent, such as THF or toluene, optionally with a base such as Et 3 N or K 2 CO 3 , and typically at a temperature range of ambient to reflux to produce a compound of Formula 710.00. In this reaction R g is H or CO 2 R a (wherein R a is a C 1 to C 4 alkyl group). The preparation of compound 705.00 wherein L is Cl is analogous to the procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,409,621. By methods known in the art compounds of Formula 710.00, wherein R g is CO 2 R a , can be converted to Formula 710.00 wherein R g is H, by acid or base hydrolysis as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,853. Compounds of formula 710.00, wherein R g is H, can be converted to compounds of Formula 400.00 by the process used to convert Formula 405.00 to Formula 400.00. Compounds of 410.00, wherein R is 3-pyridyloxy, can be prepared by reacting 3-hydroxy-pyridine with an excess of phosgene in toluene/CH 2 Cl 2 at 0 C. in the presence of a base such as pyridine. An alternate route for generating the compound of Formula 710.00 is by reductive amination of the aza ketone 715.00 with the piperazine 700.00 The reaction is typically carried out in a polar solvent, such as MeOH or EtOH, optionally in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as 3 molecular sieves. The intermediate Schiff base can be reduced to the compound of Formula 710.00 by employing a variety of reducing agents, such as NaCNBH 3 , or catalytic hydrogenation, for example, hydrogen over Pd/C. When R g is C(Z)R, these are the compounds of the invention. An alternative process for introducing substituents at the C-3 position of pyridine Ring I of Formula 1.0, involves nitrating a compound of Formula 415.00 (except wherein X is nitrogen) or a compound of Formula 470.00d with tetrbutylammonium nitrateTFAA in CH 2 Cl 2 at a temperature of 0 C. to room temperature (about 25 C.). The nitro group may then be reduced to the corresponding amine using iron filings in ethanol, or powdered Zn-HOAc in aqueous THF. By methods known to those skilled in the art, the amine group can be converted to a variety of substituents, such as, halo, cyano, thio, hydroxyl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl and haloalkyl. Compounds of Formulas 1.2 and 1.3, wherein R 30 , R 40 , R 52 and R 70 represent a pyridyl N-oxide, can be produced by reacting compounds of Formulas 1.2, and 1.3, wherein R 30 , R 40 , R 52 and R 70 represent pyridyl, with one molar equivalent of an oxidizing agent (such as oxone). Compounds of Formula 1.1, wherein R 30 or R 70 represent a pyridyl N-oxide, can be produced by reacting a compound of the formula (XI) with phosgene in the presence of a suitable base, such as pyridine, to form a compound of the formula (XII), which is then reacted with the approriate hydroxypyridine N-oxide or mercaptopyridine N-oxide. Alternatively, compounds of Formula 1.1, wherein R 30 or R 70 represent a pyridyl N-oxide, can be produced by reacting a compound of the formula (XI) with carbonyldiimidazole to form a compound of the formula (XIII) which is reacted with the approriate hydroxypyridine N-oxide (or mercaptopyridine N-oxide) in the presence of either ZnBr 2 or NaH. Various electrophilic species can also be added to the pyridine ring from the corresponding halo-substituted pyridine (Formula 405.00 wherein R 1 is halo, preferably bromo or iodo). Transmetallation of the halo derivative using an alkyl lithium (e.g. n-BuLi) provides the lithio derivative, which can then be quenched with the appropriate electrophile (e.g. R 1 L, etc.). Also, the halogens can be displaced with nucleophiles, such as HOBT, to give compounds with substituents in the pyridine ring. In the above processes, it is sometimes desirable and/or necessary to protect certain R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 etc., groups during the reactions. Conventional protecting groups are operable as described in Greene, T. W., Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis, John Wiley Sons, New York, 1981. For example, the groups listed in column 1 of Table 1 may be protected as indicated in column 2 of the table: TABLE 1 PROTECTED GROUPS 1. GROUP TO BE PROTECTED 2.

More specifically, the present invention relates to the compounds of formula (I) in which: m, and n, which may be identical or different, represent 0 or 1, X and Y, which may be identical or different, represent a hydrogen or halogen atom or a linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) alkyl, linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) trihaloalkyl, linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) alkoxy, hydroxyl, cyano, nitro, amino, alkylamino or dialkylamino group, Z represent a linear or branched C 4 to C 2 alkylene chain in which one or more CH 2 groups are optionally replaced by any one of the following atoms or groups: NR (in which R represents a hydrogen atom or a linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) alkyl group), O, S, SO, SO 2 , or CONH, or by a substituted or unsubstituted heterocylcic group, A forms, with two adjacent carbon atoms of the phenyl ring: a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl ring, a substituted or unsubstituted naphthyl ring, a substituted or unsubstituted tetrahydronaphthyl ring or substituted or unsubstituted 1,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl ring, or a substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle, represents any one of the following groups: in which: m 1 and n 1 , which may be identical or different, represent 0 or 1, X 1 and Y 1 , which may be identical or different, represent a hydrogen or halogen atom or a linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) alkyl, linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) trihaloalkyl, linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) alkoxy, hydroxyl, cyano, nitro, amino, alkylamino or dialkylamino group, A 1 forms, with two adjacent carbon atoms of the phenyl ring: a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl ring, a substituted or unsubstituted naphthyl ring, a substituted or unsubstituted tetrahydronaphthyl ring or substituted or unsubstituted 1,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl ring, or a substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle, in which X 2 , and Y 2 , which may be identical or different, represent a hydrogen or halogen atom or a linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) alkyl, linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) trihaloalkyl, linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) alkoxy, hydroxyl, cyano, nitro, amino, alkylamino or dialkylamino group, their isomers and their addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base. Among the pharmaceutically acceptable acids which may be mentioned, without any limitation being implied, are hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphonic acid, acetic acid, trifluoracetic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, oxalic acid, methanesulfonic acid, camphoric acid, etc. Among the pharmaceutically acceptable bases which may be mentioned, without any limitation being implied, are sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, triethylamine, tert-butylamine, etc. The terms substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group, substituted or unsubstituted naphthyl group and substituted or unsubstituted tetrahydronaphthyl group are understood to refer to a phenyl, naphthyl or tetrahydronaphthyl group which is optionally substituted with one or more halogen atoms or linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) alkyl, linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) trihaloalkyl, linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) alkoxy, hydroxyl, nitro or cyano groups or amino groups (optionally substituted with one or more linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) alkyl groups). The term substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle is understood to refer to a mono- or bicyclic, saturated or unsaturated 5- to 16-membered group containing 1, 2 or 3 hetero atoms chosen from oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, it being understood that the heterocycle may optionally be substituted with one or more halogen atoms or linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) alkyl, linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) alkoxy, hydroxyl, trihalomethyl, nitro or cyano groups or amino groups (optionally substituted with one or more linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) alkyl groups). The preferred compounds according to the invention are those in which: A forms, with two adjacent carbon atoms of the phenyl ring: a substituted or unsubstituted naphthyl ring, or a substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle preferably chosen from substituted or unsubstituted indole, substituted or unsubstituted benzobthiophene and substituted or unsubstituted benzobfuran rings. The preferred consitutents are those for which Z represents a C 4 to C 12 alkylene chain in which 1, 2 or 3 CH 2 groups are replaced by 1, 2 or 3 NR groups (in which R represents a linear or branched (C 1 -C 6 ) alkyl group). The invention also covers the process for the preparation of the compounds of formula (I), which process uses, as starting material, an anhydride of formula (II): in which A, X, Y, m and n are as defined in formula (I), which is reacted with an excess of a diamine of formula (III): H 5 H 2 NZNH 2 (III) in which Z is as defined in formula (I), in order to lead, after separation: either to the compound of formula (I/a), a specific case of the compounds of formula (I): in which A, X, Y, Z, m and n have the same meaning as in formula (I), or to the compound of formula (IV): in which A, X, Y, Z, m and n have the same meaning as in formula (I), which is reacted: either with the anhydride of formula (II/a): in which A 1 , X 1 , Y 1 , m 1 and n 1 are as defined in formula (I), in order to lead to the compound of formula (I/b), a specific case of the compounds of formula (I): in which A, X, Y, m, n, Z, A 1 , X 1 , Y 1 , m 1 , and n 1 have the same meaning as in formula (I), or with the anhydride of formula (V) in which X 2 and Y 2 are as defined in formula (I), in order to lead to the compound of formula (I/c), a specific case of the compounds of formula (I): in which A, X, Y, X 2 , Y 2 , Z, mn and n have the same meaning as in formula (I), which compound of formula (I/a), (I/b) or (I/c), may undergo, if so desired, standard reactions for the transformation of substituents on aromatic rings, which is purified, where appropriate, according to a standard purification technique, the isomers of which are optionally separated according to a standard separation technique and which is converted, if so desired, into its addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base. The anhydrides of formula (II) or (V) are either commercial compounds or are obtained according to known procedures. The invention also covers pharmaceutical compositions containing, as active principle, at least one compound of formula (I) with one or more inert, non-toxic, suitable excipients. Among the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention which may be mentioned more particularly are those which are suitable for oral, parenteral (intravenous or subcutaneous) or nasal administration, simple or sugar-coated tablets, sublingual tablets, gelatin capsules, lozenges, suppositories, creams, ointments, dermal gels, injectable preparations, drinkable suspensions, etc. The appropriate dosage may be adapted according to the nature and severity of the complaint, the route of administration and the age and weight of the patient.

The present invention further relates to processes for the manufacture of said azoles, pharmaceutical compositions, particularly antifungal compositions, containing said azoles, and the use of these azoles for the production of medicaments for the treatment of fungal infections. SUMMARY Several azoles are currently used for systemic mycoses. However, none of them fully satisfies the requirements of the clinical setting, particularly with regard to: broad antifungal spectrum including aspergillus fumigatus; less drug-drug interaction; and appropriate plasma half-life for once a day treatment. Other clinical requirements which are not fulfilled by the azoles currently in use are: efficacy against major systemic mycoses including disseminated aspergillosis; safety; and oral or parenteral formulations. Particularly, the demand for a parenterally administered azoles is increasing for the treatment of serious systemic mycoses. Most of the azoles on the market, as well as under development are highly lipophilic molecules that make the parenteral formulation difficult. The novel azoles of formula I have less metabolic interaction liability which is a clear clinical advantage. Those azoles of formula I, wherein T is a group T 1 , are water soluble compounds useful for the treatment of systemic mycoses and suitable for both oral and particularly parenteral administration. Thus, the invention also relates to a method for the therapy of fungal infections and mycoses, which comprises administering to the infected organism an effective amount of the novel azole compounds. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The novel azoles of the present invention have the formula wherein R 14 , R 15 are each independently hydrogen or fluorine, T is a group of the formula: wherein R 9 is pyrrolidinyl or a group ANHB, A is hydrogen or straight-chain or branched C 1 -C 5 alkyl; B is straight-chain or branched C 1 -C 4 alkylene, CH 2 CONHCH 2 or CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH(NH 2 ); and X is a pharmaceutically acceptable anion; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds, and hydrates and solvates of the compounds of formula I and the salts thereof. Where T is T 1 in the above formula I, the azoles of the invention have the formula wherein R 9 is pyrrolidinyl or a group ANHB, A is hydrogen or straight-chain or branched C 1 -C 5 alkyl; B is straight-chain or branched C 1 -C 4 alkylene, CH 2 CONHCH 2 or CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH(NH 2 ); and R 14 and R 15 are each independently hydrogen or fluorine. Where T is T 2 in the above formula I, the azoles of the invention have the formula wherein R 14 and R 15 are each independently hydrogen or fluorine. Preferred compounds of formula I (I or II) are those wherein R 14 and R 15 are both H or F; or R 14 is H and R 15 is F. Also preferred among the compounds of formula I are those wherein R 9 is 2-pyrrolidinyl, aminomethyl, (methylamino)methyl or (ethylamino)methyl. The anion X can be derived from a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic acid, and thus is a chloride, bromide, sulfate or the like. The anion X can also be derived from an organic acid, e.g. an aliphatic, aromatic or araliphatic carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid, and thus is an acetoxy, trifluoroacetoxy, mesyloxy or the like anion.

The following synthetic scheme 1 illustrates the manufacture of one of the compounds of formula I: The novel azole compounds represented by the general formula I as well as salts, hydrates or solvates thereof can be manufactured by reacting an azole compound of the above general formula (II) with a compound of the general formula (III), wherein: R 9 is pyrrolidinyl or a group ANHB, A is hydrogen or straight-chain or branched C 1 -C 5 alkyl; B is straight-chain or branched C 1 -C 4 alkylene, CH 2 CONHCH 2 or CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH(NH 2 ) and, an amino group present in R 9 may be in protected form; and L is a leaving group, followed if necessary, by removal of a protecting group and/or by salt formation. The benzylation reactions of the compound of the general formula (II) with the compound of the general formula (III) can be carried out in a solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, benzene, toluene, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, or dimethylformamide, preferably chloroform, acetonitrile, or dimethylformamide. The reaction time of this benzylation reaction may be varied within a relatively wide range. In general, the reaction can be carried out at a temperature between 0 C. and 100 C., preferably between 0 C. and 50 C. Preferably, an amino group present in R 9 in the compound of formula III is protected by a suitable amino protecting group, such as tert.-butoxycarbonyl. The protecting group may, if necessary, be removed after the reaction by procedures known to those skilled in the art. The compounds of formula (I) may contain an amino acid ester substituent R 9 which substituents may form acid addition salts. The term salts of compounds of formula (I) in the present specification, refers to such acid addition salts. These salts may be derived from pharmaceutically acceptable acids as described earlier with reference to the symbol X . The salt formation can be performed when removing a protecting group, or can be performed ad hoc by procedures known per se. The hydration can be effected in the course of the manufacturing process or can occur gradually as a result of hygroscopic properties of an initially anhydrous product. Solvates with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as ethanol can be obtained for example, during crystallization. The azoles of formula (II) as well as salts, hydrates or solvates thereof can be manufactured according to the following synthetic scheme 2, starting from 4-(2R)-2-(3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yloxy)propionylmorpholine which can be prepared by a same procedure as described in Chem. Pharm. Bull. 41, 1035, 1993.. (a) Reacting 4-(2R)-2-(3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yloxy)propionylmorpholine with a compound of the formula (1) in an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) at a temperature between 10 C. and room temperature for 3 to 8 hr. to give a compound of the formula (2), in which R 14 and R 15 are each independently hydrogen or fluorine atom (throughout this reaction scheme, R 14 and R 15 shall have this meaning), followed by (b) reacting a compound of the formula (2) with trimethyl sulfoxonium iodide, in the presence of sodium hydride in THF and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or in the presence of BuLi in THF and N,N-dimethylpropylene urea (DMPU), at a temperature between 5 C. and room temperature for 2 to 8 hr. to give a compound of the formula (3), followed by (c) reacting a compound of the formula (3) with triazole in the presence of sodium hydride in dry dimethylformamide (DMF) at a temperature between 50 C. and 100 C. for 6 to 12 hr. to give a compound of the formula (4), followed by (d) reacting a compound of the formula (4) with aqueous hydrochloric acid at a concentration between 1.0N and 0.1N solution, in methanol and n-hexane at room temperature or pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate in ethanol, at a temperature between room temperature and 100 C. for 2 to 6 hr. The resulting compound is recrystalized from t-butyl methyl ether and n-hexane to give a compound of the formula (5), followed by (e) reacting a compound of the formula (5) with mesyl chloride in CH 2 Cl 2 and methyl acetate (AcOEt) in the presence of an organic base such as triethylamine or pyridine for 30 min. to 2 hr. This reaction is followed by epoxy ring formation with sodium methoxide in methanol for 15 min. to 1 hr. The resulting compound is purified by recrystalization from t-butyl methyl ether and n-hexane or by silicagel column chromatography using CH 2 Cl 2 and methanol as eluent, to give a compound of the formula (6), followed by (f) reacting a compound of the formula (6) with acetone cyanohydrin in the presence of lithium hydride in THF under reflux for 4 to 8 hr. or trimetylsilyl cyanide in the presence of magnesium oxide in o-xylene at a temperature between 100 C. and 160 C. for 20 to 40 hr, then removing of trimethylsilyl group with conc. hydrogen chloride solution in THF to give a compound of the formula (7), followed by (g) reacting a compound of the formula (7) with dithiophosphoric acid O,O-diethyl ester and water or dithiophosphoric acid O,O-diethyl ester, water and iso-propanol at a temperature between 90 C. and 150 C. for 4 to 8 hr. to give a compound of the formula (8), followed by (h) reacting a compound of the formula (8) with 2-bromo-4-cyanoacetophenone at a temperature between room temperature and 80 C. in acetonitrile, ethanol or methanol for 2 to 24 hr. to give a compound of the formula (II), The azoles of formulae I and II with a configuration other than 2R,3R can be synthetized in a way similar to that described above. The term salts of compounds of the formula (II) in the present specification refers to acid addition salts. These salts may be derived from pharmaceutically acceptable acids such as acetic acid and hydrogen chloride. The salt formation can be performed by procedures well known in the art Hydrates or solvates with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as ethanol can be obtained for example, during crystallization. Fungal infections usually occur in immunocompromised patients with underlying diseases. Antifungal agents are, therefore, often taken with other medications. When co-administered with other drugs, azole antifungals have been reported to increase the blood concentrations of some of the drugs administered concomitantly. Such drug-drug interactions can sometimes result in severe adverse effects and sometimes form a basis for contraindication. This is one of critical issues of azole antifungals such as itraconazole, fluconazole and ketoconazole. The novel azoles represented by the formula (II) as well as hydrates or solvates thereof have less drug-drug interaction than known antimycotic azole compounds (see Table 1). Therefore, these azoles would have a clear clinical advantage. In vitro P450 Inhibitory Activity Each azole compound at different concentrations was incubated with a specific substrate for each CYP, human liver microsomes and NADPH at 37 C. Then, the metabolite formed from the specific substrate was determined by HPLC and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) was calculated. The substrate concentrations and incubation conditions were as follows: (1) substrate for CYP3A4: midazolam (10 M), formation of 1-hydroxymidazolam after incubation for 10 min at 37. (2) substrate for CYP2C9: tolbutamide (100 M), formation of 4-hydroxytolbutamide after incubation for 10 min at 37.

Therefore, the water soluble compounds of the general formula (I) as well as the salts, hydrates or solvates thereof exhibit potent activity against various fungal infections including Aspergillosis in rats over a very wide range of dosages both orally and parenterally and are useful as antifungal agents. The present invention further relates to the pharmaceutical compositions containing an azole compound of the general formula I or a salt, hydrate or solvate thereof. The azole compounds of the formula I as well as salts, hydrates or solvates thereof are very active antimycotic agents. They are active against a variety of fungal species including Candida spp., Cryptotoccus neoformans, Aspergillus spp., Trichophyton spp., Microsporum spp., Exophiala spp., Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Histoplasma capsulatum. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are useful for topical and systemic treatment of mycoses in animals as well as in humans. For example, they are useful in treating topical and mucosal fungal infections caused by, among other genera, Candida, Trichophyton, or Microsporum. They may also be used in the treatment of systemic fungal infections caused by, for example, Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus spp., Paracoccidiodes spp., Sporotrix spp., Exophiala spp., Blastomyces spp., or Histoplasma spp. For clinical use, the azole compound of the formula I as well as salts, hydrates or solvates thereof can be administered alone, but will generally be administered in pharmaceutical admixture formulated as appropriate to the particular use and purpose desired, by mixing excipient, binding agent, lubricant, disintegrating agent, coating material, emulsifier, suspending agent, solvent, stabilizer, absorption enhancer and/or ointment base. The admixture can be used for oral, injectable, rectal or topical administration. Pharmaceutical formulation for oral administration may be granule, tablet, sugar coated tablet, capsule, pill, suspension or emulsion. For parenteral injection, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously, the azoles of formula I may be used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution or in the form of a HPCD complex, which may contain other substances, for example, salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic. The azoles can also be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. The daily dosage level of the azole compounds of the formula I is from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg (in divided doses) when administered in one, two or more dosages by either the oral or parenteral route. Thus, tablets or capsules may contain from about 5 mg to about 0.5 g of active compound for administration. In any event the actual dosage can be determined by the physician and it may be varied upon the age, weight and response of the particular patient. In addition, the azole compounds of the formula I as well as salts, hydrates or solvates thereof have activity against a variety of plant pathogenic fungi, including for example Pyricularia oryzae, Pythium aphanidermatum, Alternaria spp., and Paecilomyces variotii. Thus, they can be applied for agricultural and horticultural purposes preferably in the form of a composition formulated as appropriate to the particular use and purpose desired, for example dusting powders, or granules, seed dressings, aqueous solutions, dispersions or emulsions, dips, sprays or aerosols. Such compositions may contain such conventional carriers, diluents or adjuvants as are known and acceptable in agriculture and horticulture. Other compounds having herbicidal or insecticidal, or additional antiflugals can be incorporated in the compositions. The compounds and compositions can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be applied directly to the plant foliage, stems, branches, seeds or roots or to the soil or other growing medium, and they may be used not only to eradicate the disease, but also prophylactically to protect the plants or seeds from attack. The following examples merely illustrate the preferred methods for the preparation of the compounds of the present invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention thereto. EXAMPLE 1 a) Preparation of (2R)-2,5-Difluoro-2-(3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yloxy)-propiophenone A mixture of magnesium (7.25 g, 0.298 mol) and iodine (catalytic amount) and 1-bromo-2,5-difluorobenzene (20.0 g, 0.178 mol) in THF (250ml ) was vigously stirred. The color of iodine was disappeared and the inner temperature rose up to 65 C. To this mixture was added additional 1-bromo-2,5-difluorobenzene (30.0 g, 0.267 mol) dropwise to maintain the inner temperature from 50 to 55 C. over 45min. The resulting mixture was stirred at 55 C. for 30min. then at r.t. for 1 hr. The mixture was cooled down to 5 C. To this mixture was added a solution of 4-(2R)-2-(3,4,5,6-Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yloxy)propionylmorpholine (52.5 g, 0.216 mol ) in THF (150ml) dropwise over 40min. And the resulting mixture was stirred at r.t. for 4hrs. The reaction mixture was cooled down to 5 C. and saturated NH 4 Cl aq. (100ml) was added carefully. The whole was diluted with H 2 O (600ml) and extracted with EtOAc (400 ml200 ml2). The combined organic layer was dried over Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated in vacuo.

This is a 371 of Application No. PCT/JP98/00970, filed Mar. 10, 1998. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to rare-earth complexes, ligands useful for these complexes, optically functional materials comprising the rare-earth complex, and a process for preparing the rare-earth complex. BACKGROUND ART With remarkable advances in developing electronic materials, many developments have been made in optically functional materials in the field of optoelectronics. For example, neodymium-containing glass has been introduced into actual use in laser beam electronic devices, whereas the glass has found only limited use because of the difficulties encountered in producing and working the glass and a high production cost. The dye laser, which can be used in the form of a solution, has the excellent features of being inexpensive, easy to work and cool and continuously usable for a prolonged period of time. However, the dye laser is low in strength and therefore limited in application. On the other hand, organic optical materials such as polyphenylene have the drawback of being short in luminescence life and diminished in the effectiveness of luminescence although superior to inorganic optical materials in workability. It is already known that a complex Nd III (HFA) 3 comprising Nd 3 and three molecules of hexafluoroacetylacetone (HFA) coordinated therewith and having heavy hydrogen substituted for the hydrogen of active methylene luminesces in the state of a solution S. Yanagida et al., J. Phys. Chem., 100, 10201(1996). This complex is short in luminescence life and low in quantum yield and decomposes in the presence of a very small amount of water to lose its optical conversion function. It has therefore been desired to develop complexes having a high luminescence intensity and good stability. An object of the present invention is to provide rare-earth complexes having excellent luminescence characteristics, compounds useful as ligands for these complexes, optically functional materials containing the rare-earth complex and a process for preparing such rare-earth complexes. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows 13 C-NMR spectra of (a) POS and (b) Nd(POS) 3 . FIG. 2 shows an absorption spectrum of Nd(POS) 3 in CD 3 OD. FIG. 3 is a luminescence spectrum of Nd(POS) 3 in acetone-d 6 .

Y is N, P, As, Sb or Bi, and is preferably N or P. n 1 is 2 or 3, preferably 3. n 2 is. 2 to 4, preferably 2 or 3, more preferably 3. n 3 is 0 or 1, preferably 1. n 3 is 1 especially when X is S. The ligand of the formula (III) to be incorporated into the complex of the invention is prepared, for example, in the following manner. wherein R, X, Y and n 3 are as defined above. A compound (2) is reacted with hexamethyldisilazane for trimethylsilylation, and the resulting compound is reacted with a compound (1) to obtain the desired compound of the formula (III). The reaction Eproceeds favorably when effected for about 1 to about 5 hours at room temperature to a temperature generally permitting reflux of the solvent, using about 1 to about 1.1 moles of hexamethyldisilazane and about 1 mole of the compound (1) are used per mole of the compound (2). The complex of the present invention represented by the formula (I) can be prepared by mixing together the compound represented by the formula (III) and at least one rare-earth metal compound selected from the group consisting of a rare-earth metal oxide, rare-earth metal hydroxide, rare-earth metal alkoxide, rare-earth metal amide and rare-earth metal salt, for example, in a solvent. More specifically, the rare-earth complex represented by the formula (I) can be prepared by the process to be described below. The ligand of the formula (III) is dissolved in a solvent, the rare-earth metal compound (particulate, granular or in any other form) is added to the solution, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature to 100 C. for about 1 hour to about 100 hours. The product is then purified as by crystallization or liquid-liquid extraction, whereby the rare-earth complex can be obtained. The complex may further be recrystallized from a solvent such as chloroform or methanol. Examples of rare-earth metal oxides useful as rare-earth metal compounds are trivalent compounds M 2 O 3 (wherein M is a rare-earth atom), while other oxides such as MO and M 4 O 7 are also usable. Similarly, examples of rare-earth metal hydroxides include M(OH)n 1 ; examples of rare-earth metal alkoxides include M(OR 1 )n 1 (wherein R 1 is alkyl); examples of rare-earth metal amides include M(NR a R b ) 3 (wherein R a and R b are the same or different and are each hydrogen, alkyl or phenyl); and examples of rare-earth metal salts include M 3 (Z)n 1 wherein Z is an anion such as chlorine ion, bromine ion, iodine ion, fluorine ion, sulfate ion, nitrate ion, acetate ion or like monocarboxylate ion, (oxalate ion, succinate ion, malonate ion or like dicarboxylate ion), (citrate or like tricarboxylate ion) or phosphate ion. n 1 is as defined above. The solvent to be used in preparing the complex of the formula (I) is not limited specifically but can be any solvent such as a protic solvent or aprotic solvent. Examples of useful protic solvents are water and alcoholic solvents such as methanol and ethanol. Examples of useful aprotic solvents are acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and like ketone solvents, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and like ether solvents, chloroform, methylene chloride and like halogen solvents, DMSO, DMF, etc. Preferable among these is water. The solvent is used in an amount, for example, of about 1 to about 100 parts by weight, preferably about 1 to about 20 parts by weight, relative to the combined amount of the ligand and the rare-earth metal compound (taken as 1 part by weight). The complex of the formula (II) can be obtained by reacting the rare-earth metal compound with an equivalent or excess of RX(O)n 3 1 (OH), which is a known substance, in water. The complex of the formula (II) is susceptible to coordination with H 2 O, loses the properties for use as an optically functional material when having coordinated H 2 O and is therefore less stable to H 2 O than the complex of the formula (I). If incorporating coordinated H 2 O, the complex of the formula (II) can be treated with D 2 O when to be used to remove the H 2 O for use as an optically functional material. The rare-earth metal compound is used for preparing the rare-earth complex of the formula (I) in an amount of 1 to 10 equivalents, preferably 1.05 to 3 equivalents, per equivalent of the ligand of the formula (III). The rare-earth complex of the formula (II) can be prepared from the compounds mentioned as used in a similar mixing ratio. In the case where the rare-earth complex represented by the formula (II) contains coordinated water, the complex is treated, for example, in the following manner. MeOD is added to a sample of the complex, the sample/MeOD mixture is frozen and then allowed to stand in a vacuum at room temperature for about 24 hours, and the methanol is subsequently distilled off to convert the coordinated H 2 O to D 2 O. The complex sample substituted with heavy hydrogen is thereafter dissolved in a dry organic solvent containing no hydrogen atoms (with all hydrogen atoms replaced by heavy hydrogen, halogen atoms or the like) for use as an optically functional material. Organic solvents containing heavy hydrogen, such as DMSO, methanol, acetone, THF, DMF and chloroform which are substituted with heavy hydrogen, or hydrogen-free solvents such as carbon tetrachloride are desirable since these solvents give complex a prolonged luminescence life. The rare-earth complex represented by the formula (I) is especially preferable since the complex is usable as dissolved directly in a dry solvent containing no hydrogen atoms without necessitating any procedure for converting coordinated H 2 O to D 2 O. On the other hand, the rare-earth complex represented by the formula (II) requires the conversion of the coordinated H 2 O to D 2 O. Examples of solvents for use in the luminescence method of the invention for dissolving the complex of the formula (I) are ketone compounds such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone, lower alcohols such as methanol and ethanol, water, ethers such as ether, THF, isopropyl ether, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene, hydrocarbon halides such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and tetrachloroethane, DMF, DMSO, acetamide, formamide and esters such as ethyl acetate, glycols such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, etc. The solvent may be one containing hydrogen atoms such as DMSO or acetone, whereas organic solvents containing heavy hydrogen, such as DMSO, methanol, acetone, THF, DMF and chloroform which are substituted with heavy hydrogen, or hydrogen-free solvents such as carbon tetrachloride are desirable since these solvents give complex a prolonged luminescence life. In place of the organic dye of an organic dye laser, the rare-earth complex of the present invention is usable as an optically functional material (element, electronic device or the like) under the same conditions as the organic dye laser. For example, the rare-earth complex of the invention is usable as dissolved, dispersed or suspended in a solvent under the specified conditions as to concentration (about 0.00001 to about 1 mole/liter, preferably about 0.005 to about 0.5 mole/liter, more preferably about 0.01 to about 0.3 mole/liter) and temperature (50 C. to room temperature). Although usable in the form of a liquid, the complex of the invention can also be used as an optically functional material in a solid state, for example, as dissolved or dispersed in a polymer. The complex of the present invention achieves a high optical conversion efficiency and is useful as a novel laser material for use in optical devices such as CD players, optical disks, facsimile systems, remote controllers, copying machines, laser printers, large-sized displays, medical lasers, laser beam machining and measuring means and devices relating to printing. Stated more specifically, the complex is applicable to laser devices, light-emitting diodes, liquid crystals, optical fibers, optical sensors, solar cells, etc. The complex of the invention can be adapted to alter the wavelength of the laser beam when modified or changed in the structure of ligand and/or in the kind of rare-earth element, affording a laser for giving a beam of desired wavelength. Unlike semiconductors, the complex of the invention can be used for preparing laser materials by a greatly simplified process without necessitating a clean room or the like.

This application is the national phase of international application PCT/JP98104917 filed Oct. 30, 1998 which designated the U.S. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt that is a chelate compound usable as a photographic bleaching agent, a fertilizer or the like and has little undesirable influence on the environment because of its good biodegradability, and a process for producing said salt. BACKGROUND ART The present inventors have disclosed in JP, 8-34764,A that an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron ammonium salt, which is a compound useful for photographic bleaching and the like, has a high biodegradability. However, in a production process for producing the disclosed compound, it was necessary to obtain a highly viscous and highly slurry concentrate because of the very high solubility of the desired compound, in order to obtain the desired compound in high yield. Therefore, there has been a desire for a production process having a higher productivity as an industrial production process. A process for obtaining the desired compound by a concentration to dryness or a continuous hot gas drying has achieved an improvement in the yield but has been disadvantageous in product quality that, for example, powders obtained by said process were so poor in shelf stability that it was colored or was deteriorated in solubility. Unlike a production process using an inorganic salt such as iron sulfate, a production process using iron oxide was expected to make it possible to obtain a desired compound having a relatively high purity by evaporating a reaction solution to dryness as it was, unless starting materials are decomposed. However, when a meso/racemic mixture of ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid was used, a product obtained by such a process had a very high hygroscopicity in some cases and moreover its purity was not sufficient. In addition, also when S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid was used, the resulting solid had a low stability, for example, it was colored or gave an insoluble material with a lapse of time. Furthermore, the solid had a low purity and the mass balance of the S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid used was markedly unsatisfactory. An object of the present invention is to solve such problems and provide an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt having a high storage stability and a process for producing the same in high yield. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present inventors have made extensive studies in order to achieve the above object and consequently found that an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt contains an impurity that is difficult to detect even under HPLC analysis conditions under which a slight amount of a chelate compound can be analyzed, because the impurity has a much lower chelate ability than that of other components. Additionally, the present inventors found that, as a result of various analyses such as mass spectrometry and NMR, the impurity is a compound derived from S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid by a formation of a lactam ring. The present inventors also found that a coloring and a deterioration of a shelf stability of the S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt are due to the presence of a compound of the following general formula (1) or a compound of the following general formula (2) as reaction by-products and due that an iron complexs stability of these compounds is low that the compounds release a chelated iron with a lapse of time. Thus, the present inventors found that a reduction of an amount of the reaction by-products is important. (Wherein M is an ammonium ion or an alkali metal ion.) (Wherein M is an ammonium ion or an alkali metal ion.) In addition, the present inventors found that even if these compounds are contained in the S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt, this salt is not seriously deteriorated in shelf stability when a content of each of the compounds is 7 wt % or less. The present inventors further found the following: a formation of these impurities can be inhibited by properly controlling a reaction temperature, a reaction period of time and pH at the reaction and adding a reducing agent; of the impurities formed, the lactam compound is easily soluble in a lower alcohol while the S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt is insoluble therein, and therefore only the impurity can be dissolved by utilizing a difference in solubility between the impurity and the lactam compound; and when a continuous hot gas drying method is adopted, a decomposition of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid during an oxidation can be minimized, and an oxidation of ferrous iron easily proceeds simultaneously with drying. Thus, the present invention has been accomplished. That is, one aspect of the present invention is directed to an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt which contains a lactam compound represented by the general formula (1) shown below and an ethylenediaminemonosuccinic acid represented by the general formula (2) shown below in an amount of 7 wt % or less, respectively: wherein M is an ammonium ion or an alkali metal ion, wherein M is an ammonium ion or an alkali metal ion. Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a process for producing the above-mentioned S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salts as such are stable at a room temperature and have a very high water-solubility of 60 g/50 g H 2 O or more, and aqueous solutions thereof are weakly acidic substances having a pH of about 5 and can be stably stored. On the other hand, S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-dissuccinic acid, which is used as a starting material in a process for producing an S, S-ethylenediamine-N,N-dissuccinic acid iron alkali salt by an iron chelating reaction, is an unstable compound in an acidic solution. It undergoes a lactam ring formation reaction or is decomposed by an amine elimination reaction. Additionally, this compound has a strong acidity of pH 2 or thereabouts in an aqueous solution. Therefore, the compound is further characterized in that its cyclization gradually proceeds when water is present, without an addition of an acidic substance, even at room temperature. The formation of a cyclization product and a fumaric acid, and an ethylenediaminemonosuccinic acid by an elimination reaction of amine are accelerated by heating. However, a chelating reaction of iron under basic conditions results in an extreme decrease of a reactivity of iron oxide and a formation of a large amount of iron hydroxide and iron ammine complexes. In addition, when the S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt is obtained in the form of powder, an alkali present in excess undesirably caused a moisture absorption to deteriorate a stability of a product. Therefore, the reaction was unavoidably carried out with heating in a weakly acidic pH region of 3 to 6, so that the above-mentioned by-products were formed. Furthermore, since these by-products, i.e. the cyclization product and the by-products produced by the amine elimination reaction, have a lower chelate ability than that of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid, they released iron ions, owing to a pH change, a composition change of liquid caused by additives, and a lapse of time, so that a water-insoluble iron hydrate was formed to cause an appearance of turbidity in an aqueous solution. The present inventors found the following: an appearance of the turbidity can be prevented to such an extent that it does not cause any problem in practice, by reducing a content of each of the above-mentioned by-products to 7 wt % or less; and the content of each of the by-products can be reduced to 7 wt % or less by taking the countermeasure described below. Thus, the present invention has been accomplished. Since a formation of the decomposition products and the cyclization product is dependent on a temperature at a chelating reaction of iron or iron oxide with S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid, a reaction period of time and pH at the reaction, a desired compound containing only a slight amount of the by-products can be obtained by making these conditions suitable and adding a stabilizer. S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid used in the process of the present invention can be synthesized by a known process. For example, this compound can be synthesized either by reacting 1,2-dihaloethane with L-aspartic acid with heating in the presence of an alkali metal hydroxide (Inorganic Chemistry, 7 (11), 2405 (1968)) or by utilizing a microbial enzyme. As an alkali used in the present invention, ammonia and alkali metals conventionally used in S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salts are preferable. Alkaline earth metals and organic monoamines such as alkylamines may be used as the alkali. As an iron oxide used in the process of the present invention, any of magnetite, goethite and hematite and the like may be used in the form of powder, magnetite being the most preferable and hematite being the second most preferable. When hematite is used, hematite having a specific surface area of 10 (m 2 /g) or more, more preferably 15 (m 2 /g) or more, in terms of BET value is preferable. When magnetite is used, magnetite having a specific surface area of 5 (m 2 /g) or more, more preferably 6 (m 2 /g) or more, in terms of BET value is preferable. When goethite is used, goethite having a specific surface area of 85 (m 2 /g) or more, more preferably 95 (m 2 /g) or more, in terms of BET value is preferable. Here, the term BET value means a specific surface area value measured by a low-temperature N 2 gas adsorption. As to the order of charging of starting materials in the process of the present invention, either a method comprising charging an aqueous medium and S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid in a reactor and then adding thereto iron oxide powder, or a method comprising charging an aqueous medium and iron oxide powder in a reactor and then adding thereto S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid may be adopted, the latter being more preferable. As the aqueous medium, either a water or an alcohol-containing water may be used, a water being preferably used. In the method of charging an aqueous medium and iron oxide powder in a reactor and then adding thereto S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid, a dispersion liquid obtained from the aqueous medium and the iron oxide powder is heated at from 70 to 100 C., preferably from 75 to 95 C., more preferably from 80 to 90 C., and S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid or an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid monoalkali salt is continuously or intermittently added thereto in the form of powder or a dispersion or solution in an aqueous medium. In this case, pH of the reaction mixture is preferably maintained at from 4.5 to 7, more preferably from 5 to 6. More particularly, S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid used is mixed with an aqueous alkali solution containing an alkali in an amount of from equivalent to 1.4 moles, preferably from 1.05 to 1.25 moles, per mole of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid, to obtain a dispersion liquid or aqueous solution of an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid alkali salt, which is continuously or intermittently added to the iron oxide dispersion liquid. It is also possible to add the S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid powder and the queous alkali solution to the iron oxide dispersion liquid separately and continuously or intermittently ithout beforehand mixing them, to carry out the reaction. In this case, when an addition rate of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid is rapider than that of the aqueous alkali solution, pH is lowered. Therefore, it is preferable to carry out the reaction while adjusting the pH by adding the aqueous alkali solution so that the pH may be always in a range of 4.5 to 7. Although depending on a reaction temperature, a period of time required for the addition may be properly selected in a range of from 0.2 to 4 hours, preferably from 1 to 3 hours. Furthermore, a formation of a cyclization product can be inhibited by adding a reducing agent at the time of the chelating reaction. Specific examples of the reducing agent are inorganic reducing agents in the form of powder, wire, ribbon or the like of a metal such as iron powder, zinc powder, magnesium powder, aluminum powder, etc.; and organic reducing agents such as ascorbic acid, isoascorbic acid, oxalic acid, etc. Iron is preferable for suppressing a contamination of a product with impurities. The amount of such additives is 0.1-20 mo 1 %, preferably approximately 1-10 mo 1 %, based on the amount of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid. When hematite or goethite is used as the iron oxide, a small amount of a divalent iron exists in a reaction mixture obtained by a dissolution of the iron oxide and a chelation. When magnetite is used, a divalent iron exists in the reaction mixture in an amount of from a few % to over ten % based on the total amount of iron existing in the reaction mixture. For oxidizing the divalent iron into a trivalent iron, a molecular oxygen can be used. When a desired composition is obtained as powder, it is not necessary to introduce a molecular oxygen into the reaction mixture to carry out an oxidation reaction and then dry it which are the conventional procedure. Insoluble materials are removed from the above-mentioned reaction mixture, if necessary, by filtering the reaction mixture and a residue is dried by the use of a continuous hot gas dryer. The divalent iron is effectively oxidized by an air introduced during the drying. Moreover, since a treatment period of time is short, a decomposition of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid, which has Ad occurred when an air blows into, is inhibited. Therefore, powder of a desired composition can be efficiently obtained. The continuous hot gas dryer includes, for example, a spray dryer and a continuous granulation dryer. A temperature of the hot gas used ranges from 70 C. to 200 C. S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt reaction mixture containing of the compounds represented by the above general formula (1) and (2) in an amount of more than 7% is reduced in water content or allowed to assume a dried state, and then the treated reaction mixture is washed with a water-containing lower alcohol, whereby S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt having intended low contents of the compounds of the general formula (1) and (2) can be efficiently obtained. Examples of the lower alcohol described above include lower alcohols of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Specific examples thereof include methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol, etc. Specifically, a water contained in the S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt reaction mixture containing high contents of the by-products is allowed to evaporate by a concentration under a reduced pressure of the reaction mixture until the water content becomes 60% or less based on the amount of solid components. Then, an absolute or water-containing lower alcohol is added to the residue so as to form a water-containing lower alcohol having a water content of 3 to 35%, preferably 5 to 20%, whereby crystals are dispersed. By separating the crystals by filtration, S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt having a content of each of the above-mentioned by-products of not more than 7% can be easily obtained. Another treatment method is as follows: after the reaction mixture is dried with a continuous hot gas dryer, as in spray drying, dried substances can be washed either by dispersing it in a water-containing alcohol having a water content of 3 to 35%, preferably 5 to 20%, followed by a separation by filtration, or by charging the dried substances into a Buchner funnel or the like and rinsing the dried substances with the water-containing alcohol, whereby an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt having a content of each of the above-mentioned by-products of not more than 7% can be easily obtained. The present invention is illustrated in further detail with the following examples and comparative examples, which should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. Iron yield and analysis methods for iron component and a chelate component are as follows. Iron yield(the amount of iron dissolved as determined by a titration)/(the total amount of all iron atoms used in the reaction)100 Analysis Method for Iron Component: All ions of dissolved iron in a sample is converted to ferric iron ions and the thus treated sample is reacted with potassium iodide and then titrated with sodium thiosulfate by using a starch as an indicator. Analysis Method for a Chelate Component: An aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is added to an iron complex to eliminate the iron therefrom, and then the resulting substance is dissolved in a solution containing copper to form a copper complex, which is analyzed by a liquid chromatography (column: ODS-2, wavelength: 254 nm, eluent: a buffer solution containing copper, analysis temperature: 40 C.). EXAMPLE 1 146 g of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid, 300 g of water and 21 g of 98% sodium hydroxide were charged in a reactor equipped with a stirrer and a thermometer, and were stirred and mixed at room temperature. 37.7 g of magnetite having a BET value of 6.5 (m 2 /g) and 1.4 g of iron powder were added thereto, and a reaction was carried out with heating and thorough stirring at 80 C. for 2 hours. The contents of by-products in the reaction mixture were as follows: the content of a cyclization product having a lactam ring was 2.7%, and the content of a deamined ethylenediaminemonosuccinic acid was 2%. Insoluble materials were removed from the obtained reaction mixture by filtration, and then the residue was adjusted to pH 5 with S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid. The thus obtained liquid, after a completion of the pH adjustment, was dried with a spray dryer to obtain an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron sodium salt composition having a lactam ring content of 2.5% and an ethylenediaminemonosuccinic acid content of 2%, with an iron yield of 98%.

Methanol of 2, 3 times volume as much as the water contained in the resulting residue was slowly added to the resulting concentrated liquid residue with thoroughly stirring. After a completion of the addition of methanol, the resulting liquid was stirred as it was for 1 hour, and crystals precipitated were filtered and then dried to obtain S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron sodium salt in a yield of 80%. In this case, a content of a cyclization product having a lactam ring (a lactam ring content) was 0.5%, and a content of an ethylenediaminemonosuccinic acid was 0.2%.

Then, crystals were separated by filtration and dried to obtain S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt containing 2% of a cyclization product having a lactam ring and 1.5% of an ethylenediaminemonosuccinic acid, in a yield after purification of 80%.

The solution was stored at 50 C. for 1 week and then diluted to 1% and the dissolution state of the resulting diluted solution was observed. When the crystals obtained in any of Comparative Examples were used, insoluble materials were found. In contrast, when the crystals obtained in any of Examples were used, no insoluble material was found. EXAMPLE 16 200 g of water, 40 g of magnetite (iron content: 70.5%) and 3 g of iron powder were charged in a 1-liter cylindrical flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer and a material feed opening, and were heated at 85 C. Then, 146 g of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid was dispersed in 365 g of water containing 10.2 g of ammonia, and the resulting dispersion liquid was added to an iron oxide dispersion liquid, which had been beforehand prepared, over about 2 hours by the use of a slurry pump while maintaining a mixture temperature at 80 to 85 C. During the addition, pH of the reaction mixture gradually decreased from 7 and varied in a range of 5.5 to 6. After a completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was maintained at 80 C. for 30 minutes and then cooled to room temperature. This reaction mixture contained a cyclization product having a lactam ring formed in an amount of only 0.5% based on the amount of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid used and divalent iron ions in an amount of 10% based on the total amount of all iron ions. Subsequently, insoluble components were removed from the obtained reaction mixture by filtration, and 7 g of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid was added to the liquid residue to adjust the amounts of iron ions and S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid to equimolar. Then, the resulting mixture was dried with a spray dryer to obtain 193 g of an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron ammonium salt containing 0.5% of a compound having a lactam ring and 0.2% of an ethylenediaminemonosuccinic acid, and having a content of divalent iron ions of 0.5% based on all iron ions, and a purity of 98% or more. EXAMPLE 17 200 g of water, 40 g of magnetite (iron content: 70.5%) and 3 g of iron powder were charged in a 1-liter cylindrical flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer and a material feed opening, and were heated at 80 C. Then, 146 g of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid was added thereto with a spoon over 2.5 hours while maintaining a mixture temperature at 80 to 85 C. During the addition, 150 g of an aqueous solution containing 20.4 g of sodium hydroxide was added to the reaction mixture while adjusting pH of the reaction mixture to 5 to 6. After a completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was maintained at 80 C. for 15 minutes and then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture contained a cyclization product having a lactam ring formed in an amount of only 0.4% based on the amount of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid used. After divalent iron ions remained in an amount of about 8% based on the total amount of all iron ions were oxidized by bubbling air into the reaction mixture, insoluble materials were removed by filtration. The amount of a compound having a lactam ring in the S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron sodium salt aqueous solution thus obtained was 0.4% based on the amount of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid used. EXAMPLE 18 200 g of water and 40 g of magnetite (iron content: 70.5%) were charged in a 1-liter cylindrical flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer and a material feed opening, and were heated at 85 C. Then, 146 g of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid was dispersed in 365 g of water containing 10.2 g of ammonia, and the resulting dispersion liquid was added to an iron oxide dispersion liquid, which had been beforehand prepared, over 2 hours by the use of a slurry pump while maintaining a mixture temperature at 80 to 85 C. During the addition, the pH of the reaction mixture gradually decreased from 7 and varied in a range of 5.5 to 6. After a completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was maintained at 80 C. for 30 minutes and then cooled to room temperature. Divalent iron ions remained in the reaction mixture in an amount of about 10% based on the total amount of all iron ions were oxidized by bubbling air into the reaction mixture, and then insoluble materials were removed by filtration. In the solution thus obtained, a cyclization product having a lactam ring was formed in an amount of 0.9% based on the amount of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid used. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 5 200 g of water, 40 g of magnetite (iron content: 70.5%) and 3 g of iron powder were charged in a 1-liter cylindrical flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer and a material feed opening, and were heated at 80 C. Then, 146 g of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid was added thereto with a spoon over about 2.5 hours while maintaining a mixture temperature at 80 to 85 C. During the addition, 150 g of an aqueous solution containing 20.4 g of sodium hydroxide was added to the reaction mixture while adjusting pH of the reaction mixture at from 3.0 to 4.0, and the whole aqueous sodium hydroxide solution prepared was added at last. After a completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was maintained at 80 C. for 15 minutes and then cooled to room temperature. In this reaction mixture, a cyclization product having a lactam ring was formed in an amount of 2.1% based on the amount of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid used.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to aryl (sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone) derivatives, processes for the preparation thereof, and matrix metalloproteinases inhibitors containing them as active ingredient. More particularly, this invention relates to matrix metalloproteinases inhibitors containing aryl (sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone) derivatives of the formula (I) (wherein all the symbols are the same meanings as hereinafter described.), non-toxic salts thereof, as active ingredient, and the above-mentioned novel aryl (sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone) derivatives of the formula (I), non-toxic salts thereof, and processes for the preparation thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The matrix metalloproteinases (hereinafter abbreviated as MMP) are neutral metalloproteinases and zinc (hereinafter abbreviated as Zn 2 ) is essential in the active site for their activation They degrade collagen, laminin, proteoglycans, fibronectin, elastin, gelatin etc. under physiological conditions and, therefore, are effective on growth and tissue remodeling of articulation tissue, bone tissue and connective tissue. At least 10 classes of MMP which differ in primary structure are identified. As common characteristics of these enzymes, MMP (1) have Zn 2 in the active site and the activity depends on calcium (Ca 2 ), (2) are secreted as an inactive proenzyme and activated outside of cells, (3) have high homology on amino acid sequence, (4) have an ability to degrade various extracellular matrix components in vivo, (5) are regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP) which are specific to MMP. MMP inhibitors are useful for prevention and/or treatment of various diseases induced by overexpression or excess activation of MMP. Such diseases are, for example, rheumatoid diseases, arthrosteitis, unusual bone resorption, osteoporosis, periodontitis, interstitial nephritis, arteriosclerosis, pulmonary emphysema, cirrhosis, cornea injury, metastasis of, invasion of or growth of tumor cells, autoimmune diseases (e.g. Crohns disease, Sjogrens syndrome), diseases caused by vascular emigration or infiltration of leukocytes, arterialization etc. Some compounds possessing inhibitory activity against matrix metalloproteinases are known. A sequence in the vicinity of the cleavage site of collagen (Gly-Ile-Ala-Gly or Gly-Leu-Ala-Gly) has high affinity for collagenase. Much research and development on substrate analogous matrix metalloproteinases inhibitors, which are chemically modified so as to have zinc affinity groups on a cleavage site of the substrate, has energetically been carried out Inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), Nigel RA Beeley, Phillip R J Ansell, Andrew J P Docherty et al., Curr.

Formula (1): wherein X 1 and X 2 are each independently H, Cl or F, provided that at least one of X 1 and X 2 is Cl or F; one of R 1 and R 2 is H and the other is OH; and R 5 is an unsubstituted alkyl, preferably a C 1-6 alkyl, group. The process comprises condensing a 2-chloroalkanoic acid with an optionally substituted benzyl alcohol to form a 2-(optionally substituted benzyloxy) alkanoic acid, converting the condensation product to the corresponding acid chloride and then either reacting the acid chloride with a compound of the Formula (2) in the presence of a source of copper (I) to give a compound of Formula (3) wherein one of R 3 and R 4 is H and the other is optionally substituted benzyloxy; or reacting the acid chloride with a compound of Formula (4): ANHB wherein A and B independently represent substituted alkyl, alkoxy, aryl or oxyaryl groups, or are linked to form a heterocyclic ring to form an amide, and then reacting the amide with a compound of Formula (2) to give a compound of Formula (3). The optionally substituted benzyl group from the compound of Formula (3) can removed by hydrogenation. This invention relates to processes for the preparation of certain chiral compounds and to novel compounds used in the processes. 1(2,4-dihalophenyl)-2-hydroxy-1-propanones are key intermediates for the synthesis of a variety of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, particularly antifungal compounds and medicines used in the treatment of AIDS. For example Sch 42427/SM9164 and ER-30346 are made from these intermediates. The chiral 2-hydroxy group in these compounds has been prepared by chiral -hydroxylation of the corresponding 2,4-difluoropropiophenone. One such method is described in Tetrahedron Letters, Vol 37, No. 45, pp8117-8120 (1996). An alternative method involves the regioselective ring opening of a 2,4-fluorophenyl propylene oxide, as described in Tetrahedron Letters, Vol 35, No. 45, pp8299-8302 (1994). We have now devised a process for preparing 2,4-dihalo-2-hydroxypropiophenones with good enantiomeric purity from readily available L- or D-2-chloropropionic acid. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a compound of Formula (1): wherein: X 1 and X 2 are each independently H, Cl or F, provided that at least one of X 1 and X 2 is Cl or F; one of R 1 and R 2 is H and the other is OH; and R 5 is an unsubstituted alkyl, preferably a C 1-6 alkyl, group comprising the steps: (a) condensing a 2-chloroalkanoic acid with an optionally substituted benzyl alcohol to form a 2-(optionally substituted benzyloxy) alkanoic acid; (b) converting the product from step (a) to the corresponding acid chloride; then either: (c) reacting the product of step (b) with a compound of the Formula (2) in the presence of a source of copper (I) to give a compound of Formula (3) wherein one of R 3 and R 4 is H and the other is optionally substituted benzyloxy; or (d) reacting the product of step (b) with a compound of Formula (4): ANHB wherein A and B independently represent substituted alkyl, alkoxy, aryl or oxyaryl groups, or are linked to form a heterocyclic ring to form an amide, and then reacting the amide with a compound of Formula (2) to give a compound of Formula (3); and (e) removing the optionally substituted benzyl group from the compound of Formula (3) by hydrogenation, thereby giving the compound of Formula (1). The process steps a) to d) above for the production of a compound of Formula (3) form another aspect of the present invention. In step (a) the reaction of the 2-chloroalkanoic acid with an optionally substituted benzyl alcohol proceeds with an inversion of configuration. Accordingly, the choice of which enantiomer of the 2-chloroalkanoic acid will be made on the basis of the desired configuration of the desired compound of Formula (1) or Formula (3). 2-chloroalkanoic acids which can be employed in the present invention have the general formula: R 5 CR 6 R 7 CO 2 H, wherein R 5 is an alkyl group, preferably a C 1-6 alkyl group, and most preferably a methyl group, and one of R 6 or R 7 is Cl, the other being H. The most preferred 2-chloroalkanoic acids are L- and D-2-chloropropionic acid. The optionally substituted benzyl alcohol is preferably benzyl alcohol or a benzyl alcohol having from 1 to 5 substituents, often selected from the group consisting of halo, preferably F, Cl or Br; nitro; C 1-4 -alkyl, preferably methyl or ethyl; C 1-4 -alkoxy, preferably methoxy or ethoxy; carboxy; sulpho and amino. Benzyl alcohol is most preferred. The condensation in step (a) is preferably performed in the presence of a strong base, preferably an inorganic base. Examples of suitable organic bases include alkyl lithium salts such as butyl lithium, and alkali metal, especially lithium, alkylamide salts such as lithium diisopropylamide. Examples of suitable inorganic bases include alkali metals, especially lithium, sodium and potassium metal, alkali metal hydrides such as lithium, sodium or potassium hydride, alkali metal hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates, especially sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and mixtures thereof. The condensation of step (a) is preferably performed at an elevated temperature, more preferably 30 C. to 150 C., especially 40 C. to 120 C. Condensation step (a) can be performed in the presence of an organic solvent which is unreactive towards the reagents employed. Examples of suitable solvents include halocarbons, especially chlorocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, and ethers, particularly C 1-6 alkylethers such as t-butyl methyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. It is preferred that the benzyl alcohol serves as its own solvent, and in many embodiments, a molar excess of benzyl alcohol over the chloropropionic acid is employed, such as a mole ratio of benzyl alcohol to 2-chloroalkanoic acid of from 2:1 to 15:1, and commonly from 5:1 to 10:1. Conversion of the product of step (a) to the corresponding acid chloride (i.e. COCl) is preferably performed using oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride, or a phosphorus halide, such as PCL 3 or PCL 5 . Elevated temperatures are preferred, especially 30 C. to 110 C., more preferably 35 C. to 90 C. The reaction is commonly carried out neat, but an organic solvent which is unreactive towards the reagents may be employed. Examples of suitable solvents include halocarbons, especially chlorocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane, chlorobenzene; ethers, particularly C 1-6 alkylethers such as t-butyl methyl ether and tetrahydrofuran; and aromatic solvents such as toluene. The source of copper (I) used in step (c) is preferably a Cu (I) salt, such as CuNO 3 , CuCN or a copper (I) halide, especially CuCl, CuBr or Cul. The amount of copper (I) source used is preferably between 80 and 200 mole % relative to the number of moles of the acid chloride product of step (b), more preferably from 85 to 150 mole %, especially 90 to140 mole %. Step (c) is commonly carried out in the presence of an organic solvent which is unreactive towards the reagents is commonly employed. Examples of suitable organic solvents include ethers, particularly C 1-6 alkylethers such as t-butyl methyl ether and tetrahydrofuran; and aromatic solvents such as toluene. The reaction temperature of step (c) is commonly in the range of from 78 C. to 30 C., and preferably from 40 C. to 0 C. The compound of Formula (2) is commonly prepared by reacting the appropriately substituted phenyl bromide with magnesium metal in the presence of a suitable solvent, often the solvent employed in step (c). Preferably, a stoichiometric ratio or moderate molar excess of phenyl bromide to magnesium is employed, often a molar ratio of from 1:1 to 2:1, and advantageously from 1.25:1 to 1.75:1. The preparation often takes place at a temperature of from ambient temperature (20-25 C.) to about 35 C. It will be recognised that the preparation of compounds of Formula (2) can be exothermic, and so appropriate cooling is advantageously provided to control such exotherms. In the amine compound of Formula (4) employed in step (d), when A or B represents an alkyl or alkoxy group, it is preferably a C 1-4 alkyl or alkoxy group, and particularly a methyl or methoxy group. When A or B represents an aryl or aryloxy group, it is preferably a phenyl or phenoxy group. When A and B are linked to form a ring, the ring preferably contains from 5 to 8 members, and 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms. In addition to the amine nitrogen, other heteroatoms, especially oxygen may be present in the ring. Examples of preferred amines include morpholine, pyrrolidine and N-methoxy-N-methylamine. The amine can be employed as a free amine or in the form of a salt, especially a hydrochloride salt. The mole ratio of amine to acid chloride is commonly from 1:1 to 2:1. Step (d) is commonly carried out in the presence of an organic solvent which is unreactive towards the reagents is commonly employed. Advantageously, the solvent employed is substantially water insoluble. Examples of suitable organic solvents include halocarbons, especially chlorocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane, chlorobenzene; ethers, particularly C 1-6 alkylethers such as t-butyl methyl ether and tetrahydrofuran; and aromatic solvents such as toluene. Step (d) is commonly carried out a temperature of from 0 to 30 C. In step (e) the optionally substituted benzyl group can be removed by methods known in the art, and is preferably removed from the compound of Formula (3) by hydrogenation using a transition metal catalyst and hydrogen gas. Preferred transition metal catalysts are in group VIII of the periodic table, more preferably palladium, nickel and platinum, and especially palladium on carbon, often on activated carbon. Loadings of metal on carbon are commonly in the range of from 1 to 20% w/w, and preferably from about 5% to about 10% w/w. Degussa-type palladium on activated carbon has been found to be advantageous in certain embodiments of the present invention. Solvents that can be employed in the removal of the optionally substituted benzyl group by hydrogenation include alcohols, particularly C 1-4 alkyl alcohols; esters, particularly esters of C 1-4 carboxylic acids with C 1-4 alcohols, preferably ethyl acetate; and aromatic solvents such as toluene. Step (e) is commonly carried out a temperature of from about 10 to 30 C., commonly at ambient temperature, such as 15 to 25 C. The compounds of Formula (3) are valuable intermediates in their own right and generally have useful crystalline properties. This enables the compound of Formula (3) to be crystallised thereby greatly enhancing the purity, both chemical and particularly optical, of the desired compound of Formula (1) and downstream pharmaceutical and agrochemical products. Furthermore, the compounds of Formula (3) are much more stable than the corresponding free hydroxy compounds and are therefore more readily transportable. They can also be stored for extended periods, with conversion to the corresponding free hydroxy compound being necessary only immediately prior to its use. Thus in a preferred embodiment the product of step (c) or (d) is purified by recrystallisation before step (e) is performed. Recrystallisation is preferably performed in an organic solvent, more preferably in hydrocarbon solvent, especially a linear of branched aliphatic hydrocarbon, such as n- or iso-pentane, n- or iso-hexane, cyclohexane and petroleum fractions. Accordingly the present invention also provides compounds of Formula (3) wherein X 1 and X 2 are each independently H, Cl or F, provided that at least one of X 1 and X 2 is Cl or F; one of R 3 and R 4 is H and the other is optionally substituted benzyloxy; and R 5 is an unsubstituted alkyl, preferably a C 1-6 alkyl, group. Preferably, both of X 1 and X 2 represent Cl or F, and especially both are F. The benzyloxy group is often unsubstituted. R 5 is most commonly a methyl group. The process for the production of compounds of Formula (3) preferably comprises the further step of purifying the compound of Formula (3) by recrystallisation from an organic solvent, more preferably from one of the organic solvents mentioned above in the recrystallisation process for purifying the products of steps (c) and (d). The invention is further illustrated without limitation by the following examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless specified otherwise and % Str. is percent strength. EXAMPLE 1 L-2-chloropropionic acid D-2-(benzyloxy)propionic acid Sodium metal (34.5 g, 1.5 moles) was added in small portions with cooling to benzyl alcohol (440 g, 4.1 moles). The mixture was stirred at 80-90 C. for 2 hours, cooled to 55 C. and L-2-chloropropionic acid (68.6 g, 0.63 moles) was added over about 1 hour. The mixture was stirred at 55 C. until gas chromatography indicated that the condensation was complete (about 2 hours). Water (350ml) was added and the pH was adjusted to 6.5 using concentrated HCl. Tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME, 250 ml) was added, the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes and then allowed to settle. Water (150 ml) and TBME (250 ml) were added. The aqueous layer was removed and washed with TBME (500 ml and 3250 ml washings). The washed, aqueous layer was then acidified to pH 1.5 using concentrated HCl to liberate the desired product and the product was extracted with TBME (2250 ml). The combined 500 ml of TBME was washed with water (200 ml) and the solvent removed in vacuo at 50 C., 300 mmHg pressure to give the desired D-2-(benzyloxy)propionic acid (96.1 g, 84%). D-2-(benzyloxy)propionic acid D-2-(benzyloxy)propionyl chloride Oxalyl chloride (112 g, 0.88 moles) was added dropwise at 20 C. to the product of stage (a) (102.86 g, 0.57 moles). The temperature rose rapidly to 35 C. When the exotherm had ceased the mixture was heated to 45-50 C. and the remainder of the oxalyl chloride was added at this temperature over 45 minutes. After stirring the mixture at 50-55 C. for 1.5 hours the temperature was increased to 105 C. with a nitrogen sparge to remove any residual oxalyl chloride. The desired D-2-(benzyloxy)propionyl chloride was obtained as an oil (109.7 g, 94.9%). An aliquot (ca. 5-10 ml) of a solution of 2,4-Difluorobromobenzene (98.49 g, 0.5 moles) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (75 ml) was added to a stirred mixture of Mg turnings (12.25 g, 0.51 moles) in THF (340 ml) at ambient temperature. After 35 minutes stirring at ambient temperature the reaction initiated. When the temperature reached 27 C. an ice/water bath was used to cool the reaction mixture but the temperature still reached 50 C. before the exotherm subsided. The mixture was cooled to 25 C. and the remainder of the solution of bromodifluorobenzene/THF solution added to the Mg/THF solution with cooling over 0.5 h at 20-30 C. The mixture was stirred for a further 1.5 hours, CuCl (56.5 g, 0.57 moles, dried at 110 C. for 17 hours) was added over 20 minutes at 20-30 C. (ice bath cooling) and the mixture stirred for a further 1.5 hours at 20-300 C. The mixture was cooled to 30 C. and the acid chloride added over 20 minutes at 25 to 30 C. The mixture was then allowed to warm to room temperature and monitored by GC. After stirring overnight (17 hours), 5% GC area of the acid chloride still remained. 200 ml of 18% HCl was added, keeping the temperature below 30 C. This acid dissolved almost all the solids apart from some residual CuCl. TBME (250 ml) was added and the mixture stirred for 10 mins. The two dark phases separated well and the aqueous phase was removed (120 ml). To the organic was added further TBME (100 ml) and the organic-washed with 18% HCl (100 ml). Water (100 ml) was added and an emulsion was produced. The mixture was shaken and allowed to settle. A good separation then resulted. The aqueous was removed (240 ml). The organic extract was sequentially washed with 318% HCl (200 ml) (in each case more than 200 ml aqueous was removed) washes and then a water wash (200 ml). The water wash resulted in a precipitate in the organic phase. To the mixture (containing the water wash) was added conc. HCl (50 ml). The mixture was shaken then settled to give 2 phases. The aqueous was removed and the organic diluted with further TBME (250 ml) was washed with water (150 ml). An emulsion resulted and conc. HCl (50 ml) was added. The emulsion cleared to give two phases. The aqueous was removed and the organic washed with water (2500 ml). Some solids were apparent in the aqueous phase and these were removed with the aqueous washings. The organic was then washed with 9% HCl (200 ml), water (200 ml), 5% sodium carbonate (200 ml) and water (200 ml). The solvent was removed in vacuo at 60 C./20 mmHg to give the above product (3) as a brown oil. Hydrogen gas was bubbled through a solution of (3) (2 g, 0.0072 moles) in methanol (50 ml) in the presence of a catalyst (5% Pd on carbon, 0.2 g at 50% water content, Degussa Type E101). When gas chromatography showed the reaction had gone to completion the catalyst was removed by filtration under nitrogen and methanol removed in vacuo to give (1) as an oil (1.3 g, 95%).

"last_name": null, "city": "Middlebury", "state": "CT", "country": "US"}], "title": "Inhibition of polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers", "abstract": "Disclosed herein is a method for inhibiting the premature polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising adding to said monomers an effective amount of an inhibitor having the structural formula: wherein R 1 and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and the portion represents the atoms necessary to form a five-, six-, or seven-membered heterocyclic ring, at least one of said atoms being a carbon atom substituted with a primary, secondary, or tertiary amino group. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention is directed to the use of C-substituted-amino cyclic nitroxides, especially 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, to inhibit the polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers, especially, vinyl aromatic monomers and acrylic monomers. 2. Description of Related Art Many ethylenically unsaturated monomers undesirably polymerize at various stages of their manufacture, processing, handling, storage, and use. A particularly troublesome problem is equipment fouling caused by polymerization in the purification stages of the production processes of such monomers. Polymerization, such as thermal polymerization, during their purification results in the loss of the monomer and a loss in production efficiency owing to the deposition of polymer in or on the equipment being used in the purification, deposits of which must be removed from time to time. A wide variety of compounds has been proposed and used for inhibiting uncontrolled and undesired polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers. However, these compounds have not been fully satisfactory. Accordingly, there has been a substantial need in the art for improved compositions for inhibiting the polymerization of such monomers during the distillation process for purifying or separating them from impurities, as well as during transport and storage. Additionally, the formation of soluble polymer leads to loss of monomer, i.e., a lower yield, and an increase in the viscosity of any tars that may be produced. The processing of the tars then requires higher temperature and work (energy cost) to remove residual monomer. Hindered nitroxyl compounds are known to be very active inhibitors of free radical polymerizations of unsaturated monomers such as styrene, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and the like. U.S. Pat. No 3,163,677 discloses N,N,O-trisubstituted hydroxylamines and N,N-disubstituted nitroxides of the formulae: wherein R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 are each an alkyl radical having 1 to 15 carbon atoms. (As used herein, the designation N-O* denotes a stable free radical wherein the asterisk is an unpaired electron.) The N,N,O-trisubstituted hydroxylamines can be used to make the N,N-disubstituted nitroxides, which are stable free radicals and are said to be useful as polymerization inhibitors. U.S. Pat. No. 3,334,103 discloses that nitroxides can be prepared from the corresponding heterocyclic amine wherein the nitrogen atom of the nitroxide group is attached to other than a tertiary carbon of an aliphatic group (i.e., the nitrogen atom forms a part of a heterocyclic nucleus). These nitroxides are said to have useful properties similar to those described for the N,N-disubstituted nitroxides of U.S. Pat. No. 3,163,677. U.S. Pat. No. 3,372,182 discloses that a great variety of N,N-disubstituted, stable, free radical nitroxides not otherwise readily available can be prepared by a simple and convenient process that comprises pyrolyzing in an inert reaction medium virtually any hydroxylamine that is susceptible to cleavage of the OC bond (e.g., tri-t-butylhydroxylamine). U.K. Patent Number 1,127,127 discloses that acrylic acid can be stabilized against polymerization by the addition thereto of a nitroxide having the essential skeletal structure: wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , and R 4 are alkyl groups and no hydrogen is bound to the remaining valencies on the carbon atoms bound to the nitrogen. The two remaining valencies that are not satisfied by R 1 to R 4 or nitrogen can also form part of a ring (e.g., 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-hydroxy-piperidine-1-oxyl). U.S. Pat. No. 3,422,144 discloses stable, free radical nitroxides of the formula: wherein R is selected from the group consisting of tertiary alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, haloaryl, carboxyaryl, alkoxyaryl, alkylthioaryl, pyridyl, and dialkylaminoaryl, and R is tertiary alkyl. These nitroxides are said to be useful as traps for reactive free radicals both in the counting of free radicals and for inhibiting oxidation and free radical polymerization. U.S. Pat. No. 3,494,930 discloses free radicals of the nitroxide type for use as initiators of free radical reactions, collectors of free radicals, polymerization inhibitors or antioxidants. They are constituted by nitrogenous bicyclic compounds in which one of the bridges comprises solely the nitroxide radical group and, in particular, by aza-9-bicyclo (3,3,1) nonanone-3-oxyl-9, and by aza-9-bicyclo (3,3,1) nonane oxyl-9. U.S. Pat. No. 3,873,564 discloses compounds and a method for assaying enzymes by adding to a medium containing an enzyme a stable free radical compound having a stable free radical functionality which, when subjected to an enzyme catalyzed reaction, changes the environment of the free radical functionality. By following the change in the electron spin resonance spectrum as affected by the change in environment, the type of enzyme and the activity of the enzyme can be determined. The compounds found useful are normally stable nitroxide radicals. Particularly nitronyl nitroxides, with the nitrogens in an imidazoline ring, are employed, having a methylene group joining the 2 position of the imidazoline ring with an asymmetric carbon atom. One of the groups bonded to the asymmetric carbon atoms has an enzyme labile functionality. Other compounds include two cyclic nitroxide containing rings joined by a chain having an enzyme labile functionality. U.S. Pat. No. 3,966,711 teaches that 2,2,7,7-tetraalkyl- and 2,7-dispiroalkylene-5-oxo-1,4-diazacycloheptanes substituted in the 4-position by mono- or tetravalent radicals are powerful light-stabilizers for organic polymers. They are said to possess higher compatibility than their 4-unsubstituted homologues, from which they can be synthesized by reactions known for N-alkylation. Preferred substituents in the 4-position are alkyl, alkylene, alkenyl, aralkyl, and esteralkyl groups. The 1-nitroxyls derived from the imidazolidines by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide or percarboxylic acids are also said to be good light stabilizers. U.S. Pat. No 4,182,658 discloses a method for preventing the polymerization of a readily polymerizable vinyl aromatic compound during distillation at elevated temperatures within a distillation apparatus that is subject to an emergency condition, such as a power outage. This method comprises force-feeding a supplemental polymerization inhibitor having a high solubility in the vinyl aromatic compound and a long duration of efficiency, into each of the distillation vessels of a conventional distillation apparatus in an amount sufficient to prevent polymerization therein. European Patent Application 0 178 168 A2 discloses a method for inhibiting the polymerization of an ,-ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid during its recovery by distillation by using a nitroxide free radical. U.S. Pat. No 4,665,185 discloses a process for the efficient preparation of nitroxyls of sterically hindered amines by the oxidation of the amine using a hydroperoxide, in the presence of a small amount of a metal ion catalyst, at moderate temperature, for a short period of time to give the nitroxyl in high yield and purity. U.S. Pat. No. 5,254,760 teaches that the polymerization of a vinyl aromatic compound, such as styrene, during distillation or purification, is very effectively inhibited by the presence of at least one stable nitroxyl compound together with at least one aromatic nitro compound. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,782 and 5,545,786 disclose that nitroxyl inhibitors in combination with some oxygen reduce the premature polymerization of vinyl aromatic monomers during the manufacturing processes for such monomers. Even small quantities of air used in combination with the nitroxyl inhibitors are said to result in vastly prolonged inhibition times for the monomers. European Patent Application 0 765 856 A1 discloses a stabilized acrylic acid composition in which the polymerization of the acrylic acid is inhibited during the distillation process for purifying or separating the acrylic acid as well as during transport and storage. The compositions comprise three components: (a) acrylic acid, (b) a stable nitroxyl radical, and (c) a dihetero-substituted benzene compound having at least one transferable hydrogen (e.g., a quinone derivative such as the monomethyl ether of hydroquinone (MEHQ)). During the distillation process, transport and storage, components (b) and (c) are present in a polymerization-inhibiting amount. During the distillation process, oxygen (d) is preferably added with components (b) and (c). According to the specification, examples of suitable nitroxide free radical compounds include di-t-butylnitroxide; di-t-amylnitroxide; 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidinyloxy; 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidinyloxy; 4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidinyloxy; 4-dimethylamino-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidinyloxy; 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidinyloxy; 4-ethanoyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidinyloxy; 2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidinyloxy; 3-amino-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidinyloxy; 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-oxa-3-azacyclopentyl-3-oxy; 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-oxa-3-pyrrolinyl-1-oxy-3-carboxylic acid; and 2,2,3,3,5,5,6,6-octamethyl-1,4-diazacyclohexyl-1,4-dioxy. WO 98/14416 discloses that the polymerization of vinyl aromatic monomers such as styrene is inhibited by the addition of a composition of a stable hindered nitroxyl radical and an oxime compound. CS-260755 B1 is directed to the preparation of 4-substituted-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine nitroxyls as olefin stabilizers. SU-334845 A1 is directed to the inhibition of the radical polymerization of oligoester acrylates using iminoxyl radical inhibitors of a given formula. SU-478838 is directed to the inhibition of the radical polymerization of oligoester acrylates and the prevention of oligomeric peroxides using a binary polymerization inhibitor comprising quinone. The foregoing are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION As used herein, the abbreviation TEMPO stands for 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy. Thus, 4-amino-TEMPO is 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy; 4-hydroxy-TEMPO is 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (also known in the art as HTEMPO); 4-oxo-TEMPO is 4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy; and so on. As mentioned above, hindered nitroxyl compounds are known to be very active inhibitors of free radical polymerizations of unsaturated monomers such as styrene, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and the like. The present invention is based upon the discovery that 4-amino-TEMPO has an unusual characteristic when used in a test that simulates a manufacturing plants loss of inhibitor feed to the distillation train. Under these conditions, most nitroxyl compounds permit the polymer to form at similar rates. But 4-amino-TEMPO permits polymer to form at significantly slower rates, as indicated by a lesser slope of a percent polymer versus time curve. This is advantageous in that it provides additional time for remedying a plant upset situation before an unacceptable amount of polymer is formed in the distillation train. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a method for inhibiting the premature polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising adding to said monomers an effective amount of an inhibitor having the structural formula: wherein R 1 and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and the portion represents the atoms necessary to form a five-, six-, or seven-membered heterocyclic ring, at least one of said atoms being a carbon atom substituted with a primary, secondary, or tertiary amino group. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method for inhibiting the premature polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising adding to said monomers an effective amount of an inhibitor having the structural formula wherein R 1 and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and heteroatom-substituted alkyl, R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and R 5 and R 6 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, and acyl. It is most preferred that the inhibitor be 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (i.e., 4-amino-TEMPO). The effective amount of the nitroxyl compound is typically about 1 to 2,000 ppm, based on the weight of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer, although amounts outside this range may be appropriate depending upon the conditions of use. The amount of the nitroxyl compound is preferably about 5 to about 1,000 ppm, based on the weight of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer. In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a composition comprising: (a) a ethylenically unsaturated monomer, and (b) an effective inhibiting amount, to prevent premature polymerization of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer, of an inhibitor having the structural formula: wherein R 1 and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and heteroatom-substituted alkyl portion represents the atoms necessary to form a five-, six-, or seven-membered heterocyclic ring, at least one of said atoms being a carbon atom substituted with a primary, secondary, or tertiary amino group. In another preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to a composition comprising: (a) a ethylenically unsaturated monomer, and (b) an effective inhibiting amount, to prevent premature polymerization of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer, of an inhibitor having the structural formula: wherein wherein R 1 and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and heteroatom-substituted alkyl, R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and R 5 and R 6 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, and acyl. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIG. 1 is a graph showing the slow rate of polymerization of compositions of the present invention after the shutoff of reboiler feed in a steady state dynamic testing system, as compared with the rates provided by other species. In the FIGURE, A is 4-amino-TEMPO, B is 4-oxo-TEMPO, C is 4-hydroxy-TEMPO, and D is TEMPO. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS As stated above, in one aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for inhibiting the premature polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising adding to said monomers an effective amount of an inhibitor having the structural formula: wherein R 1 and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and the portion represents the atoms necessary to form a five-, six-, or seven-membered heterocyclic ring, at least one of said atoms being a carbon atom substituted with a primary, secondary, or tertiary amino group. Such ring-completing atoms are preferably carbon atoms, but heteroatoms, such as O, N, or S, can also be present. The inhibitor employed in the practice of the present invention preferably has the structural formula wherein R 1 and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and heteroatom-substituted alkyl, R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and heteroatom-substituted alkyl, and R 5 and R 6 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, and acyl. Where R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , or R 4 are alkyl, they are preferably of 1 to 15 carbon atoms (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, and the like) and isomers thereof (e.g., t-butyl, 2-ethylhexyl, and the like). Where R 5 and/or R 6 are alkyl, it is preferred that they be a lower alkyl (i.e., one having one to four carbon atoms, e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and isomers thereof). Where R 5 and/or R 6 are aryl, it is preferred that they be aryl of from 6 to 10 carbon atoms, e.g., phenyl or naphthyl, which, in addition, may be substituted with non-interfering substituents, e.g., lower alkyl groups, halogens, and the like. Where R 5 and/or R 6 are acyl, it is preferred that they be acyl of the structure where R 7 is alkyl, aryl, OR 8 , or NR 8 R 9 and where R 8 and R 9 , are alkyl, aryl, or where R 10 is alkyl or aryl. Where R 7 , R 8 , R 9 , or R 10 are alkyl, they are preferably alkyl of from 1 to 15 carbon atoms, more preferably lower alkyl of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, as described above. Where R 7 , R 8 , R 9 , or R 10 are aryl, they are preferably aryl of from 6 to 10 carbon atoms, as described above. The inhibitor is preferably 4-amino-TEMPO. Although the above structural formula indicates that the cyclic nitroxides employed in the practice of the present invention are saturated piperidine derivatives, they can also be unsaturated piperidine derivatives of the formula: wherein Z 1 is C(NR 5 R 6 ). The cyclic nitroxides employed in the practice of the present invention can also be derived from five-membered rings, i.e., pyrrolidines. These compounds are of the structure: wherein Z 2 and Z 3 are substituted or unsubstituted carbon atoms, provided that at least one of Z 2 and Z 3 is CNR 5 R 6 . The other of Z 2 and Z 3 can be the same or different and can be oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, CH 2 , CHCH 3 , CO, C(CH 3 ) 2 , CHBr, CHCl, CHI, CHF, CHOH, CHCN, C(OH)CN, CHCOOH, CHCOOCH 3 , CHCOOC 2 H 5 , C(OH)COOC 2 H 5 , C(OH)COOCH 3 , C(OH)CHOHC 2 H 5 , CNR 5 R 6 , CCONR 5 R 6, CHNOH, CCHC 6 H 5 , CF 2 , CCl 2 , CBr 2 , CI 2 , and the like, where R 5 and R 6 are as described above. The cyclic nitroxides employed in the practice of the present invention can also be derived from pyrrolines and have the structure: wherein Z 4 is C(NR 7 R 8 ) where R 5 and R 6 are as described above. Another class of cyclic nitroxides that can be employed in the practice of the present invention is of the structure: wherein Z 2 and Z 3 are as described above. As stated above, R 1 and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and heteroatom-substituted alkyl. The alkyl (or heteroatom-substituted alkyl) groups R 1 through R 4 can be the same or different and preferably contain 1 to 15 carbon atoms. It is more preferred that R 1 through R 4 be lower alkyl (or heteroatom-substituted lower alkyl) of 1 to 4 carbon atoms (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and isomers thereof). Where heteroatom substituents are present, they can, for example, include halogen, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and the like. It is most preferred that all of R 1 through R 4 be methyl. Such stable nitroxide free radical compounds can be prepared by known methods. (See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,163,677; 3,334,103; 3,372,182; 3,422,144; 3,494,930; 3,502,692; 3,873,564; 3,966,711; and 4,665,185.) They are suitable for use over a wide range of temperatures. But distillation temperatures employed with the ethylenically unsaturated monomers that are stabilized by the process of the present invention typically range from about 60 C. to about 180 C., preferably from about 70 C. to about 165 C., and, more preferably, from about 80 C. to about 150 C. Such distillations are generally performed at an absolute pressure in the range of about 10 to about 1,200 mm of Hg. The ethylenically unsaturated monomer, the premature polymerization of which is an object of the present invention, can be any such monomer for which unintended polymerization during its manufacture, storage, and/or distribution is a problem. Among those monomers that will benefit from the practice of the present invention can be listed: styrene, -methylstyrene, styrene sulfonic acid, vinyltoluene, divinylbenzenes, polyvinylbenzenes, alkylated styrene, 2-vinylpyridine, and the like. The ethylenically unsaturated monomers will not necessarily be stabilized indefinitely by the presence of the nitroxide, especially when the monomers are heated as in distillation, but they can be considered to be stabilized as long as there is a measurable increase in the time for which they can be heated before the onset of polymerization. Those skilled in the art will understand that additional free radical scavengers can, if desired, be included in the stabilized compositions and the methods for preparing them that are the subject of the present invention. For example, air or O 2 , as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,782 and 5,545,786, can be added, as can the aromatic nitro compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No 5,254,760, the dihetero-substituted benzene compounds having at least one transferable hydrogen, e.g., a quinone derivative such as the mono-methyl-ether of hydroquinone disclosed in European Patent Application 0 765 856 A1, and other inhibitors, e.g., phenolics and certain inorganic salts, well-known to those skilled in the art. The polymerization inhibitor can be introduced into the monomer to be protected by any conventional method. It can be added as a concentrated solution in suitable solvents just upstream from the point of desired application by any suitable means. In addition, the inhibitor can be injected separately into the distillation train along with the incoming feed, or through separate entry points provided there is an efficient distribution of the inhibitor. Since the inhibitor is gradually depleted during the distillation operation, it is generally necessary to maintain the appropriate amount of the inhibitor in the distillation apparatus by adding additional amounts during the course of the distillation process. Adding inhibitor can be carried out either on a generally continuous basis or intermittently in order to maintain the concentration above the minimum required level. The advantages and the important features of the present invention will be more apparent from the following examples. EXAMPLES Procedure for Dynamic Reboiler Test with Feed Shut-Off Preparation of Feed Solution T-Butylcatechol (TBC) is removed from commercially available styrene by distillation under vacuum. Removal of TBC is verified by caustic titration. The desired amount of inhibitor is added to this TBC-free styrene either directly or by first making a concentrated solution of the inhibitor in TBC-free styrene followed by further dilution with TBC-free styrene. Procedure for Dynamic Reboiler Test A quantity of the Feed Solution containing inhibitor (blend) at the desired charge (stated as a wt/wt total inhibitor to styrene) is added to a round-bottom flask (the Pot) and heated to the desired temperature (usually 116 C.) and brought to reflux by adjusting the pressure/vacuum. Once the Pot contents are at temperature, a continuous stream of fresh Feed Solution is begun at a rate that will add the volume of the initial Pot solution to the Pot over a period of time called the residence time (typically one hour). At the same time that the fresh Feed Solution flow is begun, the Bottoms Stream flow is also begun. The Bottoms Stream is solution in the Pot that is removed at the same rate as the fresh Feed Solution is added. The equal flows of Feed and Bottoms streams cause the quantity in the Pot to remain constant over the time of the experiment while allowing continuous replenishment of inhibitor. This procedure simulates the way inhibitors are used in a distillation train of a plant producing vinyl monomers. The experiment continues with flow in and out of the Pot for a specified period of time, typically seven hours. Samples are collected hourly from the Bottoms Stream. These samples are analyzed for polymer content via the methanol turbidity method. The amount of polymer in the samples is an indication of effectiveness of the inhibitor being tested. Procedure for Feed Shut-Off At the end of the Reboiler Test Run (typically seven hours), a sample is collected from the Bottoms Stream. This sample corresponds to Feed Shut-Off Time0 minutes. The flows of fresh Feed Solution and Bottoms Stream are stopped. The vacuum and temperature are monitored and adjusted to maintain boiling at the desired temperature of the experiment. Samples are periodically removed from the Pot (typically every five minutes). These samples are analyzed for polymer content via the methanol turbidity method. Data during this time is used to generate the Feed Shut-Off Curve for the run. A less steep slope in the Feed Shut-Off Curve (slower rate of polymer production over time) indicates a more effective inhibiting system in the event of a loss of feed in the plant. A longer period of time before initiation of significant polymer formation is also an indication of a more effective inhibiting system in the event of a loss of feed in the plant. A preferred system will have a long delay prior to initiation of polymer formation followed by a slow rate of polymer production once initiated. The above procedure is carried out using 4-amino-TEMPO, 4-oxo-TEMPO, 4-hydroxy-TEMPO, and TEMPO as the inhibitors. The results are shown in FIG. 1 and clearly indicate the improvement that is realized by employing 4-amino-TEMPO, as opposed to equal quantities of any of the other three nitroxide inhibitors. The data for the graph of FIG. 1 are shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 Reboiler Runs of Five Different Nitroxides 116 C./One Hour Res.
