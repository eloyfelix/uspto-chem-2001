CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The present application is the national stage under 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT/JP97/00795, filed Mar. 13, 1997. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to liquid crystalline compounds, liquid crystal materials using the compounds and liquid crystal display devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to new liquid crystalline compounds, which are preferable as components of liquid crystal materials having compatibility with many liquid crystalline compounds and high optical anisotropy (may be abbreviated as n, hereinafter), liquid crystal materials having high n and excellent compatibility with the other liquid crystal compounds, and liquid crystal display devices using them. BACKGROUND ART Liquid crystal display devices are used for watches, desk-top calculators, miscellaneous measuring apparatus, metering panels for automobiles, word processors, electronic notebooks, printers, computers, television sets and the like. Liquid crystal display devices are obtained by using liquid crystal materials having properties of optical anisotropy and dielectric anisotropy (may be abbreviated as , hereinafter). The display modes are principally dynamic scattering (DS) mode, guest-host (G.H) mode, twist nematic (TN) mode, super twist nematic (STN) mode, thin film transistor (TFT) mode, surface stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal (SSFLC) mode and the like. Driving modes are static driving mode, time-division driving mode, active matrix driving mode, two-frequency driving mode and the like. In these modes, STN mode is now the most broadly used for the high display quality and low production cost. Various characteristics are required in the liquid crystal materials used for the STN mode, and the following is generally important: (1) Quick electric-optical response time, (2) Steep transparency per applied voltage, (3) Broad driving temperature range, and (4) Low driving voltage. For showing the above characteristics, the liquid crystalline compounds for constituting liquid crystal materials are required to have the following characteristics. Namely: (1) high optical anisotropy, (2) when the liquid crystal compound is added to a liquid crystal composition, the temperature region of the nematic phase does not reduce, and the phase separation such as crystal deposition is difficult in the low temperature region, (3) low viscosity, (4) chemical stability, and (5) high bend to splay elasticity constant ratio (K 33 /K 11 ). It is described more specifically hereinafter. It has been known that the viscosity of liquid crystals is an element that controls the response speed of liquid crystal molecules aligning in a display device to the electric field applied (Phys. Lett., 39A, 69 (1972). Namely, to prepare the liquid crystal composition showing high-speed response, it is preferable to prepare liquid crystal compositions by using liquid crystalline compounds having very low viscosity in large quantities. The liquid crystalline compounds having low viscosity have been earnestly studied. Such studies have brought bicyclic compounds having simple structures, such as bicyclohexanes and phenyl cyclohaxanes having the lowest viscosity. However, it is very difficult to find out the compounds having simpler structure, or lower viscosity than the compounds known now. A method for resolving the problems is to reduce the thickness of a liquid crystal cell (it may be called as d hereinafter). By reducing the cell thickness in comparison with that of conventional liquid crystal cell, high-speed response is obtained. However, considering the display quality, the adequate retardation value (dn), which is the first minimum condition described in Appl. Phys. Lett. 38(7), 497, should not deviate from the optimum value. Namely, it is needed to maintain a constant product of optical anisotropy and cell thickness and to reduce the cell thickness. Accordingly, it needs to make higher the n of liquid crystal materials by using as a component the liquid crystalline compound having a very higher optical anisotropy value than that of conventional compounds. The steepness of applied voltage to transparency characteristics (may be abbreviated as V-T characteristics, hereinafter) is highly caused by the bend to splay elasticity constant ratio K 33 /K 11 (Proc. of Japan Display, 388 (1986)). According to the report, the liquid crystal having a high elasticity constant ratio has steeper V-T characteristics. By using liquid crystal materials having good V-T characteristics, liquid crystal display having higher display quality can be attained. For the availability in a broader temperature region, liquid crystal compositions having a nematic phase at a low temperature are especially demanded. At the low temperature region, liquid crystal compositions, which do not deposit crystals and do not show a smectic phase, are naturally demanded. To fit liquid crystal materials with many characteristics required of each display device, a mixture of several kinds or twenties of liquid crystalline compounds constitutes a liquid crystal material. Accordingly, it is very important that the liquid crystalline compounds used have high compatibility with the other liquid crystalline compounds at the low temperature region. It becomes important problem to reduce consumption power of liquid crystal display devices recently, so that it is necessary to lower the driving power of the devices. To lower the driving power, it is needed to reduce the threshold voltage (may be abbreviated as Vth, hereinafter). The threshold voltage is a function of a dielectric anisotropy value, and the following relation is reported in Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst., 12, 57 (1970). V th (K/0) , wherein K is an elastic constant and 0 is a dierectric constant in vacuum. In the relation, when the liquid crystal materials having low driving power is demanded, it is needed to use liquid crystal materials having a high dielectric anisotropy value. Since liquid crystal display devices are frequently used at a high temperature, for example, under severe conditions such as outdoors, the liquid crystalline compounds used for liquid crystal compositions should have sufficiently high chemical stability. It is further important to have a little temperature dependence as an important factor in several characteristics. The practical liquid crystal display devices must be maintained with various surroundings, at an especially broad temperature region (for example, 20120 C.) not so as to largely change the display quality. To satisfy the demand, it is necessary to use liquid crystal materials having very little temperature dependence of various characteristic values. The liquid crystal materials for STN display devices have been studied, and many excellent compounds have been developed. As a compound having a particularly high elasticity constant ratio K 33 /K 11 , an alkenyl compound has been obtained and a liquid crystal material having steep V-T characteristics has been practically used. However, at the present time, only a few example of liquid crystalline compound having remarkably high n has been known and practically used. Compounds having high n that have been first practically used are tolan compounds as shown by formula (10), which have been disclosed by J. Malthete et al (Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst., 23, 233 (1973)). The tolan compounds have relatively high n and now are practically used. However, the optical anisotropy value is 0.20 and it is not enough for practical use. To resolve the problem, the tolan derivative having alkyl groups as shown by formula (11) has been developed (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. sho-64-879) for increasing the polarization ratio. However, in spite of the increased optical anisotropy value (0.20), the compatibility with the other many liquid crystal compounds is very low, and what is more the practical use of the compounds is limited by lack of chemical stability. To obtain a compound having nematic phase at a high temperature, a compound represented by formula (12) has been prepared (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. hei 2-83340). Although the compound has a high optical anisotropy value and a high clearing point, the compatibility with the other many liquid crystalline compounds is very low, so that the compound is very impractical. To resolve the problem, the compound represented by formula (13) has been prepared (EP581272A). The compound improves the compatibility at a low temperature, but it is not enough. Further, the insertion of a fluorine atom increases the viscosity, which is unfavarable.

4-(2-(3-fluoro-4-heptylphenyl)ethynyl)-1-(2-(3-fluoro-4-heptylphenyl)ethynyl)benzene Any acetylene derivatives represented by general formula (1) can be prepared by well-known method of organic synthetic chemistry. For example, methods described in Organic Synthesis (published by John Wiley and Sons Inc.), Organic reactions (published by John Wiley and Sons Inc.), or Jikken Kagaku Kouza (published by Maruzen) can be suitably combined to easily synthesize the derivatives. By common methods of organic synthetic chemistry, the compounds of formula (1) can be easily prepared, for example, by the following example. In the following, H 1 , H 2 , H 3 , H 4 , H 5 , H 6 , H 7 , H 8 , H 9 , H 10 , H 11 and H 12 represent the same meaning as described above, and Hal represents a bromine atom or an iodine atom. The acetylene derivatives of formula (1) can be prepared by repeating twice alkyne production reaction. In that case, there is no problem by using the most performable Castro reaction (J. Org. Chem., 28, 2163 (1963)). When R 1 and Y 1 are the same, it is unnecessary to conduct a two step reaction. The acetylene derivatives of formula (1) can be prepared by one step. Halogenated compound (15) can be reacted with phenyl acetylene derivative (14) under basic conditions in the presence of a catalyst to obtain tolan derivative (16). As the solvent, well-known amine compounds such as diethylamine, diethylaniline, triethylamine can be used. As the catalyst, a Pd type or Ni type compound can be preferably used. For simple operation of the first step, the compound of formula (15) in which two halogen atoms are different at the 1- and 4-positions is used. When a 4-iodo-1-bromo benzene derivative is used, the first step reaction selectively proceeds on the iodine atom, so that the production of three rings compound can be depressed. Otherwise, the compound should be removed at the next step reaction. The compound of formula (17) is reacted with tolan derivative (16) under the same condition as described in the above, and the acetylene derivative of formula (1) can be produced. The phenyl acetylene derivative of formula (14) or (17) used in the above reaction can be easily produced by the following method. Acetylene derivative (19), which is protected at the one end side by a protection group such as a trimethylsilyl group (TMS), is reacted with halogen compound (18) to obtain an addition compound (20), and then the protection group is removed to obtain the phenylacetylene derivative of formula (14) or (17). As acetylene derivative (19) protected at the one end, trimethylsilylacetylene, 3-methyl-3-hydroxy-1-butyne or the like can be preferably used. Moreover, the phenylacetylene of formula (14) can be prepared from acetophenone derivative (21). The carbonyl group of the acetophenone derivative of formula (21) is chlorinated to obtain the 1,1-dichloroethane derivative of formula (22), and then the derivative is reacted in the presence of a strong base by dehydrohochlorination reaction to obtain phenyl acetylene derivative (14). The compounds of formulas (14) and (17), wherein R 1 or Y 1 is an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, an alkoxyalkyl group, a halogen-substituted alkyl group, a halogenated alkoxy group, a halogen-substituted alkoxyalkyl group, a thioalkyl group, alkyldimethylsilyl group, or alkyldihydroxy-silyl group, can be produced by the common method of iodination or bromination of the 4-position of the corresponding replaced benzene. The compounds of formulas (14) and (17), wherein R 1 or Y 1 is an alkenyl group, an alkynyl group, an alkenyloxy group, an alkynyloxy group, a halogen-substituted alkenyl group, or a halogenated alkynyl group, can be preferably produced by the following method. When R 1 or Y 1 is an alkenyl group or a halogen-substituted alkenyl group, compound (19) is reacted with dihalogeno compound (15) by the method described above to obtain compound (23), then the resulting compound is reacted with a Grignard reagent R 1 or a lithium compound by a cross coupling reaction to obtain compound (24), and then the protection group is removed to obtain compound (14). Instead of R 1 I, Y 1 I can be used to produce compound (17). When R 1 or Y 1 is an alkenyloxy group or an alkynyloxy group, alkynyl parts are introduced into compound (25), in which the hydroxy group of 4-halogenophenol has been protected by a tetrahydropyranyl (THP) group, by the said method, the THP group is removed under acidic conditions, and the resulting compound (26) is reacted with alkenylhalide or alkynylhahide, and after removing TMS, compound (14) is obtained. Using the same method, compound (17) can be obtained. Moreover, when R 1 or Y 1 is an alkynyl group or a halogen-substituted alkynyl group, the compound can be obtained by the following method. After compound (15) reacted with trimethylsilylacetylene to obtain compound (27), a TMS group is selectively removed to obtain compound (28). The compound is reacted with alkylhalide or halogen-substituted alkylhalide by a common method under basic conditions, and the TMS group of a protection group is removed to obtain compound (14). Compound (17) can be obtained by the same method.

Clark and Lagerwall showed that the use of ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLCs) in very thin cells leads to optoelectric switching or display elements having response times faster by a factor of up to 1000 than those of the conventional TN (twisted nematic) cells (see, for example, EP-A 0 032 362). On the basis of these and other favorable properties, for example the possibility of bistable switching and the contrast, which is virtually independent of viewing angle, FLCs are in principle highly suited to applications such as computer displays. For the use of FLCs in electrooptical or completely optical assemblies there is a need either for compounds which form tilted or orthogonal smectic phases and which are themselves optically active, or else for compounds which, although forming such smectic phases are not themselves optically active, can be doped with optically active compounds to induce ferroelectric smectic phases. The desired phase should at the same time be stable over as wide as possible a temperature range. Obtaining a good contrast ratio in electrooptical assemblies necessitates a uniform planar orientation of the liquid crystals. Good orientation in the S A and S* c phase can be achieved, for example, when the phase sequence of the liquid-crystal mixture with decreasing temperature is as follows: isotropicN*S A S* C A precondition is that the pitch of the helix in the N* phase is very large (greater than 10 m) or, even better, is fully compensated (see, for example: T. Matsumoto et al., Proc. of the 6th Int. Display Research Conf., Japan Display, Sep. 30-Oct. 2, 1986, Tokyo, Japan, pp. 468-470; M. Murakami et al., ibid., pp. 344-347). This is done, for example, by adding one or more optically active dopes which induce, say, a right-handed helix to the chiral liquid-crystal mixture which in the N* phase has a left-handed helix, in amounts such that the helix is compensated. For the use of the SSFLCD effect (Surface Stabilized Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal Display) of Clark and Lagerwall for uniform planar orientation a further precondition is that the pitch in the smectic C* phase is substantially greater than the thickness of the display element ( Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst. 1983, 94, 213 and ibid. 1984, 114, 151. The optical response time s of ferroelectric liquid-crystal systems, which should be as short as possible, depends on the rotational viscosity of the system mPas, on the spontaneous polarization P s nC/cm 2 and on the electric field strength E V/m in accordance with the relationship Since the field strength E is determined by the electrode separation in the electrooptical component and by the applied voltage, the ferroelectric display medium must be of low viscosity and must have a high spontaneous polarization in order for a short response time to be obtained. Finally, requirements in addition to thermal, chemical and photochemical stability are for a small optical anisotropy n and a small positive or, preferably, negative dielectric anisotropy (see, for example: S. T. Lagerwall et al., Ferroelectric Liquid Crystals for Displays, SID Symposium, Oct. Meeting 1985, San Diego, Calif., USA). The entirety of these requirements can only be met with mixtures of two or more components. The basis of these mixtures (or matrix) is preferably formed by compounds which as far as possible themselves already have the desired phase sequence INS A S C . Further components are often added to the mixture in order to lower the melting point and to broaden the S C phase and usually the N phase as well, for inducing the optical activity, for pitch compensation and for adapting the optical and dielectric anisotropy, as far as possible without increasing the rotational viscosity, for example. Ferroelectric liquid-crystal displays can also be operated by utilizing the DHF (Distorted Helix Formation) effect or the PSFLCD (Pitch Stabilized Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal Display, also called SBFShort Pitch Bistable Ferroelectric) effect. The DHF effect was described by B. I. Ostrovski in Advances in Liquid Crystal Research and Applications , Oxford/Budapest, 1980, 469 ff. and the PSFLCD effect is described in DE-A 39 20 625 and EP-A 0 405 346. In contrast to the SSFLCD effect, utilizing these effects requires a liquid-crystalline material with a short S C pitch. Derivatives of phenanthrene (which here also includes 9,10-dihydrophenanthrenes) have already been described as liquid crystals or as components of liquid-crystalline mixtures: Azomethines having a phenanthrene or 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene unit are known from J. Chem. Soc. 1958, 552 and J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. II 1982, 465-472; keto derivatives of 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene are known from Chem. Ind. London 1974, 615, Prod Int. Liq. Cryst. Conf. 1973, 397 and Tetrahedron 1981, 37, 2815; carboxyl derivatives of 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene are known from DD-WP 153 826 and Z. Chem. 1983, 23, 21-22; 2,7-bis(alkoxy)phenanthrenes are known from Nippon Kagaku Kaishi 1980, 250; and phenanthrene derivatives having one or more fluorine substituents in positions 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 are known from DE-A 19 500 768. However, since the developmentof ferroelectric liquid-crystal mixtures in particularcan in no way be regarded as complete, the manufacturers of displays are interested in a very wide variety of components for mixtures. One of the reasons for this is that only the interaction of the liquid-crystalline mixtures with the individual components of the display device or of the cells (for example the alignment layer) allows conclusions to be drawn about the quality of the liquid-crystalline mixtures too. The object of the present invention was therefore to provide compounds which are suitable in liquid-crystalline mixtures for improving the profile of properties of these mixtures. It has now been found, surprisingly, that phenanthrene derivatives of the formula (I) are particularly suitable for use in liquid-crystal mixtures. The invention therefore provides compounds of the formula (I) in which the symbols and indices have the following meanings: G is CHFCH 2 or CFCH; E 1 , E 2 , E 3 , E 4 , E 5 and E 6 are identical or different and are CH, CF or N, with the proviso that E 4 and E 5 cannot simultaneously be N; R 1 and R 2 are identical or different and are a) hydrogen, F, Cl, CF 3 , OCF 3 or CN, b) a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical (with or without an asymmetric carbon atom) having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, where b1) one or more nonadjacent and nonterminal CH 2 groups can be replaced by O, S, COO, OCO, OCOO or Si(CH 3 ) 2 , and/or b2) one or more CH 2 groups can be replaced by CHCH, CC, cyclopropane-1,2-diyl, 1,4-phenylene, 1,4-cyclohexylene or 1,3-cyclopentylene, and/or b3) one or more H atoms can be-replaced by F and/or Cl, and/or b4) the terminal CH 3 group can be replaced by one of the following chiral groups (optically active or racemic): with the proviso that only one of the radicals R 1 , R 2 can be hydrogen, F, Cl, CF 3 , OCF 3 or CN; R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 and R 7 are identical or different and are a) hydrogen, b) a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical (with or without an asymmetric carbon atom) having 1 to 16 carbon atoms, where b1) one or more nonadjacent and nonterminal CH 2 groups can be replaced by O, and/or b2) one or two CH 2 groups can be replaced CHCH, c) R 4 and R 5 together are alternatively (CH 2 ) 4 or (CH 2 ) 5 , if they are attached to an oxirane, dioxolane, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, butyrolactone or valerolactone system; M 1 , M 2 , M 3 and M 4 are identical or different and are COO, OCO, COS, SCO, CSO, OCS, CH 2 O, OCH 2 , CH 2 S, SCH 2 , CHCH, CC, CH 2 CH 2 COO, OCOCH 2 CH 2 or a single bond; A 1 , A 2 , A 3 and A 4 are identical or different and are 1,4-phenylene in which one or more H atoms can be replaced by F, Cl and/or CN, pyrazine-2,5-diyl, in which one or two H atoms can be replaced by F, Cl and/or CN, pyridazine-3,6-diyl in which one or two H atoms can be replaced by F, Cl and/or CN, pyridine-2,5-diyl in which one or more H atoms can be replaced by F, Cl and/or CN, pyrimidine-2,5-diyl in which one or two H atoms can be replaced by F, Cl and/or CN, 1,4-cyclohexylene in which one or two H atoms can be replaced by CN, F and/or CH 3 , 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2,5-diyl, 1,3-dioxane-2,5-diyl, 1,3-dithiane-2,5-diyl, 1,3-thiazole-2,4-diyl, in which one H atom can be replaced by F, Cl and/or CN, 1,3-thiazole-2,5-diyl in which one H atom can be replaced by F, Cl and/or CN, thiophene-2,4-diyl, in which one H atom can be replaced by F, Cl and/or CN, thiophene-2,5-diyl in which one or two H atoms can be replaced by F, Cl and/or CN, piperazine-1,4-diyl or piperazine-2,5-diyl or 1-(C 1 -C 4 )alkyl-1-silacyclohexylene-1,4-diyl; a, b, c and d are zero or one, with the proviso that the compound of the formula (I) may contain no more than four ring systems having five or more members. The provision of compounds of the formula (I) considerably broadens, in general terms, the palette of liquid-crystalline substances which from a variety of applications-related standpoints are suitable for the preparation of liquid-crystalline mixtures. In this connection the compounds of the formula (I) possess a broad scope of application. Depending on the selection of the substituents they can be used as base materials forming the predominant part of liquid-crystalline phase compositions; or alternatively, compounds of the formula (I) can also be added to liquid-crystalline base materials from other classes of compounds, in order for example to influence the dielectric and/or optical anisotropy of such a dielectric material and/or to optimize its threshold voltage and/or its viscosisty. The compounds of the formula (I) are particularly suitable for addition even in small amounts for influencing the dielectric anisotropy (As) toward higher negative values. The novel compounds of the formula (I) are particularly suitable for use in FLC mixtures for ferroelectric switching and/or display devices which are operated in inverse mode.

R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 and R 7 are, with particular preference, identical or different and are a) hydrogen, b) a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical (with or without an asymmetric carbon atom) having 1 to 14 carbon atoms, where b1) one nonterminal CH 2 group can be replaced by O, and/or c) R 4 and R 5 together are alternatively (CH 2 ) 4 or (CH 2 ) 5 , if they are attached to an oxirane, dioxolane, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, butyrolactone or valerolactone system.

Very particular preference is given to the following compounds of the formula (Ia) to (If): in which R 1 , R 2 , M 1 , M 3 , A 1 and A 3 have the meanings and preferences stated above. The compounds according to the invention are prepared by methods known per se from the literature, as are described in standard works on organic synthesis, for example Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart. The preparation is carried out under reaction conditions which are known and suitable for said reactions. Use may also be made here of variants which are known per se but which are not mentioned here in any more detail. If desired, the starting materials can also be formed in situ, by not isolating them from the reaction mixture but instead immediately converting them further into the compounds of the formula (I). By way of example, synthesis routes to 9-fluorophenanthrene, 9-fluoro-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene and compounds of the formula (I) are indicated in schemes 1 to 6, although other methods are also conceivable and possible. The preparation of 2-mono- and 2,7-disubstituted phenanthrene quinones (Scheme 1,5) where X 1 , X 2 H, Br, I, NO 2 , NH 2 has been described on several occasions, for example in Beilsteins Handbuch der organischen Chemie, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Vol. 7 (main and supplementary series) and in the literature cited therein. The positional isomers which may possibly be formed in the course of the rearrangement of 5,7-dihydrodibenzc,eoxepines into 9,10-dihydro-9-phenanthroles (reaction step ii in Scheme 4) and in the dehydrohalogenation of 9,10-difluoro-9,10-dihydrophenanthrenes (reaction step vi in Scheme 5) with asymmetric substitution (X 1 X 2 and/or R x R y ) can be resolved subsequently or in one of the subsequent stages by means, for example, of column chromatography. An alternative synthesis route (Scheme 5) starts from commercial phenanthrene quinone and leads via 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene-9,10-diol and 9,10-difluoro-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene to compounds of the formula (I). Scheme 6 indicates by way of example the synthesis of asymmetrically substituted compounds of the formula (I) via the corresponding biphenyl-2-carbaldehyde and 9,9-difluoro-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene. The group R x is equivalent to the group R 1 (A 1 M 1 ) a (A 2 M 2 ) b or an appropriate unprotected or protected precursor thereof which in later steps can be converted into this group by methods which are known per se and are familiar to the skilled worker. The group R y is equivalent to the group (M 3 A 3 ) c (M 4 A 4 ) d R 2 or an appropriate unprotected or protected precursor thereof which in later steps can be converted into this group by methods which are known per se and are familiar to the skilled worker. The radical R x or R y is synthesized by methods which are known per se and are familiar to the skilled worker. Its preparation takes place under reaction conditions which are known and suitable for said reactions. In this context it is also possible to make use of variants which are known per se and are not mentioned in any more detail here. Reference may be made, for example, to DE-A 23 44 732, 24 50 088, 24 29 093, 25 02 94, 26 36 684, 27 01 591 and 27 52 975 for compounds with 1,4-cyclohexylene or 1,4-phenylene groups; to DE-A 26 41 724 for compounds with pyrimidine-2,5-diyl groups; to DE-A 40 26 223, EP-A 0 391 203 and German Patent Application 196 48 171.6 for compounds with pyridine-2,5-diyl groups; to DE-A 32 31 462 for compounds with pyridazine-3,6-diyl groups; and to EP-A 309 514 for compounds with 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2,5-diyl groups and to EP-A 0 630 903 for compounds with 1-sila-1,4-cyclohexylen groups. Reference may additionally be made to Tetrahedron Lett. 1981, 37, 2815-1821, ibid. 1985, 26, 61-64 and Z. Chem. 1983, 23, 21-22 for the introduction of alkyl and acyl substituents, to Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996, 6, 481-484 for the introduction of bromine, chlorine and carboxyl substituents into positions 2 and 7 of a 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene structure. The preparation of disubstituted pyridines, disubstituted pyrazines, disubstituted pyrimidines and disubstituted pyradazines is also given, for example, in the corresponding volumes of the series The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds by A. Weissberger and E. C. Taylor (editors). Dioxane derivatives are judiciously prepared by reaction of a corresponding aldehyde (or a reactive derivative thereof) with a corresponding 1,3-diol (or a reactive derivative thereof), preferably in the presence of an inert solvent, such as benzene or toluene, and/or in the presence of a catalyst, for example strong acid such as sulfuric acid, benzene- or 4-toluenesulfonic acid, at temperatures between about 20 and about 150 C., preferably between 80 C. and 120 C. Primarily suitable as reactive derivatives of the starting materials are acetals. Some of said aldehydes and 1,3-diols and their reactive derivatives are known while some can be prepared without difficulty by standard methods of organic chemistry from compounds known from the literature. For example, the aldehydes are obtainable by oxidation of corresponding alcohols or by reduction of nitrites or corresponding carboxylic acids or derivatives thereof, and the diols by reduction of corresponding diesters. 2,3-Difluorophenylboronic acid and 4-alkoxy-2,3-difluorophenylboronic acids are described, for example, in WO 96/00710; 4-benzyloxy-2,3-difluorophenylboronic acid as well can be obtained analogously (WO 96/01246). Examples of 4-alkyl-substituted 2,3-difluorophenylboronic acids are given in EP-A 0 363 458. Compounds in which an aromatic ring is substituted by at least one F atom can also be obtained from the corresponding diazonium salts by replacement of the diazonium group with a fluorine atom, for example by the methods of Balz and Schiemann. As far as the linking of ring systems to one another is concerned, reference may be made, for example, to: N. Miyaura, T. Yanagai and A. Suzuki in Synthetic Communications 1981, 11, 513-519; DE-C39 30 663; M. J. Sharp, W. Cheng, V. Snieckus in Tetrahedron Lett. 1987, 28, 5093; G. W. Gray in J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II 1989, 2041 and Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst. 1989, 172, 165, ibid. 1991, 204, 43 and ibid. 1991, 204, 91; N. A. Bumagin; E. V. Luzikova, I. P. Letskaya, Zh. Org.

Seto et al. in Liq. Cryst. 1990, 8, 861-870 for compounds containing CC bridges. The syntheses of 1-azaphenanthrene-5,6-dione, 4-azaphenanthrene-5,6-dione, 1,7-phenanthroline-5,6-dione and 4,7-phenanthroline-5,6-dione as starting materials for compounds of the formula (I) in accordance with Scheme 5 are described in Synth. Commun. 1996, 26, 2197-2203, J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. II 1996, 7, 1429-1433 and the literature cited therein. Because of their property of being strong transition metal complexing agents, analogous derivatives of 1,10-phenanthroline are less suitable as constituents of liquid-crystalline mixtures for use in electrooptical assemblies. Esters of the formula (I) can also be obtained by esterification of corresponding carboxylic acids (or reactive derivatives thereof) using alcohols or phenols (or reactive derivatives thereof). Another suitable example of a method for this purpose is the DCC method (DCCdicyclohexylcarbodiimide; cf.: B. Neises, W. Steglich, Angew. Chem. 1978, 90, 556-557). The corresponding carboxylic acids and alcohols and phenols are either known or can be prepared analogously to known processes. Particularly suitable reactive derivatives of said carboxylic acids are the acid halides, especially the chlorides and bromides, and also the anhydrides, including mixed anhydrides, for example, azides or esters, especially alkyl esters having 1-4 carbon atoms in the alkyl group. Particularly suitable reactive derivatives of said alcohols and phenols are the corresponding metal alcoholates or phenolates, preferably of an alkali metal such as sodium or potassium. The esterification is advantageously carried out in the presence of an inert solvent. Particularly suitable solvents are ethers, such as diethyl ether, di-n-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or anisole, ketones, such as acetone, butanone or cyclohexanone, amides, such as dimethylformamide or hexamethylphosphoramide, hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene or xylene, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as tetrachloromethane, dichloromethane or tetrachloroethylene, and sulfoxides, such as dimethyl sulfoxide or sulfolane. Esters of the formula (I) can also be obtained from the corresponding carboxylic acid salts (preparation by analogy with DE-C 4304756 ) by reaction with phenols in accordance with DE-A 4427198. Ethers of the formula (I) are also obtainable by etherification of corresponding hydroxy compounds, preferably corresponding phenols, where the hydroxy compound is judiciously first of all converted into a corresponding metal derivative, for example into the corresponding alkali metal alcoholate or alkali metal phenolate by treatment with NaH, NaNH 2 , NaOH, KOH, Na 2 CO 3 or K 2 CO 3 . This product can then be reacted with the corresponding alkyl halide, alkylsulfonate or dialkyl sulfate, judiciously in an inert solvent such as acetone, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulfoxide, or else with an excess of aqueous or aqueous-alcoholic NaOH or KOH at temperatures of between about 20 C. and 100 C. Also suitable for etherification, for example, is the reaction of phenols with alcohols using diethyl azodicarboxylate and triphenylphosphine in accordance with the so-called Mitsunobu method (cf.: 0. Mitsunobu, Synthesis 1981, 1-28 or L. Navailles, H. T. Nguyen, P. Barois, Liq. Cryst. 1996, 20, 653-664). The corresponding alcohols, alkyl halides, alkylsulfonates and dialkyl sulfates are either known or can be prepared in analogy to known methods.

The compounds according to formula (I) are especially useful for operating in smectic and nematic liquid crystal mixtures, in the case of nematic mixtures preferably for active matrix displays (AM-LCD).-(e.g. C.

L{umlaut over (u)}der, Recent Progress of AM LCDs, Proceedings of the 15 th International Displays Research Conference, 1995, p.9-12) and in-plane-switching displays (IPS-LCD), in the case of smectic liquid crystal mixtures peferably for chirally inclined smectic (ferroelectric or antiferroelectric) displays, for ELB displays (electrically controlled birefringence) and for electroclinic displays. The invention also provides for the use of compounds of the formula (I) in liquid-crystal mixtures, preferably smectic and nematic mixtures, especially ferroelectric mixtures. Especially preferred is the use in ferroelectric mixtures, which are operated in inverse mode. The invention additionally provides liquid-crystal mixtures, preferably smectic and nematic mixtures, especially preferred ferroelectric and antiferroelectric, especially ferroelectric mixtures, comprising one or more compounds of the formula (I). The smectic and nematic liquid crystal mixtures are preferable applicable for electrooptic displays, in the case of nematic mixtures especially for active matrix displays and in-plane-switching displays (IPS-LCD), in the case of smectic liquid crystal mixtures for ELB displays, for electroclinic displays and chirally inclined smectic (ferroelectric or antiferroelectric) displays. The novel liquid-crystal mixtures generally contain from 2 to 35, preferably from 2 to 25 and, with particular preference, from 2 to 20 components. They generally contain from 0.01 to 80% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 60% by weight, particularly preferably from 0.1 to 30% by weight, of one or more, preferably from 1 to 10, particularly preferably from 1 to 5, very particularly preferably from 1 to 3, of the novel compounds of the formula (I). Further components of liquid-crystal mixtures comprising novel compounds of the formula (I) are preferably selected from known compounds having smectic and/or nematic and/or cholesteric phases. These include, for example: derivatives of phenylpyrimidine as described, for example, in WO 86/06401 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,874,542, meta-substituted aromatic compounds having a six-membered ring, as described, for example, in EP-A 0 578 054, silicon compounds as described, for example, in EP-A 0 355 008, mesogenic compounds having only one side chain, as described, for example in EP-A 0 541 081, pyridylpyrimidines as described, for example, in WO 92/12974 and German Patent Application 196 48 171.6, hydroquinone derivatives as described, for example, EP-A 0 603 786, phenylbenzoates as described, for example, in P. Keller, Feffoelectrics 1984, 58, 3 and J. W. Goodby et al., Liquid Crystals and Ordered Fluids , Vol.4, New York, 1984, and thiadiazoles as described, for example, in EP-B 0 309 514. Examples of suitable chiral, nonracemic dopes are: optically active phenylbenzoates as described, for example, in P. Keller, Ferroelectrics 1984, 58, 3 and J. W. Goodby et al., Liquid Crystals and Ordered Fluids, Vol. 4, New York, 1984, optically active oxirane ethers as described, for example, in EP-A 0 263 437 and WO-A 93/13093, optically active oxirane esters as described, for example, in EP-A 0 292 954, optically active dioxolane ethers as described, for example, in EP-A 0 351 746, optically active dioxolane esters as described, for example, in EP-A 0 361 272, optically active tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic esters as described, for example, in EP-A 0 355 561, and optically active 2-fluoroalkyl ethers as described, for example, in EP-A 0 237 007 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,051,506. Suitable additional components of mixtures are set out in particular in the international patent application WO-A 97/04039, which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. Preferred additional components of FLC mixtures used in the inverse mode are: phenanthrenederivatives of the formula (II), fluoropyridines of the formula (III), difluorophenylene derivatives of the formula (IV), meta-substituted aromatic compounds of the formula (V), 4-cyanocyclohexyls of the formula (VI), 1,3,4-thiadiazoles of the formula (VII) where the symbols and indices have the following meanings: X 1 and X 2 are identical or different and independently of one another are CH, CF or N, Y is F, CF 3 oder R R and R are identical or different and independently of one another are as defined for R 1 and R 2 in formula (I), A and M are identical or different and independently of one another are defined as in formula (I), and a,b,c,d are identical or different and independently of one another are 0 or 1, with the proviso that the compounds may contain no more than four ring systems and must, with the exception of the formula (II), contain at least two ring systems. The mixtures can in turn be employed in electrooptical or fully optical elements, for example display elements, switching elements, light modulators, elements for image processing and/or signal processing or, generally, in the area of nonlinear optics. The novel ferroelectric liquid-crystal mixtures are particularly suitable for operation in the so-called inverse mode or V (min) mode (see for example: J. C. Jones, M. J. Towler, J. R. Hughes, Displays 1993, 14, No. 2, 86-93; M. Koden, Ferroelectrics 1996, 179, 121-129). In addition the mixtures are suitable for field treatment, i.e. for operation in the quasi-bookshelf geometry (QBG) (see, for example: H. Rieger et al., SID 91 Digest, Anaheim 1991, 396). Liquid-crystalline mixtures comprising compounds of the formula (I) are particularly suitable for use in electrooptical switching and display devices (displays). These displays are usually constructed in such a way that a liquid-crystal layer is enclosed on both sides by layers which are usually, in this sequence starting from the LC layer, at least one alignment layer, electrodes and a limiting sheet (for example of glass). In addition, they comprise spacers, adhesive frames, polarizers andfor color displaysthin color-filter layers. Other possible components are antireflection, passivation, compensation and barrier layers and electric nonlinear elements, such as thin-film transistors (TFTs) and metal-insulator-metal (MIM) elements. The structure of liquid-crystal displays has already been described in detail in relevant monographs (see, for example: E. Kaneko, Liquid Crystal TV Displays: Principles and Applications of Liquid Crystal Displays . KTK Scientific Publishers, 1987). The invention therefore additionally provides a switching and/or display device, preferably a smectic or nematic, especially a ferroelectric device, comprising a liquid-crystal mixture which comprises one or more compounds of the formula (I). In devices, which contain nematic liquid crystal mixtures, active matrix displays and in-plane-switching displays (IPS-LCD) are preferred. In devices, which contain smectic liquid crystal mixtures, ECB displays (electrically controlled birefringence), electroclinic displays and chirally inclined smectic (ferroelectric or antiferroelectric) displays are preferred. Such devices are e.g. applicable for computer displays or in chip-cards. The novel switching and/or display device is preferably operated in normal mode or inverse mode. Ferroelectric switching and/or display devices operated by multiplex addressing can inter alia be operated in two different ways, the normal mode or the inverse mode (or V (min) mode). The difference between the two is in the addressing scheme and in the various requirements regarding the dielectric tensor of the FLC material, i.e. the FLC mixture. An overview is given, for example, by J. C. Jones et al. in Displays 1993, 14, No. 2, 86-93, referred to below as Jones, and M. Koden in Ferroelectrics 1996, 179, 121-129, and the literature set out therein. The response characteristics of an FLC device can be generally represented in a diagram in which the driver voltage (V) is plotted horizontally and the width of the driving pulse (, time) is plotted vertically (see for example Jones, FIGS.4,8,10 and11). A response curve is determined experimentally and divides the V, area into a switching region and a nonswitching region. Normally, the pulse width becomes shorter when the voltage is increased. It is this behavior which characterizes the mode known as normal (see for example Jones, FIG. 4 ). With appropriate materials, however, the V curve has a minimum (at the voltage V (min) ), as can be seen in Jones, for example, in FIGS.8,10and11. This minimum comes about as the result of the superimposition of dielectric and ferroelectric twisting. FLC devices are operated in the inverse mode if the sum of the row driver voltage and column driver voltage in the operating temperature range is higher than the minimum on the V, curve, i.e. V (row) V (column) V (min) .

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to novel liquid crystalline compounds, liquid crystal compositions comprising the compound, and liquid crystal display devices fabricated by using the composition. BACKGROUND ART Display devices employing such characteristics as optical (refractive) anisotropy or dielectric anisotropy of liquid crystal substances have widely been utilized for watches, is tabletop calculators, or the likes. While the liquid crystal phase exhibited by the liquid crystal substances includes nematic liquid crystal phase, smectic liquid crystal phase, and cholesteric liquid crystal phase, nematic liquid crystal phase is most general in practical use. Display mode employing the nematic liquid crystal phase includes TN (twisted nematic) type, DS (dynamic scattering) type, guest-host type, and DAP (deformation of aligned phase) type. As liquid crystalline compounds (including liquid crystal substances and compounds which do not exhibit liquid crystal phase but are effective as component of liquid crystal compositions) used for these display modes, many compounds have heretofore been developed. However, no compounds have been filled in display devices in a state of single component and actually used up to now. The reason is that whereas, as the liquid crystalline compounds expected to be used as liquid crystal materials for display devices, compounds which exhibit a liquid crystal phase at a temperature in a range as wide as possible with room temperature, at which display devices are used at a highest frequency, being its center are desired, the compounds must be sufficiently stable against environmental factors at the time of use and the compounds must have physical properties sufficient to make display devices be driven, liquid it crystalline compounds which satisfy these requirements as single compound have not yet been found. Accordingly, at present, a plural number of liquid crystalline compounds are mixed to prepare compositions having such characteristics as described above and the compositions are put to practical use as liquid crystal material. While it is generally considered to be necessary that these liquid crystal compositions are stable against moisture, light, heat, and air which usually exist under conditions wherein the compositions are used, that the compositions are stable against electric field and electromagnetic radiation, and that liquid crystalline compounds to be mixed to prepare the compositions are stable against each other, and are safe, the following characteristics are further desired depending on the purposes of the compositions. For instance, liquid crystal compositions for liquid crystal display devices of TN mode which are most widely used are considered to be necessary to have a low viscosity, wide temperature range of liquid crystal phase, and large dielectric anisotropy value () in addition to the characteristics described above. In order to satisfy the requirement, attempts in which liquid crystal compositions having each different characteristics are mixed have been made. However, when simple substances of liquid crystalline compound having varied characteristics are mixed, liquid crystal compositions to be obtained come to have a large dependency on frequency and temperature, and production of display devices which enable uniform display regardless of the changes in usage conditions becomes impossible. As components of liquid crystal compositions for nematic display mode, liquid crystalline compounds having a rod-like molecular structure in which six-membered rings are linearly linked are ordinarily used, and characteristics such as temperature range of liquid crystal phase and viscosity of the compounds are known to be approximately determined by the number of the six-membered rings described above. That is, as the number of six-membered ring decreases, the viscosity generally reduces but the temperature range of liquid crystal phase narrows. On the contrary, as the number of six-membered ring increases, the viscosity increases but the temperature range of liquid crystal phase widens. Particularly in the case where the number of six-membered ring is 4 or more the temperature range of liquid crystal phase remarkably widens. Thus, such case is desirable, but on the other side, the viscosity considerably increases. Accordingly, liquid crystalline compounds which exhibit a low value as to the viscosity similar to that of the liquid crystalline compounds having a small number of the rings in spite of having such a wide temperature range of liquid crystal phase are desired, and several compounds have been developed heretofore. For instance, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid derivatives expressed by the formula (10) are known as the compound having a comparatively wide temperature range of liquid crystal phase and a low viscosity (Flussige Kristalle in Tabellen, VEB Deutscher Verlagfur Grundstoffindustrie (1974) 34 p and Laid-open Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho 54-151951). However, the derivatives have been found out to have acute toxicity (in this connection, it has been published that the derivatives are extremely high in toxicity such that their half lethal dose (LD 50 ) caused by acute toxicity is 18 mg/kg, although it is a result of intravenous injection to mice), and thus it is not preferable from the aspect of environmental safety to fill the derivatives in practical panels and use them. Further, whereas benzoic acid derivatives expressed by the formula (11) are known as the compounds having a low viscosity (Laid-open Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei 6-57252), the derivatives do not have a wide temperature range of liquid crystal phase such an extent as necessary to withstand practical use.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION As will be clear from the general formula (1) described above, since cyclohexane derivatives which are liquid crystalline compounds of the present invention have a one-ring structure and are naturally small in the number of six-membered ring contained in the molecule compared with conventional liquid crystalline compounds, any of the cyclohexane derivatives exhibit a low viscosity. However, the cyclohexane derivative of the present invention further have a wide temperature range of liquid crystal phase in common with two-ring compounds ordinarily used, are safe since they do not have such a toxic as observed in cyclohexanecarboxylic acid derivatives, are excellent in miscibility with other liquid crystalline compounds, and are even chemically stable at the same time. Liquid crystal compositions of the present invention comprise, as a first component, at least one liquid crystalline compound expressed by the general formula (1). Its content is necessary to be in the range of 0.1 to 99.9% by weight based on the amount of liquid crystal composition for developing excellent characteristics. While the liquid crystal composition of the present invention may comprise only the first component described above the compositions in which at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the compounds expressed by one of the general formulas (2), (3), and (4) described above (hereinafter referred to as second component A) and/or at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the compounds expressed by the general formula (5) or (6) described above (hereinafter referred to as second component B) are mixed as a second component in addition to the first component, or the compositions in which at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the compounds expressed by one of the general formulas (7), (8), and (9) described above are further mixed as a third component in addition to the first and second components are preferable. Besides, an optically active compound as another component, and a known compound may be mixed for the purpose of adjusting threshold voltage, temperature range of liquid crystal phase, optical anisotropy value (n), dielectric anisotropy value (), and viscosity. Among the second component A described above, the compounds expressed by one of the following formulas (2-1) to (2-9) can be mentioned as preferable examples of the ones included in the general formula (2), the compounds of one of the following formulas (3-1) to (3-69) can be mentioned as preferable examples of the ones included in the general formula (3), and the compounds of one of the following formulas (4-1) to (4-24) can be mentioned as preferable examples of the ones included in the general formula (4), respectively. wherein R 1 and X 1 have the same meaning as described above. Any of the compounds expressed by one of the general formulas (2) to (4) exhibit a positive , are excellent in thermal stability and chemical stability, and are indispensable when liquid crystal compositions for TFT (AM-LCD) of which a high reliability such as a high voltage holding ratio (large specific resistivity) is required are produced. While the amount of the compound to be used is suitably in the range of 1 to 99% by weight based on the total amount of liquid crystal composition when liquid crystal compositions for TFT are produced, it is preferably 10 to 97% by weight and more desirably 40 to 95% by weight. In this case, liquid crystal compositions may further comprise a compound expressed by one the general formulas (7) to (9) for the purpose of adjusting viscosity. While the compounds expressed by one of the general formulas (2) to (4) described above can be used when liquid crystal compositions for STN display mode or TN display mode are produced, the amount of the compound to be used is preferably less than 50% by weight based on the total amount of liquid crystal composition since these compounds are small in their effect of lowering threshold voltage of liquid crystal compositions. Next, among the second component B, the compounds of one the formulas (5-1) to (5-40) can be mentioned as preferable examples of the ones included in the general formula (5), and the compounds of one of the formulas (6-1) to (6-3) can be mentioned as preferable examples of the ones included in the general formula (6), respectively. wherein R 2 , R 3 , and X 2 have the same meaning as described above. Any compounds expressed by the general formula (5) or (6) have a positive and large value, and are used particularly for the purpose of lowering threshold voltage of liquid crystal compositions. Also, the compounds are used for the purpose of improving the steepness of viscosity of liquid crystal compositions for STN display mode or TN display mode including for the purpose adjusting n and widening temperature range of nematic phase such as raising clearing point of liquid crystal compositions, and thus are indispensable particularly when liquid crystal compositions for STN display mode or ordinary TN display mode are produced. Whereas the compounds can lower threshold voltage of liquid crystal compositions as their amount used is increased, the use of the compounds bring about increase of the viscosity. Accordingly, it is advantageous to use the compounds in a large amount for driving devices at a low voltage so far as the viscosity of liquid crystal compositions satisfies required characteristics. From such circumstances, the amount of the compounds to be used is suitably in the range of 0.1 to 99.9% by weight, preferably 10 to 97% by weight, and more desirably 40 to 95% by weight based on the total amount of liquid crystal composition when liquid crystal compositions for STN display mode or TN display mode are produced. Among the third component described above, the compounds one of the following formulas (7-1) to (7-11) can be mentioned as preferable examples of the ones included in the general formula (7), the compounds of one of the formulas (8-1) to (8-18) can be mentioned as preferable examples of the ones included in the general formula (8), and the compounds of one of the formulas (9-1) to (9-6) as preferable examples of the compounds included in the general formula (9). wherein R 4 and R 5 have the same meaning as described above. Any compounds expressed by one of the general formulas (7) to (9) have a small absolute value of . Among them, the compounds of the general formula (7) are used principally for the purpose of adjusting viscosity or adjusting n of liquid crystal compositions, and the compounds of the general formula (8) or (9) are used for the purpose of widening nematic range and adjusting n. Whereas these compounds raise threshold voltage of liquid crystal compositions as their amount used is increased, the use of the compounds reduces the viscosity. Accordingly, it is desirable to use the compounds in a larger amount so far as the threshold voltage of liquid crystal compositions satisfies required values. From such circumstances, the amount of the compounds to be used is suitably less than 40% by weight and preferably less than 35% by weight based on the total amount of liquid crystal composition when liquid crystal compositions for TFT are produced. On the other hand, when liquid crystal composition for STN display mode or TN display mode are produced, the amount of use described above is preferably less than 70% by weight and preferably less than 60% by weight based on the total amount of liquid crystal composition. Next, among other components, an optically active compound is usually added to the liquid crystal compositions of the present invention for the purpose of inducing helical structure of liquid crystal composition to adjust required twist angle and to prevent reverse twist, with the exception of specific cases, for instance, the case of liquid crystal compositions for OCB (Optically Compensated Birefringence) mode. While the optically active compound is widely selected from known compounds so far as the purposes described above can be achieved, the optically active compound expressed by one of the following formulas (Op-1) to (Op-8) can preferably be mentioned: Pitch length of the twist in liquid crystal compositions are adjusted by adding these optically active compounds. The twist pitch length is preferably adjusted in the range of 40 to 200 m in the case of liquid crystal compositions for TFT or TN, preferably adjusted in the range of 6 to 20 m in the case of the compositions for STN, and preferably adjusted in the range of 1.5 to 4 m in the case of compositions for bistable TN mode, respectively. Further, in such cases, two or more kind of optically active compounds may be added for the purpose of adjusting the dependency of pitch length on temperature. Liquid crystal compositions of the present invention can be produced by methods which are conventional by themselves. For instance, the compositions are produced by a method in which various components are dissolved in one another at a high temperature, or a method in which various components are dissolved in an organic solvent to mix and then the solvent is distilled off under a reduced pressure. Further, the liquid crystal compositions of the present invention can be used as ones for guest-host (GH) mode by adding a dichroic dye such as merocyanine type, styryl type, azo type azomethine type, azoxy type, quinophthalone type, anthraquinone type, and tetrazine type thereto. Alternatively, the liquid crystal compositions can be used as NCAP which is prepared by the microencapsulation of a nematic liquid crystal, or as liquid crystal compositions for polymer dispersed liquid crystal display devices (PDLCD) represented by polymer net work liquid crystal display devices (PNLCD) prepared by forming a polymer of three-dimensional reticulated structure in a liquid crystal. Still further, the liquid crystal compositions of the present invention can be used as ones for electrically controlled birefringence (ECB) mode or dynamic scattering (DS) mode. Compounds of the present invention expressed by the general formula (1) can be produced by known methods of ordinary organic synthesis. Production of compounds expressed by the general formula (1) in which MCOOH: Conjugated aldehyde expressed by the formula (14) is obtained by reacting the compound expressed by the formula (12) with phosphorane which is prepared from 1,3-dioxane-2-ylethyltriphenylphosphonium bromide and a base, to convert into exo-olefin compound (13), and then treating it with an acid. Compound of the present invention expressed by the general formula (1) is obtained by oxidizing an aldehyde of the formula (14) with an oxidizing agent such as silver oxide. wherein R has the same meaning as described above.

In particular, the compounds are inhibitors of the proliferation of a range of rapidly dividing tumour cells, for example melanoma and/or lymphoma cells. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION Anti-Proliferative Agents There is a need in cancer therapy for therapeutic compounds which are inhibitors of the proliferation of tumour cells. One compound which is known to have such activity is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Anti-Metastatic and Anti-Invasive Agents Compounds which have the property of inhibiting the action of the metalloproteinase enzymes involved in connective tissue breakdown and remodelling, such as fibroblast collagenase (Type 1), PMN-collagenase, 72 kDa-gelatinase, 92 kDa-gelatinase, stromelysin, stromelysin-2 and PUMP-1 (known as matrix metalloproteinase, and herein referred to as MMPs) have been proposed and are being tested in the clinic for the treatment of solid tumours. Cancer cells are particularly adept at utilising the MMPs to achieve rapid remodelling of the extracellular matrix, thereby providing space for tumour expansion and permitting metastasis. MMP inhibitors should minimise these processes and thus slow or prevent cancer progression. A known class of MMP inhibitors having a hydroxamic acid group as the zinc binding group may be represented by the structural formula (IA) in which the groups R 1 to R 5 are variable in accordance with the specific prior art disclosures of such compounds. Examples of patent publications disclosing MMP inhibitors of formula (IA) are: US 4599361 (Searle) WO 93/24475 (Celltech) EP-A-2321081 (ICI) EP-A-0574758 (Roche) EP-A-0236872 (Roche) EP-A-0575844 (Roche) EP-A-0274453 (Bellon) WO 94/02446 (British Biotech) WO 90/05716 (British Biotech) WO 94/02447 (British Biotech) WO 90/05719 (British Biotech) WO 94/21612 (Otsuka) WO 91/02716 (British Biotech) WO 94/21625 (British Biotech) WO 92/09563 (Glycomed) WO 94/24140 (British Biotech) US 5183900 (Glycomed) WO 94/25434 (Celltech) US 5270326 (Glycomed) WO 94/25435 (Celltech WO 92/17460 (SB) WO 95/04033 (Celltech) EP-A-0489577 (Celltech) WO 95/04735 (Syntex) EP-A-0489579 (Celltech) WO 95/04715 (Kanebo) EP-A-0497192 (Roche) WO 95/06031 (Immunex) US 5256657 (Sterling) WO 95/09841 (British Biotech) WO 92/13831 (British Biotech) WO 95/12603 (Syntex) WO 92/22523 (Research Corp) WO 95/19956 (British Biotech) WO 93/09090 (Yamanouchi) WO 95/19957 (British Biotech) WO 93/09097 (Sankyo) WO 95/19961 (British Biotech) WO 93/20047 (British Biotech) WO 95/19965 (Glycomed) WO 93/24449 (Celltech) WO 95/22966 (Sanofi Winthrop) WO 95/23790 (SB) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention is based on the identification of a class of ester and thioester compounds which inhibit proliferation of rapidly dividing cells. The ester and thioester compounds in question have certain structural similarities to known MMP inhibitors of general formula (IA) above disclosed in the foregoing patent publications. How ever, instead of the amide group CONR 4 R 5 of formula (IA), they have an ester or thioester group. Despite the similarity of structure, it has been shown that compounds of the invention which have little or no MMP inhibitory activity are nonetheless potent inhibitors of such cell proliferation, implying a novel mechanism is at work. This antiproliferation property suggests a utility for the compounds of the present invention in the treatment of cancers. Although the patent publications listed above predominantly disclose MMP inhibiting compounds of formula (IA), ie having an amide group CONR 4 R 5 , a few (WO 92/09563, U.S. Pat. No. 5,183,900, U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,326, EP-A-0489577, EP-A-0489579, WO 93/09097, WO 93/24449, WO 94/25434, WO 94/25435, WO 95/04033, WO 95/19965, and WO 95/22966) include within their generic disclosure compounds having a carboxylate ester group in place of the amide group. The carboxylate ester compounds with which this invention is concerned thus represent a selection of a notional subclass from the compounds proposed in the art as MMP inhibitors, for a specific and previously unrecognised pharmaceutical utility. WO 95/04033 discloses N 4 -hydroxy-N 1 -(1-(S)-methoxycarbonyl-2,2-dimethylpropyl)-2-(R)-(4-chlorophenylpropyl)succinamide as an intermediate for the preparation of the corresponding methylamide MMP inhibitor. In addition, Int. J. Pept. Protein Res . (1996), 48(2), 148-155 discloses the compound PhCH 2 CH(CO-Ile-OtBu)CH 2 CONHOH as an intermediate in the preparation of compounds which are inhibitors of neurotensin-degrading enzymes.

As mentioned above, compounds of formula (I) above, and those of formula (I) excluded by the provisos in the definition of formula (I) above, are useful in human or veterinary medicine since they are active as inhibitors of the proliferation of cancer cells. The utility of the invention therefore lies in the treatment of cancers, such as those caused by over-proliferation of lymphoma, leukemia, myeloma, adenocarcinoma, carcinoma, mesothelioma, teratocarcinoma, choriocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, melanoma, retinoblastoma, fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, glioblastoma or endothelioma cells. It will be understood that different compounds (I) will have differing potencies as proliferation inhibitors depending on the the type of cancer being treated. The activity of any particular compound (I) in inhibiting proliferation of any particular cell type may be routinely determined by standard methods, for example analagous to those described in the Biological Example herein. From the fact that compounds (I) which are poorly active as inhibitors of MMPs are nonetheless active in inhibiting proliferation of cancer cells, it is inferred that their utility in treating cancers is different from or supplementary to the utility of effective MMP inhibitors in the treatment of cancers. In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition comprising a compound of the invention as defined by reference to formula (IB) above, together with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable excipient or carrier. One or more compounds of the invention may be present in the composition together with one or more excipient or carrier. The compounds with which the invention is concerned may be prepared for administration by any route consistent with their pharmacokinetic properties. Orally administrable compositions may be in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, liquid or gel preparations, such as oral, topical, or sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinyl-pyrrolidone; fillers for example lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricant, for example magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica; disintegrants for example potato starch, or acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose syrup, gelatin hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents. For topical application to the skin, the drug may be made up into a cream, lotion or ointment. Cream or ointment formulations which may be used for the drug are conventional formulations well known in the art, for example as described in standard textbooks of pharmaceutics such as the British Pharmacopoeia. The active ingredient may also be administered parenterally in a sterile medium. Depending on the vehicle and concentration used, the drug can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservative and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. It will be understood that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.

An example of a pyrazole derivative which demonstrates 50% inhibition of tumor cell growth is 3-4-(3-chloro-5-fluorophenyl)-1 piperazinyl-1-1-(3-chloro-2-pyridyl)-5-methyl-4-pyrazolyl)-1-trans-propene hydrochloride. Synthesis of the compounds represented by formula (I) can be prepared by any one of various routes such as a Mannich reaction, a Wittig reaction, reductive amination or substitution by allylation. This is a Continuation-in-Part of PCT Application No. PCT/JP98/00300, filed Jan. 26, 1998 and claims benefit of priority based on Japanese Application Nos. Hei-9-012116 and Hei-10-208807 filed Jan. 27, 1997 and Jul. 24, 1998, respectively. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a novel compound having an antitumor activity, an antitumor agent comprising the compound as an active ingredient, and a method for treating tumors using the antitumor agent. BACKGROUND ART Many 5-fluorouracil type drugs (hereinafter abbreviated as 5-FU drugs) have been used as an antitumor agent that can be administered orally, but their mechanism of action is quite the same, and also the effects obtained are not deemed sufficient. Besides, tumors resistant to 5-FU drugs have come out. It has therefore been demanded to develop a new antitumor agent having a different mechanism of action from that of 5-FU drugs which is more efficacious than 5-FU drugs and is effective on 5-FU-resistant tumors as well. An object of the present invention is to provide a potent antitumor agent which has a novel chemical structure not heretofore reported and exhibits efficacy on 5-FU-resistant tumors as well. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION As a result of extensive study, the inventors of the present invention have found that novel pyrazole derivatives represented by formula (I) hereinafter shown exhibit a powerful antitumor activity even on 5-FU-resistant tumors. It has also been found that the pyrazole derivatives are also effective on P glycoprotein-expressed multiple drug-resistant strains that have been a clinical problem.

The alkoxy group preferably include those having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The term aryl group means a monovalent group derived from an aromatic hydrocarbon by removing one hydrogen atom from its nucleus and includes, for example, phenyl, tolyl, biphenyl and naphthyl groups. In the aminoalkyl group as referred to herein, the amino moiety may be bonded to any position of the alkyl moiety, and the alkyl moiety preferably contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The terminology alkylamino group is indented to include an amino group substituted with one alkyl group and an amino group substituted with two alkyl groups, which may be the same or different, in which the alkyl group preferably contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The term acyl group means a carbonyl group (CO) with a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group or an aryl group bonded thereto, including formyl, acetyl, propanoyl and benzoyl groups. The alkyl group bonded to the carbonyl group preferably contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and the aryl group bonded is preferably a phenyl group. The term heterocyclic group designates a group derived from a monocyclic or bicyclic, saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic compound containing in its ring one or more hetero atoms selected from an oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom and a sulfur atom, the position of the hetero atom(s) being not limited. Monocyclic heterocyclic groups include those derived from monocyclic heterocyclic compounds, such as pyrrole, furan, thiophene, pyrrolidine, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydrothiophene, imidazole, pyrazole, imidazolidine, pyrazolidine, oxazole, thiazole, oxadiazole, thiadiazole, pyridine, dihydropyridine, tetrahydropyran, piperidine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, triazine, pyrazine, piperazine, dioxane, pyran, and morpholine.

These compounds are useful in the treatment of type I diabetes, type II diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, obesity, and a number of other diseases. CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present invention claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 of U.S. provisional application 60/059,598 filed on Sep. 23, 1997, the contents of which are fully incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides novel compounds, novel compositions, methods of their use, and methods of their manufacture, where such compounds of Formula 1 and Formula 2 are pharmacologically useful inhibitors of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (PTPases) such as PTP1B, CD45, PTP1C, PTP, LAR and HePTP or the like, wherein W, X, Y, Z, R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are defined more fully below. It has been found that PTPases plays a major role in the intracellular modulation and regulation of fundamental cellular signaling mechanisms involved in metabolism, growth, proliferation and differentiation (Flint et al., The EMBO J. 12:1937-46 (1993); Fischer et al, Science 253:401-6 (1991)). Overexpression or altered activity of tyrosine phosphatases can also contribute to the symptoms and progression of various diseases (Wiener, et al., J. Natl. cancer Inst. 86:372-8 (1994); Hunter and Cooper, Ann. Rev. Biochem, 54:897-930 (1985)). Furthermore, there is increasing evidence which suggests that inhibition of these PTPases may help treat certain types of diseases such as diabetes type I and II, autoimmune disease, acute and chronic inflammation, osteoporosis and various forms of cancer. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Protein phosphorylation is now well recognized as an important mechanism utilized by cells to transduce signals during different stages of cellular function (Fischer et al, Science 253:401-6 (1991); Flint et al., The EMBO J. 12:1937-46 (1993)). There are at least two major classes of phosphatases: (1) those that dephosphorylate proteins (or peptides) that contain a phosphate group(s) on a serine or threonine moiety (termed Ser/Thr phosphatases) and (2) those that remove a phosphate group(s) from the amino acid tyrosine (termed protein tyrosine phosphatases or PTPases). The PTPases are a family of enzymes that can be classified into two groups: a) intracellular or nontransmembrane PTPases and b) receptor-type or transmembrane PTPases. Intracellular PTPases: Most known intracellular type PTPases contain a single conserved catalytic phosphatase domain consisting of 220-240 amino acid residues. The regions outside the PTPase domains are believed to play important roles in localizing the intracellular PTPases subcellularly (Mauro, L. J. and Dixon, J. E. TIBS 19:151-155 (1994)). The first intracellular PTPase to be purified and characterized was PTP1B which was isolated from human placenta (Tonks et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263: 6722-6730 (1988)). Shortly after, PTP1B was cloned (Charbonneau et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 5252-5256 (1989); Chernoff et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 2735-2789 (1989)). Other examples of intracellular PTPases include (1) T-cell PTPase (Cool et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 5257-5261 (1989)), (2) rat brain PTPase (Guan et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:1501-1502 (1990)), (3) neuronal phosphatase STEP (Lombroso et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 88: 7242-7246 (1991)), (4) ezrin-domain containing PTPases: PTPMEG1 (Guet al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 5867-57871 (1991)), PTPH1 (Yang and Tonks, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 5949-5953 (1991)), PTPD1 and PTPD2 (Mller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91: 7477-7481 (1994)), FAP-1/BAS (Sato et al., Science 268: 411-415 (1995); Banville et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269: 22320-22327 (1994); Maekawa et al., FEBS Letters 337: 200-206 (1994)), and SH2 domain containing PTPases: PTP1C/SH-PTP1/SHP-1 (Plutzky et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:1123-1127 (1992); Shen et al., Nature Lond. 352: 736-739 (1991)) and PTPID/Syp/SH-PTP2/SHP-2 (Vogel et al., Science 259:1611-1614 (1993); Feng et al., Science 259:1607-1611 (1993); Bastein et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 196:124-133 (1993)). Low molecular weight phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase (LMW-PTPase) shows very little sequence identity to the intracellular PTPases described above. However, this enzyme belongs to the PTPase family due to the following characteristics: (i) it possesses the PTPase active site motif: Cys-Xxx-Xxo(-XXO(-Xxx-Xxx-Arg (Cirri et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 214: 647-657 (1993)); (ii) this Cys residue forms a phospho-intermediate during the catalytic reaction similar to the situation with classical PTPases (Cirri et al., supra; Chiarugi et al., FEBS Lett. 310: 9-12 (1992)); (iii) the overall folding of the molecule shows a surprising degree of similarity to that of PTP1B and Yersinia PTP (Su et al., Nature 370: 575-578 (1994)). Receptor-type PTPases consist of a) a putative ligand-binding extracellular domain, b) a transmembrane segment, and c) an intracellular catalytic region. The structures and sizes of the putative ligand-binding extracellular domains of receptor-type PTPases are quite divergent. In contrast, the intracellular catalytic regions of receptor-type PTPases are very homologous to each other and to the intracellular PTPases. Most receptor-type PTPases have two tandemly duplicated catalytic PTPase domains. The first receptor-type PTPases to be identified were (1) CD45/LCA (Ralph, S. J., EMBO J. 6:1251-1257 (1987)) and (2) LAR (Streuli et al., J. Exp. Med. 168:1523-1530 (1988)) that were recognized to belong to this class of enzymes based on homology to PTP1B (Charbonneau et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 5252-5256 (1989)). CD45 is a family of high molecular weight glycoproteins and is one of the most abundant leukocyte cell surface glycoproteins and appears to be exclusively expressed upon cells of the hematopoietic system (Trowbridge and Thomas, Ann. Rev. Immunol. 12: 85-116 (1994)). The identification of CD45 and LAR as members of the PTPase family was quickly followed by identification and cloning of several different members of the receptor-type PTPase group. Thus, 5 different PTPases, (3) PTPa, (4) PTPb, (5) PTPd, (6) PTPe, and (7) PTPz, were identified in one early study (Krueger et al., EMBO J. 9: 3241-3252 (1990)). Other examples of receptor-type PTPases include (8) PTPg (Barnea et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 13: 1497-1506 (1995)) which, like PTPz (Krueger and Saito, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89: 7417-7421 (1992)) contains a carbonic anhydrase-like domain in the extracellular region, (9) PTP (Gebbink et al., FEBS Letters 290: 123-130 (1991)), (10) PTPk (Jiang et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 13: 2942-2951 (1993)). Based on structural differences the receptor-type PTPases may be classified into subtypes (Fischer et al., Science 253: 401-406 (1991)): (I) CD45; (II) LAR, PTPd, (11) PTPs ; (III) PTPb, (12) SAP-1 (Matozaki et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269: 2075-2081 (1994)), (13) PTP-U2/GLEPP1 (Seimiya et al., Oncogene 10: 1731-1738 (1995); Thomas et al., J. Biol.Chem. 269: 19953-19962 (1994)), and (14) DEP-1; (IV) PTPa,_PTPe. All receptor-type PTPases except Type IV contain two PTPase domains. Novel PTPases are continuously identified, and it is anticipated that more than 500 different species will be found in the human genome, i.e. close to the predicted size of the protein tyrosine kinase superfamily (Hanks and Hunter, FASEB J. 9: 576-596 (1995)). PTPases are the biological counterparts to protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). Therefore, one important function of PTPases is to control, down-regulate, the activity of PTKs. However, a more complex picture of the function of PTPases now emerges. Several studies have shown that some PTPases may actually act as positive mediators of cellular signaling. As an example, the SH2 domain-containing PTP1D seems to act as a positive mediator in insulin-stimulated Ras activation (Noguchi et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 14: 6674-6682 (1994)) and of growth factor-induced mitogenic signal transduction (Xiao et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269: 21244-21248 (1994)), whereas the homologous PTP1C seems to act as a negative regulator of growth factor-stimulated proliferation (Bignon and Siminovitch, Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 73:168-179 (1994)). Another example of PTPases as positive regulators has been provided by studies designed to define the activation of the Src-family of tyrosine kinases. In particular, several lines of evidence indicate that CD45 is positively regulating the activation of hematopoietic cells, possibly through dephosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine of Fyn and Lck (Chan et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12: 555-592 (1994)). Dual specificity protein tyrosine phosphatases (dsPTPases) define a subclass within the PTPases family that can hydrolyze phosphate from phosphortyrosine as well as from phosphor-serine/threonine. dsPTPases contain the signature sequence of PTPases: His-Cys-Axx-Xxx-Gly-Xxo-Xxx-Arg. At least three dsPTPases have been shown to dephosphorylate and inactivate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERKs)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK): MAPK phosphatase (CL100, 3CH134) (Charles et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 5292-296 (1993)); PAC-1 (Ward et al., Nature 367: 651-654 (1994)); rVH6 Mourey et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271: 3795-3802 (1996)). Transcription of sPTPases are induced by different stimuli, e.g. oxidative stress or heat hock (Ishibashi et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269: 29897-29902 (1994); Keyse and Emslie, Nature 359: 644-647 (1992)). Further, they may be involved in regulation of the cell cycle: cdc25 (Millar and Russell, Cell 68: 407-410 (1992)); KAP (Hannon et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91: 1731-1735 (1994)). Interestingly, tyrosine dephosphorylation of cdc2 by a dual specific phosphatase, cdc25, is required for induction of mitosis in yeast (review by Walton and Dixon, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 62: 101-120 (1993)). PTPases were originally identified and purified from cell and tissue lysates using a variety of artificial substrates and therefore their natural function of dephosphorylation was not well known. Since tyrosine phosphorylation by tyrosine kinases is usually associated with cell proliferation, cell transformation and cell differentiation, it was assumed that PTPases were also associated with these events. This association has now been proven to be the case with many PTPases. PTP1B, a phosphatase whose structure was recently elucidated (Barford et al., Science 263:1397-1404 (1994)) has been shown to be involved in insulin-induced oocyte maturation (Flint et al., The EMBO J. 12:1937-46 (1993)) and recently it has been suggested that the overexpression of this enzyme may be involved in p185 c-erb B2 -associated breast and ovarian cancers (Wiener, et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 86:372-8 (1994); Weiner et al., Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 170:1177-883 (1994)). The insulin-induced oocyte maturation mechanism has been correlated with the ability of PTP1B to block activation of S6 kinase. The association with cancer is recent evidence which suggests that overexpression of PTP1B is statistically correlated with increased levels of p185 c-erb B2 in ovarian and breast cancer. The role of PTP1B in the etiology and progression of the disease has not yet been elucidated. Inhibitors of PTP1B may therefore help clarify the role of PTP1B in cancer and in some cases provide therapeutic treatment for certain forms of cancer. The activity of a number of other newly discussed phosphatases are currently under investigation. Two of these: PTP1C and Syp/PTP1DISHPTP2/PTP2C have recently been implicated in the activation of Platelet Derived Growth Factor and Epidermal Growth Factor induced responses (Li et al., Mole. Cell. Biol. 14:509-17 (1994)). Since both growth factors are involved in normal cell processing as well as disease states such as cancer and artherosclerosis, it is hypothesized that inhibitors of these phosphatases would also show therapeutic efficacy. Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention which exhibit inhibitory activity against various PTPases, are indicated in the treatment or management of the foregoing diseases. PTPases: the insulin receptor signaling pathway/diabetes Insulin is an important regulator of different metabolic processes and plays a key role in the control of blood glucose. Defects related to its synthesis or signaling lead to diabetes mellitus. Binding of insulin to its receptor causes rapid (auto)phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the intracellular part of the b-subunit. Three closely positioned tyrosine residues (the tyrosine-1150 domain) must all be phosphorylated to obtain full activity of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (IRTK) which transmits the signal further downstream by tyrosine phosphorylation of other cellular substrates, including insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) (Wilden et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 16660-16668 (1992); Myers and White, Diabetes 42: 643-650 (1993); Lee and Pilch, Am. J. Physiol. 266: C319-C334 (1994); White et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263: 2969-2980 (1988)). The structural basis for the function of the tyrosine-triplet has been provided by recent X-ray crystallographic studies of IRTK that showed tyrosine-1150 to be autoinhibitory in its unphosphorylated state (Hubbard et al., Nature 372: 746-754 (1994)). Several studies clearly indicate that the activity of the auto-phosphorylated IRTK can be reversed by dephosphorylation in vitro (reviewed in Goldstein, Receptor 3: 1-15 (1993); Mooney and Anderson, J. Biol.Chem. 264: 6850-6857 (1989)), with the tri-phosphorylated tyrosine-1150 domain being the most sensitive target for protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) as compared to the di- and mono- phosphorylated forms (King et al., Biochem. J. 275: 413-418 (1991)). It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that this tyrosine-triplet functions as a control switch of IRTK activity. Indeed, the IRTK appears to be tightly regulated by PTP-mediated dephosphorylation in vivo (Khan et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264: 12931-12940 (1989); Faure et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 11215-11221 (1992); Rothenberg et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266: 8302-8311 (1991)). The intimate coupling of PTPases to the insulin signaling pathway is further evidenced by the finding that insulin differentially regulates PTPase activity in rat hepatoma cells (Meyerovitch et al., Biochemistry 31: 10338-10344 (1992)) and in livers from alloxan diabetic rats (Boylan et al., J. Clin. Invest. 90: 174-179 (1992)). Relatively little is known about the identity of the PTPases involved in IRTK regulation. However, the existence of PTPases with activity towards the insulin receptor can be demonstrated as indicated above. Further, when the strong PTPase-inhibitor pervanadate is added to whole cells an almost full insulin response can be obtained in adipocytes (Fantus et al., Biochemistry 28: 8864-8871 (1989); Eriksson et al., Diabetologia 39: 235-242 (1995)) and skeletal muscle (Leighton et al., Biochem. J. 276: 289-292 (1991)). In addition, recent studies show that a new class of peroxovanadium compounds act as potent hypoglycemic compounds in vivo (Posner et al.,supra). Two of these compounds were demonstrated to be more potent inhibitors of dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor than of the EGF-receptor. It was recently found that the ubiquitously expressed SH2 domain containing PTPase, PTP1D (Vogel et al., 1993, supra), associates with and dephosphorylates IRS-1, but apparently not the IR itself (Kuhn{acute over (e)} et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268: 11479-11481 (1993); (Kuhn{acute over (e)} et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269:15833-15837 (1994)). Previous studies suggest that the PTPases responsible for IRTK regulation belong to the class of membrane-associated (Faure et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267:11215-11221 (1992)) and glycosylated molecules (H{umlaut over (a)}ring et al., Biochemistry 23: 3298-3306 (1984); Sale, Adv. Prot. Phosphatases 6:159-186 (1991)). Hashimoto et al. have proposed that LAR might play a role in the physiological regulation of insulin receptors in intact cells (Hashimoto et al., J. Biol.Chem. 267: 13811-13814 (1992)). Their conclusion was reached by comparing the rate of dephosphorylationlinactivation of purified IR using recombinant PTP1B as well as the cytoplasmic domains of LAR and PTPa. Antisense inhibition was recently used to study the effect of LAR on insulin signaling in a rat hepatoma cell line (Kulas et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270: 2435-2438 (1995)). A suppression of LAR protein levels by about 60 percent was paralleled by an approximately 150 percent increase in insulin-induced auto-phosphorylation. However, only a modest 35 percent increase in IRTK activity was observed, whereas the insulin-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity was significantly increased by 350 percent. Reduced LAR levels did not alter the basal level of IRTK tyrosine phosphorylation or activity. The authors speculate that LAR could specifically dephosphorylate tyrosine residues that are critical for PI 3-kinase activation either on the insulin receptor itself or on a downstream substrate. While previous reports indicate a role of PTPa in signal transduction through src activation (Zheng et al., Nature 359: 336-339 (1992); den Hertog et al., EMBO J. 12: 3789-3798 (1993)) and interaction with GRB-2 (den Hertog et al., EMBO J. 13: 3020-3032 (1994); Su et a., J. Biol. Chem. 269: 18731-18734 (1994)), a recent study suggests a function for this phosphatase and its close relative PTPe as negative regulators of the insulin receptor signal (Mller et al., 1995 supra). This study also indicates that receptor-like PTPases play a significant role in regulating the IRTK, whereas intracellular PTPases seem to have little, if any, activity towards the insulin receptor. While it appears that the target of the negative regulatory activity of PTPases a and e is the receptor itself, the downmodulating effect of the intracellular TC-PTP seems to be due to a downstream function in the IR-activated signal. Although PTP1B and TC-PTP are closely related, PTP1B had only little influence on the phosphorylation pattern of insulin-treated cells. Both PTPases have distinct structural features that determine their subcellular localization and thereby their access to defined cellular substrates (Frangione et al., Cell 68: 545-560 (1992); Faure and Posner, Glia 9: 311-314 (1993)). Therefore, the lack of activity of PTP1B and TC-PTP towards the IRTK may, at least in part, be explained by the fact that they do not co-localize with the activated insulin receptor. In support of this view, PTP1B and TC-PTP have been excluded as candidates for the IR-associated PTPases in hepatocytes based on subcellular localization studies (Faure et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 11215-11221 (1992)). The transmembrane PTPase CD45, which is believed to be hematopoietic cell-specific, was in a recent study found to negatively regulate the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase in the human multiple myeloma cell line U266 (Kulas et al., J. Biol.Chem. 271: 755-760 (1996)). PTPases: somatostatin Somatostatin inhibits several biological functions including cellular proliferation (Lamberts et al., Molec. Endocrinol. 8: 1289-1297 (1994)). While part of the antiproliferative activities of somatostatin are secondary to its inhibition of hormone and growth factor secretion (e.g. growth hormone and epidermal growth factor), other antiproliferative effects of somatostatin are due to a direct effect on the target cells. As an example, somatostatin analogs inhibit the growth of pancreatic cancer presumably via stimulation of a single PTPase, or a subset of PTPases, rather than a general activation of PTPase levels in the cells (Liebow et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 2003-2007 (1989); Colas et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 207: 1017-1024 (1992)). In a recent study it was found that somatostatin stimulation of somatostatin receptors SSTR1, but not SSTR2, stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells can stimulate PTPase activity and that this stimulation is pertussis toxin-sensitive. Whether the inhibitory effect of somatostatin on hormone and growth factor secretion is caused by a similar stimulation of PTPase activity in hormone producing cells remains to be determined. PTPases: the immune system/autoimmunity Several studies suggest that the receptor-type PTPase CD45 plays a critical role not only for initiation of T cell activation, but also for maintaining the T cell receptor-mediated signaling cascade. These studies are reviewed in: (Weiss A., Ann. Rev. Genet 25: 487-510 (1991); Chan et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol 12: 555-592 (1994); Trowbridge and Thomas, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12: 85-116 (1994)). CD45 is one of the most abundant of the cell surface glycoproteins and is expressed exclusively on hemopoetic cells. In T cells, it has been shown that CD45 is one of the critical components of the signal transduction machinery of lymphocytes. In particular, evidence has suggested that CD45 phosphatase plays a pivotal role in antigen-stimulated proliferation of T lymphocytes after an antigen has bound to the T cell receptor (Trowbridge, Ann. Rev. immunol, 12:85-116 (1994)). Several studies suggest that the PTPase activity of CD45 plays a role in the activation of Lck, a lymphocyte-specific member of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinase (Mustelin etal., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 6302-6306 (1989); Ostergaard et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 8959-8963 (1989)). These authors hypothesized that the phosphatase activity of CD45 activates Lck by dephosphorylation of a C-terminal tyrosine residue, which may, in turn, be related to T-cell activation. In a recent study it was found that recombinant p56lck specifically associates with recombinant CD45 cytoplasmic domain protein, but not to the cytoplasmic domain of the related PTPa (Ng et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271: 1295-1300 (1996)). The p56lck-CD45 interaction seems to be mediated via a nonconventional SH2 domain interaction not requiring phosphotyrosine. In immature B cells, another member of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, Fyn, seems to be a selective substrate for CD45 compared to Lck and Syk (Katagiri et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270: 27987-27990 (1995)). Studies using transgenic mice with a mutation for the CD45-exon6 exhibited lacked mature T cells. These mice did not respond to an antigenic challenge with the typical T cell mediated response (Kishihara et al., Cell 74:143-56 (1993)). Inhibitors of CD45 phosphatase would therefore be very effective therapeutic agents in conditions that are associated with autoimmune disease. CD45 has also been shown to be essential for the antibody mediated degranulation of mast cells (Berger et al., J. Exp. Med. 180:471-6 (1994)). These studies were also done with mice that were CD45-deficient. In this case, an IgE-mediated degranulation was demonstrated in wild type but not CD45-deficient T cells from mice. These data suggest that CD45 inhibitors could also play a role in the symptomatic or therapeutic treatment of allergic disorders. Another recently discovered PTPase, an inducible lymphoid-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) has also been implicated in the immune response. This phosphatase is expressed in both resting T and B lymphocytes, but not non-hemopoetic cells. Upon stimulation of these cells, mRNA levels from the HePTP gene increase 10-15 fold (Zanke et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 22:235-239 (1992)). In both T and B cells HePTP may function during sustained stimulation to modulate the immune response through dephosphorylation of specific residues. Its exact role, however remains to be defined. Likewise, the hematopoietic cell specific PTP1C seems to act as a negative regulator and play an essential role in immune cell development. In accordance with the above-mentioned important function of CD45, HePTP and PTP1C, selective PTPase inhibitors may be attractive drug candidates both as immunosuppressors and as immunostimulants. One recent study illustrates the potential of PTPase inhibitors as immunmodulators by demonstrating the capacity of the vanadium-based PTPase inhibitor, BMLOV, to induce apparent B cell selective apoptosis compared to T cells (Schieven et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270: 20824-20831 (1995)). PTPases: cell-cell interactions/cancer Focal adhesion plaques, an in vitro phenomenon in which specific contact points are formed when fibroblasts grow on appropriate substrates, seem to mimic, at least in part, cells and their natural surroundings. Several focal adhesion proteins are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues when fibroblasts adhere to and spread on extracellular matrix (Gumbiner, Neuron 11, 551-564 (1993)). However, aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins can lead to cellular transformation. The intimate association between PTPases and focal adhesions is supported by the finding of several intracellular PTPases with ezrin-like N-terminal domains, e.g. PTPMEGI (Gu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 5867-5871 (1991)), PTPH1 (Yang and Tonks, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 5949-5953 (1991)) and PTPD1 (Mller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91: 7477-7481 (1994)). The ezrin-like domain show similarity to several proteins that are believed to act as links between the cell membrane and the cytoskeleton. PTPD1 was found to be phosphorylated by and associated with c-src in vitro and is hypothesized to be involved in the regulation of phosphorylation of focal adhesions (Mller et al., supra). PTPases may oppose the action of tyrosine kinases, including those responsible for phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins, and may therefore function as natural inhibitors of transformation. TC-PTP, and especially the truncated form of this enzyme (Cool et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 7280-7284 (1990)), can inhibit the transforming activity of v-erb and v-fms (Lammers et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268: 22456-22462 (1993); Zander et al., Orcogene 8: 1175-1182 (1993)). Moreover, it was found that transformation by the oncogenic form of the HER2/neu gene was suppressed in NIH 3T3 fribroblasts overexpressing PTP1B (Brown-Shimer et al., Cancer Res. 52: 478-482 (1992)). The expression level of PTP1B was found to be increased in a mammary cell line transformed with neu (Zhay et al., Cancer Res. 53: 2272-2278 (1993)). The intimate relationship between tyrosine kinases and PTPases in the development of cancer is further evidenced by the recent finding that PTPe is highly expressed in murine mammary tumors in transgenic mice over-expressing c-neu and v-Ha-ras, but not c-myc or int-2 (Elson and Leder, J. Biol. Chem. 270:26116-26122 (1995)). Further, the human gene encoding PTPg was mapped to 3p21, a chromosomal region which is frequently deleted in renal and lung carcinomas (LaForgia et a., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 5036-5040 (1991)). In this context, it seems significant that PTPases appear to be involved in controlling the growth of fibroblasts. In a recent study it was found that Swiss 3T3 cells harvested at high density contain a membrane-associated PTPase whose activity on an average is 8-fold higher than that of cells harvested at low or medium density (Pallen and Tong, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 6996-7000 (1991)). It was hypothesized by the authors that density-dependent inhibition of cell growth involves the regulated elevation of the activity of the PTPase(s) in question. In accordance with this view, a novel membrane-bound, receptor-type PTPase, DEP-1, showed enhanced (10-fold) expression levels with increasing cell density of WI-38 human embryonic lung fibroblasts and in the AG1518 fibroblast cell line ({umlaut over (O)}stman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91: 9680-9684 (1994)). Two closely related receptor-type PTPases, PTPk and PTP, can mediate homophilic cell-cell interaction when expressed in non-adherent insect cells, suggesting that these PTPases might have a normal physiological function in cell-to-cell signaling (Gebbink et at., J. Biol.Chem. 268: 16101-16104 (1993); Brady-Kalnay et al., J. Cell Biol. 122: 961-972 (1993); Sap et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 14: 1-9 (1994)). Interestingly, PTPk and PTP do not interact with each other, despite their structural similarity (Zondag et al., J. Biol.Chem. 270: 14247-14250 (1995)). From the studies described above it is apparent that PTPases may play an important role in regulating normal cell growth. However, as pointed out above, recent studies indicate that PTPases may also function as positive mediators of intracellular signaling and thereby induce or enhance mitogenic responses. Increased activity of certain PTPases might therefore result in cellular transformation and tumor formation. Indeed, in one study over-expression of PTPa was found to lead to transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts (Zheng, supra). In addition, a novel PTP, SAP-1, was found to be highly expressed in pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells. SAP-1 is mapped to chromosome 19 region q13.4 and might be related to carcinoembryonic antigen mapped to 19q 13.2 (Uchida et al., J. Biol.Chem. 269: 12220-12228 (1994)). Further, the dsPTPase, cdc25, dephosphorylates cdc2 at Thr14/Tyr-15 and thereby functions as positive regulator of mitosis (reviewed by Hunter, Cell 80: 225-236 (1995)). Inhibitors of specific PTPases are therefore likely to be of significant therapeutic value in the treatment of certain forms of cancer. PTPases: platelet aggregation Recent studies indicate that PTPases are centrally involved in platelet aggregation. Agonist-induced platelet activation results in calpain-catalyzed cleavage of PTP1B with a concomitant 2-fold stimulation of PTPase activity (Frangioni et al., EMBO J. 12:48434856 (1993)). The cleavage of PTP1B leads to subcellular relocation of the enzyme and correlates with the transition from reversible to irreversible platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma. In addition, the SH2 domain containing PTPase, PTP1C/SH-PTP1, was found to translocate to the cytoskeleton in platelets after thrombin stimulation in an aggregation-dependent manner (Li et al., FEBS Lett. 343: 89-93 (1994)). Although some details in the above two studies were recently questioned there is over-all agreement that PTP1B and PTP1C play significant functional roles in platelet aggregation (Ezumi et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:11927-11934 (1995)). In accordance with these observations, treatment of platelets with the PTPase inhibitor pervanadate leads to significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, secretion and aggregation (Pumiglia et al., Biochem. J. 286: 441-449 (1992)). PTPases: osteoporosis The rate of bone formation is determined by the number and the activity of osteoblasts, which in term are determined by the rate of proliferation and differentiation of osteoblas progenitor cells, respectively. Histomorphometric studies indicate that the osteoblast number is the primary determinant of the rate of bone formation in humans (Gruber et al., Mineral Electrolyte Metab. 12: 246-254 (1987); reviewed in Lau et al., Biochem. J. 257: 23-36 (1989)). Acid phosphatases/PTPases may be involved in negative regulation of osteoblast proliferation. Thus, fluoride, which has phosphatase inhibitory activity, has been found to increase spinal bone density in osteoporotics by increasing osteoblast proliferation (Lau et al., supra). Consistent with this observation, an osteoblastic acid phosphatase with PTPase activity was found to be highly sensitive to mitogenic concentrations of fluoride (Lau et al., J. Biol. Chem. 260: 4653-4660 (1985); Lau et al., J. Biol. Chem. 262: 1389-1397 (1987); Lau et al., Adv. Protein Phosphatases 4:165-198 (1987)). Interestingly, it was recently found that the level of membrane-bound PTPase activity was increased dramatically when the osteoblast-like cell line UMR 106.06 was grown on collagen type-l matrix compared to uncoated tissue culture plates. Since a significant increase in PTPase activity was observed in density-dependent growth arrested fibroblasts (Pallen and Tong, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 88: 6996-7000 (1991)), it might be speculated that the increased PTPase activity directly inhibits cell growth. The mitogenic action of fluoride and other phosphatase inhibitors (molybdate and vanadate) may thus be explained by their inhibition of acid phosphatases/PTPases that negatively regulate the cell proliferation of osteoblasts. The complex nature of the involvement of PTPases in bone formation is further suggested by the recent identification of a novel parathyroid regulated, receptor-like PTPase, OST-PTP, expressed in bone and testis (Mauro et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269: 30659-30667 (1994)). OST-PTP is up-regulated following differentiation and matrix formation of primary osteoblasts and subsequently down-regulated in the osteoblasts which are actively mineralizing bone in culture. It may be hypothesized that PTPase inhibitors may prevent differentiation via inhibition of OST-PTP or other PTPases thereby leading to continued proliferation. This would be in agreement with the above-mentioned effects of fluoride and the observation that the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate appears to enhance osteoblast proliferation and matrix formation (Lau et al., Endocrinology 116: 2463-2468 (1988)). In addition, it was recently observed that vanadate, vanadyl and pervanadate all increased the growth of the osteoblast-like cell line UMR106. Vanadyl and pervanadate were stronger stimulators of cell growth than vanadate. Only vanadate was able to regulate the cell differentiation as measured by cell alkaline phosphatase activity (Cortizo et al., Mol. Cell. Biochem. 145: 97-102 (1995)). PTPases: microorganisms Dixon and coworkers have called attention to the fact that PTPases may be a key element in the pathogenic properties of Yersinia (reviewed in Clemens et al. Molecular Microbiology 5: 2617-2620 (1991)). This finding was rather surprising since tyrosine phosphate is thought to be absent in bacteria. The genus Yersinia comprises 3 species: Y. pestis (responsible for the bubonic plague), Y. pseudoturberculosis and Y. enterocolitica (causing enteritis and mesenteric lymphadenitis). Interestingly, a dual-specificity phosphatase, VH1, has been identified in Vaccinia virus (Guan et al., Nature 350: 359-263 (1991)). These observations indicate that PTPases may play critical roles in microbial and parasitic infections, and they further point to PTPase inhibitors as a novel, putative treatment principle of infectious diseases.

The present invention also has the objective of providing suitable topical, oral, and parenteral pharmaceutical formulations for use in the novel methods of treatment of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention may be administered orally as tablets, aqueous or oily suspensions, lozenges, troches, powders, granules, emulsions, capsules, syrups or elixirs. The composition for oral use may contain one or more agents selected from the group of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to produce pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. The tablets contain the acting ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be, for example, (1) inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; (2) granulating and disintegrating agents, such as corn starch or alginic acid; (3) binding agents, such as starch, gelatin or acacia; and (4) lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. These tablets may be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. Coating may also be performed using techniques described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,160,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. Formulations for oral use may be in the form of hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin. They may also be in the form of soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil. Aqueous suspensions normally contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspension. Such expicients may be (1) suspending agent such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; (2) dispersing or wetting agents which may be (a) naturally occurring phosphatide such as lecithin; (b) a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid, for example, polyoxyethylene stearate; (c) a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol, for example, heptadecaethylen-oxycetanol; (d) a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or (e) a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to known methods using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringers solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. The Compounds of the invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-rritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperature but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, or phosphatidyl-cholines. For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compounds of Formula 1 are employed. Dosage levels of the compounds of the present invention are of the order of about 0.5 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram body weight, with a preferred dosage range between about 20 mg to about 50 mg per kilogram body weight per day (from about 25 mg to about 5 gs per patient per day). The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain 5 mg to 1 g of an active compound with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 5 mg to about 500 mg of active ingredient. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, gender, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. The dosage needs to be individualized by the clinician.

This invention extends to all tautomeric and geometric forms. It will be appreciated that the compounds according to the invention can contain one or more asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms. The presence of one or more of these asymmetric centers in a compound of formula (i) can give rise to stereoisomers, and in each case the invention is to be understood to extend to all such stereoisomers, including enantiomers, and diastereoisomers and mixtures including racemic mixtures thereof.

Alkoxy means an alkyl-O-group in which the alkyl group is as previously described, and thioalkyl means an alkyl-S-group. Cycloalkyl includes a non-aromatic cyclic or multicyclic ring system of 3 to 10 carbon atoms. Cycloalkylalkyl means a cycloalkyl-alkyl-group wherein the cycloalkyl and alkyl groups are as previously defined. The cyclic alkyl may optionally be partially unsaturated.

Halogen means fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The invention further provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (i), in which R 1 -R 25 , p, X, Y and Z are as defined above. It will be appreciated that functional groups such as amino, hydroxyl, carbonyl or carboxyl groups present in the various compounds described below, and which it is desired to retain, may need to be in protected forms before any reaction is initiated. In such instances, removal of the protecting group may be the final step in a particular reaction. Suitable protecting groups for such functionality will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For specific details, see Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley Interscience, T W Greene. Thus the process for preparing compounds of formula (i) in which R 2 contains an OH comprises deprotecting (for example by hydrogenolysis or hydrolysis) a compound of formula (i) in which R 2 contains an appropriate OP wherein P represents a suitable protecting group (eg benzyl or acetyl). The process for preparing compounds of formula (i) in which R 2 contains a carbonyl group may comprise of deprotecting (for example by acidic hydrolysis) a compound of formula (i) in which R 2 contains an appropriate CP 2 moiety where P represents a suitable protecting group (eg alkoxy). A process for the preparation of a compound of formula (i) in which Z is CO comprises reaction of an appropriate carboxylic acid of formula (ii) with a suitable amine of formula (iii) wherein R 1 a represents R 1 as defined in relation to formula (i) or a group convertable to R 1 and R 2 a-R 5 a similarly represent R 2 -R 5 or groups convertable to R 2 -R 5 respectively and thereafter, if required, converting any group R 1 a to R 1 and/or R 2 a to R 2 and/or R 3 a to R 3 and/or R 4 a to R 4 and/or R 5 a to R 5 . The reaction of a carboxylic acid of formula (ii) with an amine of formula (iii) may be carried out under any suitable conditions known to those skilled in the art. Favourably the carboxylic acid is converted into an acid chloride, mixed anhydride, p-nitrophenyl ester or other activated intermediate prior to reaction with an amine of formula (iii). Favourably the reaction with the amine of formula (iii) is carried out in the presence of a suitable base, for example an amine such as triethylamine, preferably in an appropriate solvent such as dichloromethane. In some cases a stronger base, such as sodium hydride, and a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide, will be required. Carboxylic acids of formula (ii) are either previously described compounds or are prepared using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art. For example a carboxylic acid of formula (ii) is conveniently prepared from an appropriate compound of formula (v). Conversion of a compound of formula (v) to a carboxylic acid of formula (ii) can be carried out using any standard procedures known to those skilled in the art. For example, a compound of formula (v) can be formylated to provide an aldehyde of formula (iv), which can then be oxidised to provide the corresponding acid of formula (ii). Alternatively, a compound of formula (v) can be brominated to provide a bromide of formula (vi), which can then be converted into a carboxylic acid of formula (ii), for example by organometal catalysed carboxylation or by generation of a Grignard reagent followed by quenching with carbon dioxide. Compounds of formula (v) may be prepared by any standard procedure known to those skilled in the art, for example by treatment of a compound of formula (viii) with a strong base (such as butyllithium), and, if necessary, conversion to a Grignard or other organometallic species, followed by reaction with an agent R 2 aW where W is a suitable leaving group such as a halogen, or an agent G, where G contains for example, a reactive carbonyl moiety or a nitrile, and after reaction constitutes the group R 2 a. A compound of formula (viii), when X is N and Y is CH or N, may be prepared by any standard procedure known to those skilled in the art, for example by the reaction of a compound of formula (vii) where Q is a suitable leaving group such as a halogen with an agent such as R 1 aOM where M is a metal counter ion such as sodium. A compound of formula (vii) may be prepared by any standard procedure known to those skilled in the art, for example when X is N, by the procedures described in J. Heterocyclic Chem., 1982, 19, 1207-1209 or Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr., 1968, 4959-4967. A compound of formula (viii), when X is CH and Y is N, may be prepared by any standard procedure known to those skilled in the art, for example by the hydrolysis of a compound of formula (ix) in which K is, for example, a substituent such as acetoxy to a compound of formula (ix) in which K is, for example, a hydroxyl group and subsequent treatment with an alkylating agent R 1 aW, where W is a suitable leaving group such as a halogen, in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium hydride in an appropriate solvent such as THF. A compound of formula (ix) when X is CH may be prepared by any standard procedure known to those skilled in the art, for example by the procedures described in J. Heterocyclic Chem., 1996, 33, 647-654 Amines of formula (iii) are either commercially available, previously described compounds or are prepared using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art. compound of formula (ia) may also be prepared by reaction of a carboxylic acid of formula (ii) with an amine of formula (x) to provide a compound of formula (ia) in which R 4 a is H, followed by reaction with an appropriate alkylating agent of formula (xi), wherein R 1 a-R 5 a are as defined earlier and W represents a suitable leaving group such as a halogen. The reaction of a carboxylic acid of formula (ii) with an amine of formula (x) may be carried out under any suitable conditions known to those skilled in the art. Favourably the carboxylic acid is converted into an acid chloride, mixed anhydride, p-nitrophenyl ester or other activated intermediate prior to reaction with an amine of formula (x). Favourably the reaction with the amine of formula (x) is carried out in the presence of a suitable base, for example an amine such as triethylamine, preferably in an appropriate solvent such as dichloromethane. In some cases a stronger base such as sodium hydride, and a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide, may be required. Amines of formula (x) are either commercially available, previously described compounds or are prepared using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art. The reaction of a compound of formula (ia) in which R 4 a is H with an alkylating agent of formula (xi) may be carried out under any suitable conditions known to those skilled in the art. Favourably the reaction is carried out using an appropriate base, such as sodium hydride, preferably in an appropriate solvent such as dimethylformamide. Alkylating agents of formula (xi) are either commercially available or are prepared using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art. Some compounds of formula (i) may be prepared from other compounds of formula (i). For example, compounds in which R 2 contains an oxime may be prepared from compounds in which R 2 contains a carbonyl group. This transformation may be carried out using any appropriate standard conditions known to those skilled in the art. For example the transformation may be achieved in one step by reaction of a compound of formula (i) with an appropriate hydroxylamine under suitable conditions. Suitable conditions include the use of a base, such as pyridine in a dry solvent such as toluene at an appropriate temperature such as the reflux temperature of the solvent. The use of a Dean and Stark apparatus to remove the water generated may also be considered appropriate. Alternatively, the transformation may involve two steps, ie reaction of the ketone with hydroxylamine followed by alkylation of the resulting oxime with an approriate alkylating agent. The reaction with hydroxylamine may involve the use of a base, such as pyridine in a dry solvent such as toluene at an appropriate temperature such as the reflux temperature of the solvent. The use of a Dean and Stark apparatus to remove the water generated may also be considered appropriate. The alkylation can be conducted under any suitable conditions known to those skilled in art. Suitable conditions include the use of an appropriate base such as sodium hydride in an appropriate anhydrous solvent such as DMF. Some compounds of formula (i) in which R 2 contains an oxime can be prepared by further modification of the oxime substituent after alkylation if the alkylating agent contains appropriate functionality. For example, if R 2 contains an amide, this can be prepared by reaction of an appropriate carboxylic acid with a suitable amine under standard conditions known to those skilled in the art. Standard conditions include the use of a suitable coupling agent such as 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride in an appropriate solvent such as dichloromethane in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine. An appropriate carboxylic acid may be conveniently prepared by hydrolysis of an appropriate ester. An appropriate ester may be obtained if an alkylating agent incorporating an ester is used. An example of such an alkylating agent is t-butyl chloroacetate. Compounds of formula (i) in which R 2 contains a carbonyl group may be prepared from compounds of formula (i) in which R 2 contains a hydroxyl group by oxidation using any standard conditions known to those skilled in the art. Suitable conditions include the use of DMSO and oxalyl chloride in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine in an appropriate anhydrous solvent such as dichloromethane. Compounds of formula (i) in which R 2 contains a carbonyl group may be reduced using standard conditions known to those skilled in the art (for example with sodium borohydride in an appropriate solvent) to provide compounds in which R 2 contains an alcohol group. The alcohol thus obtained may be alkylated using any suitable conditions known to those skilled in art. Suitable conditions include the use of an appropriate base such as sodium hydride in an appropriate anhydrous solvent such as DMF. Compounds of formula (i) in which R 2 contains an amine group may be prepared from compounds of formula (i) in which R 2 contains a carbonyl group using any standard conditions known to those skilled in the art, such as reductive amination. Suitable conditions include the use of a reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride in an appropriate solvent such as dichloroethane in the prescence of a drying agent such as activated molecular sieves. The addition of acetic acid may also be beneficial. By way of further example, compounds of formula (i) may also be prepared by a Wittig or similar reaction, followed by reduction of the double bond, using conditions known to those skilled in the art, on a compound of formula (ia) where R 2 a contains either an aldehyde or ketone moiety. Compounds of formula (i) in which Z is CS may be prepared from compounds of formula (i) in which Z is CO using any appropriate conditions known to those skilled in the art, for example by using Lawessons reagent. Compounds of formula (i) which contain an N-oxide may be prepared using any appropriate conditions known to those skilled in the art, for example by treating a compound of formula (i) containing a heteroaryl N-atom with peracetic acid in acetic acid in an appropriate solvent such as chloroform. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in some cases it may more appropriate to carry out the above mentioned transformations of a carbonyl group on compounds of formula (ii), (vi) or (v) rather than compounds of formula (i). It will be appreciated that where a particular stereoisomer of formula (i) is required, this may be obtained by conventional resolution techniques such as high performance liquid chromatography or the synthetic processes herein described may be performed using the appropriate homochiral starting material. The invention includes the prevention and treatment of TNF mediated disease or disease states, by which is meant any and all disease states in which TNF plays a role, either by production of TNF itself, or by TNF causing another cytokine to be released, such as but not limited to IL-1 or IL-6. A disease state in which IL-1, for instance, is a major component, and whose production or action is exacerbated or secreted in response to TNF, would therefore be considered a disease state mediated by TNF. As TNF- (also known as lymphotoxin) has close structural homology with TNF- (also known as cachectin), and since each induces similar biological responses and binds to the same cellular receptor, both TNF- and TNF- are assumed to be inhibited by compounds of the present invention and thus are herein referred to collectively as TNF unless specifically delineated otherwise. PDE IV inhibitors are useful in the treatment of a variety of allergic and inflanrnatory diseases, including: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, atopic dermatitis, atopic eczema, urticaria, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, inflammation of the eye, allergic responses in the eye, eosinophilic granuloma, psoriasis, Bechets disease, erythematosis, anaphylactoid purpura nephritis, joint inflammation, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritic conditions such as rheumatoid spondylitis and osteoarthritis, septic shock, ulcerative colitis, Crohns disease, reperfusion injury of the myocardium and brain, chronic glomerulonephritis, endotoxic shock and adult respiratory distress syndrome. In addition, PDE IV inhibitors are useful in the treatment of diabetes insipidus and conditions associated with cerebral metabolic inhibition, such as cerebral senility, senile dementia (Alzheimers disease), memory impairment associated with Parkinsons disease, depression and multi-infarct dementia. PDE IV inhibitors are also useful in conditions ameliorated by neuroprotectant activity, such as cardiac arrest, stroke and intermittent claudication. Additionally, PDE IV inhibitors could have utility as gastroprotectants. A special embodiment of the therapeutic methods of the present invention is the treatment of asthma. Inhibitors of PDE IV are useful for the treatment of viral diseases. The viruses contemplated for treatment herein are those that produce TNF as a result of infection, or those which are sensitive to inhibition, such as by decreased replication, directly or indirectly, by the TNF inhibitors of Formula (i). Such viruses include, but are not limited to HIV-1, HIV-2 and HIV-3, cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza, adenovirus and the Herpes group of viruses, such as, but not limited to, Herpes zoster and Herpes simplex. This invention more specifically relates to a method of treating a mammal, afflicted with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which comprises administering to such mammal an effective TNF inhibiting amount of a compound of Formula (i) or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof. The compounds of this invention may be also be used in association with the veterinary treatment of animals, other than humans, in need of inhibition of TNF production. TNF mediated diseases for treatment, therapeutically or prophylactically, in animals include disease states such as those noted above, but in particular viral infections. Examples of such viruses include, but are not limited to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) or other retroviral infection such as equine infectious anaemia virus, caprine arthritis virus, visna virus, maedi virus and other lentiviruses. The compounds of this invention are also useful in treating parasite, yeast and fungal infections, where such yeast and fungi are sensitive to upregulation by TNF or will elicit TNF production in vivo. A preferred disease state for treatment is fungal meningitis. The compounds of formula (i) are preferably in pharmaceutically-acceptable form. By pharmaceutically-acceptable form is meant, inter alia, a pharmaceutically-acceptable level of purity excluding normal pharmaceutical additives such as diluents and carriers, and including no material considered toxic at normal dosage levels. A pharmaceutically-acceptable level of purity will generally be at least 50% excluding normal pharmaceutical additives, preferably 75%, more preferably 90% and still more preferably 95%. When used herein the term pharmaceutically-acceptable encompasses materials suitable for both human and veterinary use. A compound of formula (i) or where appropriate a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof and/or a pharmaceutically-acceptable solvate thereof, may be administered per se or, preferably, as a pharmaceutical composition also comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. Accordingly, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (i) or where appropriate a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof and/or a pharmaceutically-acceptable solvate thereof, and a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. The active compound may be formulated for administration by any suitable route, the preferred route depending upon the disorder for which treatment is required, and is preferably in unit dosage form or in a form that a human patient may administer to himself in a single dosage. Advantageously, the composition is suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral administration or through the respiratory tract. Preparations may be designed to give slow release of the active ingredient. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. In addition to the treatment of warm-blooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, cats, etc, the compounds of the invention are effective in the treatment of humans. The compositions of the invention may be in the form of tablets, capsules, sachets, vials, powders, granules, lozenges, suppositories, reconstitutable powders, or liquid preparations such as oral or sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions. Topical formulations are also envisaged where appropriate. In order to obtain consistency of administration it is preferred that a composition of the invention is in the form of a unit dose. Unit dose presentation forms for oral administration may be tablets and capsules and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers for example microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricants, for example magnesium stearate; disintegrants, for example starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium starch glycollate or microcrystalline cellulose, or pharmaceutically-acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate. Solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling, tabletting or the like. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers. Such operations are of course conventional in the art. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice, in particular with an enteric coating. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminium stearate gel, hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia, non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as esters of glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid; and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents. Compositions may also suitably be presented for administration to the respiratory tract as a snuff or an aerosol or solution for a nebuliser, or as a microfine powder for insufflation, alone or in combination with an inert carrier such as lactose. In such a case the particles of active compound suitably have diameters of less than 50 m, such as from 0.1 to 50 m, preferably less than 10 m, for example from 1 to 10 m, 1 to 5 m or from 2 to 5 m. Where appropriate, small amounts of other anti-asthmatics and bronchodilators for example sympathomimetic amines such as isoprenaline, isoetharine, salbutamol, phenylephrine and ephedrine; corticosteroids such as prednisolone and adrenal stimulants such as ACTH may be included. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the compound and a sterile vehicle, and, depending on the concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions, the compound can be dissolved in water for injection and filter-sterilised before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, a preservative and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhance the stability, the composition can be frozen after filling into the vial and the water removed under vacuum. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner, except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved, and sterilisation cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilised by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound. The compositions may contain from 0.1% to 99% by weight, preferably from 10-60% by weight, of the active material, depending on the method of administration. Compounds of formula (i), or if appropriate a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof and/or a pharmaceutically-acceptable solvate thereof, may also be administered as a topical formulation in combination with conventional topical excipients. Topical formulations may be presented as, for instance, ointments, creams or lotions, impregnated dressings, gels, gel sticks, spray and aerosols, and may contain appropriate conventional additives such as preservatives, solvents to assist drug penetration and emollients in ointments and creams. The formulations may contain compatible conventional carriers, such as cream or ointment bases and ethanol or oleyl alcohol for lotions. Suitable cream, lotion, gel, stick, ointment, spray or aerosol formulations that may be used for compounds of formula (i) or if appropriate a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, are conventional formulations well known in the art, for example, as described in standard text books such as Harrys Cosmeticology published by Leonard Hill Books, Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, and the British and U.S. Pharmacopoeias. Suitably, the compound of formula (i), or if appropriate a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, will comprise from about 0.5 to 20% by weight of the formulation, preferably from about 1 to 10%, for example 2 to 5%. The dose of the compound used in the treatment of the invention will vary in the usual way with the seriousness of the disorders, the weight of the sufferer, and the relative efficacy of the compound. However, as a general guide suitable unit doses may be 0.1 to 1000 mg, such as 0.5 to 200, 0.5 to 100 or 0.5 to 10 mg, for example 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 mg; and such unit doses may be administered more than once a day, for example 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times a day, but preferably 1 or 2 times per day, so that the total daily dosage for a 70 kg adult is in the range of about 0.1 to 1000 mg, that is in the range of about 0.001 to 20 mg/kg/day, such as 0.007 to 3, 0.007 to 1.4, 0.007 to 0.14 or 0.01 to 0.5 mg/kg/day, for example 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg/day, and such therapy may extend for a number of weeks or months. ASSAY METHODS The assays used to confirm the phosphodiesterase IV inhibitory activity of compounds of formula (I) are standard assay procedures as disclosed by Schilling et al, Anal. Biochem. 216:154 (1994), Thompson and Strada, Adv. Cycl. Nucl. Res. 8:119 (1979) and Gristwood and Owen, Br. J. Pharmacol. 87:91P (1986). Compounds of formula (i) have exhibited activity at levels consistent with those believed to be usefull in treating phosphodiesterase IV-related disease states in those assays. The ability of compounds of formula (i) to inhibit TNF production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) is measured as follows. PMBCs are prepared from freshly taken blood or Buffy coats by standard procedures. Cells are plated out in RPMI 16401% foetal calf serum in the presence and absence of inhibitors. LPS (100 ng/ml) is added and cultures are incubated for 22 h at 37 C. in an atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO 2 . Supernatants are tested for TNF by ELISA using commercially available kits. Abbreviations LPS Lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) ELISA Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay Activity in a guinea pig lung model is measured using the procedures described by Mauser et al, Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 148 1623 (1993) and Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 152 467 (1995). The pharmacokinetic profile of the compounds of the invention is determined in rats cannulated in the right carotid artery for blood collection.

The compounds are described, as are methods for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions including such compounds and their use in medicine, for example in the treatment of psoriasis, fibrosis, atherosclerosis, restenosis, auto-immune disease, allergy, asthma, transplantation rejection, inflammation, thrombosis, nervous system diseases, and cancer. This application is a 371 of PCT/EP96/04399 filed Oct. 10, 1996. The present invention relates to a series of substituted heteroaromatic compounds, methods for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in medicine. In particular, the invention relates to bioisosteres of quinoline and quinazoline derivatives which exhibit protein tyrosine kinase inhibition. Protein tyrosine kinases catalyse the phosphorylation of specific tyrosyl residues in various proteins involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation (A. F. Wilks, Progress in Growth Factor Research, 1990 (2), 97-111). Protein tyrosine kinases can be broadly classified as growth factor receptor (e.g. EGF-R, PDGF-R, FGF-R and c-erbB-2) or non-receptor (e.g. c-src, bcr-abl) kinases. Inappropriate or uncontrolled activation of many of these kinases i.e. aberrant protein tyrosine kinase activity, for example by over-expression or mutation, has been shown to result in uncontrolled cell growth. Aberrant activity of protein tyrosine kinases such as c-erbB-2, c-src, p561ck, EGF-R, PDGF-R, and zap70 has been implicated in human malignancies. Aberrant EGF-R activity has, for example, been implicated in cancers of the head and neck, and aberrant c-erbB-2 activity in breast, ovarian, non-small cell lung, pancreatic, gastric and colon cancers. Inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinase should therefore provide a treatment for tumours such as those outlined above. Aberrant protein tyrosine kinase activity has also been implicated in a variety of other disorders: psoriasis, (Dvir et al, J.Cell.Biol; 1991, 113, 857-865), fibrosis, atherosclerosis, restenosis, (Buchdunger et al, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci. U.S.A.; 1991, 92 2258-2262), auto-immune disease, allergy, asthma, transplantation rejection (Klausner and Samelson, Cell; 1991, 64 875-878), inflammation (Berkois, Blood; 1992, 79(9), 2446-2454), thrombosis (Salari et al, FEBS; 1990, 263(1), 104-108) and nervous system diseases (Ohmichi et al, Biochemistry, 1992, 31, 4034-4039). Inhibitors of the specific protein tyrosine kinases involved in these diseases eg PDGF-R in restenosis and EGF-R in psoriasis, should lead to novel therapies for such disorders. P561ck and zap 70 are indicated in disease conditions in which T cells are hyperactive eg rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disease, allergy, asthma and graft rejection. WO 9519774 discloses bicyclic derivatives of formula (I): in which A to E are nitrogen or carbon and at least one of A to E is nitrogen; or two adjacent atoms together are N, O or S; R 1 is H or alkyl and n is 0, 1 or 2; and R 2 includes optionally substituted alkyl, alkoxy, cycloalkoxy, cycloalkoxy, or 2 together form a carbocycle or heterocycle, and m is 0 to 3. The compounds are said to inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase and suggested uses include the treatment of cancer, psoriasis, kidney disease, pancreatitis and contraception. EP0635507 discloses a class of tricyclic quinazoline derivatives of the formula (III): wherein R 1 and R 2 together form specified optionally substituted groups containing at least one heteroatom so as to form a 5 or 6-membered ring, in which there is a N atom at the 6 position of the quinazoline ring. R 3 includes independently hydrogen, hydroxy, halogeno, (1-4C)alkyl, (1-4C) alkoxy di-(1-4C)alkylamino, or (2-4C)alkanoylamino. The above citation notes that receptor tyrosine kinases in general, which are important in the transmission of biochemical signals initiating cell replication, are frequently present in common human cancers such as breast cancer (Sainsbury et al Brit. J. Cancer 1988, 58, 458). This citation also states that tyrosine kinase activity is rarely detected in normal cells whereas it is frequently detectable in malignant cells (Hunter, Cell, 1987, 50, 823) and it is suggested that inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinase should be of value as inhibitors of the growth of mammalian cancer cells (Yaish et al. Science, 1988, 242, 933). This citation therefore has the aim of providing quinazoline derivatives which inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases involved in controlling the tumourigenic phenotype. The above compounds suffer the disadvantage that they are more difficult to synthesize than their quinoline and quinazoline counterparts on account of the additional structural complexity and accordingly there is a need for quinoline and quinazoline deriatives which are capable of inhibiting protein tyrosine kinase activity and yet are relatively simple to synthesize. There is no reference in the above citation to any such bicyclic heterocyclic system capable of inhibiting protein tyrosine kinase activity and the present invention seeks to fill this omission. Selective inhibition of the EGF receptor is, however, disclosed by Fry et al (Science, 265, 1093 (1994)). This citation discloses that the compound: is a highly selective inhibitor of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase at picomolar concentrations while inhibiting other tyrosine kinases only at micromolar or higher concentrations. This compound does not however exhibit good in vivo activity in contrast to the compounds of the present invention. WO 93/17682 and Bioorg Med Chem Lett (1993, 4 (1), 173-176) disclose compounds which block angiotensin II receptors and have the general formula (IV) in which D is a bicyclic heterocyle comprising a 6-membered ring fused to another 6-membered ring, the bicyclic heterocycle comprising at least one heteroatom selected from N, O and S, and each fused ring independently containing 0 to 3 N atoms, 1 N atom and 1 O atom, 1 N atom or 1 S atom, 1 O atom and 1 S atom, 2 O atoms, 2 S atoms or 1 O atom or 1 S atom, with the remaining ring atoms being carbon atoms. Pendant R 1 and R 1 groups include tetra zolyl, N substituted amino, N substituted amide, N substituted urea, carboxylate, amino sulphone, carbonyl, methylene alkoxy, sulphonate and phosphate. WO 93/18035 and Bioorg Med Chem Lett (1993, 4 (1), 173-176) relate to further angiotension II receptor blocking compounds of formula (I) above, with the difference that D in formula (I) now represents a bicyclic heterocycle comprising a 6-membered ring fused to a 5-membered ring, the bicyclic heterocycle comprising at least one heteroatom selected from N, O and S. In this application, the 6-membered ring comprises 0 to 3 N atoms, 1 N atom and 1 O atom, 1 N atom and 1 S atom, 1 O atom and 1 S atom, 2 O atoms, 2 S atoms, 1 O atom, or 1 S atom; and the 5-membered ring comprises 0 to 3 N atoms, 1 N atom and 1 O atom, 1 N atom and 1 S atom, 1 O atom and 1 S atom, 1 O atom, or 1 S atom with the remaining atoms in the fused rings being carbon atoms. WO 86/06718 relates to a class of mono- and di- Mannich bases, derived from 4-(7-substituted-1,5-naphthyridin-4-ylamino)phenols and 4-(7-substituted-quinolin-4-ylamino) -phenols of formula (V): in which Y is N or CH, and R 1 and R 2 are independently hydrogen or specified substituted amino groups. The compounds of formula (II) exhibit antimalarial activity. EP 0534341 relates to the preparation of 4-(ar)alkoxy pyrimidines for use as pesticides and agrochemical fungicides. This application discloses compounds of formula (VI): in which R 2 and R 3 together form an unsaturated 5-membered ring, together with the C atoms to which they are attached, containing an O or S atom; or R 2 and R 3 together form a saturated 5, 6 or 7-membered ring which may contain an O or S atom. EP 0452002 relates to 4-substituted thieno 2,3-d, 3,2-d and 3,4-d pyrimidines of formula (VII) below having fungicidal, insecticidal and miticidal utility: in which and X includes O, S or NR 4 where R 4 H or C 1-4 alkyl; Y includes a carbocyclic ring which may contain a heteroatom; and Z is a C 3-8 cycloalky or phenyl. Tetrahedron (1971, 27 487-499) concerns an academic study which discloses nucleophilic substitution reactions of 4-chlorothieno3,2-dpyrimidines to produce a number of compounds in which the 4-substituent is bound to the pyrimidine via a heteroatom, for example 4-phenoxythieno3,2-dpyrimidine is exemplified. EP 0370704 relates to the preparation of 4-(benzylamino) pyrimidines of formula (VIII) as pesticides: It is a general object of the present invention to provide compounds suitable for the treatment of disorders mediated by protein tyrosine kinase activity, and in particular treatment of the above mentioned disorders. In addition to the treatment of tumours, the present invention envisages that other disorders mediated by protein tyrosine kinase activity may be treated effectively by preferential inhibition of the appropriate protein tyrosine kinase activity. Broad spectrum inhibition of protein tyrosine kinase may not provide optimal treatment of, for example tumours, and could in certain cases even be deterimental to subjects since protein tyrosine kinases provide an essential role in the normal regulation of cell growth. It is another object of the present invention to provide compounds which preferentially inhibit protein tyrosine kinases, such as c-erbB-2, p561ck, EGF-R and PDGF-R protein tyrosine kinases. A further object of the present invention is to provide compounds useful in the treatment of protein tyrosine kinase related diseases which minimise undesirable side-effects in the recipient. The present invention relates to heterocyclic compounds which may be used to treat disorders mediated by protein tyrosine kinases and in particular have anti-cancer properties. More particularly, the compounds of the present invention are potent inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases such as c-erbB-2, EGF-R and p561ck thereby allowing clinical management of particular diseased tissues. The present invention envisages, in particular, the treatment of human malignancies, for example breast, stomach, ovary, colon, lung and pancreatic tumours, especially those driven by c-erbB-2, using the compounds of the present invention. For example, the invention includes compounds which are highly active against the c-erbB-2 protein tyrosine kinase in preference to the EGF receptor kinase hence allowing treatment of c-erbB-2 driven tumours. More particularly, the present invention envisages that disorders mediated by protein tyrosine kinase activity may be treated effectively by inhibition of the appropriate protein tyrosine kinase activity in a relatively selective manner, thereby minimising potential side effects. Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula (A): or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein X is N or CH; wherein represents a fused 5, 6 or 7-membered heterocyclic ring containing 1 to 5 heteroatoms which may be the same or different and which are selected from N, O or S(O) m , wherein m is 0, 1 or 2, the heterocyclic ring containing a total of 1, 2 or 3 double bonds inclusive of the bond in the pyridine or pyrimidine ring, with the provisos that the heterocyclic ring does not form part of a purine and that the fused heterocyclic ring does not contain two adjacent O or S(O) m atoms;

Certain compounds of the formula (A) contain asymmetric carbon atoms and are, therefore, capable of existing as optical isomers. The individual isomers and mixtures of these are included within the scope of the present invention. Likewise, it is understood that compounds of formula (A) may exist in tautomeric forms other than that shown in the formula. Salts of the compounds of the present invention may comprise acid addition salts derived from a nitrogen in the compound of formula (A). The therapeutic activity resides in the moiety derived from the compound of the invention as defined herein and the identity of the other component is of less importance although for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes it is, preferably, pharmaceutically acceptable to the patient. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from mineral acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric and sulphuric acids, and organic acids, such as tartaric, acetic, trifluoroacetic, citric, malic, lactic, fumaric, benzoic, glycollic, gluconic, succinic and methanesulphonic and arylsulphonic, for example p-toluenesulphonic, acids. In a further aspect, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula (A), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which process comprises the reaction of a compound of the formula (B): with a compound of the formula C: wherein L is a leaving group and X, Y and R 1 to R 5 are as hereinbefore defined. Suitable leaving groups will be well known to those skilled in the art and include, for example, halo such as chloro and bromo; sulphonyloxy groups such as methanesulphonyloxy and toluene-p-sulphonyloxy; and alkoxy groups. The reaction is conveniently carried out in the presence of a suitable inert solvent, for example a C 1-4 alkanol, such as isopropanol, a halogenated hydrocarbon, an ether, an aromatic hydrocarbon or a do polar aprotic solvent such as acetone or acetonitrile at a non-extreme temperature, for example from 0 to 150 C., suitably 10 to 100 C., preferably 50 to 100 C. Optionally, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base when YNH. Examples of suitable bases include an organic amine such as triethylamine, or an alkaline earth metal carbonate, hydride or hydroxide, such as sodium or potassium carbonate, hydride or hydroxide. When YHOH or SH it is necessary to perform the reaction in the presence of a base, and in such a case the product is not obtained as the salt. The compound of formula (A) in the case in which YNR b may be obtained from this process in the form of a salt with the acid HL, wherein L is as hereinbefore defined, or as the free base by treating the salt with a base as hereinbefore defined. The preparation of compounds (B) and (C) is well known to those skilled in the art. In addition to the above, one compound of formula (A) may be converted to another compound of formula (A) by chemical transformation of the appropriate substituent or substituents using appropriate chemical methods (see for example, J.March Advanced Organic Chemistry, Edition III, Wiley Interscience, 1985). For example, a group R 1 may be substituted onto the ring U by replacement of another group R 1 which is a suitable leaving group. This is especially suitable for preparing compounds of formula (A) wherein an R 1 group is linked to the ring by a nitrogen atom; such compounds may, for example, be obtained by reaction of the amine corresponding to the group R 1 with the corresponding compound of formula (A) carrying a halo substituent in the appropriate position on the ring. This is also especially suitable for preparing compounds where R 1 is a heterocyclic ring system; such compounds may, for example, be prepared by reaction of the corresponding heteroaryl stannane derivative with the corresponding compound of formula (A) carrying a halo substituent in the appropriate position on the ring using a suitable catalyst such as an organometallic compound of palladium (for example bis(triphenylphosphine) palladium chloride) together with any other required catalytic additives. A compound containing an alkyl or aryl mercapto group may be oxidised to the corresponding sulphinyl or sulphonyl compound by use of an organic peroxide (eg benzoyl peroxide) or suitable inorganic oxidant (eg OXONE). A compound containing a nitro substituent may be reduced to the corresponding amino-compound, eg by use of hydrogen and an appropriate catalyst (if there are no other susceptible groups) or by use of Raney Nickel and hydrazine hydrate. Amino or hydroxy substituents may be acylated by use of an acid chloride or an anhydride under appropriate conditions. Equally an acetate or amide group may be cleaved to the hydroxy or amino compound respectively by treatment with, for example, dilute aqueous base. In addition reaction of an amino substituent with triphosgene and another amine (eg aqueous ammonia, dimethylamine) gives the urea substituted product. An amino substituent may also be converted to a dimethylamino substituent by reaction with formic acid and sodium cyanoborohydride. All of the above-mentioned chemical transformations may also be used to convert one compound of formula (B) to a further compound of formula (B) prior to the reaction with the compound of formula (C); or to convert one compound of formula (C) to a further compound of formula (C) prior to the reaction with the compound of formula (B). The substituents present on the compounds (B) and (C) must be compatible with the conditions for their reaction together. The present invention also provides compounds of formula (A) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof (hereinafter identified as the active ingredients) for use in medical therapy, and particularly in the treatment of disorders mediated by aberrant protein tyrosine kinase activity such as human malignancies and the other disorders mentioned above. The compounds are especially useful for the treatment of disorders caused by aberrant c-erbB-2 activity such as breast, ovarian, non-small cell lung, pancreatic, gastric and colon cancers. A further aspect of the invention provides a method of treatment of a human or animal subject suffering from a disorder mediated by aberrant protein tyrosine kinase activity which comprises administering to the human or animal subject an effective amount of a compound of formula (A) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. A further aspect of the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula (A), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in therapy. A further aspect of the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula (A), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of malignant tumours. A further aspect of the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula (A), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of atherosclerosis, resterosis or thrombosis. Whilst it is possible for the compounds or salts of the present invention to be administered as the new chemical, it is preferred to present them in the form of a pharmaceutical formulation. According to a further feature of the present invention we provide pharmaceutical formulations comprising at least one compound of the formula (A), or pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s) thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients. Pharmaceutical formulations may be presented in unit dose forms containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient per unit dose. Such a unit may contain for example 0.5 mg to 1 g, preferably 5 mg to 100 mg of a compound of the formula (A) depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration and the age, weight and condition of the patient. Pharmaceutical formulations may be adapted for administration by any appropriate route, for example by the oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual or transdermal), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or intradermal) route. Such formulations may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy, for example by bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier(s) or excipient(s). Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules or tablets; powders or granules; solutions or suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; edible foams or whips; or oil-in-water liquid emulsions or water-in-oil liquid emulsions. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches intended to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. For example, the active ingredient may be delivered from the patch by iontophoresis as generally described in Pharmaceutical Research, 3(6), 318 (1986). Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration may be formulated as ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols or oils. For treatments of the eye or other external tissues, for example mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredient may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base or a water-in-oil base. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administrations to the eye include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges, pastilles and mouth washes. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for rectal administration may be presented as suppositories or as enemas. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oil solutions of the active ingredient. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for administration by inhalation include fine particle dusts or mists which may be generated by means of various types of metered dose pressurised aerosols, nebulizers or insufflators. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient. It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavouring agents. The compounds of the formula (A) and salts thereof have anticancer activity as demonstrated hereinafter by their inhibition of the protein tyrosine kinase c-erbB-2 enzyme. It has thus been established that compounds of the present invention are of use in medicine and, in particular in the treatment of certain human malignancies, for example breast, ovarian non-small cell lung, pancreatic, gastric and colon cancers. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the treatment of susceptible malignancies in an animal, e.g. a human, which comprises administering to the animal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or salt of the present invention. In the alternative, there is also provided a compound or salt of the present invention for use in medicine and, in particular, for use in the treatment of cancers. The present invention also provides the use of a compound of formula (A) or a salt thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for treatment of malignant tumours. The animal requiring treatment with a compound or salt of the present invention is usually a mammal, such as a human being. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound or salt of the present invention will depend upon a number of factors including, for example, the age and weight of the animal, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, the nature of the formulation, and the route of administration, and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. However, an effective amount of a compound of the present invention for the treatment of neoplastic growth, for example colon or breast carcinoma will generally be in the range of 0.1 to 100 mg/kg body weight of recipient (mammal) per day and more usually in the range of 1 to 10 mg/kg body weight per day. Thus, for a 70 kg adult mammal, the actual amount per day would usually be from 70 to 700 mg and this amount may be given in a single dose per day or more usually in a number (such as two, three, four, five or six) of sub-doses per day such that the total daily dose is the same. An effective amount of a salt of the present invention may be determined as a proportion of the effective amount of the compound per se. Certain embodiments of the present invention will now be illustrated by way of example only. The physical data given for the compounds exemplified is consistent with the assigned structure of those compounds.

The solid was washed with water and dried in vacuo at 70 C. to give the title compound (62 g) as a pale brown solid, m.p. 144-146 C.: H 2 H 6 -DMSO 8.25 (1H,d), 7.95 (1H,bd), 7.25 (1H,d), 6.65 (1H,bs), 1.51 (9H,s); m/z (M1) 229. This material was carried forward to give 6-chloro-3H-pyrido3,4-dpyrimidin-4-one and 4,6-dichloropyrido3,4-dpyrimidine according to the procedures described for these compounds in WO95/19774 6-(N,N-Dimethylamino)-3H-pyrido3,4-dpyrimidin-4-one 6-Chloro-3H-pyrido3,4-dpyrimidin-4-one was reacted with dimethylamine (2.0 molar solution in methanol) in a pressure vessel at 130 C. for 32 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo and the resulting solid washed with ethyl acetate. This solid was heated in 2-propanol to give a suspension, which was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to give the product (60%). 4-Chloro-6-(N,N-dimethylamino)-pyrido3,4-dpyrimidine 6-(N,N-Dimethylamino)-3H-pyrido3,4-dpyrimidin-4-one (1.0 g, 5.25 mmol) was heated at reflux with phosphorous oxychloride (8.5 ml) and triethylamine (5.3 ml) for 3 hours. The mixture was concentrated in vacuo, azeotroping with toluene twice. The residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate and aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (8%), the layers separated, and the aqueous extracted once more with ethyl acetate. The combined organics were washed with water and brine, dried (sodium sulphate), and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was triturated with hexane to give the product as a solid (0.36 g, 33%). General Procedures (A) Reaction of an amine with a bicyclic species containing a 4-chloropyrimidine ring The optionally substituted bicyclic species and the specified amine were mixed in an appropriate solvent (acetonitrile unless otherwise specified), and heated to reflux. When the reaction was complete (as judged by TLC), the reaction mixture was allowed to cool. The resulting suspension was diluted, e.g. with acetone, and the solid collected by filtration, washing e.g. with excess acetone, and dried at 60 C. in vacuo, giving the product as the hydrochloride salt. If the free base was required (e.g. for further reaction), this was obtained by treatment with a base e.g. triethylamine; purification by chromatography was then performed, if required. (B) Reaction of a product from Procedure (A) with a heteroaryl tin reagent A stirred mixture of the product from Procedure (A), (containing a suitable leaving group such as a chloro or bromo), a heteroaryl stannane and bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium dichloride were heated at reflux in dry dioxane under nitrogen for 24 hours. The resulting mixture was generally purified by chromatography on silica. (C) Reaction of the product from Procedure (A) with a second amine The product of Procedure (A) (containing a suitable leaving group such as chloro) was dissolved in an excess of the desired amine (or a solution thereof) and heated in a pressure vessel (e.g. at 130 C. for 17 hr). The cooled mixture was generally purified by chromatography on silica. (D) Preparation of a substituted aniline An appropriately substituted 4-nitrophenol was heated with an appropriately substituted benzyl halide (1.05 equiv.) and potassium carbonate (3 equiv.) in acetonitrile at reflux until reaction was complete (as judged by TLC). After standard work-up, the 4-benzyloxy-1-nitrobenzene was purified by column chromatography.

Biological Data Compounds of the present invention were tested for protein tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity in a substrate phosphorylation assay and a cell proliferation assay. The substrate phosphorylation assay uses a baculovirus expressed, recombinant construct of the intracellular domain of c-erbB-2 that is constitutively active. The method measures the ability of the isolated enzyme to catalyse the transfer of 33 P-labelled -phosphate from ATP onto tyrosine residues in a synthetic peptide. The enzyme is incubated for 1 hour, at room temperature, with 100 M ATP, 10 mM MnCl 2 , 1 mg/ml PolyGluAlaTyr (6:3:1) and test compound (diluted from a 5 mM stock in DMSO, final DMSO concentration is 2%) in 40 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. The reaction is stopped by the addition of EDTA (final concentration 0.1M) and the peptide is then precipitated onto ion exchange filter paper and the incorporated radioactivity determined. The results are shown in the first column of Table 1 below as the IC 50 values in nM. The cell proliferation assay uses an immortalised human breast epithelial cell line (HB4a) which has been transformed by over-expression of c-erbB-2. Growth of these cells in low serum is dependent upon the c-erbB-2 tyrosine kinase activity. The specificity of the effect of the test compounds on tyrosine kinase dependent growth over general toxicity is assessed by comparison to an HB4a cell line which has been transfected with ras. Cells are plated at 3000/well in 96-well plates in 0.1 ml medium and allowed to attach overnight. test compound is added in 0.1 ml medium, with a final concentration of 0.5% DMSO, and the plates incubated for 4 days at 37 C.

This invention relates to novel compounds useful in therapy, particularly in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. International Patent Application WO 89/05297 discloses a number of substituted quinazoline compounds which are indicated as inhibitors of gastric acid secretion. International Patent Application WO 97/23462 (published after the priority date of this application) discloses quinoline and quinazoline compounds having a 5-phenyl substituent. The compounds are indicated in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. According to the present invention, there is provided a compound of formula I, wherein R 1 represents C 1-4 alkoxy optionally substituted by one or more fluorine atoms; R 2 represents H or C 1-6 alkoxy optionally substituted by one or more fluorine atoms; R 3 represents a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring containing at least one heteroatom selected from N, O and S, the ring being optionally substituted by one or more groups selected from halogen, C 1-4 alkoxy, C 1-4 alkyl and CF 3 ; R 4 represents a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered heterocyclic ring containing at least one heteroatom selected from N, O and S, the ring being optionally fused to a benzene ring or a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring containing at least one heteroatom selected from N, O and S, the ring system as a whole being optionally substituted by one or more groups independently selected from OH, C 1-4 alkyl, C 1-4 alkoxy, halogen, CONR 8 R 9 , SO 2 NR 8 R 9 , (CH 2 ) b NR 8 R 9 and NHSO 2 (C 1-4 alkyl), and when S is a member of the ring system, it may be substituted by one or two oxygen atoms; R 8 and R 9 independently represent H or C 1-4 alkyl, or together with the N atom to which they are attached they may represent a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring containing at least one heteroatom selected from N, O and S; b represents 0, 1, 2 or 3; X represents CH or N; and L is absent, or represents a cyclic group of formula Ia, in which N is attached to the 2-position of the quinoline or quinazoline ring; A is absent or represents CO or SO 2 ; Z represents CH or N; m represents 1 or 2, and in addition, when Z represents CH, it may represent 0; and n represents 1, 2 or 3, provided that the sum of m and n is 2, 3, 4 or 5; or represents a chain of formula Ib, in which N is attached to the 2-position of the quinoline or quinazoline ring; A and Z have the same significance as A and Z above, respectively; R 6 and R 7 independently represent H or C 1-4 alkyl; and p represents 1, 2 or 3, and in addition, when Z represents CH, it may represent 0; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (referred to together herein as the compounds of the invention). Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include acid addition salts, such as hydrochloride and hydrobromide salts, and phosphate salts. Alkyl and alkoxy groups that R 1-4 may represent or include can be straight chain, branched chain, cyclic, or a combination thereof. Preferably, R 3 is an aromatic ring, for example pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, thienyl, furanyl or oxazolyl. Heterocyclic groups that R 4 comprises may be saturated or unsaturated. However, it is preferred that the ring attached to L, or when L is absent, to the quinoline or quinazoline ring, is saturated. The compounds of the invention may be optically active. In particular, they may exhibit atropisomerism about the bond joining R 3 to the rest of the molecule when an R 3 substituent is in the ortho-position of the ring. The invention includes all optical isomers of the compounds of formula I, and all diastereoisomers thereof.

Compounds of formulae XI, XII, XIV, XVIIa, XVIIb, XIX, XXI, XXIIa, XXIIb, XXIIIa, XXIIIb, XXVI, XXIX and XXX are either known or are available using known techniques, as illustrated by the Examples. The intermediate compounds of formulae X, XIIIa, XIIIb, XXII, XXVIIIa and XXVIIIb form a further aspect of the invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that sensitive functional groups may need to be protected and deprotected during synthesis of a compound of the invention. This may be achieved by conventional techniques, for example as described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by T W Greene and P G M Wuts, John Wiley and Sons Inc. 1991. The compounds of the invention are useful because they possess pharmacological activity in animals. In particular, the compounds are useful in the treatment of a number of conditions including hypertension, myocardial infarction, male erectile dysfunction, hyperlipidaemia, cardiac arrhythmia and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The latter condition is of greatest interest. Thus, according to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia which comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention to a patient suffering from such a disorder. The use of the compounds of the invention as pharmaceuticals, and the use of the compounds of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, are also provided. The compounds of the invention may be administered by any convenient route, for example orally, parenterally (e.g intravenously, transdermally) or rectally. The daily dose required will of course vary with the particular compound used, the particular condition being treated and with the severity of that condition. However, in general a total daily dose of from about 0.01 to 10 mg/kg of body weight, and preferably about 0.05 to 1 mg/kg, is suitable, administered from 1 to 4 times a day. Oral administration is of particular interest. The compounds of the invention will generally be administered in the form of a suitable pharmaceutical formulation. Thus, according to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation including preferably less than 50% by weight of a compound of the invention in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. The pharmaceutical formulation is preferably in unit dose form. Such forms include solid dosage forms, for example tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, and suppositories for oral, parenteral or rectal administration; and liquid dosage forms, for example sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, suitably flavoured syrups, flavoured emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil and peanut oil, and elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Solid formulations may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with pharmaceutical carriers, for example conventional tabletting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, gums and other diluents, for example water, to form a homogeneous preformulation formulation in which the active ingredient is uniformly dispersed so that it may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms containing typically from 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient. The solid dosage forms may be coated or otherwise compounded to prolong the action of the formulation. The formulations of the invention may also contain a human 5- reductase inhibitory compound see International Patent Application WO 95/28397, or a compound of the invention could be presented in a pharmaceutical pack also containing a human 5- reductase inhibitory compound as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use. The compounds of the invention may be tested in the screens set out below. Contractile Responses of Human Prostate Prostatic tissue was cut into longitudinal strips (approximately 3210 mm) and suspended in organ baths under a resting tension of 1 g in Krebs Ringer bicarbonate of the following composition (mM): NaCl (119), KCl (4.7), CaCl 2 (2.5), KH 2 PO 4 (1.2), MgSO 4 (1.2), NaHCO 3 (25), glucose (11), and gassed with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 . The solution also contained 10 mM cocaine and 10 mM corticosterone. Tissues were exposed to a sensitising dose of ()-noradrenaline (100 mM) and washed over a 45 minute period. Isometric contractions were obtained in response to cumulative additions of ()-noradrenaline to obtain control curves in all tissues. A further curve was then generated in the presence or absence of antagonist (incubated for 2 hours). Antagonist affinity estimates (pA 2 ) were determined using a single concentration of competing antagonist, pA 2 log A/(DR-1) where the dose ratio (DR), relative to corresponding controls, was produced by a single concentration of antagonist A, assuming competitive antagonism and Schild regression close to unity. Anaesthetised Dog Model of Prostatic Pressure and Blood Pressure Mature male beagles (12-15 kg body weight) were anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbitone (30-50 mg/kg i.v.) and a tracheal cannula was inserted. Subsequent anaesthesia was maintained using pentobarbitone infusion. The animals were respirated with air using a Bird Mk8 respirator (Bird Corp., Palm Springs, Calif., USA) adjusted to maintain blood gasses in the range pO 2 90-110 mm Hg, pCO 2 35-45 mm Hg, pH 7.35-7.45. Body temperature was maintained at 36-37.5 C. using a heated operating table. Catheters were placed into the left femoral artery for recording blood pressure and into the left femoral vein for compound administration. Heart rate was recorded via the lead II E.C.G. A laparotomy was performed to cannulate both ureters to prevent change of fluid volume within the bladder. A 7F cardiac catheter (with a 1.5 ml capacity balloon tip) was inserted into the bladder via the urethra. The balloon was filled with air and the catheter withdrawn until the balloon became lodged in the prostate, which was confirmed by digital pressure. Balloon pressure was recorded via a Druck transducer. Prostatic pressure and haemodynamic parameters were made on a Grass Polygraph (Grass Instruments, Quincy, Mass., U.S.A.) and the data measured on line using a Motorola 68000-based microcomputer system (Motorola Inc., Temple, Ariz., U.S.A.). Compounds were made up in PEG 300 and administered i.v. through a catheter in the femoral vein. Responses to phenylephrine (1-16 g/kg i.v. in saline) were obtained to generate control dose-response curves (two control curves for each experiment). Compounds were administered (in terms of compound base) at 10-300 g/kg i.v. 5 min before construction of phenylephrine curves (constructed up to a maximum dose of 128 g/kg in the presence of test compound). Due to 1 -related dysrhythymic properties of phenylephrine, absolute maximal responses were not obtained but were taken as 10% greater than the control response obtained with 16 g/kg phenylephrine. Drug concentrations were calculated on the basis of molar weight of compound/kg body weight thus allowing a pseudo pA 2 calculation by Schild analysis using dose ratios derived from shifts in the phenylephrine dose-response curves. The compounds of the invention may have the advantage that they are more potent, have a longer duration of action, have a broader range of activity, are more stable, have fewer side effects or are more selective (in particular they may have beneficial effects in benign prostatic hyperplasia without causing undesirable cardiovascular effects, for example because they are able to selectively antagonise prostatic receptor subtypes of the 1 -adrenoceptor), or have other more useful properties than the compounds of the prior art.

The processes for preparing the object compound I are explained in detail in the following. Process 1 The object compound I or its salt can be prepared by reacting a compound II or its salt with a compound III or its salt. Suitable salts of the compounds II and III may be the same as those exemplified for the compound I. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a base such as alkali metal e.g. lithium, sodium, potassium, etc., the hydroxide or carbonate or bicarbonate thereof e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, etc., alkali metal alkoxide e.g. sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, etc., or the like. This reaction is usually carried out in a conventional solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, N,N-dimethylformamide, acetone, or the like. The reaction temperature is not critical, and the reaction is usually carried out under cooling to heating. Process 2 The object compound Ib or its salt can be prepared by acylating a compound Ia or its salt. The acylation is carried out in the presence of an acylating agent. Suitable acylating agents are the corresponding carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid compounds, which are represented by the formula: ROH wherein R is acyl, and reactive derivatives thereof, and the corresponding isocyanate or isothiocyanate compounds.

In case that the acylating agent is liquid, it can also be used as a solvent. In case that the carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid compounds are used as acylating agent in the free acid form or salt form, it is preferable to carry out the reaction in the presence of a conventional condensing agent such as N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or the like. The reaction temperature is not critical and the reaction can be carried out under cooling, at ambient temperature, or under heating. This reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a conventional inorganic base or in the presence of a conventional organic base. Process 3 The object compound Id or its salt can be prepared by acylating a compound Ic or its salt. This reaction can be carried out in substantially the same manner as Process 2, and therefore the reaction mode and reaction condition of this reaction are to be referred to those explained in Process 2.

Suitable reactive derivative at the amino group of the compound IV may be a silyl derivative formed by the reaction of the compound IV with a silyl compound such as bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide or mono(trimethylsilyl)acetamide, or the like. Suitable salts of the compound IV and its reactive derivative can be referred to the organic or inorganic acid addition salts as exemplified for the compound I.

The object compound I and the starting compounds can also be prepared by the methods of Examples and Preparations mentioned below or similar manners thereto or conventional manners. The compounds obtained by the above processes can be isolated and purified by a conventional method such as pulverization, recrystallization, chromatography, reprecipitation or the like. It is to be noted that the compound I and the other compounds may include one or more stereoisomers and geometrical isomers due to asymmetric carbon atoms and double bonds, and all of such isomers and mixture thereof are included within the scope of this invention.

The homogenate was centrifuged (1000g, 20 minutes) to remove tissue clumps and the supernatant was centrifuges (100,000g, 60 minutes) to yield a pellet. The pellet was resuspended in buffer (50 mM TES, 1 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, 140 mg/l bacitracin, 1 mM dithiothreiol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin pH 6.8) and homogenized with a glass-teflon homogenizer to yield suspension which was referred to as crude membrane suspension. The obtained membrane suspension was stored at 80 C. until use. (b) 3 H-Bradykinin binding to the membrane The frozen crude membrane suspension was thawed. In binding assays, 3 H-Bradykinin (0.06 nM) and drug (110 6 M) were incubated with 50 l of the membrane suspension at room temperature for 60 minutes in a final volume of 250 l. Separation of receptor-bound from free 3 H-Bradykinin is achieved by immediate filtration under vacuum and washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5).

CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/084,717, filed May 26, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,037,350 which was the National Stage application under 35 U.S.C. 371 of International Application No. PCT/EP96/04515 filed Oct. 16, 1996, which claims priority from EP95.203.427.0, filed Dec. 8, 1995, the contents of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The present invention is concerned with novel (imidazol-5-yl)methyl-2-quinolinone derivatives, the preparation thereof, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said novel compounds and the use of these compounds as a medicine as well as methods of treatment by administering said compounds. Oncogenes frequently encode protein components of signal transduction pathways which lead to stimulation of cell growth and mitogenesis. Oncogene expression in cultured cells leads to cellular transformation, characterized by the ability of cells to grow in soft agar and the growth of cells as dense foci lacking the contact inhibition exhibited by non-transformed cells. Mutation and/or overexpression of certain oncogenes is frequently associated with human cancer. A particular group of oncogenes is known as ras which have been identified in mammals, birds, insects, mollusks, plants, fungi and yeasts. The family of mammalian ras oncogenes consists of three major members (isoforms): H-ras, K-ras and N-ras oncogenes. These ras oncogenes code for highly related proteins generically known as p21 ras . Once attached to plasma membranes, the mutant or oncogenic forms of p21 ras will provide a signal for the transformation and uncontrolled growth of malignant tumor cells. To acquire this transforming potential, the precursor of the p21 ras oncoprotein must undergo an enzymatically catalyzed farnesylation of the cysteine residue located in a carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide. Therefore, inhibitors of the enzyme that catalyzes this modification, farnesyl protein transferase, will prevent the membrane attachment of p21 ras and block the aberrant growth of ras-transformed tumors. Hence, it is generally accepted in the art that farnesyl transferase inhibitors can be very useful as anticancer agents for tumors in which ras contributes to transformation. Since mutated, oncogenic forms of ras are frequently found in many human cancers, most notably in more than 50% of colon and pancreatic carcinomas (Kohl et al., Science, vol 260, 1834-1837, 1993), it has been suggested that farnesyl tranferase inhibitors can be very useful against these types of cancer. In EP-0,371,564 there are described (1H-azol-1-ylmethyl) substituted quinoline and quinolinone derivatives which suppress the plasma elimination of retinoic acids. Some of these compounds also have the ability to inhibit the formation of androgens from progestines and/or inhibit the action of the aromatase enzyme complex. Unexpectedly, it has been found that the present novel compounds, all having a phenyl substituent on the 4-position of the 2-quinolinone-moiety and wherein the imidazole moiety is bound via a carbon atom to the rest of the molecule, show farnesyl protein transferase inhibiting activity.

The compounds of formula (I), wherein X is oxygen, said compounds being represented by formula (I-a), may be prepared by hydrolysing an intermediate ether of formula (II), wherein R is C 1-6 alkyl, according to art-known methods, such as stirring the intermediate of formula (II) in an aqueous acid solution. An appropriate acid is for instance hydrochloric acid. Subsequently the resulting quinolinone wherein R 1 is hydrogen may be transformed into a quinolinone, wherein R 1 has a meaning as defined hereinabove apart from hydrogen, by art-known N-alkylation. The compounds of formula (I), wherein R 8 is hydroxy, said compounds being referred to as compounds of formula (I-b) may be prepared by reacting an intermediate ketone of formula (III) with a intermediate of formula (IV-a), wherein P is an optional protective group such as, for example, a sulfonyl group, e.g. a dimethylamino sulfonyl group, which can be removed after the addition reaction. Said reaction requires the presence of a suitable strong base, such as, for example, butyl lithium in an appropriate solvent, such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran and the presence an appropriate silanederivative, such as, for example, triethylchlorosilane. During the work-up procedure an intermediate silane derivative is hydrolyzed. Other procedures with protective groups analogous to silanederivatives can also be applied. Compounds of formula (I-b-1), being compounds of formula (I-b) wherein the dotted line is a bond and R 1 is hydrogen, can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (XXI) with an intermediate of formula (IV-a), as described hereinabove for the synthesis of compounds of formula (I-b). The thus obtained intermediate of formula (XXII) undergoes ring opening of the isoxazole moiety by stirring it with an acid, such as, e.g. TiCl 3 , in the presence of water. Subsequent treatment of an intermediate of formula (XXIII) with a suitable reagent such as, e.g. R 17 CH 2 COCl or R 17 CH 2 COOC 2 H 5 , yields either directly a compound of formula (I-b-1) or an intermediate which can be converted to a compound of formula (1-b-1) by treatment with a base such as, e.g. potassium tert-butoxide. Intermediates of formula (XXI) can conveniently be prepared by treating an intermediate of formula (XVI), described hereinafter, under acidic conditions. Compounds of formula (I) wherein R 8 is a radical of formula NR 11 R 12 , said compounds being represented by formula (I-g) may be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (XIII), wherein W is an appropriate leaving group such as, for example, halo, with a reagent of formula (XIV). Said reaction may be performed by stirring the reactants in an appropriate solvent such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran. The compounds of formula (I) may also be prepared by converting compounds of formula (I) into other compounds of formula (I). Compounds wherein the dotted line represents a bond can be converted into compounds wherein the dotted line does not represent a bond, by art-known hydrogenation methods. Vice versa, compounds wherein the dotted line does not represent a bond may be converted into compounds wherein the dotted line represents a bond by art-known oxidation reactions. Compounds of formula (I) wherein R 8 is hydroxy, said compounds being represented by formula (I-b) may be converted into compounds of formula (I-c), wherein R 8a has the meaning of R 10 except for hydrogen, by art-know O-alkylation or O-acylation reactions; such as, for instance, reacting the compound of formula (I-b) with an alkylating reagent such as R 8a W in appropriate conditions, such as, for example, a dipolar aprotic solvent, e.g. DMF, in the presence of a base, e.g. sodium hydride. W is a suitable leaving group, such as, for example, halo or a sulfonylgroup. As an alternative to the above reaction procedure, compounds of formula (I-c) may also be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (I-b) with a reagent of formula R 8a OH in acidic medium. Compounds of formula (1-b) may also be converted into compounds of formula (I-g), wherein R 11 is hydrogen and R 12 is C 1-6 alkylcarbonyl, by reacting compounds of formula (I-b) in acidic medium, such as sulfuric acid, with C 1-16 alkylCN in a Ritter type reaction. Further, compounds of formula (I-b) may also be converted into compounds of formula (I-g), wherein R 11 and R 12 are hydrogen, by reacting compounds (I-b) with ammonium acetate and subsequent treatment with NH 3 (aq.). Compounds of formula (I-b) may also be converted into compounds of formula (I-d), wherein R 8 is hydrogen, by submitting the compounds of formula (I-b) to appropriate reducing conditions, such as, stirring in trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of an appropriate reducing agent, such as sodium borohydride or alternatively stirring the compounds of formula (I-b) in acetic acid in the presence of formamide. Furthermore, compounds of formula (I-d) wherein R 8 is hydrogen may be converted into compounds of formula (I-e) wherein R 8b is C 1-6 alkyl by reacting compounds of formula (I-d) with a reagent of formula (V) in an appropriate solvent, such as, for instance, diglyme in the presence of a base such as, for example, potassium butoxide. A compound of formula (I-f), defined as a compound of formula (I) wherein X is sulfur may be prepared by reacting the corresponding compound of formula (I-a), with a reagent like phosphorus pentasulfide or Lawessons reagent in a suitable solvent such as, for example, pyridine. Compounds of formula of formula (I), wherein R 1 is hydrogen and X is oxygen, said compounds being defined as compounds of formula (I-a-1) may be prepared by reacting a nitrone of formula (VI) with the an hydride of a carboxylic acid, such as, for example, acetic anhydride, thus forming the corresponding ester on the 2 position of the quinoline moiety. Said quinoline ester can be hydrolyzed in situ to the corresponding quinolinone using a base such as for example, potassium carbonate. Alternatively, compounds of formula (I-a-1) can be prepared by reacting a nitrone of formula (VI) with a sulfonyl containing electrophilic reagent such as, for example, p-toluenesulfonylchloride in the presence of a base such as, for example, aqueous potassium carbonate. The reaction initially involves the formation of a 2-hydroxy-quinoline derivative which is subsequently tautomerized to the desired quinolinone derivative. The application of art-known conditions of phase transfer catalysis may enhance the rate of the reaction. Compounds of formula (I-a-1) may also be prepared by an intramolecular photochemical rearrangement of compounds of formula (VI). Said rearrangement can be carried out by dissolving the reagents in a reaction-inert solvent and irradiating at a wavelength of 366 nm. It is advantageous to use degassed solutions and to conduct the reaction under an inert atmosphere such as, for example, oxygen free argon or nitrogen gas, in order to minimize undesired side reactions or reduction of quantum yield. The compounds of formula (I) may also be converted into each other via art-known reactions or functional group transformations. A number of such transformations are already described hereinabove. Other examples are hydrolysis of carboxylic esters to the corresponding carboxylic acid or alcohol; hydrolysis of amides to the corresponding carboxylic acids or amines; hydrolysis of nitriles to the corresponding amides; amino groups on imidazole or phenyl may be replaced by a hydrogen by art-known diazotation reactions and subsequent replacement of the diazo-group by hydrogen; alcohols may be converted into esters and ethers; primary amines may be converted into secondary or tertiary amines; double bonds may be hydrogenated to the corresponding single bond. Intermediates of formula (III) may be prepared by reacting a quinolinone derivative of formula (VIII) with an intermediate of formula (IX) or a functional derivative thereof under appropriate conditions, such as, for example, a strong acid, e.g. polyphosphoric acid in an appropriate solvent. The intermediate of formula (VIII) may be formed by cyclization of an intermediate of formula (VII) by stirring in the presence of a strong acid, e.g. polyphosphoric acid. Optionally said cyclization reaction may be followed by an oxidation step, which can be performed by stirring the intermediate formed after cyclization in an appropriate solvent, such as, for example, a halogenated aromatic solvent, e.g. bromobenzene, in the presence of a oxidizing agent, e.g. bromine or iodine. At this stage it may also be appropriate to change the R 1 substituent by art-known functional group transformation reaction. Intermediates of formula (III-a-1), being intermediates of formula (III) wherein the dotted line is a bond, R 1 and R 17 are hydrogen and X is oxygen, can be prepared starting from an intermediate of formula (XVII), which is conveniently prepared by protecting the corresponding ketone. Said intermediate of formula (XVII) is stirred with an intermediate of formula (XVIII) in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, in an appropriate solvent, such as an alcohol, e.g. methanol. The thus obtained intermediate of formula (XVI) undergoes hydrolysis of the ketal and ring opening of the isoxazole moiety by stirring the intermediate of formula (XVI) with an acid, such as for example, TiCl 3 , in the presence of water. Subsequently acetic anhydride is used to prepare an intermediate of formula (XV), which undergoes ring closure in the presence of a base such as, for example, potassium tert-butoxide. Intermediates of formula (III-a-1) can easily be converted to intermediates of formula (III-a), defined as intermediates of formula (III) wherein the dotted line represents a bond, X is oxygen, R 17 is hydrogen and R 1 is other than hydrogen, using art-known N-alkylation procedures. An alternative way to prepare intermediates of formula (III-a-1), wherein X is oxygen and R 1 is hydrogen, starts from an intermediate of formula (XVI), which is conveniently converted to intermediates of formula (XIX) using catalytic hydrogenation conditions, e.g. by using hydrogen gas and palladium on carbon in a reaction-inert solvent such as, e.g. tetrahydrofuran. Intermediates of formula (XIX) are converted to intermediates of formula (XX) by submitting intermediates (XIX) to an acetylation reaction, e.g. by treatment with the anhydride of a carboxylic acid, e.g. acetic anhydride in a reaction-inert solvent, e.g. toluene, and subsequent treatment with a base such as, e.g. potassium tert-butoxide in a reaction-inert solvent, e.g. 1,2-dimethoxyethane. Intermediates of formula (III-a-1) can be obtained by treating intermediates of formula (XX) in acidic conditions. Intermediates of formula (II) may be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (X), wherein W is an appropriate leaving group, such as, for example, halo, with an intermediate ketone of formula (XI). This reaction is performed by converting the intermediate of formula (X) into a organometallic compound, by stirring it with a strong base such as butyl lithium and subsequently adding the intermediate ketone of formula (XI). Although this reaction gives at first instance a hydroxy derivative (i.e. R 8 is hydroxy), said hydroxy derivative can be converted into other intermediates wherein R 8 has another definition by performing art-known (functional group) transformations. The intermediate nitrones of formula (VI) may be prepared by N-oxidizing quinoline derivatives of formula (XII) with an appropriate oxidizing agent such as, for example, m-chloro-peroxybenzoic acid or H 2 O 2 in an appropriate solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane. Said N-oxidation may also be carried out on a precursor of a quinoline of formula (XII). The intermediates of formula (XII) are supposed to be metabolized in vivo into compounds of formula (I) via intermediates of formula (VI). Hence, intermediates of formula (XII) and (VI) may act as prodrugs of compounds of formula (I). The compounds of formula (I) and some of the intermediates have at least one stereogenic center in their structure. This stereogenic center may be present in a R or a S configuration. The compounds of formula (I) as prepared in the hereinabove described processes are generally racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of formula (I) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials. This invention provides a method for inhibiting the abnormal growth of cells, including transformed cells, by administering an effective amount of a compound of the invention. Abnormal growth of cells refers to cell growth independent of normal regulatory mechanisms (e.g. loss of contact inhibition). This includes the abnormal growth of: (1) tumor cells (tumors) expressing an activated ras oncogene; (2) tumor cells in which the ras protein is activated as a result of oncogenic mutation of another gene; (3) benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant ras activation occurs. Furthermore, it has been suggested in literature that ras oncogenes not only contribute to the growth of of tumors in vivo by a direct effect on tumor cell growth but also indirectly, i.e. by facilitating tumor-induced angiogenesis (Rak. J. et al, Cancer Research, 55, 4575-4580, 1995). Hence, pharmacologically targetting mutant ras oncogenes could conceivably suppress solid tumor growth in vivo, in part, by inhibiting tumor-induced angiogenesis. This invention also provides a method for inhibiting tumor growth by administering an effective amount of a compound of the present invention, to a subject, e.g. a mammal (and more particularly a human) in need of such treatment. In particular, this invention provides a method for inhibiting the growth of tumors expressing an activated ras oncogene by the administration of an effective amount of the compounds of the present invention. Examples of tumors which may be inhibited, but are not limited to, lung cancer (e.g. adenocarcinoma), pancreatic cancers (e.g. pancreatic carcinoma such as, for example exocrine pancreatic carcinoma), colon cancers (e.g. colorectal carcinomas, such as, for example, colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma), hematopoietic tumors of lymphoid lineage (e.g. acute lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, Burkitts lymphoma), myeloid leukemias (for example, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)), thyroid follicular cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), tumors of mesenchymal origin (e.g. fibrosarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas), melanomas, teratocarcinomas, neuroblastomas, gliomas, benign tumor of the skin (e.g. keratoacanthomas), breast carcinoma, kidney carninoma, ovary carcinoma, bladder carcinoma and epidermal carcinoma. This invention may also provide a method for inhibiting proliferative diseases, both benign and malignant, wherein ras proteins are aberrantly activated as a result of oncogenic mutation in genes, i.e. the ras gene itself is not activated by mutation to an oncogenic mutation to an oncogenic form, with said inhibition being accomplished by the administration of an effective amount of the compounds described herein, to a subject in need of such a treatment. For example, the benign proliferative disorder neurofibromatosis, or tumors in which ras is activated due to mutation or overexpression of tyrosine kinase oncogenes may be inhibited by the compounds of this invention. Hence, the present invention discloses the compounds of formula (I) for use as a medicine as well as the use of these compounds of formula (I) for the manufacture of a medicament for treating one or more of the above mentioned conditions. Some of the intermediates of formual (XIII), wherein W is halo may also show farnesyl protein transferase inhibiting activity. In view of their useful pharmacological properties, the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of a particular compound, in base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, to aid solubility for example, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause a significant deleterious effect to the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. Those skilled in the art could easily determine the effective amount from the test results presented hereinafter. In general it is contemplated that an effective amount would be 35 from 0.0001 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg body weight, and in particular from 0.001 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 0.01 to 500 mg, and in particular 0.1 mg to 200 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form. Experimental part Hereinafter THF means tetrahydrofuran, DIPE means diisopropylether, DCM means dichloromethane, DMF means N,N-dimethylformamide and ACN means acetonitrile. Of some compounds of formula (I) the absolute stereochemical configuration was not experimentally determined. In those cases the stereochemically isomeric form which was first isolated is designated as A and the second as B, without further reference to the actual stereochemical configuration. A.

Pharmacological example EXAMPLE C. 1 In vitro Assay for Inhibition of Farnesyl Protein Transferase. Human farnesyl protein transferase was prepared essentially as described (Y. Reiss et al., Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology vol 1, 241-245, 1990). Kirsten virus transformed human osteosarcoma (KHOS) cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md., USA) grown as solid tumors in nude mice or grown as monolayer cell cultures were used as a source of human enzyme. Briefly, cells or tumors were homogenized in buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (pH 7.5). The homogenates were centrifuged 28,000g for 60 min and the supernatants collected. A 30-50% ammonium sulfate fraction was prepared, and the resulting precipitate was resuspended in a small (10 to 20 ml) volume of dialysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 20 M ZnCl 2 . The ammonium sulfate fraction was dialyzed overnight against two changes of the same buffer. The dialyzed material was applied to a 101 cm Q Fast Flow Sepharose (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc., Piscataway, N.J., USA) which had been preequilibrated with 100 ml of dialysis buffer supplemented with 0.05M NaCl. The column was washed with an additional 50 ml of dialysis buffer plus 0.05M NaCl followed by a gradient from 0.05M to 0.25M NaCl prepared in dialysis buffer. The enzyme activity was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.25 to 1.0M NaCl prepared in the dialysis buffer. Fractions containing 4 to 5 ml volumes of column eluate were collected and analyzed for farnesyl protein transferase activity. Fractions with enzyme activity were pooled and supplemented with 100 M ZnCl 2 . Enzyme samples were stored frozen at 70 C. The activity of farnesyl protein transferase was measured using the Farnesyl Transferase 3 H Scintillation Proximity Assay (Amersham International plc., England) under the conditions specified by the manufacturer. To assay for inhibitors of the enzyme, 0.20 Ci of the 3 H-farnesylpyrophosphate substrate and the biotinylated lamin B peptide substrate (biotin-YRASNRSCAIM) were mixed with test compounds in a reaction buffer consisting of 50 mM HEPES, 30 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM KCl, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.01% Triton X-100. Test compounds were delivered in a 10 l volume of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to achieve concentrations of 1 and 10 g/ml in a final volume of 100 l. The reaction mixture was warmed to 37 C. The enzyme reaction was started by adding 20 l of diluted human farnesyl protein transferase. Sufficient enzyme preparation was added to produce between 4000 to 15000 cpm of reaction product during the 60 min of reaction incubation at 37 C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of STOP/scintillation proximity bead reagent (Amersham). The reaction product 3 H-(Cys)-biotin lamin B peptide was captured on the streptavidin linked scintillation proximity bead. The amount of 3 H-farnesyl-(Cys)-biotin lamin B peptide synthesized in the presence or absence of test compounds was quantified as cpm by counting on a Wallac Model 1480 Microbeta Liquid Scintillation Counter. The cpm of product was considered to be farnesyl protein transferase activity. The protein farnesyl transferase activity observed in the presence of test compound was normalized to farnesyl transferase activity in the presence of 10% DMSO and expressed as per cent inhibition. In separate studies, some test compounds exhibiting 50% or greater inhibition of farnesyl protein transferase activity were evaluated for concentration-dependent inhibition of enzyme activity. The effects of test compounds in these studies were calculated as IC 50 (concentration of test compound producing 50% inhibition of enzyme activity) using the LGIC50 computer program written by the Science Information Division of R.

Insertion of activated oncogenes such as the mutant ras gene into mouse NIH 3T3 cells converts the cells to a transformed phenotype. The cells become tumorigenic, display anchorage independent growth in semi-solid medium and lose contact inhibition. Loss of contact inhibition produces cell cultures which no longer form uniform monolayers. Rather, the cells pile up into multicellular nodules and grow to very high saturation densities in plastic tissue culture dishes. Agents such as protein farnesyl transferase inhibitors which revert the ras transformed phenotype restore the uniform monolayer growth pattern to cells in culture. This reversion is easily monitored by counting the number of cells in tissue culture plates. Transformed cells will achieve higher cell numbers than cells which have reverted to an untransformed phenotype. Compounds which revert the transformed phenotype should produce antitumor effects in tumors bearing ras gene mutations. Method: Compounds are screened in tissue culture in NIH 3T3 cells transformed by the T24 activated human H-ras gene. Cells are seeded at an initial density of 200,000 cells per well (9.6 cm 2 surface area) in six-well cluster tissue culture plates. Test compounds are immediately added to 3.0 ml cell growth medium in a 3.0 l volume of DMSO, with a final concentration of DMSO in the cell growth medium of 0.1%. The test compounds are run at concentrations of 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500 nM along with a DMSO treated vehicle control. (In case a high activity is observed at 5 nM, the test compound is tested at even lower concentrations.) The cells are allowed to proliferate for 72 hours. Then the cells are detached in 1.0 ml trypsin-EDTA cell dissociation medium and counted on a Coulter particle counter. Measurements: Cell numbers expressed as cells per well are measured using a Coulter Particle Counter. All cell counts were corrected for the initial cell input density by subtracting 200,000. Control cell countscell counts from cells incubated with DMSO vehicle200,000 Test compound cell countscell counts from cells incubated with test compound200,000. IC 50 (i.e. the test compound concentration required to inhibit enzyme activity by 50%) is calculated if sufficient data are available, summarized in table 11. TABLE 11 Co. No. IC 50 (nM) Co.

The enzyme farnesyl protein transferase catalyzes the covalent attachment of a farnesyl moiety derived from farnesyl pyrophosphate to the oncogene product p21 ras . This directs p21 ras to attach to plasma membranes. Once attached to plasma membranes, mutant or oncogenic forms of p21 ras will provide a signal for the transformation and uncontrolled growth of malignant tumor cells. Therefore, inhibitors of protein farnesyltransferase will prevent the membrane attachment of p21 ras and inhibit growth of ras-transformed tumors. Nude mice are inoculated with 110 6 of T24 activated human H-ras gene transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells (T24 cells), subcutaneously in the inguinal region. After three days to allow tumors to become established, treatment with test compounds is begun via the oral route. The test compounds are dissolved in a 20% -cyclodextrin in 0.1N HCl solution and administered orally as 0.1 ml of compound solution per 10 g mouse body weight. Routinely used doses are 6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg/kg. Body weights and tumor sizes are monitored during the ensuing 15 days of treatment. At the end of treatment, animals are sacrificed and tumors are weighed. The mean vehicle treated tumor weight is defined as the mean tumor weight from 10 to 15 mice treated with the test compound. The mean tumor weight is defined as the mean tumor weight from 10 to 15 mice not treated with the test compound. TABLE 12 % reduction final tumor weight Co.

CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of international application PCT/EP96/05883 filed Dec. 20, 1996, which designated the United States and is now abandoned. This invention concerns 1-(1,2-disubstituted piperidinyl)-4-substituted piperidine derivatives having tachykinin antagonistic activity, in particular substance P antagonistic activity, and their preparation; it further relates to compositions comprising them, as well as their use as a medicine. Substance P is a naturally occurring neuropeptide of the tachykinin family. There are ample studies showing that substance P and other tachykinins are involved in a variety of biological actions, and therefore, play an essential role in various disorders (Regoli et al., Pharmacological Reviews 46(4), 1995, p. 551-599, Receptors and Antagonists for Substance P and Related Peptides). The development of tachykinin antagonists has led to date to a series of peptide compounds of which might be anticipated that they are metabolically too labile to be employed as pharmaceutically active substances (Longmore J. et al., DNP 8(1), February 1995, p. 5-23, Neurokinin Receptors). The present invention concerns nonpeptide tachykinin antagonists, in particular nonpeptide substance P antagonists, which in general are metabolically more stable, and hence, may be more appropriate as pharmaceutically active substances. Several nonpeptide tachykinin antagonists are disclosed in the art. For instance, EP-0,532,456-A, (Ciba-Geigy) published on Mar. 17, 1993, discloses 1-acylpiperidine compounds, in particular 2arylalkyl-1-arylcarbonyl-4-piperidinamine derivatives, and their use as substance P antagonists. EP-0,151,824-A(JAB 435) and EP-0,151,826-A(JAB 436) disclose structurally related 1-(1-carbonyl or imino)-4piperidinyl)-4-piperidinamine derivatives as histamine- and serotonine antagonists. The present compounds differ from the art compounds by their structure and by their favourable pharmacological properties.

The heterocycles in the definition of Het are preferably connected to the rest of the molecule, i.e. X, C(Q) or C 1-6 alkyl, by a carbon atom. As used in the foregoing definitions and hereinafter, halo is generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo; C 1-4 alkyl defines straight and branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, 1-methylethyl, 2methylpropyl and the like; C 1-6 alkyl is meant to include C 1-4 alkyl and the higher homologues thereof having 5 to 6 carbon atoms such as, for example, pentyl, 2-methylbutyl, hexyl, 2-methylpentyl and the like; C 1-4 alkanediyl defines bivalent straight and branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as, for example, methylene, 1,2-ethanediyl, 1,3propanediyl, 1,4butanediyl, and the like: C 1-6 alkanediyl is meant to include C 1-4 alkanediyl and the higher homologues thereof having from 5 to 6 carbon atoms such as, for example, 1,5-pentanediyl, 1,6hexanedinyl and the like.

Such solvates are for example hydrates, alcoholates and the like. For isolation and purification purposes, it is also possible to use pharmaceutically unacceptable salts. Only the pharmaceutically acceptable, non-toxic salts are used therapeutically and those salts are therefore preferred. The term stereochemically isomeric forms as used hereinbefore defines all the possible isomeric as well as conformational forms which the compounds of formula (I) may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture, more in particular the racemic mixture, of all possible stereochemically and conformationally isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers, enantiomers and/or conformers of the basic molecular structure. More in particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration; CNR 3 and C 3-6 alkenyl radicals may have the E- or Z-configuration. For the compounds having two stereogenic centers, the relative stereodescriptors R* and S* are used in accordance with the Chemical Abstracts rules (Chemical Substance Name Selection Manual (CA), 1982 Edition, Vol. III, Chapter 20). All stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) both in pure form or mixtures thereof are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention. Some of the compounds of formula (I) may also exist in their tautomeric form. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. For instance, compounds of formula (I) wherein X is NH and Q is O or R 5 is a radical of formula (a-1) or (a-2), may exist in their corresponding tautomeric form. The N-oxide forms of the compounds of formula (I) are meant to comprise those compounds of formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called N-oxide, particularly those N-oxides wherein one or more of the piperidine-nitrogens are N-oxidized. Whenever used hereinafter, the term compounds of formula (I) is meant to also include their N-oxide forms, their pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts, and their stereochemically isomeric forms.

The compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by reductively N-alkylating an intermediate of formula (III) with an intermediate of formula (II). Said reductive N-alkylation may be performed in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane, ethanol, toluene or a mixture thereof, and in the presence of a reducing agent such as, for example, a borohydride, e.g. sodium borohydride, sodium cyano-borohydride or triacetoxy borohydride. In case a borohydride is used as a reducing agent, it may be convenient to use a catalyst such as, for example, titanium(IV) isopropylate as described in J. Org. Chem, 1990, 55, 2552-2554. Using said catalyst may also result in an improved cis/trans ratio in favour of the trans isomer. It may also be convenient to use hydrogen as a reducing agent in combination with a suitable catalyst such as, for example, palladium-on-charcoal or platinum-on-charcoal. In case hydrogen is used as reducing agent, it may be advantageous to add a dehydrating agent to the reaction mixture such as, for example, aluminum tert-butoxide. In order to prevent the undesired further hydrogenation of certain functional groups in the reactants and the reaction products, it may also be advantageous to add an appropriate catalyst-poison to the reaction mixture, e.g., thiophene or quinoline-sulphur. Stirring and optionally elevated temperatures and/or pressure may enhance the rate of the reaction. In this and the following preparations, the reaction products may be isolated from the reaction medium and, if necessary, further purified according to methodologies generally known in the art such as, for example, extraction, crystallization, trituration and chromatography. The compounds of formula (I) can also be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (IV) wherein W 1 is an appropriate leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, e.g. chloro or bromo, or a sulfonyloxy leaving group, e.g. methanesulfonyloxy or benzenesulfonyloxy, with an intermediate of formula (V). The reaction can be performed in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane, an alcohol, e.g. ethanol, or a ketone, e.g. methyl isobutylketone, and in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate or triethylamine. Stirring may enhance the rate of the reaction. The reaction may conveniently be carried out at a temperature ranging between RT and reflux temperature. The compounds of formula (I) may also be prepared by reacting a piperidinone derivative of formula (VI) with an appropriate organometallic reagent of formula (VII) wherein R 4 is the same as R 4 but other than hydrogen and M is an organometallic part such as, e.g. MgBr, yielding compounds of formula (I) wherein R 5 is OH, said compounds being represented by formula (I-a). As outlined below, compounds of formula (I) may be converted into each other using art-known transformations. For instance, compounds of formula (I) wherein R 5 is OH may be converted into compounds of formula (I) wherein R 5 is Ar 3 C 1-6 alkyloxy, di(Ar 3 )C 1-6 alkyloxy or a radical of formula (a-1) wherein Y is O. Also, compounds of formula (I) wherein R 5 is NR 7 H may be converted into compounds of formula (I) wherein R 5 is NR 7 R 8 , R 8 being other than hydrogen; or wherein R 5 is a radical of formula (a-1) wherein Y is NR 7 . Further, compounds of formula (I) wherein R 5 is a radical of formula (a-2) wherein R 10 is hydrogen may be converted into compounds of formula (I) wherein R 5 is a radical of formula (a-2) wherein R 10 is a C 1-6 alkylcarbonyl. The compounds of formula (I) may also be converted to the corresponding N-oxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its N-oxide form. Said N-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alkanols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents. The starting materials and some of the intermediates are known compounds and are commercially available or may be prepared according to conventional reaction procedures generally known in the art. For example, intermediates of formula (III), (IV), (VII) and (XI) may be prepared according to art-known procedures. Intermediates of formula (II) may be prepared by condensing an intermediate of formula (IV) with an intermediate of formula (VIII) analogous to the procedure described in EP-0,532,456-A. The preparation of intermediates of formula (VIII) is also described in EP-0,532,456-A. However, intermediates of formula (VIII) wherein R 1 is optionally substituted Ar 1 C 1-6 alkyl or di(Ar 1 )C 1-6 alkyl, said R 1 being represented by CH(R 1a ) 2 and said intermediates being represented by formula (VIII-a), may also be prepared as depicted in scheme 1. In scheme 1, the intermediates of formula (IX-b) may be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (IX-a) with an aldehyde or a ketone of formula (X). The C 1-6 alkyl-carbamate moiety in the intermediates of formula (IX-b) may be converted into a fused oxazolone which in turn may be reduced to an intermediate of formula (IX-d). Said intermediate (IX-d) may in turn be deprotected, thus forming an intermediate of formula (VIII-a). Subsequently, intermediates of formula (VIII-a) may be reacted with an intermediate of formula (IV) to prepare intermediates of formula (II) wherein R 1 is defined as CH(R 1a ) 2 , said intermediates being represented by formula (II-a). The reactions performed in scheme 1 may all be conducted following conventional methods that are generally known in the art. Intermediates of formula (V) may suitably be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (VIII-1), being a protected intermediate of formula (VIII) with a protecting group P 1 such as, for example, a C 1-6 alkyloxycarbonyl group, with an intermediate of formula (III) according to the previously described reductive N-alkylation procedure, and subsequently deprotecting the thus formed intermediate. In particular, intermediates of formula (V) wherein R 1 is CH(R 1a ) 2 , said intermediates being represented by formula (V-a), may be prepared as is depicted in scheme 2. The ketalized intermediate of formula (IX-c) may be transformed to the corresponding ketone of formula (IX-e) which subsequently may be reductively aminated with a pyrrolidine, piperidine- or homopiperidine derivative of formula (III). The thus obtained intermediate may then be reduced with a suitable reducing agent to an intermediate of formula (V-a). Piperidinone derivatives of formula (VI) may be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (II) with an intermediate of formula (XI), according to the previously described N-alkylation procedure, followed by deprotection. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. Diastereomers may be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques, e.g., counter-current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like. The compounds of formula (I) as prepared in the hereinabove described processes are generally racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of formula (I) which are sufficiently basic or acidic may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid, respectively chiral base. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali or acid. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereo-specifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials. The compounds of formula (I) have valuable pharmacological properties in that they interact with tachykinin receptors and they antagonize tachykinin-induced effects, especially substance P-induced effects, both in vivo and in vitro and are thus of use in the treatment of tachykinin-mediated diseases, and in particular in substance P-mediated diseases. Tachykinins, also referred to as neurokinins, are a family of peptides among which substant P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), neurokinin B (NKB) and neuropeptide K (NPK) may be identified. They are naturally occurring in mammals, including human beings, and are distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system, where they act as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. Their actions are mediated through several subtypes of receptors, such as, for example, NK 1 , NK 2 and NK 3 receptors. Substance P displays highest affinity for NK 1 receptors, whereas NKA preferentially binds to NK 2 receptors and NKB preferentially binds to NK 3 receptors. However, the selectivity of these tachykinins is relatively poor and under physiological conditions the action of any of these tachykinins might be mediated by activation of more than one receptor type. Substance P and other neurokinins are involved in a variety of biological actions such as pain transmission (nociception), neurogenic inflammation, smooth muscle contraction, plasma protein extravasation, vasodilation, secretion, mast cell degranulation, and also in activation of the immune system. A number of diseases are deemed to be engendered by activation of neurokinin receptors, in particular the NK 1 receptor, by excessive release of substance P and other neurokinins in particular cells such as cells in the neuronal plexi of the gastrointestinal tract, unmyelinated primary sensor afferent neurons, sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons and nonneuronal cell types (DNP 8(1), February 1995, p. 5-23, Neurokinin Receptors by Longmore J. et al.; Pharmacological Reviews 46(4), 1994, p. 551-599, Receptors and Antagonists for Substance P and Related Peptides by Regoli et al.). The compounds of the present invention are potent inhibitors of neurokinin-mediated effects, in particular those mediated via the NK 1 receptor, and may therefore be described as tachykinin antagonists, especially as substance P antagonists, as indicated in vitro by the antagonism of substance P-induced relaxation of pig coronary arteries which is described hereinafter. The binding affinity of the present compounds for the human, guinea-pig and gerbil neurokinin receptors may be determined in vitro in a receptor binding test using 3 H-substance P as radioligand. The subject compounds also show substance-P antagonistic activity in vivo as may be evidenced by, for instance, the antagonism of substance P-induced plasma extravasation in guinea-pigs, or the antagonism of drug-induced emesis in ferrets (Watson et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 115, 84-94, 1995). In view of their capability to antagonize the actions of tachykinins by blocking the tachykinin receptors, and in particular antagonizing the actions of substance P by blocking the NK 1 receptor, the subject compounds are useful in the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of tachykinin-mediated diseases such as, for example, pain, in particular traumatic pain such as postoperative pain; traumatic avulsion pain such as brachial plexus; chronic pain such as arthritic pain such as occurring in osteo-, rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis; neuropathic pain such as post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, segmental or intercostal neuralgia, fibromyalgia, causalgia, peripheral neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, AIDS-related neuropathy, occipital neuralgia, geniculate neuralgia, glossopharyngeal neuralgia, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, phantom limb pain; various forms of headache such as migraine, acute or chronic tension headache, temperomandibular pain, maxillary sinus pain, cluster headache; odontalgia; cancer pain; pain of visceral origin; gastrointestinal pain; nerve entrapment pain; sports injury pain; dysmennorrhoea; menstrual pain; meningitis; arachnoiditis; musculoskeletal pain; low back pain e.g. spinal stenosis; prolapsed disc; sciatica; angina; ankylosing spondyolitis; gout; burns; scar pain; itch; and thalamic pain such as post stroke thalamic pain; respiratory and inflammatory diseases, in particular inflammation in asthma, influenza, chronic bronchitis and rheumatoid arthritis; inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract such as Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug induced damage; inflammatory diseases of the skin such as herpes and eczema; inflammatory diseases of the bladder such as cystitis and urge incontinence; and eye and dental inflammation; emesis, i.e. nausea, retching and vomiting, including acute emesis, delayed emesis and anticipatory emesis, no matter how emesis is induced, for example, emesis may be induced by drugs such as cancer chemotherapeutic agents such as alkylating agents, e.g. cyclophosphamide, carmustine, lomustine and chlorambucil; cytotoxic antibiotics, e.g. dactinomycin, doxorubicin, mitomycin-C and bleomycin; anti-metabolites, e.g. cytarabine, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil; vinca alkaloids, e.g. etoposide, vinblastine and vincristine; and others such as cisplatin, dacarbazine, procarbazine and hydroyurea; and combinations thereof; radiation sickness; radiation therapy, e.g. irradiation of the thorax or abdomen, such as in the treatment of cancer; poisons; toxins such as toxins caused by metabolic disorders or by infection, e.g. gastritis, or released during bacterial or viral gastrointestinal infection; pregnancy; vestibular disorders, such as motion sickness, vertigo, dizziness and Menieres disease; post-operative sickness; gastrointestinal obstruction; reduced gastrointestinal motility; visceral pain, e.g. myocardial infarction or peritonitis; migraine; increased intereranial pressure; decreased intercranial pressure (e.g. altitude sickness); opioid analgesics, such as morphine; and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, acid indigestion, over-indulgence of food or drink, acid stomach, sour stomach, waterbrash/regurgitation, heartburn, such as episodic heartburn, nocturnal heartburn, and meal-induced heartburn and dyspepsia; central nervous system disorders, in particular psychoses such as schizophrenia, mania, dementia or other cognitive disorders e.g. Alzheimers disease; anxiety; AIDS-related dementia; diabetic neuropathy; multiple sclerosis; depression; Parkinsons disease; and dependence on drugs or substances of abuse; allergic disorders, in particular allergic disorders of the skin such as urticaria, and allergic disorders of the airways such as rhinitis; gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome; skin disorders, such as psoriasis, pruritis and sunburn; vasospastic diseases, such as angina, vascular headache and Reynauds disease; cerebral ischaemia, such as cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid haemorrhage stroke, epilepsie, head trauma, spinal cord trauma and ischemic neuronal damage; fibrosing and collagen diseases, such as scleroderma and eosinophilic fascioliasis; disorders related to immune enhancement or suppression, such as systemic lupus erythematosus; rheumatic diseases, such as fibrositis; neoplastic disorders; cell proliferation; and cough. The compounds of the present invention have a favourable metabolic stability and exhibit good oral availability. They also have an advantageous onset and duration of action. The compounds of formula (I) also have the ability to penetrate the central nervous system as may be demonstrated in vivo by their inhibitory effect on the change in behaviour induced by intracerebroventricular-applied substance P in the gerbil. In view of the utility of the compounds of formula (I), there is provided a method of treating warm-blooded animals, including humans, suffering from tachykinin-mediated diseases as mentioned hereinabove, in particular, pain, emesis or asthma. Said method comprises the systemic administration of an effective tachykinin antagonizing amount of a compound of formula (I), a N-oxide form, a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt or a possible stereoisomeric form thereof, to warm-blooded animals, including humans. Hence, the use of a compound of formula (I) as a medicine is provided, and in particular a medicine to treat pain, emesis or asthma. For ease of administration, the subject compounds may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, a therapeutically effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable solutions containing compounds of formula (I) may be formulated in an oil for prolonged action. Appropriate oils for this purpose are, for example, peanut oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, soy bean oil, synthetic glycerol esters of long chain fatty acids and mixtures of these and other oils. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wettable agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause any significant deleterious effects on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on or as an ointment. Acid or base addition salts of compounds of formula (I) due to their increased water solubility over the corresponding base or acid form, are obviously more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions. In order to enhance the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions, it can be advantageous to employ -, - or -cyclo-dextrins or their derivatives, in particular hydroxyalkyl substituted cyclodextrins, e.g. 2-hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin. Also co-solvents such as alcohols may improve the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. Those of skill in the treatment of tachykinin mediated diseases could determine the effective therapeutic daily amount from the test results presented hereinafter. An effective therapeutic daily amount would be from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 40 mg/kg body weight, more preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the therapeutically effective dose once daily or as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 0.05 mg to 500 mg, and in particular, 0.5 mg to 50 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form. The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the patient may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated patient and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily amount ranges mentioned hereinabove are therefore only guidelines. The following examples are intended to illustrate and not to limit the scope of the present invention. Experimental Part Hereinafter THF means tetrahydrofuran, DIPE means diisopropylether, RT means room temperature and DMF means N,N-dimethylformamide. Of some compounds of formula (I) the absolute stereochemical configuration was not experimentally determined.

Pharmacological Examples EXAMPLE C.1 Antagonism of Substance-P Induced Relaxation of the Pig Coronary Arteries Segments of coronary arteries taken from pigs (killed by injection of an overdose of sodium pentobarbital) were inverted and mounted for recording of isometric tension in organ baths (volume 20 ml) with the endothelium at the outside. The preparations were bathed in Krebs-Henseleit solution. The solution was kept at 37 C. and gassed with a mixture of O 2 /CO 2 (95/5). After stabilisation of the preparations, prostaglandin F 2 (10 5 M) was administered to induce a contraction. This was repeated until contractile responses became stable. Then prostaglandin F 2 was again administered and substance P (310 10 M and 10 9 M cumulatively) was added. Substance P induced endothelium dependent relaxations. After washing away the agonists, a known concentration of a compound of formula (I) was added. After an incubation period of 30 minutes, prostaglandin F 2 (10 5 M) and the same concentrations of substance P as described above were again administered in the presence of the compound to be tested. Relaxations caused by substance P were expressed as relaxations under control conditions, and percentage inhibition (% inhibition) of the response to 10 9 M substance P was taken as a measure of the antagonistic activity of the compound to be tested.

thereof, wherein A is CH or N, B is OCH 3 or NHCH 3 , R 1 is H, chloro or methyl and R 2 is H, fluoro, chloro or methyl. The present invention relates to novel nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, to processes for preparing them, to compositions containing them and to methods of using them to combat fungi, especially fungal infections of plants. More particularly, the invention relates to fungicidal compounds in which a substituted pyridine ring is attached through an oxymethylene linking group to a phenyl ring containing an ortho methyl -methoxyacrylate group or methyl -methoxyirninoacetate group or an amide derivative thereof. Fungicidal compounds in which a substituted pyridine ring is linked through an oxymethylene group to a phenyl ring containing an ortho methyl -methoxyacrylate group are described in, for example, EP-A-0278595 and EP-A-0350691. Such compounds include those in which the pyridine carries a 6-trifluoromethyl substituent. Similar compounds containing a methyl -methoxyiminoacetate group and amide derivatives are described in, for example, EP-A-0363818 and EP-A-0398692. The compounds of the present invention show an unexpected advantage over the known compounds in respect of certain fungicidal properties. According to the present invention there is provided a compound having the general formula (I): or a stereoisomer thereof, wherein A is CH or N, X is OCH 3 or NHCH 3 , R 1 is H, chloro or methyl and R 2 is H, fluoro, chloro or methyl. Of particular interest are compounds where A is N and X is OCH 3 or NHCH 3 and more particularly where A is CH and X is OCH 3 . Because the carbon-carbon double bond of the group XOC.CA.OCH 3 is unsymmetrically substituted, the compounds of the invention may be obtained in the form of mixtures of (E)- and (Z)-geometric isomers. However, these mixtures can be separated into individual isomers, and this invention embraces such isomers and mixtures thereof in all proportions. The (E)-isomers with respect to the group XOC.CA.OCH 3 are usually the more fungicidally active and form a preferred embodiment of the invention. Further, when R 1 is not the same as R 2 and R 2 is not fluoro, the compounds of the invention may exist in the form of mixtures of optical isomers. However, these mixtures can be separated into the component isomers by known methods and this invention embraces such isomers and mixtures thereof in all proportions. In one aspect the invention includes a compound of formula (I) or a stereoisomer thereof, wherein A is CH or N, X is OCH 3 or NHCH 3 , R 1 is H, chloro or methyl and R 2 is fluoro or methyl. Suitably, A is N and X is OCH 3 or NHCH 3 . Preferably A is CH and B is OCH 3 . In another aspect the invention includes a compound having the general formula (I) or a stereoisomer thereof, wherein A is CH or N, X is OCH 3 or NHCH 3 , R1 is H or methyl and R 2 is fluoro or methyl. Suitably, A is N and X is OCH 3 or NHCH 3 . Preferably A is CH and X is OCH 3 . In yet another aspect the invention includes a compound having the general formula (I) or a stereoisomer thereof, wherein A is CH or N and X is OCH 3 or NHCH 3 , R 1 is H or chloro and R 2 is fluoro or methyl. Suitably, A is N and X is OCH 3 or NHCH 3 . Preferably A is CH and X is OCH 3 . The present invention is illustrated by compounds of the general formula (II) listed in Tables 1 to 4. Throughout the Tables the W group has the (E)-configuration. In the compounds of Table 1, W is CH 3 O.CHC.CO 2 CH 3 .

Suitable methods are disclosed, for example, in EP-A-0278595 and EP-A-0350691, the contents of which are incorporated here by reference. Thus, compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by reacting the metal salt of a pyridone of formula (III): wherein R 1 and R 2 are as defined above and M is a metal atom, with a compound of formula (IV): wherein A and X are as defined above and L is a suitable leaving group. In practice, a hydroxypyridine of formula (V): or the tautomeric pyridone is reacted with the compound (IV) in the presence of a suitable base such as silver carbonate in a suitable solvent such as toluene. In this case reaction proceeds via the compound III where M is silver. The leaving group L in the compound (IV) is suitably a halogen, (chloro, iodine or preferably bromine) or OSO 2 CF 3 . Typically, the reactants are refluxed in the toluene solvent for 3-4 hours. Alternatively, the compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by reacting a pyridine of formula (VI): wherein R 1 , R 2 and L are as defined above, with the metal salt of a compound of formula (VII): wherein A, X and M are as defined above. Here the metal atom M is typically an alkali or alkaline earth metal, or it could be another metal such as silver. Compounds of formula (IV), particularly where L is bromo, are well documented in the literature and can be prepared by the methods described therein; see for example EP-A-0203606 (where A is CH and X is OCH 3 ), EP-A-0363818 (where A is N and X is OCH 3 ) and EP-A-0398692 (where A is N and X is NHCH 3 ). The amides (where X is NHCH 3 ) may readily be prepared from the corresponding esters (where X is OCH 3 ) by treating the ester with methylamine in a suitable solvent such as methanol. Compounds of formula (VII) can be prepared by forming the metal salt of the corresponding hydroxymethyl compound using conventional techniques. The hydroxymethyl compounds can be prepared, for example, by the methods described in WO 9307116. The pyridines of formula (V) and (VI) are either commerically available or can be prepared from commerically available materials by methods described in the chemical literature. A novel method which is particularly convenient for preparing pyridines of formula (V) where R 1 is fluoro and R 2 is H or chloro, and which may be adapted to prepare other pyridines (V) or the tautomeric pyridones, involves the route displayed in Scheme 1. In Scheme 1, the pyridone tautomer (V.1) of the pyridine (V) where R 1 is fluoro and R 2 is chloro and the pyridone tautomer (V.2) of the pyridine (V) where R 1 is fluoro and R 2 is H can be prepared from acyclic starting materials and used to make the compounds (I) where R 1 is fluoro and R 2 is chloro (I.1) or where R 1 is fluoro and R 2 is H (I.2). The compound (I.2) can be made either by reacting the pyridone (V.2) with methyl 2-2-(bromomethyl)phenyl-3-methoxypropenoate (Compound (IV) where A is CH, X is OCH 3 and L is Br) or by reduction of the compound (I.1) using, for example, zinc dust. The pyridones (V.1) and (V.2) are prepared by decarboxylating the corresponding 2-hydroxy-nicotinic acid (VIII.1) or (VIII.2) at an elevated temperature above 190 C., typically at 250 C. Alternatively, the pyridone (V.2) is prepared by reduction of the pyridone (V.1). The 2-hydroxy-nicotinic acids (VIII.1) and (VIII.2) can be prepared by the general method described by R W Lang and P F Wenk in Helv.Chim.Acta., 1988, 71(3), 596-601, involving the acidification of the corresponding nicotinamide (IX.1) or (IX.2). Alternatively, the 2-hydroxynicotinic acid (VIII.2) can be prepared by reduction of the 2-hydroxynicotinic acid (VIII.1). The 2-hydroxynicotinamide (IX.1) can be prepared according to Lang Wenk by cyclising a compound of formula (XI) with malonamide (X). The 2-hydroxynicotinamide (IX.2) can be prepared by reduction of the 2-hydroxynicotinamide (IX.1). The compound (XI) can be prepared by reacting chlorodifluoroacetic anhydride (XII), which is commercially available, with ethyl vinyl ether (XIII). Alternatively, the compounds of formula (I) wherein R 1 and R 2 are as defined above, A is CH and X is OCH 3 can be prepared from a phenylacetate of formula (XIV) or a ketoester of formula (XV) by the steps shown in Scheme 2. Throughout Scheme 2 the terms R 1 and R 2 are as defined above, R 3 is hydrogen or a metal such as sodium or potassium and R is an alkyl group. Each transformation is performed at a suitable temperature and usually, though not always, in a suitable solvent. Thus, a compound of formula (I) can be prepared by treatment of a phenylacetate of formula (XIV) with a base, such as sodium hydride or sodium methoxide, and methyl formate. If a species of formula CH 3 L 1 , wherein L 1 is a leaving group such as a halide (for example chloride, bromide or iodide), or a CH 3 SO 4 anion, is then added to the reaction mixture, a compound of formula (I) is obtained. If a protic acid is added to the reaction mixture, a compound of formula (XVI), wherein R 3 is hydrogen, is obtained. Alternatively, the compound of formula (XVI) wherein R 3 is a metal such as sodium can be isolated from the reaction mixture. A compound of formula (XVI) wherein R 3 is a metal can be converted into a compound of formula (I) by treatment with a species CH 3 L 1 , wherein L is as defined above. A compound of formula (XVI) wherein R 1 is hydrogen can be converted into a compound of formula (I) by successive treatment with a base, such as potassium carbonate, and a species of general formula CH 3 L 1 . Alternatively, a compound of formula (I) can be prepared from an acetal of formula (XVII) by elimination of methanol under either acidic or basic conditions. Examples of reagents or reagent mixtures which can be used for this transformation are lithium diisopropylamide, potassium hydrogen sulphate (see, for example, T Yamada, H Hagiwara and H Uda, J.Chem.Soc.Chemical Communications, 1980, 838 and references therein, and triethylamine, often in the presence of a Lewis acid such as titanium tetrachloride (see, for example, K Nsunda and L Heresi, J.Chem.Soc.Chemical Communications, 1985, 1000). Acetals of formula (XVII) can be prepared by treatment of a methyl silyl ketene acetal of formula (XVIII) with trimethyl orthoformate in the presence of a Lewis acid such as titanium tetrachloride (see, for example, K Saigo, M Osaki and T Mukaiyama, Chemistry Letters, 1976, 769). A methyl silyl ketene acetal of formula (XVIII) can be prepared by treating a phenylacetate of formula (XIV) with a base and a trialkylsilyl halide of formula R 3 SiCl or R 3 SiBr, such as trimethylsilyl chloride, or a base, such as triethylamine, and a trialkylsilyl triflate of formula R 3 SiOSO 2 CF 3 (see, for example, C Ainsworth, F Chen and Y Kuo, J.Organometallic Chemistry, 1972, 46, 59). It is not always necessary to isolate the intermediates (XVII) and (XVIII). Under appropriate conditions a compound of formula (I) can be prepared from a phenylacetate of formula (XIV) in one pot by the successive addition of suitable reagents listed above. A phenylacetate of formula (XIV) can be prepared from a phenylacetate of formula (XIX). Thus, if a compound of formula (V) is treated with a suitable base such as silver carbonate and a phenyl acetate of formula (XIX) added, a phenylacetate of formula (XIV) is obtained. A phenylacetate of formula (XIX) can be prepared by treating an isochromanone of formula (XX) with HL, wherein L is preferably bromine, in methanol. This transformation can also be accomplished in 2 steps if the isochromanone of formula (XX) is treated with HL in a non-alcoholic solvent, and the resulting phenylacetic acid is then esterified using standard procedures (see, for example, I Matsumoto and J Yoshizawa, Jpn. Kokai (Tokkyo Koho) 79138536,27.10.1979, ChemAbs., 1980, 92, 180829h; and G M Lim, Y G Perron and R D Droghini, Res.Discl., 1979, 188, 672, Chem.Abs., 1980, 92, 128526t). Isochromanones of formula (XX) are well known in the chemical literature. Alternatively, a compound of formula (I) can be prepared by treatment of a ketoester of formula (XV) with a methoxymethylenation reagent such as methoxymethylenetriphenyl-phosphorane (see, for example, EP-A-0044448). A ketoester of formula (XV) can be prepared from a ketoester of formula (XXI), by treatment with a compound of formula (V) as described above. Ketoesters of formula (XXI) are described in EP-A-0331061. Compounds of formula (I) where R 1 and R 2 are as defined above, A is N and B is OCH 3 may be prepared from ketoesters of formula (XV) by treatment with methoxylamine (or a salt of methoxylamine). Moreover these same compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by nitrosation of phenylacetates of formula (XIV) using nitrous acid or an ester of nitrous acid, in the presence of a base such as sodium methoxide, (see for example, O Touster, Organic Reactions, 1953, 7, 327 and S Kukolja et al, J.Med.Chem., 1985, 28, 1896). Compounds of formula (I) where A is N and X is the group NHCH 3 , may be prepared by treating a compound of formula (I) where A is N and X is OCH 3 with methylamine in a suitable solvent such as methanol. The compounds of formula (I) are active fungicides and may be used to control one or more of the following pathogens: Pyricularia oryzae on rice and wheat and other Pyricularia spp. on other hosts; Puccinia recondita, Puccinia striiformis and other rusts on wheat, Puccinia hordei, Puccinia striiformis and other rusts on barley, and rusts on other hosts e.g. turf, rye, coffee, pears, apples, peanuts, sugar beet, vegetables and ornamental plants; Erysiphe graminis (powdery mildew) on barley, wheat, rye and turf and other powdery mildews on various hosts such as Sphaerotheca macularis on hops, Sphaerotheca fuliginea on cucurbits (e.g. cucumber), Podosphaera leucotricha on apple and Uncinula necator on vines; Cochliobolus spp., Helminthosporium spp., Drechslera spp. (Pyrenophora spp.), Rhynchosporium spp., Septoria spp. (including Mycosphaerella graminicola and Leptosphaeria nodorum ), Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides and Gaeumannomyces graminis on cereals (e.g. wheat, barley, rye), turf and other hosts; Cercospora arachidicola and Cercosporidium personatum on peanuts and other Cercospora species on other hosts, for example, sugar beet, bananas, soya beans and rice; Botrytis cinerea (grey mould) on tomatoes, strawberries, vegetables, vines and other hosts and other Botrytis spp. on other hosts; Alternaria spp. on vegetables (e.g. cucumber), oil-seed rape, apples, tomatoes, cereals (e.g. wheat) and other hosts; Venturia spp. (including Venturia inaequalis (scab)) on apples, pears, stone fruit, tree nuts and other hosts; Cladosporium spp. on a range of hosts including cereals (e.g. wheat); Monilinia spp. on stone fruit, tree nuts and other hosts; Didymella spp. on tomatoes, turf, wheat and other hosts; Phoma spp. on oil-seed rape, turf, rice, potatoes, wheat and other hosts; Aspergillus spp. and Aureobasidium spp. on wheat, lumber and other hosts; Ascochyta spp. on peas, wheat, barley and other hosts; Plasmopara viticola on vines; other downy mildews such as Bremia lactucae on lettuce, Peronospora spp. on soybeans, tobacco, onions and other hosts, Pseudoperonospora humuli on hops and Pseudoperonospora cubensis on cucurbits; Pythium spp. (including Pythium ultimum ) on turf and other hosts; Phytophthora infestans on potatoes and tomatoes and other Phytophthora spp. on vegetables, strawberries, avocado, pepper, ornamentals, tobacco, cocoa and other hosts; Thanatephorus cucumeris on rice and turf and other Rhizoctonia species on various hosts such as wheat and barley, vegetables, cotton and turf; Sclerotinia spp. on turf, peanuts, oil-seed rape and other hosts; Sclerotium spp. on turf, peanuts and other hosts; Colletotrichum spp. on a range of hosts including turf, coffee and vegetables; Laetisaria fuciformis on turf; Mycosphaerella spp. on banana, peanut, citrus, pecan, papaya and other hosts; Diaporthe spp. on citrus, soybean, melon, pear, lupin and other hosts; Elsinoe spp. on citrus, vines, olives, pecans, roses and other hosts; Pyrenopeziza spp. on oil-seed rape and other hosts; Oncobasidium theobromae on cocoa causing vascular streak dieback; Fusarium spp., Typhula spp., Microdochium nivale , Ustilago spp., Urocystis spp., Tilletia spp., and Claviceps purpurea on a variety of hosts but particularly wheat, barley, turf and maize; Ramularia spp. on sugar beet and other hosts; post-harvest diseases particularly of fruit (e.g. Pencillium digitatum and P. italicum and Trichoderma viride on oranges, Colletotrichum musae and Gloeosporium musarum on bananas and Botrytis cinerea on grapes); other pathogens on vines, notably Eutypa lata, Guignardia bidwellii, Phellinus igniarus, Phomopsis viticola, Pseudopezicula tracheiphila and Stereum hirsutum ; other pathogens on lumber, notably Cephaloascus fragrans , Ceratocystis spp., Ophiostoma piceae , Penicillium spp., Trichoderma pseudokoningii, Trichoderma viride, Trichoderma harzianum, Aspergillus niger, Leptographium lindbergi and Aureobasidium pullulans ; and fungal vectors of viral diseases e.g. Polymyxa graminis on cereals as the vector of barley yellow mosaic virus (BYMV). Further, some of the compounds may be useful as seed dressings against pathogens including Fusarium spp., Septoria spp., Tilletia spp., (e.g. bunt, a seed-borne disease of wheat), Ustilago spp. and Helminthosporium spp. on cereals, Rhizoctonia solani on cotton and Pyricularia oryzae on rice. In particular, some of the compounds show good eradicant activity against Plasmopara viticola and Pythium ultimum. The compounds may move acropetally/locally in plant tissue. Moreover, the compounds may be volatile enough to be active in the vapour phase against fungi on the plant. The invention therefore provides a method of combating fungi which comprises applying to a plant, to a seed of a plant or to the locus of the plant or seed a fungicidally effective amount of a compound as hereinbefore defined, or a composition containing the same. The compounds may be used directly for agricultural purposes but are more conveniently formulated into compositions using a carrier or diluent. The invention thus provides fungicidal compositions comprising a compound as hereinbefore defined and an acceptable carrier or diluent therefor. It is preferred that all compositions, both solid and liquid formulations, comprise 0.0001 to 95%, more preferably 1 to 85%, for example 1 to 25% or 25 to 60%, of a compound as hereinbefore defined. When applied to the foliage of plants, the compounds of the invention are applied at rates of 0.1 g to 10 kg, preferably 1 g to 8 kg, more preferably 10 g to 4 kg, of active ingredient (invention compound) per hectare. When used as seed dressings, the compounds of the invention are used at rates of 0.0001 g (for example 0.00 g or 0.05 g) to 10 g, preferably 0.005 g to 8 g, more preferably 0.005 g to 4 g, of active ingredient (invention compound) per kilogram of seed. The compounds can be applied in a number of ways. For example, they can be applied, formulated or unformulated, directly to the foliage of a plant, to seeds or to other medium in which plants are growing or are to be planted, or they can be sprayed on, dusted on or applied as a cream or paste formulation, or they can be applied as a vapour or as slow release granules. Application can be to any part of the plant including the foliage, stems, branches or roots, or to soil surrounding the roots, or to the seed before it is planted, or to the soil generally, to paddy water or to hydroponic culture systems. The invention compounds may also be injected into plants or sprayed onto vegetation using electrodynamic spraying techniques or other low volume methods, or applied by land or aerial irrigation systems. The term plant as used herein includes seedlings, bushes and trees. Furthermore, the fungicidal method of the invention includes preventative, protectant, prophylactic, systemic and eradicant treatments. The compounds are preferably used for agricultural and horticultural purposes in the form of a composition. The type of composition used in any instance will depend upon the particular purpose envisaged. The compositions may be in the form of dustable powders or granules comprising the active ingredient (invention compound) and a solid diluent or carrier, for example, fillers such as kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered magnesia, fullers earth, gypsum, diatomaceous earth and china clay. Such granules can be preformed granules suitable for application to the soil without further treatment. These granules can be made either by impregnating pellets of filler with the active ingredient or by pelleting a mixture of the active ingredient and powdered filler. Compositions for dressing seed may include an agent (for example, a mineral oil) for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed; alternatively the active ingredient can be formulated for seed dressing purposes using an organic solvent (for example, N-methylpyrrolidone, propylene glycol or N,N-dimethylformamide). The compositions may also be in the form of water dispersible powders or water dispersible granules comprising wetting or dispersing agents to facilitate the dispersion in liquids. The powders and granules may also contain fillers and suspending agents. The compositions may also be in the form of soluble powders or granules, or in the form of solutions in polar solvents. Soluble powders may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with a water-soluble salt such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, magnesium sulphate or a polysaccharide, and a wetting or dispersing agent to improve water dispersibility/solubility. The mixture may then be ground to a fine powder. Similar compositions may also be granulated to form water-soluble granules. Solutions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in polar solvents such as ketones, alcohols and glycol ethers. These solutions may contain surface active agents to improve water dilution and prevent crystallisation in a spray tank. Emulsifiable concentrates or emulsions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in an organic solvent optionally containing a wetting or emulsifying agent and then adding the mixture to water which may also contain a wetting or emulsifying agent. Suitable organic solvents are aromatic solvents such as alkylbenzenes and alkylnaphthalenes, ketones such as cyclohexanone and methylcyclohexanone, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene and trichlorethane, and alcohols such as benzyl alcohol, furfuryl alcohol, butanol and glycol ethers. Aqueous suspension concentrates of largely insoluble solids may be prepared by ball or bead milling with a dispersing agent with a suspending agent included to stop the solid settling. Compositions to be used as sprays may be in the form of aerosols wherein the formulation is held in a container under pressure of a propellant, e.g. fluorotrichloromethane or dichlorodifluoromethane. The invention compounds can be mixed in the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to form a composition suitable for generating in enclosed spaces a smoke containing the compounds. Alternatively, the compounds may be used in micro-encapsulated form. They may also be formulated in biodegradable polymeric formulations to obtain a slow, controlled release of the active substance. By including suitable additives, for example additives for improving the uptake, distribution, adhesive power and resistance to rain on treated surfaces, the different compositions can be better adapted for various utilities. Other additives may be included to improve the biological efficacy of the various formulations. Such additives can be surface active materials to improve the wetting and retention on surfaces treated with the formulation and also the uptake and mobility of the active material, or additionally can include oil based spray additives, for example, certain mineral oil and natural plant oil (such as soya bean and rape seed oil) additives, or blends of them with other adjuvants. The invention compounds can be used as mixtures with fertilisers (e.g. nitrogen-, potassium- or phosphorus-containing fertilisers). Compositions comprising only granules of fertiliser incorporating, for example coated with, a compound of formula (I) are preferred. Such granules suitably contain up to 25% by weight of the compound. The invention therefore also provides a fertiliser composition comprising a fertiliser and the compound of general formula (I) or a salt or metal complex thereof. Water dispersible powders, emulsifiable concentrates and suspension concentrates will normally contain surfactants, e.g. a wetting agent, dispersing agent, emulsifying agent or suspending agent. These agents can be cationic, anionic or non-ionic agents. Suitable cationic agents are quaternary ammonium compounds, for example, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Suitable anionic agents are soaps, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulphuric acid (for example, sodium lauryl sulphate), and salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds (for example, sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium or ammonium lignosulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of sodium diisopropyl- and triisopropylnaphthalene sulphonates). Suitable non-ionic agents are the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl or cetyl alcohol, or with alkyl phenols such as octyl- or nonylphenol and octylcresol. Other non-ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, alkyl glucosides, polysaccharides and the lecithins and the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide. Suitable suspending agents are hydrophilic colloids (for example, polyvinylpyrrolidone and sodium carboxymethylcellulose), and swelling clays such as bentonite or attapulgite. Compositions for use as aqueous dispersions or emulsions are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient, the concentrate being diluted with water before use, these concentrates should preferably be able to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage be capable of dilution with water in order to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. The concentrates may conveniently contain up to 95%, suitably 1-85%, for example 1-25% or 25-60%, by weight of the active ingredient. After dilution to form aqueous preparations, such preparations may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient depending upon the intended purpose, but an aqueous preparation containing 0.0001 to 10%, for example 0.005 to 10%, by weight of active ingredient may be used. The compositions of this invention may contain other compounds having biological activity, e.g. compounds having similar or complementary fungicidal activity or which possess plant growth regulating, herbicidal or insecticidal activity.

EXAMPLE 4 This Example illustrates the preparation of methyl 2-2-(6-difluoromethylpyrid-2-yl-oxymethyl)phenyl-(O-methyloximino)acetamide. (Compound No 2 of Table 4). Methyl 2-2-(6-difluoromethylpyrid-2-yloxymethyl)phenyl-(O-methyloximino)-acetate (0.43 g, as prepared in Example 3) was dissolved in methylamine (20 ml of a 33% solution in ethanol) and stirred for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was concentrated and the volatiles removed in vacuo to give the title compound (0.41 g, 96% yield) as a pale brown oil; 1 H NMR given in Table 5. EXAMPLE 5 The compounds were tested against a variety of foliar fungal diseases of plants. The technique employed was as follows. The plants were grown in John Innes Potting Compost (No 1 or 2) in 4 cm diameter minipots. The test compounds were formulated either by bead milling with aqueous Dispersol T or as a solution in acetone or acetone/ethanol which was diluted to the required concentration immediately before use. The formulations (100 ppm active ingredient) were sprayed on to the foliage or applied to the roots of the plants in the soil. The sprays were applied to maximum retention and the root drenches to a final concentration equivalent to approximately 40 ppm a.i. in dry soil. Tween 20 was added to give a final concentration of 0.05% when the sprays were applied to cereals. For most of the tests the compounds were applied to the soil (roots) or to the foliage (by spraying) one or two days before the plant was inoculated with the disease. Exceptions were the tests on Erysiphe graminis and Puccinia recondita in which the plants were inoculated 24 hours and 48 hours, respectively, before treatment. Foliar pathogens were applied by spray as zoosporangial suspensions onto the leaves of test plants. After inoculation, the plants were put into an appropriate environment to allow infection to proceed and then incubated until the disease was ready for assessment. The period between inoculation and assessment varied from four to fourteen days according to the disease and environment. The disease level present (i.e. leaf area covered by actively sporulating disease) on each of the treated plants was recorded using the following assessment scale: Each assessment was then expressed as a percentage of the level of disease present on the untreated control plants. This calculated value is referred to as a POCO (Percentage of Control) value. An example of a typical calculation is as follows: This calculated POCO value is then rounded to the nearest of the values in the 9-point assessment scale shown above. In this particular example, the POCO value would be rounded to 30. If the calculated POCO falls exactly mid-way between two of the points, it is rounded to the lower of the two values. The results are shown in Table 6.

This application is a 371 of PCT/JP97/02157 filed Jun. 24, 1997. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to an anti- Helicobacter pylori agent comprising an oxazolin-4-one derivative useful as a therapeutic agent for gastric and duodenal ulcer etc. BACKGROUND ART As therapeutic agents for ulcer, there have been developed antacids, anticholinergic agents, antigastrin agents, gastrointestinal hormones, antipepsine agents, histamine H 2 receptor antagonists, tissue repairing agents, mucosa-protecting agents, microcirculation-improving agents, proton pump inhibitors etc. The development of histamine H 2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors, both possessing potent acid secretion-suppressing activity, in particular, has facilitated ulcer treatment. However, these therapeutic agents for ulcer are unsatisfactory in terms of suppressing effect on recurrent ulcer. On the other hand, Helicobacter pylori , a gram-negative microaerophilic bacterium belonging to the genus Helicobacter, has been suggested as a potential major cause of recurrence of gastritis, duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer etc. Although many antibacterial agents readily inhibit the proliferation of the respective microorganisms belonging to the genus Helicobacter in vitro, their efficacy in humans and animal experiments is very low when administered singly in vivo. Various diseases caused by Helicobacter pylori as such are treated by chemotherapies such as double chemotherapy with a bismuth preparation and an antibiotic, and triple chemotherapy with a bismuth preparation, metronidazole (U.S. Pat. No. 2,944,061) and either tetracycline (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 2,712,517) or amoxicillin (U.S. Pat. No. 3,192,198). Metronidazole, an imidazole derivative possessing anti- Helicobacter pylori activity, is used in combination with antibiotics. These bismuth preparations, antibiotics, metronidazole etc. are administered orally. Also, clinical studies have shown that eradication of this microorganism results in healing and decreased recurrence rates in ulcer. However, these bismuth preparations, antibiotics, metronidazole etc. must be administered at high daily doses to maintain sufficient concentrations to inhibit Helicobacter pylori proliferation at the sites of their proliferation, resulting in many problems, including adverse effects such as vomiting and diarrhea. There have been developed various compounds possessing anti- Helicobacter pylori activity. For example, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 117268/1993 discloses a pyridine derivative possessing anti- Helicobacter pylori activity, and European Patent EPO 535528A1 discloses an imidazole derivative possessing anti- Helicobacter pylori activity. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION After extensive investigation in view of the above problems, the present inventors found that a particular oxazolin-4-one derivative exhibits very specific and excellent antibacterial activity against the bacteria of the genus Helicobacter, represented by Helicobacter pylori .

Accordingly, the present invention relates to (1) an anti- Helicobacter pylori composition comprising a compound of the formula: wherein A represents an aromatic group which may be substituted, R 1 and R 2 independently represent a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon group which may be substituted, R 3 and R 4 independently represent a hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon group which may be substituted, an

HC-21 strain (hereinafter also referred to as HC-21 strain) isolated from a soil sample from Tenninkyo, Asahikawa-shi, Hokkaido, Japan.

Journal of General Applied Microbiology 29, 319-322 (1983) identified the diaminopimelic acid in the hydrochloric acid hydrolyzate of cells as the LL-configuration. Judging from the results shown above, specifically the light yellowish brown to grayish brown aerial mycelia, gently waved or key-shaped spore chains, spiny spore surfaces, diaminopimelic acid in the LL-configuration, and other findings, it is evident that this strain belongs to the genus Streptomyces; the strain was designated Streptomyces sp. HC-21. The Streptomyces sp. HC-21 strain as such is characterized by the capability of L-rhamnose assimilation and spiny spore surfaces. The Streptomyces sp. HC-21 strain as such has been deposited under accession number IFO-15984 at the Institute for Fermentation, Osaka (foundation), since Jun. 12, 1996, and under accession number FERM BP-5571 at the National Institute of Bioscience and Human-Technology, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry of the Japan (1-3, Higashi 1-chome, Yatabe, Tsukuba City, Ibaraki Prefecture), since Jun. 25, 1996. The bacteria of the genus Streptomyces can undergo variation, naturally or by mutagens, as a general nature of microorganisms. Even the various variants obtained by, for example, irradiation with radiations such as X rays, gamma rays and ultraviolet rays, single spore separation, treatment with various chemicals, cultivation on drug-containing media, and other means, or naturally-occurring mutants, are all usable for the method of the present invention, as long as they are capable of producing indolmycin. Although the culture medium for the method of the present invention may be liquid or solid, as long as it contains nutrient sources usable by the strain used, a liquid medium is preferred for large-scale treatment. The medium is supplemented as appropriate with assimilable nutrient sources, digestible nitrogen sources, inorganic substances, and trace nutrients. Carbon sources include, for example, glucose, lactose, sucrose, maltose, dextrin, starch, glycerol, mannitol, sorbitol, oils and fats (e.g., soybean oil, olive oil, rice bran oil, sesame oil, lard oil, chicken oil); nitrogen sources include, for example, meat extract, yeast extract, dry yeasts, soybean flour, corn steep liquor, peptone, cottonseed flour, blackstrap molasses, urea, ammonium salts (e.g., ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate, ammonium acetate) and others. Also used as appropriate are salts containing sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium etc., metal salts such as those of iron, manganese, zinc, cobalt, nickel etc., salts of phosphoric acid, boric acid etc., and salts of organic acids such as acetic acid and propionic acid. Additionally, amino acids (e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid, alanine, lysine, valine, methionine, proline), vitamins (e.g., B 1 , B 2 , nicotinic acid, B 12 , C), nucleic acids (e.g. purine, pyrimidine and derivatives thereof) etc. may be contained. It is of course common practice to add inorganic or organic acids, alkalis, buffers etc. for regulation of the mediums pH, and appropriate amounts of oils and fats, surfactants etc. for defoaming. Cultivation may be achieved by standing culture, shaking culture, spinner culture, or the like. For large-scale treatment, submerged spinner culture is of course desirable. Although culturing conditions vary depending on the condition and composition of the medium, the kind of strain, and the means of cultivation, it is normally recommended that temperature and initial pH be 15 to 26 C. and about 5 to 9, respectively. It is desirable that temperature in the middle stage of cultivation and initial pH be 20 to 25 C. and about 6 to 8, respectively. Duration of cultivation also varies depending on the above-mentioned conditions but it is recommended that cultivation be continued until the concentration of the desired bioactive substance reaches maximum. It normally takes about 1 to 10 days in the case of shaking culture or spinner culture using a liquid medium. The resulting bioactive substance indolmycin can be extracted and purified from the culture on the basis of its chemical nature. Because indolmycin is produced in the culture broth and cells, it can be purified by separating the culture broth and cells by filtration or centrifugation from the culture, extracting it from the resulting filtrate or centrifugal supernatant using an organic solvent, or extracting it from cells using an organic solvent, and isolating it from each extract or the combined extract. For industrial purposes, it is advantageous to purify indolmycin from the extract obtained by adding an organic solvent such as methanol, acetone, butanol or ethyl acetate directly to the culture, with the cell separation operation omitted. Because indolmycin is a weakly basic oil-soluble substance, its collection from the culture broth permits the use of means of separation and purification in common use for collection of related microbial metabolites. For example, methods based on solubility differences from impurity substances and chromatographies using various carriers such as activated charcoal nonionic high porous resin, silica gel, alumina and dextran gel can be used singly or in combination. The method of isolating and collecting indolmycin from the culture is hereinafter described specifically. First, cells are removed by filtration from the culture broth; the resulting supernatant is adjusted to appropriate pH; a solvent such as ethyl acetate is added, followed by vigorous stirring, to yield an ethyl acetate layer. The organic layer obtained is sequentially washed with alkali, acid and water, after which it is concentrated; the resulting concentrate is subjected to silica gel column chromatography. Useful developing solvents include, for example, chloroform-methanol or hexane-acetone mixed solvents. After the effective fractions are combined and concentrated, the concentrate is subjected to Sephadex LH-20 chromatography. Useful developing solvents are methanol and mixed solvents such as hexane-toluene-methanol and hexane-methylene chloride-methanol. Aft er concentration, the eluate containing the effective fractions is purified by preparative high performance liquid chromatography. The column packing used here is ODS-SH343 S-15 (produced by Yamamura Kagaku Kenkyujo); the solvent system used is a combination of 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) and 26% CH 3 CN. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The present invention is hereinafter described in more detail by means of, but not limited to, the following working examples, experimental examples and preparation example. In the description below, room temperature means about 15 to 30 C. EXAMPLES Example 1 A platinum loopful of Streptomyces sp. HC-21 strain, previously sufficiently grown on a slant medium consisting of yeast extract-maltose extract-agar, was inoculated to a sterile 2 l Sakaguchi flask containing 500 ml of a seed medium of pH 7.0 consisting of 2% glucose, 3% soluble starch, 1% corn steep liquor, 1% fresh soybean flour, 0.5% polypeptone, 0.3% sodium chloride and 0.5% precipitating calcium carbonate, and cultured at 24 C. on a reciprocal shaker for 2 days. To this 500 ml culture broth was injected 120 l of a principal medium of pH 7.0 consisting of 2.0% glucose, 3.0% soluble starch, 1.0% defatted soybean flour, 0.3% corn steep liquor, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.5% polypeptone, 0.2% oatmeal agar, 0.3% sodium chloride, 0.5% precipitating calcium carbonate, 0.05% ACTCOL 31-56 (produced by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan) and 0.05% silicone, followed by transplantation to a sterile 200 l fermentation jar and 90 hours of cultivation under conditions of 24 C. temperature, 1.1 kg/cm 2 internal pressure, 120 l/min aeration rate and 120 rpm stirring rate. The 120 l of the culture broth thus obtained was filtered using Hyflo Super Cel to yield 110 l of a filtrate. This filtrate was adjusted to pH 3.0 with dilute sulfuric acid; an equal amount of ethyl acetate was added, followed by vigorous stirring, to yield 80 l of an ethyl acetate layer. This ethyl acetate layer was washed with 30 l of a 2% NaHCO 3 solution, then with 30 l of a 0.02 N.HCl solution, and thoroughly washed with water, after which it was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield about 30 g of a concentrate. This concentrate was passed through a silica gel column (0.8 l) to adsorb the active ingredient, followed by sequential elution with 4 l of hexane-acetone (80:20), 4 l of hexane-acetone (50:50) and 4 l of hexane-acetone (20:80). The effective fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 1.53 g of a concentrate. This concentrate was dissolved in methanol; the resulting solution was passed through a column (2 l) of Sephadex LH-20 (produced by Pharmacia, Sweden), thoroughly washed previously; the effective eluted fractions from 1.3 l to 1.7 l were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 490 mg of a powder. This powder was further developed (20 ml/min, 20 ml fractions) with a solvent system of 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) and 26% CH 3 CN, using preparative liquid chromatography (Hitachi model L-6250, detector L-4000, YMC-Pack, ODS SH343 S-15 120 A, 214 nm), to yield effective fractions (fraction Nos. 30 through 39). After the CH 3 CN was removed, the effective fractions were washed with water and again extracted with ethyl acetate; the ethyl acetate layer was concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 315 mg of crystalline indolmycin. Elemental analysis (for C 14 H 15 N 3 O 2 ): Calculated: C, 65.35; H, 5.88; N, 16.33; Found : C, 65.14; H, 5.87; N, 16.07. The physicochemical properties also agreed well with those of indolmycin. Example 2 (5S)-2-(N-benzyloxycarbonyl-N-methyl)amino-5(1R)-1-(indol-3-yl)ethyl-2-oxazolin-4-one A solution of indolmycin (100 mg) in tetrahydrofuran (5 ml) was cooled to 30 C.

Experimental Example 1 In vitro antimicrobial test: Determination of invitro antimicrobial activity against Helicobacter pylori and other microorganisms Using 5 strains of Helicobacter pylori , 19 other bacterial species and 2 yeast species as test strains, the antimicrobial activities of various compounds were determined by the method described below (agar dilution method). The test compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide; this solution was 2-fold diluted step by step with sterilized distilled water to yield test samples. Two milliliters of each test sample was mixed with 18 ml of Brucella agar supplemented with 7% horse blood as a medium to prepare a determination plate. Helicobacter pylori was subjected to shaking culture at 37 C. in a gas pack jar incorporating CampyPak (BBL R Beckton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) for 20 hours, using Brucella broth medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum, to yield a seed inoculum. The other test microorganisms were each cultured at 37 C. for 20 hours, using Brucella broth medium, to yield respective seed inocula. Five microliters of each seed inoculum, previously adjusted to about 10 6 CFU/ml using Brucella broth medium supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum was inoculated to each determination plate, and cultured at 37 C. in a gas pack jar incorporating CampyPak and water-soaked cotton absorbent for 4 days. After cultivation, strain growth was macroscopically examined; the minimum concentration for the absence of strain growth was taken as the MIC value (minimum inhibitory concentration) of the test compound. The results are shown in Tables 2 and 3.

As seen from Tables 2 and 3, compound (I) exhibits very selective antimicrobial activity against the bacteria of the genus Helicobacter, represented by Helicobacter pylori. Experimental Example 2 (In vivo antimicrobial activity test) After mongolian gerbils (MGS/Sea, male, 6 weeks of age) were fasted for 24 hours, Helicobacter pylori TN2GF4 was inoculated to the stomach at 10 7.08 per mongolian gerbil. Starting at 11 days after infection, a 3, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg suspension of the test compound in a 0.5% aqueous solution of methyl cellulose was orally administered twice daily (morning and evening) for 3 days. On the day after final administration, the stomach of each infected mongolian gerbil was excised and disrupted; a series of 10-fold dilutions of the stomach homogenate were each inoculated to modified Skirrows medium supplemented with activated charcoal and cultured under microaerophilic conditions at 37 C. for 4 days, after which clearance effect was assessed on the basis of the presence or absence of bacterial growth. The results are shown in Table 4. Bacterial cell counts are expressed in meanstandard deviation after Dunnetts test against the control group. In Table 4, ** indicates p0.01.

Preparation Example For use as a therapeutic agent for Helicobacter pylori infections, the preparation of the present invention, which contains a compound represented by formula (I) or a salt thereof, can be produced with the following formulations: 1. Capsules (1) Indolmycin 100 mg (2) Lactose 90 mg (3) Microcrystalline cellulose 70 mg (4) Magnesium stearate 10 mg Total 270 mg per capsule Components (1), (2) and (3) and a half portion of component (4) were mixed and granulated. To these granules, the remaining portion of component (4) was added, and the whole mixture was packed in a gelatin capsule. 2. Tablets (1) Indolmycin 100 mg (2) Lactose 35 mg (3) Corn starch 150 mg (4) Microcrystalline cellulose 30 mg (5) Magnesium stearate 5 mg Total 320 mg per tablet Components (1), (2) and (3), a two-third portion of component (4) and a half portion of component (5) were mixed and granulated. To these granules, the remaining portions of components (4) and (5) were added, and the whole mixture was tableted by compressive tableting. Industrial Applicability Compound (I) or a salt thereof exhibits very specific potent antibacterial activity against the bacteria of the genus Helicobacter represented by Helicobacter pylori . The use of compound (I) of the present invention or a salt thereof therefore provides the desired effect for an anti- Helicobacter pylori agent at doses much lower than the effective doses of conventional antibacterial agents for the bacteria of the genus Helicobacter (especially Helicobacter pylori ). Compound (I) or a salt thereof is effective in the prevention or treatment of various diseases caused by bacteria of the genus Helicobacter such as duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, chronic gastritis and gastric cancer, and, because Helicobacter pylori is a major cause of ulcer recurrence, compound (I) or a salt thereof is also effective in the prevention of ulcer recurrence. Also, compound (I) or a salt thereof exhibits no antibacterial action against gram-positive bacteria such as those of the genera Staphylococcus and Bacillus and against gram-negative bacteria such as those of the genera Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Proteus, Klebsiella, Serratia, Salmonella, Citrobacter and Alcaligenes.

In the reactions described hereinbefore, any reactive groups present such as carboxy, amino, alkylamino or imino groups may be protected during the reaction by conventional protecting groups which are cleaved again after the reaction. For example, a protecting group for a carboxyl group may be a trimethylsilyl, methyl, ethyl, tert.butyl, benzyl or tetrahydropyranyl group and protecting groups for an amino, alkylamino or imino group may be an acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzoyl, ethoxycarbonyl, tert.butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, benzyl, methoxybenzyl or 2,4-climethoxybenzyl group and additionally, for the amino group, a phthalyl group.

Moreover, chiral compounds of general formula I obtained may be resolved into their enantiomers and/or diastereomers. Thus, for example, the compounds of general formula I obtained which occur as racemates may be separated by methods known per se (cf. Allinger N. L. and Eliel E. L. in Topics in Stereochemistry, Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971) into their optical antipodes and compounds of general formula I with at least 2 asymmetric carbon atoms may be resolved into their diastercomers on the basis of their physical-chemical differences using methods known per se, e.g. by chromatography and/or fractional crystallisation, and, if these compounds are obtained in racemic form, they may subsequently be resolved into the enantiomers as mentioned above. The enantiomers are preferably separated by column separation on chiral phases or by recrystallisation from an optically active solvent or by reacting with an optically active substance which forms salts or derivatives such as e.g. esters or amides with the racemic compound, particularly acids and the activated derivatives or alcohols thereof, and separating the diastereomeric mixture of salts or derivatives thus obtained, e.g. on the basis of their differences in solubility, whilst the free antipodes may be released from the pure diastereomeric salts or derivatives by the action of suitable agents. Optically active acids in common use are e.g. the D- and L-forms of tartaric acid or dibenzoyltartaric acid, di-o-tolyltartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, camphorsulphonic acid, glutamic acid, N-acetylglutamic acid, aspartic acid, N-acetylaspartic acid or quinic acid. An optically active alcohol may be for example () or ()-menthol and an optically active acyl group in amides, for example, may be a ()-or ()-menthyloxycarbonyl group. Furthermore, the compounds of formula I obtained may be converted into the salts thereof, particularly for pharmaceutical use into the physiologically acceptable salts with inorganic or organic acids. Acids which may be used for this purpose include for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid or methanesulphonic acid. Moreover, if the new compounds of formula I thus obtained contain a carboxy group, they may subsequently, if desired, be converted into the salts thereof with inorganic or organic bases, particularly for pharmaceutical use into the physiologically acceptable salts thereof. Suitable bases for this purpose include for example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, cyclohexylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine. The compounds of general formulae I to VIII used as starting materials are known from the literature in some cases or may be obtained by methods known from the literature or are described in the Examples. As already mentioned, the new compounds of general formula I wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a prodrug group have valuable pharmacological properties, particularly inhibitory effects on various kinases and cycline/CDK-complexes, on the proliferation of cultivated human tumour cells and, when administered orally, on the growth of tumours in nude mice infected with human tumour cells. For example, the compounds listed in Table 1 were tested for their biological properties as follows: TEST 1 Inhibition of Cycline/CDK Enzyme, in Vitro Activity High Five insect cells (BTI-TN-5B 1-4 ) which had been infected with a high titre of recombinant baculovirus were used to produce active human cycline/CDK holoenzymes. By using a baculovirus vector which contained two promoters (polyhedrin enhancer promoter, P10 enhancer promoter), GST-tagged cyclines (e.g. cycline D1 or cycline D3) with the corresponding His6-tagged CDK subunit (e.g. for CDK4 or CDK6) were expressed in the same cell. The active holoenzyme was isolated by affinity chromatography on glutathione sepharose. Recombinant GST-tagged pRB (aa 379-928) was produced in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione sepharose. The substrates used for the kinase assays depended on the specific kinases. Histone H1 (Sigma) was used as the substrate for cycline E/CDK2, cycline A/CDK2, cycline B/CDK1 and for v-cycline/CDK6. GST-tagged pRB (aa 379-928) was used as substrate for cycline D1/CDK4, cycline D3/CDK4, cycline D1/CDK6 and for cycline D3/CDK6. Lysates of the insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus or recombinant kinases (obtained from the lysates by purification) were incubated together with radiolabelled ATP in the presence of a suitable substrate with various concentrations of the inhibitor in a 1% DMSC) solution (dimethyl sulphoxide) for 45 minutes at 30 C. The substrate proteins with associated radioactivity were precipitated with 5% TCA (trichloroacetic acid) in water-repellent PVDF multi-well microtitre plates (Millipore) or with 0.5% phosphoric acid solution on Whatman P81 filters. After the addition of scintillation liquid the radioactivity was measured in a Wallace 1450 Microbeta Liquid Scintillation Counter. For each concentration of the substance double measurements were carried out; IC50 values were calculated for the enzyme inhibition. TEST 2 Inhibition of the Proliferation of Cultivation Human Tumour Cells Cells cf the Leimyosarcoma tumour cell line SK-UT-1B (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) were cultivated in Minimum Essential Medium with non-essential amino acids (Gibco), supplemented with sodium pyruvate (1 mmol), glutamine (2 mmol) and 10% foetal calf serum (Gibco) and harvested during the log-growth phase. Then the SK-UT-1B cells were added to Cytostar multi-well plates (Amersham) at a density of 4000 cells per well and incubated overnight in an incubator. Various concentrations of the compounds (dissolved in DMSO; final concentration: 1%) were added to the cells. After 48 hours incubation 14C-thymidine (Amersham) was added to each well and incubation was continued for a further 24 hours. The quantity of 14C-thymidine incorporated into the tumour cells in the presence of the inhibitor and representing the number of cells in the S phase was measured in a Wallace 1450 Microbeta Liquid Scintillation Counter. IC50 values for the inhibition of proliferation (inhibition of incorporated 14C-thymidine) were calculated, correcting for the background radiation. All the measurements were done twice. TEST 3 In Vivo Effects on Tumour-Bearing Nude Mice 106 cells SK-UT-1B, or non-small cell lung tumour NCI-H460 (obtained from ATCC) in a volume of 0.1 ml were injected subcutaneously into male and/or female nude mice (NMRI nu/nu; 25-35 g; N10-20); alternatively, small fragments of SK-UT-1B or NCI-H460 cell clumps were implanted subcutaneously. One to three weeks after the injection or implantation a kinase inhibitor was administered daily by oral route for a period of 2 to 4 weeks (by oesophageal tube). The size of the tumour was measured three times a week using a digital sliding gauge. The effect of a kinase inhibitor on the tumour growth was determined as a percentage inhibition compared with a control group treated with placebo.

Aminoguanidine compounds can be used as therapeutically effective agents against a variety of diseases of the nervous system such as diabetic and toxic neuropathies, peripheral nervous system diseases, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, stroke, Huntingtons disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, motor neuron disease, traumatic nerve injury, multiple sclerosis, dysmyelination and demyelination disorders, and mitochondrial diseases. The aminoguanidine compounds which can be used in the present method include (1) aminoguanidine and diaminoguanidine analogs which can act as substrates or substrate analogs for creatine kinase; (2) bisubstrate inhibitors of creatine kinase comprising covalently linked structural analogs of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and aminoguanidine; (3) aminoguanidine analogs which can act as reversible or irreversible inhibitors of creatine kinase; and (4) N-phosphoroaminoguanidine analogs bearing nontransferable moieties which mimic the N-phosphoryl group.", "related_docs": [], "pct_data":

formula I wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 and R 5 are as defined in the description, are useful as pharmaceuticals. This is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/945,721, having a 371 date of Nov. 5, 1997, which application is a 371 of International Application No. PCT/EP96/01841, now abandoned, filed May 3, 1996. The present invention relates to novel amino-tetralines (tetrahydro-naphthalenamines), their preparation, their use as pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. In accordance with the invention, there are provided, in a first aspect, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthalenamines bearing a phenyl substituent on the aromatic ring and acid addition salt thereof. The phenyl substituent is preferably in position 5 of the 2-naphthalenamine. The phenyl substituent may bear further substituents, for example as in the case of formula I below. Further substituents may also be present conveniently but not exclusively on the aromatic ring, e.g. in position 8 of the 2-naphthalenamine when the phenyl group is in position 5. More particularly the present invention provides a compound of formula I wherein R 1 and R 2 , independently, are hydrogen, (C 1-4 )alkyl, (C 1-4 )alkoxy, (C 1-4 )alkylthio, halogen, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, cyano, (C 2-5 )alkanoyl, (C 1-4 )alkylsulfonyl or sulfamoyl, R 3 is hydrogen, hydroxy, (C 1-4 )alkyl, (C 1-4 )alkoxy, halogen, cyano, (C 2-5 )alkanoyl, carbamoyl, (C 1-4 )alkylsulfonyloxy or trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy, and R 4 and R 5 , independently, are hydrogen, (C 1-4 )alkyl, hydroxy(C 2-4 )alkyl or phenyl(C 1-4 )alkyl, or form together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached a pyrrolidinyl, piperidino or piperazinyl group, in free base or acid addition salt form. Halogen is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably fluorine or chlorine. Any alkyl, alkoxy and alkylthio radicals preferably are straight chain radicals. They preferably have 1 to 3 carbon atoms, more preferably they are methyl, methoxy and methylthio groups. The following significances and their combinations are preferred: R 1 and R 2 , independently, are hydrogen, (C 1-4 )alkyl, (C 1-4 )alkoxy, halogen or trifluoromethyl, R 3 is hydrogen, hydroxy, (C 1-4 )alkoxy, cyano or carbamoyl, R 4 and R 5 , independently, are hydrogen or (C 1-4 )alkyl, or form together with the nitrogen to which they are attached a piperidino group. In a particular group of compounds of formula I, R 1 and R 2 , independently, are hydrogen, (C 1-4 )alkyl, (C 1-4 )alkoxy, (C 1-4 )alkylthio, halogen, trifluoromethyl, cyano or (C 2-5 )alkanoyl, R 3 is as defined on line 5 and 6 and R 4 and R 5 , independently, are hydrogen, (C 1-4 )alkyl or phenyl(C 1-4 )alkyl, or form together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached a pyrrolidinyl, piperidino or piperazinyl group. The compounds of the invention possess an asymmetrical carbon atom in position 2. They may therefore appear in optically active form or in form of mixtures of optical isomers, e.g. in form of racemic mixtures. All optical isomers and their mixtures including the racemic mixtures are part of the present invention. When a compound of the invention is in optically active form, the R configuration is preferred. In a further aspect, the invention provides a process for the production of the compounds of the invention, whereby a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthalenamine bearing a halogen on the aromatic ring is reacted with optionally substituted phenylboronic acid and the resulting compound is recovered in free base form or in acid addition salt form. More particularly the invention provides a process for the production of the compounds of the invention, whereby a compound of formula II wherein R 3 , R 4 and R 5 are as defined above and Hal is halogen, is reacted with a compound of formula III wherein R 1 and R 2 are as defined above, and the resulting compound is recovered in free base form or in acid addition salt form. The reaction may be effected in known manner, preferably by transition metal-catalyzed aryl-aryl coupling, e.g. as described in Example 1. Hal is preferably bromine or iodine, particularly bromine. Working up of the reaction mixtures obtained according to the above process and purification of the compounds thus obtained may be carried out in accordance to known procedures. Acid addition salts may be produced in known manner from the free base forms and vice-versa. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts for use in accordance with the present invention include for example the hydrochloride, the hydrogen maleate, the hydrogen fumarate and the hydrogen malonate. Racemic compounds of the invention may be obtained from racemic starting materials. Optically active isomers may be obtained form optically active starting materials or from the racemate. The enantiomers may be obtained from the racemate by known methods, for example by fractional crystallization of diastereoisomeric salts, e.g. their salts with ()-di-O,O-p-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid or ()-di-O,O-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid. The starting materials of formula II may be produced by halogenating compounds of formula IV wherein R 3 , R 4 and R 5 are as defined above, in accordance to known procedures, e.g. as described in Example 1. The starting materials of formulae III and IV are known or may be produced in analogous manner to known procedures. Compounds of the invention, e.g. compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, hereinafter referred to as agents of the invention, exhibit pharmacological activity and are, therefore, useful as pharmaceuticals. The agents of the invention provide long-lasting protection against maximal electroshock-induced convulsions in mice at doses of about 1 to 100 mg/kg p.o. and about 0.32 to 32 mg/kg i.p. cf. E. A. Swinyard, J. Am. Pharm. Assoc. Scient. Ed. 38, 201 (1949) and J. Pharmacol. Exptl. Therap. 106, 319 (1952). The agents of the invention are therefore useful in the treatment of epilepsy and other convulsive states such as high pressure neurological syndrome. Furthermore, the agents of the invention reduce ischemia-induced neuronal damage and ensuing symptoms in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion model in rats at a dosage of 1-30 mg/kg i.p, i.v. and p.o. cf. A. Tamura et al., J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metabol. 1, 53-60 (1981)), A. Sauter, M. Rudin, Stroke 17, 1228-1234 (1986). The agents of the invention are therefore useful in the treatment of any clinical condition involving a component of cerebral anoxia, hypoxia and/or ischemia, e.g. ischemic damage to grey and white matter, stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, brain and spinal cord injury/trauma, high intracranial pressure, mult-infarct dementia or vascular dementia, and any surgical procedure potentially associated with cerebral anoxia, hypoxia and/or ischemia (e.g. cardiac bypass, operations on extracerebral vessels). The agents of the invention display binding to the veratridine-sensitive sodium channel with IC 50 S of from about 0.1 to about 100 M. For the binding procedure see for example J. B. Brown, Journal of Neuroscience 6, 2064-2070 (1986). They block veratridine-induced glutamate release in rat hippocampal slice preparations at concentrations of about 0.1-1 M. The experiment is performed according to a modification of M. J. Leach et al. in Epilepsia 27, 490-497 (1986) and Stroke 24, 1063-1067 (1993), using exogenous glutamate. As a result, the agents of the invention are indicated for the treatment of any pathology, disorder or clinical condition involving glutamate release in their etiology, including psychiatric disorders (such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, panic attacks, attention deficit and cognitive disorders, social withdrawal), hormonal conditions (excess GH e.g. in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, angiopathy and acromegaly or LH prostate hypertrophy, menopausal syndrome secretion, corticosterone secretion in stress), metabolic induced brain damage (hypolycemia, non-ketotic hyperglycinaemia glycine encephalopathy, sulphite oxidase deficiency, hepatic encephalopathy associated with liver failure), emesis, spasticity, tinnitus, pain (e.g. cancer pain, arthritis) and drug (ethanol, opiates including synthetics with opiate-like effects, e.g. pethidine, methadone etc., cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and other sedatives, benzodiazepines) abuse and withdrawal. Moreover, the agents of the invention are indicated in the treatment of any pathology involving neuronal damage, for example neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers, Huntingtons or Parkinsons diseases, virus (including HIV)-induced neurodegeneration, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), supra-nuclear palsy, olivoponto-cerebellar atrophy (OPCA), and the actions of environmental, exogenous neurotoxins. For the above-mentioned indications, the appropriate dosage will of course vary depending upon, for example, the compound employed, the host, the mode of administration and the nature and severity of the condition being treated. However, in general, satisfactory results in animals are indicated to be obtained at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 to about 100, preferably from about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg animal body weight. In larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range from about 1 to about 500, preferably from about 1 to about 300 mg of an agent of the invention, conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day or in sustained release form. For all these indications the preferred compound is (R)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8-methoxy-N,N-dimethyl-5-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-2-naphthaleneamine, which is the compound of example 21. It has for example been determined that in the above mentioned electroshock model, this compound provides protection against maximal electroshock-induced convulsions with a threshold dose of 10 mg/kg p.o. for periods up to 8 hours post-administration. In the MCA occlusion model, the compound given i.p. immediately after occlusion has been found to dose-dependently reduce infarct size at 3.2, 10 and 32 mg/kg (19, 43, and 53% respectively). In the veratridine-induced glutamate release test, the compound has been found to block the release with an IC 50 of 0.5 M, which is consistent with its affinity for the veratridine binding site (IC 50 125 nM). The compound of example 21 is for example superior to the standard Lifarizine in the MCA occlusion model (infarct size reduction of 43% versus 25%, after 10 mg/kg i.p.). In the veratridine-induced glutamate release test it has been found to be about equipotent to Lifarizine, but more potent than the standards Riluzole and Lamotrigine (IC 50 0.5 M versus 5 M and 20 M respectively). The preferred indications are epilepsy, stroke and brain and spinal trauma. The agents of the invention may be administered by any conventional route, in particular enterally, preferably orally, for example in the form of tablets or capsules, or parenterally, for example in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions. In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention also provides an agent of the invention, for use as a pharmaceutical, e.g. for the treatment of epilepsy, stroke and brain or spinal trauma. The present invention furthermore provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an agent of the invention in association with at least one pharmaceutical carrier or diluent. Such compositions may be manufactured in conventional manner. Unit dosage forms contain, for example, from about 0.25 to about 150, preferably from 0.25 to about 25 mg of a compound according to the invention. Moreover the present invention provides the use of an agent of the invention, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of any condition mentioned above, e.g. epilepsy, stroke and brain or spinal trauma. In still a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for the treatment of any condition mentioned above, e.g. epilepsy, stroke and brain or spinal trauma, in a subject in need of such treatment, which comprises administering to such subject a therapeutically effective amount of an agent of the invention. The following examples illustrate the invention. The temperatures are given in degrees Celsius and are uncorrected.

After degassing and filling the system with argon, 0.031 g (0.14 mMol) of palladium(II)acetate are added and the mixture is stirred overnight at 80. The aqueous phase is separated and extracted with ethylacetate. The combined organic phases are extracted with 2N acetic acid, the acidic extracts basified with aqueous ammonia and again extracted with ethylacetate. After drying with sodium sulfate, filtering and evaporating the organic phase, the resulting bright-brown oil is treated with fumaric acid in methyl-tert.butylether. The resulting salt is recrystallised from isopropanol, yielding white crystals of the hydrogen fumarate of the title compound, m.p. 213-216. The starting material may be produced as follows: 4.1 g (20 mMol) of (/)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8-methoxy-N,N-dimethyl-2-naphthalenamine are dissolved in 50 ml of acetic acid and 1.8 (22 mMol) of sodium acetate are added. A solution of 1.02 ml (20 mMol) of bromine in 5 ml acetic acid is added dropwise at room temperature within about 30 minutes. A colorless precipitate is formed. After stirring overnight solvent is distilled off under vacuum, the residue taken up with water and extracted with ethylacetate. The remaining aqueous phase is made alkaline with aqueous ammonia and extracted with ethylacetate. The organic phase is dried with sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to dryness. The remaining oil is distilled in a bulb to bulb distillation apparatus yielding a slightly yellow oil, b.p. 170-180 at 0.04 mbar. The following compounds are prepared analogously to example 1.

This is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 09/110,594, filed on Jul. 6, 1998 now abandoned. Polyglycidyl compounds The present invention relates to polyglycidyl compounds based on spirobisindanes, to a process for the preparation of these compounds as well as to their use for the production of moulded articles, coatings, matrix materials, casting compounds or adhesives. At present, polyglycidyl compounds are frequently used as reactive component in curable compositions, for example as hardeners or crosslinkers in powder coating compositions based on polyesters and polyacrylates. Many polyglycidyl compounds containing more than two epoxy groups have as such the disadvantage of being liquid either at room temperature or at a little above room temperature. Typical representatives of these viscous resins are, for example, the triglycidyl ester of trimellitic acid and the diglycidyl ester of 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid. In practice, the homogeneous incorporation of these liquid compounds into solid compositions requires substantially more elaborate processing than is the case when using glycidyl compounds which are already solid. The main component of the solid polyglycidyl compounds are diglycidyl compounds based on bisphenol A. These in turn have disadvantages if they are used as sole crosslinker for curable compositions. They are not suitable for the production of coatings which are resistant to outdoor weathering. An improved flow behaviour is still to be desired regarding the known systems for outdoor weathering-resistant powder coating compositions based on e.g. polyesters and glycidyl compounds such as Araldite PT 810 (triglycidyl isocyanurate TGIC). Furthermore, JP Kokai Hei 8-92231 describes a crystalline, purely bifunctional 6,6-diglycidyloxy-3,3,3,3-tetramethyl-1,1-spirobisindane having a melting point of 80-140 C. which, owing to its high melt flow and low hydrolisable chlorine content, was developed for the production of electronic materials. JP Kokai Hei 8-217852 and JP Kokai Hei 9-124769 describe purely bifunctional 6,6-diglycidyloxy-3,3,3,3-tetraalkyl-1,1-spirobisindanes which are used in cured mixtures with phenol- or naphthol-based resins, preferably for sealing semi-conductor modules. FR 2322161 A1 describes a process for the preparation of epoxy resins by condensation of a polyhydroxy spirobisindane of the formula wherein X and Y are each independently of one another H, CH 3 , OH or Cl, with epichlorohydrin in the presence of a alkali hydroxide, characterized by using said alkali hydroxide solved in a low-weight alcohol (f.e. methanol or ethanol). The examples, by said process epoxidized 3,3,3,3-tetramethyl-5,5.6,6-tetrahydroxy-1,1-spirobisindane, had an epoxy value below the theory. It is the object of this invention to provide novel multifunctional and weather-resistant epoxy compounds which are solid at room temperature and which can be used, for example, as hardeners in polyester powder coating systems where they may replace, inter alia, TGIC as hardener. In this application, compounds that are solid at room temperature will be understood as meaning compounds having a T g value (determined by DSC, heating rate20 C./min) higher than 20 C. The object of this invention is achieved by providing a novel polyglycidyl compound having on average more than two, preferably more than two and a half, particularly preferably more than three, glycidyl groups per molecule and a T g value (determined by DSC, heating rate20 C./min) higher than 20 C., based on a polyfunctional 1,1-spirobisindane of formula I or on a mixture of different polyfunctional 1,1-spirobisindanes of the general formula I wherein Z is a direct single bond or O; more than two of R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are OH, OCORCOOH, OROH, OCONHRNHCOOROH or OC m H 2m n OH, with the proviso that R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are not OH when Z is a direct single bond, wherein m is an integer from 2 to 4, n is an integer from 1 to 20, and R is C 1 -C 8 alkylene, C 5 -C 8 cycloalkylene, C 6 -C 14 arylene or partially hydrated C 6 -C 14 arylene, and the remaining R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are a hydrogen atom or OC 1 -C 8 alkyl, OC 5 -C 8 cycloalkyl, OC 6 -C 14 aryl, partially hydrated OC 6 -C 14 aryl or (meth)acrylate; and R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R8 are each independently of one another C 1 -C 8 alkyl, C 5 -C 8 cycloalkyl, C 6 -C 14 aryl, partially hydrated C 6 -C 14 aryl or a hydrogen atom. R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 defined as C 1 -C 8 alkyl are straight-chain or branched radicals, for example methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl and tert-butyl as well as the different isomers of pentane, hexane, heptane and octane. R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 defined as C 5 -C 8 cycloalkyl are, for example, radicals containing 5 to 8 ring-carbon atoms, e.g. of cyclopentane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane and cyclooctane as well as their substitution products, in particular their alkyl substitution products, such as the C 1 -C 4 alkyl substitution products. R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 defined as C 6 -C 14 aryl can be, for example, phenyl, tolyl, pentalinyl, indenyl, napthyl, azulinyl and anthryl. R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 defined as partially hydrated C 6 -C 14 aryl are understood as being aryls which are partially hydrated by addition of hydrogen to one or several double bonds of the aromatic aryl, for example compounds of formula: R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 defined as OC 1 -C 8 alkyl, OC 5 -C 8 cycloalkyl, OC 6 -C 14 aryl or partially hydrated OC 6 -C 14 aryl have the same meaning as that given above for the corresponding radicals which are not bound to oxygen. R defined as C 1 -C 8 alkylene is understood as being the straight-chain bifunctional groupings (CH 2 ) n , wherein n1 to 8, i.e. for example methylene, ethylene, n-propylene, as well as the branched bifunctional groupings of propene, butene, pentene, hexene, heptene and octene. R defined as C 5 -C 8 cycloalkylene containing 5 to 8 ring-carbon atoms may be, for example, 1,2- and 1,3-cyclopentenyl, 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-hexenyl, 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-heptenyl and 1,2-, 1,3-, 1,4- and 1,5-octenyl, 1,2-norbornyl as well as their substitution products, in particular their alkyl substitution products, such as the C 1 -C 4 alkyl substitution products. R defined as C 6 -C 14 arylene may be, for example, phenylene, tolylene, pentalinylene, indenylene, napthylene, azulinylene and anthrylene. R defined as partially hydrated C 6 -C 14 arylene is understood as meaning arylenes which are partially hydrated by addition of hydrogen to one or several double bonds of the aromatic arylene. Within the present context, the term polyglycidyl compounds will be understood as meaning compounds containing unsubstituted glycidyl groups as well as compounds containing glycidyl groups which are substituted by alkyl groups, preferably methyl groups. The polyglycidyl compounds obtained after the glycidylisation of the polyfunctional 1,1-spirobisindanes are always polyglycidyl ethers or polyglycidyl esters. The basic bodies of formula I, in which Z is a direct bond, are known and are prepared by varying the starting compounds in analogy to the synthesis of 3,3,3,3-tetramethyl-5,5,6,6-tetrahydroxy-1,1-spirobisindane (SBI), for example according to Wilson Baker, J.Chem.Soc 1678 (1934). R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are accordingly determined by the choice of the radicals of the phenolic basic body used (in the case of SBI using pyrocatechol, i.e. 1,2-dihydoxybenzene), or by reacting the hydoxyl groups of the basic body by known subsequent reactions (reaction with anhydrides, etherification etc.), whereas R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 are determined by varying the ketone used (using e.g. acetone, i.e. dimethyl ketone, for the preparation of SBI). The basic bodies of formula 1, in which Z is an oxygen bridge O, are known and can be prepared, for example, according to U.S. patent U.S. Pat. No. 3,764,337. R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 , and also R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 , can be varied here in the manner described above. To prepare the novel polyglycidyl compounds, a polyfunctional 1,1-spirobisindane of formula I or a mixture of different polyfunctional 1,1-spirobisindanes of formula I is reacted by one of the known processes with a stoichiometric excess of glycidyl chloride or -methylglycidyl chloride in the presence of a suitable catalyst and, after adding a base, excess glycidyl chloride or -methylglycidyl chloride is removed by distillation. A general overview may be found, inter alia, in Lee Neville Handbook of Epoxy Resins, McGraw Hill Book Company, 1982, chapter 3. In another method for the preparation of the novel poyglycidyl compounds, a polyfunctional 1,1-spirobisindane of formula I or a mixture of different polyfunctional 1,1-spirobisindanes of formula I is converted by known processes to epoxy resins by etherification with unsubstituted allyl halides or with allyl halides which are substituted by C 1 -C 4 alkyl radicals, e.g. methyl radicals, and by subsequent oxidation of the olefins using suitable oxidants. A general overview on which oxidants are suitable for converting olefins into epoxides may also be found in Lee Neville Handbook of Epoxy Resins, McGraw Hill Book Company 1982, chapter 3. The compounds of formula I are preferably compounds, in which Z is a direct single bond. The polyglycidyl compounds based on basic bodies according to formula I are particularly preferably those, wherein all R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are OH, OCORCOOH, OROH, OCONHRNHCOOROH or OC m H 2m n OH, and m, n and R have the meanings cited above. Of these compounds those are in turn preferred, wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are OH or OCORCOOH, and R has the meaning given above. Again, of these compounds those are preferred, wherein R is C 5 -C 8 cycloalkan-1,2-ylene. When synthesising compounds of formula I, R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 are determined, as mentioned above, by varying the ketone used. In this case, those polyglycidyl compounds are preferred, wherein R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 are each independently of one another C 1 -C 8 alkyl or a hydrogen atom. Those polyglycidyl compounds are particularly preferred, wherein all R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 are C 1 -C 4 alkyl, preferably methyl. Those polyglycidyl compounds are most preferred, which are based on compounds of formula I, wherein all R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are hydroxyl and all R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 are methyl and Z is a direct bond. In another of its aspects, this invention relates to a reaction product obtained from the reaction of a polyglycidyl compound having on average more than two glycidyl groups per molecule and a T g value (determined by DSC, heating rate20 C./min) higher than 20 C., based on a polyfunctional 1,1-spirobisindane of formula II or on a mixture of different polyfunctional 1,1-spirobisindanes of the general formula II wherein Z is a direct single bond or O; more than two of R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are OH, OCORCOOH, OROH, OCONHRNHCOOROH or OC m H 2m n OH, wherein m is an integer from 2 to 4, n is an integer from 1 to 20, and R is C 1 -C 8 alkylene, C 5 -C 8 cycloalkylene, C 6 -C 14 arylene or partially hydrated C 6 -C 14 arylene, and the remaining R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are a hydrogen atom or OC 1 -C 8 alkyl, OC 5 -C 8 cycloalkyl, OC 6 -C 14 aryl, partially hydrated OC 6 -C 14 aryl or (meth)acrylate; and R 5 , R6, R 7 and R8 are each independently of one another C 1 -C 8 alkyl, C 5 -C 8 cycloalkyl, C 6 -C 14 aryl, partially hydrated C 6 -C 14 aryl or a hydrogen atom, with a less than stoichiometric amount of a compound containing two substituents reacting with epoxy groups. The compounds described so far can be reacted in analogy to known glycidyl compounds with compounds reacting with epoxy groups. These reaction products are particularly preferred if the polyglycidyl compound and the compound containing two substituents reacting with epoxy groups are used in such amounts that there are 0.01-0.75 of those groups which react with an epoxy resin per one epoxy group of the polyglycidyl compound. Such reactions are particularly suitable for adjusting the glass transition temperature (T g ) to the respective requirements, i.e. usually to increase the T g . The use of reaction products is also preferred if the compound containing two substituents reacting with epoxy groups is a compound of formula HOCOR 9 COOH, HOR 9 OH, HOR 9 OCONHR 9 NHCO v OR 9 OH or HOC u H 2u v OH, wherein u is an integer from 2 to 4, v is an integer from 1 to 20, and R 9 is C1-C8alkylene, C5-C8cycloalkylene, C6-C14arylene or partially hydrated C6-C14arylene, wherein R 9 is preferably C5-C8cycloalkan-1,2-ylene or C5-C8cycloalkan-1,4-ylene. R 9 can, for example, correspond to those radicals which were cited above for R. It is also preferred to use reaction products if the compound containing two substituents reacting with epoxy groups is 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid or a cyclic anhydride. Typical examples thereof are the anhydrides of phthalic acid or of hexahydrophthalic acid. The novel compounds are valuable formulation components for curable compositions which comprise one of the novel polyglycidyl compounds or its reaction products and a compound reacting therewith with crosslinking. The novel compounds can be combined with all customary crosslinkers or hardeners for epoxy resins. The novel polyglycidyl compounds or their reaction products, where required also in combination with other epoxy resins, can be used for all applications in which epoxy resins are used, for example for the preparation of adhesives, moulding articles and coatings. A preferred field of use for the novel compounds are powder coating applications which are described in more detail below as Use Example. The novel compounds can in this case replace, for example, the triglycidyl isocyanurate TGIC which is particularly widely used in this technology, without requiring any substantial changes in the other components of the powder coatings or in the preparation of coating formulations and without having to consider drawbacks with regard to the technical aspects of applying coating compositions. This invention therefore also relates to powder coatings comprising a carboxyl-terminated polyester and/or a free carboxyl group-containing acrylic resin as compound which reacts with crosslinking, which powder coatings comprise one of the above compounds, employing it as crosslinker. The (meth)acrylate polymer is in this case preferably a copolymer of one or several acrylates and/or methacrylates, preferably of the corresponding alkyl esters containing 1 to 18, more preferably 1 to 8, carbon atoms in the alkyl group, with acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid and, optionally, with additional ethylenically unsaturated comonomers. The (meth)acrylate polymer has, for example, a molecular weight (number average Mn from GPC measurement with polystyrene standardisation) of 500 to 30000, preferably of 1000 to 10000. It furthermore preferably comprises 0.2 to 6 equivalents of free carboxyl groups. The glass transition temperature of the (meth)acrylate polymers is conveniently above 20 C., preferably in the range from 30 to 100 C. Typical examples of suitable (meth)acrylate monomers are ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate and also, preferably, C 1 -C 4 alkylmethacrylates, such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate or butyl methacrylate. (Meth)acrylate derivatives containing silane groups may also be used. Suitable ethylenically unsaturated comononers are, for example, acrylo- or methacrylonitriles and also vinyl compounds. Preferred comonomers are vinyl aromatic compounds, in particular styrene. The above polymers can be prepared in known manner, for example by polymerising the monomers dissolved in suitable organic solvents, in particular in toluene or in mixtures of 1-methoxy-2-propanol, 1-methoxy-2-propylacetate and methyl isobutyl ketone (typically at a weight ratio of 70/20/10) in the presence of a suitable initiator, such as dicumyl peroxide, and of a chain-transfer agent such as thioglycolic acid. They can also be polymerised in the mass. The carboxyl group-containing polyesters preferably have an acid number (given in mg KOH/g polyester) from 10 to 100 and a molecular weight (number average Mn) from 2000 to 10000. In the case of these polyesters, the ratio of Mw (weight average of the molecular weight) to Mn is usually from 2 to 10. These polyesters are preferably solid at room temperature and preferably have a glass transition temperature from 35 to 120 C., preferably from 40 to 80 C. They are condensates of polyols with dicarboxylic acids and, optionally, polyfunctional carboxylic acids (e.g. di-, tri- or tetracarboxylic acids) or the corresponding carboxylic acid anhydrides. Suitable polyols are, for example, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol, neopentanediol, isopentyl glycol, 1,6-hexanediol, glycerol, hexanetriol, trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane, erythritol, pentaerythritol, cyclohexanediol or 1,4-dimethylolcyclohexane. Suitable dicarboxylic acids are, for example, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, phthalic acid, methylphthalic acids, tetrahydrophthalic acid, methyltetrahydrophthalic acids, e.g. 4-methyltetrahydrophthalic acid, cyclohexane-dicarboxylic acids, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, dodecanedicarboxylic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid or 4,4-diphenyldicarboxylic acid, etc. Suitable tricarboxylic acids are typically aliphatic tricarboxylic acids, such as 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid, aromatic tricarboxylic acids, such as trimesic acid, trimellitic acid and hemimellitic acid, or cycloaliphatic tricarboxylic acids, such as 6-methylcyclohex-4-ene-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid. Suitable tetracarboxylic acids are, for example, pyromellitic acid or benzophenone-3,3,4,4-tetracarboxylic acid. Commercially available polyesters are often based on neopentyl glycol and/or trimethylol-propane as main alcoholic components as well as on adipic acid and/or terephthalic acid and/or isophthalic acid and/or trimellitic acid as main acid components. The cited curable compositions preferably comprise the epoxy resin and the additional polymer in such amounts that the ratio of free carboxyl groups to epoxy groups in the composition is from 0.5 to 1 to 2 to 1, preferably from 0.8 to 1 to 1.2 to 1, more preferably about 1 to 1. It is also possible to use other types of epoxy hardeners customarily used for powder coatings in combination with the novel polyglycidyl compounds, for example diglycidyl terephthalate or glycidyl methacrylate homo- or copolymers (described, inter alia, in EP 0 653 466 A2). Such epoxy resin mixtures can provide coatings having a particularly advantageous property profile with respect to the technical aspects of application because they permit adjusting or optimising the properties to the polyesters used. Epoxy resin mixtures having an epoxy value of 1-10 equivalents/kg are preferred. The curable compositions of this invention can also comprise other customary components, such as catalysts and/or accelerators, for example Actirone NXJ-60 (2-propylimidazole), Actiron NXJ-60 P (60% by weight of 2-propylimidazole per 40% by weight of solid carrier material), Beschleuniger DT 3126 (C 16 H 33 N(CH 3 ) 3 Br) or triphenylphosphine, to enable a sufficiently fast curing reaction even at relatively low temperatures, for example in the range from 60 to 160 C. These catalysts are often an organic amine or a derivative of an amine, preferably a tertiary amine or a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound. Catalysts preferred for the reaction of epoxy groups with carboxyl groups are phenylimidazole, N-benzyldimethylamine and 1,8-diazabicyclo5,4,0-7-undecene, where required on a silicate carrier material. The catalyst or a catalyst mixture is usefully added in an amount from about 0.1 to 10, preferably from 0.5 to 5% by weight. The novel curable compositions may additionally contain further customary additives, for example light stabilisers, colourants, pigments, e.g. titanium dioxide, degassing agents, e.g. benzoin, adhesives, thixotropic agents and/or flow control agents. The novel curable compositions may also contain a suitable inert solvent or solvent mixture, for example xylene, butyl acetate, isobutanol, 1-methoxy-2-propanol, 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate or methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). The curable compositions of this invention can be used in the standard areas of curable epoxy resin composition technology, i.e. for example as coating composition, casting resin, impregnating resin, laminating resin, adhesive or sealing material. Powder coatings of this invention can be prepared by simply mixing the components, for example in a ball mill. Another possibility, which is more preferred, is that which comprises fusing all the components, mixing and homogenising them, preferably in an extruder, such as in a Buss ko-kneader, cooling the mixture and commenting it. The powder coating mixtures preferably have an average particle size in the range from 0.015 to 500 m, more preferably from 10 to 100 m. Depending on their application, the powder coatings are cured on the object to be coated at a temperature of at least 100 C., preferably from 150 to 250 C. Curing usually requires about 5 to 60 minutes. Objects and materials suitable for coating are all those which are stable at the temperatures required for curing, in particular metals and ceramics. The use of, in particular, polyesters which consist to 50% by weight, preferably to 90% by weight and more (relative to the diol component), of neopentanediol and of aromatic or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids, in particular terephthalic acid, as modules and which are commercially available e.g. as Crylcoat types UCB or under names such as Uralac DSM or Grilesta EMS, provides powder coatings which result in weather-resistant coatings suitable for outdoor coatings and which are particularly flexible with respect to sudden or also prolonged mechanical stress. USE EXAMPLES EXAMPLE A Synthesis of 3,3,3,3-tetramethyl-5,5,6,6-tetrahydroxy-1,1,-spirobisindane (SBI) The synthesis is carried out according to Wilson Baker, J.Chem.Soc 1678 (1934). 297.3 g (2.7 mol) of pyrocatechol (Fluka) (1,2-dihydoxybenzene) are dissolved in 320 ml of acetone and 700 ml of glacial acetic acid (Fluka). Subsequently, 540 ml of conc. hydrochloric acid are added and the mixture is refluxed for 1 days, during which time an growing precipitate gradually forms. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and the precipitate is then collected by filtration and washed twice with about 1 litre of a mixture of water and acetic acid at a ratio of 1:1 and, finally, with pure water until the pH of the filtrate is neutral.

Example 5 Use of SBI-G as crosslinker for weather-resistant powder coatings based on polyesters. The powder coatings listed in Table II are prepared in analogy to Example 4. The white pigmented unstabilised powder coating test panels obtained are subjected to outdoor weathering. The gloss and yellowness index values obtained at the beginning (time t0) and after 5 and 10 months, respectively, are compiled in Table IV. The results obtained prove that the novel powder coatings have weather-resistant properties which match the quality of the reference formulations. Even after 10 months of outdoor weathering, the gloss and yellowness index values are on virtually the same scale as the starting values. This is surprising insofar as the claimed SBI-G is an aromatic compound, giving rise to expecatations of the typical bad behaviour of paint systems based on bisphenol A solid resins. Even after a short time, these solid resins show strong yellowing and also chalking, with the corresponding loss in gloss. Quite on the contrary, the SBI-G coatings obtained have values which are comparable to those of the coatings known to be weather-resistant which are obtained with crosslinkers such as TGIC or PT 910.

This application is a 371 of PCT/JP98/04780, filed Oct. 22, 1988. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to novel derivatives of antibiotic erythromycin A. BACKGROUND ART Erythromycin A is an antibiotic widely used as an agent for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by Gram-positive bacteria, mycoplasmas, etc. However, erythromycin A is decomposed by gastric acid due to its instability to acids, and thus has a drawback of no constancy of movement in the body. Hitherto many erythromycin derivatives have been prepared for the purpose of the improvement of such biological or pharmaceutically effective properties. For example, it is reported that 6-O-methylerythromycin A derivatives have an improved stability to acids and have a superior in vivo antibacterial activity in comparison with erythromycin A when administered orally (U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,803). There are also recent reports relating to 11,12-cyclic carbamate derivatives obtained from 6-O-methylerythromycin A as a starting material with the aim of expansion of antibacterial spectrum as well as a stability to acids (EP. Patent No. 487411, U.S. Pat. No. 4,742,049). In addition, the present inventors have reported the antibacterial activity of the ester derivatives esterified at the 3-position (EP. Patent No. 619320).

By use of both an inexpensive optically active diphosphine compound and a rhodium complex as catalysts, intermediate compounds important for carbapenem antibiotics can be manufactured with high selectivity and efficiency. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing (3S,4R)-4-(R)-1-formylethylazetidin-2-one derivativeswhich are useful as intermediates for synthesis of carbapenem antibioticsthrough asymmetric hydroformylation by use of both an optically active diphosphine compound and a rhodium complex as catalysts. 2. Description of the Related Art In recent years, a number of metal complexes have been used in practice as catalysts for organic synthesis. Since noble metal complexes are stable and easy to handle, there have been conducted numerous synthesis studies have been conducted using such complexes as catalysts, regardless of their high prices. Thus, noble metal complexes have facilitated organic synthesis reactions which were believed to be impossible to carry out by conventional methods. In particular, complexes of a transition metal such as rhodium or ruthenium and having an optically active diphosphine ligand are known as excellent catalysts for asymmetric synthesis, and a variety of phosphine compounds having a characteristic structure have been developed (edited by The Chemical Society of Japan, Kagaku Sosetsu 32 Chemistry of Organometallics, pp. 237-238, 1982). Asymmetric hydroformylation using a transition metal-optically active phosphine complex is one class of such reactions; e.g., reaction by use of a rhodium complex having an optically active 2,3-o-diisopropylidene-2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)-butane (hereinafter referred to as DIOP) ligand (Journal of Organic Chemistry, vol. 46, page 4422 (1981)); reaction by use of a rhodium complex having an optically active diphosphine (e.g., DIOP) ligand (Bulletin of Chemical Society of Japan, vol. 52, page 2605 (1976)); and a catalytic asymmetric hydroformylation of methyl acetamideacrylate by use of a rhodium complex containing DIOP, etc. as a ligand (Tetrahedron Asymmetry, vol. 10, page 693 (1990)). As a catalyst formed of a complex having an optically active tertiary phosphate ligand, Tetrahedron Asymmetry, vol. 3, page 583 (1992) describes bis(triaryl phosphite) having an optically active binaphthyl skeleton, as well as asymmetric hydroformylation of vinyl acetate making use of a rhodium complex containing the phosphate as a ligand. Recently, it has also been reported that a ligand called BINAPHOS having an asymmetric structure, i.e., having a binaphthyl skeleton and no C2 symmetry, is useful for the asymmetric hydroformylation of olefins (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 115, 7033 (1993)). Thus, a variety of catalysts for asymmetric synthesis are known. Nevertheless, there is still demand for development of a catalyst that meets requirements of high selectivity called for by some target compounds. High selectivity is particularly needed in the field of pharmaceuticals. For example, there has been reported a method for manufacturing (3S,4R)-4-(R)-1-formylethylazetidin-2-one derivatives serving as important intermediates for carbapenem antibiotics which have been actively developed in recent years, through asymmetric hydroformylation of 4-vinylazetidin-2-one by use of an optically active phosphine-phosphite compound and a metal compound containing Rh, etc. as catalysts (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No. 6-316,560). A method has also been reported in which asymmetric hydroformylation of 4-vinylazetidin-2-one is performed by use of an optically active phosphine-phosphinite compound and a metal compound containing Rh, etc. as catalysts (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No. 9-40,684). PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION In all the above-described methods, however, there is observed formation of a normal species (n-form:2-formylethyl form) which is a by-product attributed to regioselectivity to a formyl group-bonding and simultaneous formation of an S-species (i.e., -form) affecting the enantioselectivity in addition to an (R)-species (i.e., -form), which is a target compound, attributed to configuration of a formyl group-bonding. Therefore, there has been demand for satisfying both regioselectivity and enantioselectivity, as well as the demand for obtaining a target compound in high yield. In particular, there has been demand for a method for effectively manufacturing (3S,4R)-4-(R)-1-formylethylazetidin-2-one derivatives having a methyl group at the -position, which are of great value for use as important intermediates for carbapenem antibiotics, with high regioselectivity and enantioselectivity. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present inventors have conducted earnest studies to solve the above problems, and found that (3S,4R)-4-(R)-1-formylethylazetidin-2-one derivatives having a methyl group at the -position of the present invention are effectively manufactured through asymmetric hydroformylation by use of both an inexpensive and easily available optically active diphosphine compound and a rhodium complex as catalysts. The present invention was accomplished based on this finding. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing (3S,4R)-4-(R)-1-formylethylazetidin-2-one derivatives represented by formula (3): wherein R 1 represents a hydrogen atom or a protective group for a hydroxyl group; through asymmetric hydroformylation of 4-vinylazetidin-2-one represented by formula (1): wherein R 1 has the same meaning as described above; in the presence of a rhodium complex and a (2S,4S)-diphosphine compound represented by formula (2): wherein R 2 represents a phenyl group which may be substituted with 1-5 substituent(s) selected from a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxy group, and a halogen atom. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Hereafter, the present invention will be described in detail. The 4-vinylazetidin-2-one (formula (1)) used as starting materials in the present invention are conventionally known compounds, which may be synthesized through, for example, a method described in Liebig Ann. Chem., 539-560 (1974). Specifically, a 4-acetoxyazetidinon-2-one derivative (formula (4)) is subjected to reaction with sodium benzenesulfinate, sodium p-toluenesulfinate, or the corresponding potassium salt or lithium salt in a soluble solvent such as acetone-water, methanol, or water-methanol to thereby derive to a compound represented by formula (5). Subsequently, this compound is reacted with an organic vinyl compoundfor example, a vinylating agent such as vinyl magnesium chloride, vinyl magnesium bromide, vinyl magnesium iodide, divinyl magnesium, vinyl lithium, vinyl zinc chloride, or divinyl zincto thereby obtain 4-vinylazetidin-2-one (formula (1)): wherein R 1 has the same meaning as described above; Ac represents an acetyl group; and Ar represents a phenyl group which may be substituted with a halogen atom, a lower alkyl group, etc. The substituent R 1 in 4-vinylazetidin-2-one (formula (1)) represents a hydrogen atom or a protective group for a hydroxyl group, and as the protective group for a hydroxyl group there may be used typical protective groups, i.e., a protective group which may be converted to a hydroxyl group through hydrolysis or hydrogenation used. Examples include organic silyl groups, an acyl group, and aralkyl groups. Specific examples include tri-lower alkylsilyl groups, diphenyl-lower alkylsilyl groups, a triphenylsilyl group, lower alkylcarbonyl groups, a benzyl group, and a benzoyl group. Preferred examples include tri-lower alkylsilyl groups and diphenyl-lower alkylsilyl groups. Of these protective groups for a hydroxyl group, there is preferred a group substituted with a linear or branched alkyl group having 1-6 carbon atom(s) as the lower alkyl substituent. Examples of the tri-lower alkylsilyl groups include a tert-butyldimethylsilyl group, a dimethyltexylsilyl group, a triethylsilyl group, a truisopropylsilyl group, and a trimethylsilyl group, with a tert-butyldimethylsilyl group being particularly preferred. A tert-butyldiphenylsilyl group is preferred as the diphenyl-lower alkyl group. (3S,4R)-4-(R)-1-Formylethylazetidin-2-one derivatives (formula (3)), which are the target compounds of the present invention, may be manufactured through asymmetric hydroformylation of the above-described 4-vinylazetidin-2-one (formula (1)) by use of an optically active diphosphine compound (formula (2)) and a rhodium compound as catalysts. In accordance with the present invention, asymmetric hydroformylation of 4-vinylazetidin-2-one (formula (1)) in the presence of an (S,S)-form of a diphosphine compound and a rhodium compound enables selective and effective manufacture of a product of -form in particular among three possibly formed isomers of -form, -form, and n-form: wherein R 1 has the same meaning as described above. In the diphosphine compounds used as catalysts in the present invention, R 2 in formula (2) represents a phenyl group which may be substituted with 1-5 substituent(s) selected from a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxy group, and a halogen atom, and the preferred number of these substituents is 0-3. Examples of the lower alkyl group substituents to a phenyl group include a linear or branched alkyl group having 1-4 carbon atom(s) such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, an isopropyl group, an n-butyl group, a sec-butyl group, an isobutyl group, or a tert-butyl group. Preferred examples of the phenyl group substituted with the lower alkyl group(s) include an o-tolyl group, an m-tolyl group, a p-tolyl group, a 3,5-dimethylphenyl group, a mesityl group, a 3,5-di(tert-butyl)phenyl group, and a 3,5-diethylphenyl group. Examples of the lower alkoxy group substituents to a phenyl group include a linear or branched alkoxy group having 1-4 carbon atom(s) such as a methoxy group, an ethoxy group, a propyloxy group, an isopropyloxy group, and a tert-butoxy group. Preferred examples of the phenyl group substituted with the lower alkoxy group(s) include a p-methoxyphenyl group, an m-methoxyphenyl group, and a 3,5-dimethoxyphenyl group. Furthermore, examples of the halogen atom substituents to a phenyl group include a fluorine atom, a chlorine atom, a bromine atom, and an iodine atom. Preferred examples of the phenyl group substituted with the halogen atom(s) include a p-fluorophenyl group, a 3,5-difluorophenyl group, a p-chlorophenyl group, a 3,5-dichlorophenyl group, a p-bromophenyl group, and a 3,5-dibromophenyl group. Examples of the diphosphine compounds used as ligands in the asymmetric hydroformylation of the present invention include compounds as described above; however, use of a diphosphine compound having a configuration of (S,S) is an essential condition for obtaining (3S,4R)-4-(R)-1-formylethylazetidin-2-one derivatives (formula (3)), which are the target compounds. A (2S,4S)-form of the diphosphine compound must be used in order to obtain a target compound of the present invention. These diphosphine compounds may typically be used in an amount of 0.0005-10 mol %, preferably 0.001-5 mol %, with respect to 4-vinylazetidin-2-one (formula (1)) serving as a substrate. With regard to a rhodium complex serving as the other catalyst component, a zwitterionic complex is preferred, and specific examples include a compound represented by formula (4): Rh (I)(L)( 6 C 6 H 5 B Ph 3 )(4) wherein L represents 1,5-cyclooctadiene (hereinafter referred to as COD) or norbornadiene (hereinafter referred to as NBD), Ph represents a phenyl group, and Rh means Rh(I). Examples of the rhodium complexes include Rh (COD)( 6 C 6 H 5 B h 3 ) and Rh (NBD)( 6 C 6 H 5 B Ph 3 ), and the latter complex is preferred. The rhodium complex may be used in a mole amount to an equimole amount based on the optically active diphosphine compound used, and is preferably used in a to mole amount. No particular limitation is imposed on the solvents used in the present invention, and any solvent may be used so long as it effects reaction. Hydrocarbons are particularly preferred. Specific examples include n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, isooctane, nonane, decane, cyclohexane, cyclopentane, benzene, toluene, xylene, and mesitylene. In addition to these solvents, examples include ethers such as diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, or diethylene glycol dimethyl ether; ketones such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone; and esters such as ethyl acetate, butyl butyrate, or butyl benzoate. These solvents may be used singly or in combination of two or more species. The reaction temperature of hydroformylation of the present invention is preferably low in view of thermal stability of formed aldehyde, although it is preferably high in view of the reaction rate. The temperature is typically 20-250 C., preferably 10-120 C. The reaction may be carried out for a reaction time of 1-48 hours, and is preferably carried out for 6-30 hours. The asymmetric hydroformylation of the present invention is conducted in the presence of carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a similar manner as that for typical hydroformylation. In this case, the reaction may be carried out under the reaction pressure of 5-200 kg/cm 2 , preferably 20-150 kg/cm 2 and the mixing mole ratio of carbon monoxide to hydrogen, carbon monoxide/hydrogen, is 10-0.1, preferably 4-0.25. The gas system may be diluted with another reaction-inert gas so long as the mixing mole ratio of carbon monoxide to hydrogen is maintained within the given range. For example, methane, nitrogen, argon, helium, carbon dioxide, etc. may be used singly or in combination of two or more species. The asymmetric hydroformylation of the present invention provides remarkable lowering of formation of the n-form, which has been a problem in conventional methods, and enables synthesis of the -form, which is the target compound, with selectivity as high as about 84% based on the -form/-form/n-form. The thus-obtained (3S,4R)-4-(R)-1-formylethyl-azetidin-2-one derivatives (formula (3)), which are target compounds of the present invention, easily undergo conversion of a formyl group to a carboxyl group, through customary oxidation, e.g., Jones oxidation, and are finally converted to useful intermediates derived to carbapenem antibiotics.

Examples of group e) are 1,2,4-triazolyl, 1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl, 1-carboxymethyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl or 1,2,3-triazol-5-yl. The term heterocycle in the definition of Het 2 in group f) refers to a single ring or fused heterocyclic rings having 4 to 7, preferably 5- or 6- atoms in each ring, there being up to four hetero atoms in each ring selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur in each ring, which heterocyclic ring may carry 1 to 3 optional substituents selected from (C 1-4 )alkyl, (C 2-4 )alkenyl, (C 1-4 )alkoxy, halogen, trihalo-(C 1-4 )alkyl, hydroxy, acyloxy, oxo, mercapto, amino, carboxyl, carbamoyl, di-(C 1-4 )alkylamino, carboxymethyl, carbomoylmethyl, sulfomethyl and methoxycarbonylamino.

Except where otherwise indicated organic radicals contain preferably up to 10 carbon atoms and lower refers to up to 4 carbon atoms. Examples of acid addition salts are salts of inorganic or organic acids, e.g. hydroiodide or hydrochloride. A particular preferred group of compounds of formula I comprise those of formula I wherein R is hydrogen or a negative charge, R o is hydrogen, and X is pyridinium, 1,2,3-triazol-5-ylthio or carbamoylmethylethylmethylammonium and their acid addition salts. The compounds of formula I are known. They are characterized by their excellent spectrum of activity: for example, in EP A 333 154 and EP A 264 091, a number of compounds having a substituted ammonium-propenyl group and substituted pyridinium-propenyl group are described. EP 315 518 claims compounds of the type having isomeric thienopyridinium-propenyl derivatives. DE 3 404 615 and DE 3 512 225 describe pyridinium- and ammonium-propenyl derivatives which are substituted in the same way. U.S. Pat. No. 4,139,618 describes for example cephalosporin derivatives having thia- or oxadiazol-5-yl-thio groups as substituents. However, according to methods known from literature, the compounds of formula I can only be produced via several intermediate steps, using extensive protecting group technology. For example, in EP 333 154, 7--(2-phenylacetamido)-3-chloromethylcephem-4-carboxylic acid-p-methoxybenzylester is converted into the vinylogous chloromethyl compound via the analogous iodomethyl compound, phosphonium salt and Wittig reaction with chloroacetaldehyde. The resultant compound is then reacted with a N-nucleophile according to choice, the protecting groups in position 7 and 4 are cleaved in any order and subsequently reacylated with the side chain that is applicable for the respective active substance in position 7. In another reaction sequence, for example, in the first stage the phenylacetyl protecting group at the vinylogous chloromethyl compound is cleaved, then the N-nucleophile is introduced, subsequently the ester protecting group is removed and reacylated or synthesis to form the active substance is effected in reverse order. The disadvantages of this synthesis are on the one hand the high number of stages of synthesis due to extensive protecting group technology, and on the other hand to form the vinylogous compound it is necessary to work with poisonous choroacetaldehyde which is only obtainable with extreme difficulty and with high loss in dry, monomeric form. Another synthesis strategy is described for example in EP 315 518. Here, 7-amino-3-chloromethylcephem-4-carboxylic acid benzhydryl ester is acylated with the protected active substance side chain, subsequently vinylized again with chloracetaldehyde by means of the corresponding phosphonium salt, chloride is exchanged for iodide, reacted with the corresponding N-heterocycle and the protecting group is subsequently cleaved. Again due to extensive protecting group technology, this synthesis requires a large number of stages of synthesis with some expensive chromatography steps. Another approach is illustrated by the synthesis method claimed in DE 3 404 615. Here, in reverse order, a Wittig reaction is carried out between a protected 7-acylamino-3-formyl-4-carboxylic acid ester with the corresponding substituted phosphoniumylide. Again, the expensive protecting group technology and the poor accessibility of the corresponding 3-formylcephem compound and of the Wittig reagent are distinct disadvantages of this synthesis. In U.S. Pat. No. 4 139 618, in an expensive synthesis via a 3-formyl-2-cephem-4-carboxylic acid ester, a Grignard reaction and sigmatropic rearrangement, 7-acylamino-3-acetoxypropenyl-cephem-4-carboxylic acid ester is produced, the ester group cleaved and the exchange with a heterocyclic thiole effected in aqueous solution. As an alternative to this, the heterocyclic thiole is introduced under acidic catalysis to a 1-hydroxypropenyl-2-cephemcarboxylic acid ester. The 2-double bond is subsequently isomerized and the ester protecting group cleaved. One disadvantage of this process is the fact that exchange of the substituent in an aqueous medium in -lactam chemistry is linked with considerable decomposition. In an alternative process, the product must be purified by chromatography. In view of the many advantages of 3-substituted propenyl cephalosporines, there was still a need for a commercially useful process which provides intermediates from which a wide variety of 3-substituted propenyl cephalosporines can be produced. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved process for the production of compounds of formula I. It is a further object of this invention to provide certain new intermediates. According to one aspect, the present invention provides a new process for the production of compounds of formula I as defined above, which comprises the step of i) subjecting a compound of formula IX wherein R o is as defined above and R 6 is a silyl protecting group, to a nucleophilic exchange in 3-position, and optionally splitting off silyl protecting groups. Examples of silyl protecting groups include trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, tri-n-propyl-silyl, tri-n-butylsilyl, methyldiethylsilyl, dimethylethylsilyl, phenyldimethylsilyl, tert. butyldiphenylsilyl, tert. butyldimethylsilyl and triphenylsilyl. The trimethylsilyl group is preferred. The exchange reaction with a nucleophile, according to the invention, is extremely simple. By adding the corresponding N-nucleophile as a free base or in the form of an anion, a compound of formula IX is converted into the N,O-bissilylated derivative of formula I, i.e. wherein R and R 1 are silyl protecting groups, which groups may be splitt off by simple hydrolysis or alcoholysis to give compounds of formula I, wherein R is hydrogen or a negative charge and R 1 is hydrogen. The compounds having substitution type d) are obtained whereby the corresponding amine is reacted in the form of a Schiff base and the aldehyde component is removed in known manner when the reaction with the compound of formula IX has taken place. In the same way, the reaction with S-heterocycles is simple. The compounds of formula I are obtained by adding the S-heterocycle in the form of its alkali or alkaline earth salt, in the form of a quaternary ammonium salt or in the form of the free mercapto compound, in the presence of an acid trap, with subsequent hydrolysis or alcoholysis of the silyl protecting groups. If desired, in order to raise the solubility of the heterocycle in the reaction system, a cosolvent such as an organic amide, a urea or a polar carbonyl derivative, is added. If readily silylable functions are contained in the nucleophiles as substituents, these are optionally silylated with one of the silylation agents mentioned below in step iii) prior to the reaction with a compound of formula IX. The compounds of formula I can be isolated in conventional manner. Silyl protecting groups may be removed by simple hydrolysis or alcoholysis. This may be effected e.g. either by adding a desilylation agent to the reaction mixture, or the product is extracted into a separable aqueous phase, by adding water either under alkaline or acidic conditions and precipitating by adjusting the pH value to the isoelectric point, optionally adding an organic solvent. The compounds of formula IX are new and also form part of the invention. The compounds of formula IX, as well as of formula I, VII and VIII, include two isomers, namely (E)-isomer (i.e. a trans-isomer) and (Z)-isomer (i.e. a cis-isomer) and a mixture thereof. A compound of formula IX is conveniently obtained by the step of ii) reacting a compound of formula VIII wherein R o and R 6 are defined as above, and R 10 is a silyl protecting group, an optionally substituted straight or branched alkyl radical, an optionally substituted aryl or acyl radical, with an iodinating agent. Examples of aryl in the definition of R 10 include phenyl or naphthyl, optionally substituted with up to 3 groups selected from halogen, (C 1-4 )alkyl or (C 1-4 alkoxy. Examples of acyl are (C 1-4 )alkylcarbonyl e.g. formyl or acetyl, or benzoyl. Suitable solvents are inert, organic solvents, e.g. halogenated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane or chloroform, inert nitriles such as acetonitrile or sulfolane. Suitable iodinating agents for the production of a compound of formula IX are trialkyliodosilanes, for example trimethyliodosilane or diiodosilane. The iodinating agent may be employed in a stoichiometric quantity or in excess. The temperature during iodination depends on the reactivity of the oxygen derivative in formula VIII. Thus, temperatures of 50 C. to boiling point of the reaction mixture are possible. It is preferable to operate at a temperature of 20 C. to 20 C. During the iodination reaction, the compound of formula IX is surprisingly obtained predominantly as the E-isomer; after longer reaction times or on addition of an inert polar solvent, e.g. acetonitrile or sulfolane, practically exclusively E-isomers are formed. Thus in the subsequent products of formula I, the E-configuration on the double bond also dominates. A compound of formula VIII is conveniently obtained by iii) silylating a compound of formula VII wherein R o is defined as above and R 9 is hydrogen, an optionally substituted straight or branched alkyl radical, an optionally substituted aryl radical or an acyl radical. Suitable silylation agents are strong silylation agents, such as hexamethyldisilazane, in the presence of a catalyst, e.g. an organic acid, a quaternary ammonium salt or a mixture of hexamethyldisilazane with a silylation agent such as trimethylchlorosilane or trimethyliodosilane. In the same way, silylation agents such as bis-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide or bissilylurea may be used in combination with one of the above-mentioned silylation agents. Suitable solvents are inert organic solvents, e.g. halogenated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane or chloroform, inert nitrites such as acetonitrile, or acyclic or cyclic ethers. It is preferable to use the solvents which in the next stage are inert towards the iodinating agent. Solvents which are not inert have to be removed and replaced prior to the reaction with the iodinating agent. The temperature for the silylation reaction is not critical, and may be up to boiling point of the relevant solvent. The compounds of formula VII may be employed in any E:Z ratio. The compounds of formula VIII may then be reacted in situ with an iodinating agent to form compounds of formula IX, which may then be subjected in situ to a nucleophilic exchange in 3-position to give compounds of formula I. The compounds or formula VII may be prepared in known manner. For example they may be prepared by the method described in European Patent Application No. 92103666.1 by reacting a 7-silylated-3-iodomethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid silyl ester (obtainable from e.g. 7-ACA) with e.g. triphenylphosphine to give a 7-silylated-3-triphenylphosphoniummethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid silyl ester which is reacted with a base and then with an aldehyde to give compounds of formula VII. The process according to the invention, compared with the state of the art, has the simplest protecting group technology, is a one-pot reaction and is effected under mild, aprotic conditions. It may be used on industrial scale. The reaction steps i), ii), and iii) are preferably carried out in a one-pot process without isolation of the intermediates. The process uses silyl groups as protecting groups, which may be introduced in a single step and also may be cleaved in one single step, thus reducing the number of steps. Silyl protecting groups may be removed by simple hydrolysis or alcoholysis at the end of the reaction. The relevant products may be obtained in pure form by reprecipitation, resp. recrystallization, without any chromatography steps. In its preliminary stages of vinylization of 7-aminocephalosporanic acid in the Wittig stage, the process according to the invention enables work to be effected using ecologically acceptable and safe aldehydes. The new compound of formula IX is a central intermediate product for the production of compounds of formula I. In addition, this method of synthesis leaves open the option of subsequently adding an acyl radical in position 7 without expensive protecting group technology. The compounds of formula I are important starting products in the production of valuable cephalosporin antibiotics. Cephalosporins which are propenyl-substituted in 3-position are either resorbed orally, or when applied parenterally, they are characterized for their very broad efficient spectrum of activity. For example, the following compound may be produced. In the following examples, which illustrate the invention more fully, but in no way limit its scope, all temperatures are given in degrees celsius.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compounds useful for inhibiting a retrovirus in a human cell infected with said retrovirus. More particularly, the present invention provides pyran-2-ones, 5,6-dihydropyran-2-ones, 4-hydroxy-benzopyran-2-ones, 4-hydroxy-cycloalkylbpyran-2-ones, and derivatives thereof as HIV-proteinase inhibitors. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION During the past decade, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has progressed from having the status of a medical curiosity afflicting only a small number of individuals to a problem of major proportions, both medically and economically. John Saunders and Richard Storer, New Developments in RT Inhibitors, DNP 5(3), April 1992, pages 153-169. WHO figures reveal that more than 360,000 cases of AIDS have been reported worldwide, including nearly 175,000 cases in the U.S.A. Of these, approximately 100,000 worldwide (50,000 in the U.S.A.) were reported in the preceding 12-month period. In the U.S.A., the number of seropositive individuals is thought to be approximately two million, and estimates suggest that 5-10 million people worldwide may be seropositive. Saunders and Storer, page 153. Since the first description of the malady in the early part of this decade, acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome (AIDS) and its devastating consequences have been subjects of continuous and intense coverage in both the lay and scientific press. Indeed, an edition of Scientific American was entirely devoted to AIDS (Scientific American 289, 4 (1988)), and the literature on the disease and the virus is already so vast as to defy thorough citation. On Mar. 20, 1987, the FDA approved the use of the compound, zidovudine (AZT), to treat AIDS patients with a recent initial episode of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, AIDS patients with conditions other than pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or patients infected with the virus with an absolute CD4 lymphocyte count of less than 200/mm 3 in the peripheral blood. AZT is a known inhibitor of viral reverse transcriptase, an enzyme necessary for human immunodeficiency virus replication. U.S. Pat. No. 4,724,232 claims a method of treating humans having acquired immunodeficiency syndrome utilizing 3-azido-3-deoxy-thymidine (azidothymidine, AZT). Following the discovery of the anti-HIV activity of AZT, much effort has been focused on a wide variety of other dideoxynucleoside analogues in the search for superior agents. In the case of the 2.3-dideoxy series, ddC and ddI have shown potent activity against HIV in vitro and have been evaluated in clinical trials. Saunders and Storer, page 160. The compound ddC is currently being developed by Hoffman-La Roche Co. as a potential anti-AIDS drug. Its limiting toxicity in humans is peripheral neuropathy which is reversible at low doses. Raymond R. Schinazi, Jan R. Mead and Paul M. Feorino, Insights Into HIV Chemotherapy, AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses, Vol. 8, Number 6, 1992, pages 963-990. It has been approved by the FDA for AIDS therapy in combination with AZT. The compound ddI has also been evaluated in clinical trials. Its limiting toxicities are peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis. It has also been shown to stimulate hepatic glycolysis leading to irreversible liver damage. Schinazi, Mead and Feorino, page 966. It has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of HIV-1 infections in adults and pediatric patients who are intolerant to or whose health has significantly deteriorated while on AZT treatment. Schinazi, Mead and Feorino, page 966. Among these approved drugs, AZT is currently the only drug that has been shown to decrease the mortality and frequency of opportunistic infections associated with AIDS. Schinazi, Mead and Feorino, page 963. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has long been recognized as the causative agent in AIDS, although a minority opinion to the contrary has been expressed (e.g., P. Duesberg, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 86:755-764 (1989)). Sequence analysis of the complete genomes from several infective and non-infective HIV-isolates has shed considerable light on the make-up of the virus and the types of molecules that are essential for its replication and maturation to an infective species. The HIV protease is essential for the processing of the viral gag and gag-pol polypeptides into mature virion proteins. L. Ratner, et al., Nature, 313:277-284 (1985); L. H. Pearl and W. R. Taylor, Nature, 329:351 (1987). HIV exhibits the same gag/pol/env organization seen in other retroviruses. L. Ratner, et al., above; S. Wain-Hobson, et al., Cell, 40:9-17 (1985); R. Sanchez-Pescador, et al., Science, 227:484-492 (1985); and M. A. Muesing, et al., Nature, 313:450-458 (1985). Reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme unique to retroviruses that catalyzes the conversion of viral RNA into double stranded DNA. Blockage at any point during the transcription process, by AZT or any other aberrant deoxynucleoside triphosphate incapable of elongation, should have dramatic consequences relative to viral replication. Much work on the RT target is in progress based, in large measure, upon the fact that nucleosides like AZT are easily delivered to cells. However, the inefficiency of phosphorylation steps to the triphosphate, and the lack of specificity and consequent toxicity, constitute major drawbacks to use of AZT and similar nucleosides having a blocked, or missing, 3hydroxyl group. The T4 cell receptor for HIV, the so-called CD4 molecule, has also been targeted as an intervention point in AIDS therapy. R. A. Fisher, et al., Nature, 331:76-78 (1988); R. E. Hussey, et al., Nature, 331:78-81 (1988); and K. C. Deen, et al., Nature, 331:82-84 (1988). The exterior portion of this transmembrane protein, a molecule of 371 amino acids (sCD4) has been expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and Genentech (D. H. Smith, et al., Science, 238:1704-1707 (1987)) has had a product in clinical trials since the fall of 1987. CD4 has been shown to have a narrow spectrum of activity against wild-type virus and so far has failed to control HIV infection in humans. Schinazi, Mead and Feorino, page 963. The idea behind CD4 based therapy is that the molecules can neutralize HIV by interfering with viral attachment to T4, and other cells which express CD4 on their surfaces. A variant on this theme is to attach cell toxins to CD4 for specific binding and delivery to infected cells which display glycoprotein gp-120 on their surfaces. M. A. Till, et al., Science, 242:1166-1168 (1988); and V. K. Chaudhary, et al., Nature, 335:369-372 (1988). Another therapeutic target in AIDS involves inhibition of the viral protease (or proteinase) that is essential for processing HIV-fusion polypeptide precursors. In HIV and several other retroviruses, the proteolytic maturation of the gag and gag/pol fusion polypeptides (a process indispensable for generation of infective viral particles) has been shown to be mediated by a protease that is, itself, encoded by the pol region of the viral genome. Y. Yoshinaka, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82:1618-1622 (1985); Y. Yoshinaka, et al., J. Virol., 55:870-873 (1985); Y. Yoshinaka, et al., J. Virol., 57:826-832 (1986); and K. von der Helm, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 74:911-915 (1977). Inhibition of the protease has been shown to inhibit the processing of the HIV p55 in mammalian cell and HIV replication in T lymphocytes. T. J. McQuade, et al., Science, 247:454 (1990). The protease (or proteinase), consisting of only 99 amino acids, is among the smallest enzymes known, and its demonstrated homology to aspartyl proteases such as pepsin and renin (L. H. Pearl and W. R. Taylor, Nature, 329:351-354 (1987); and I. Katoh, et al., Nature, 329:654-656 (1987)), led to inferences regarding the three-dimensional structure and mechanism of the enzyme (L. H. Pearl and W. R. Taylor, above) that have since been borne out experimentally. Active HIV protease has been expressed in bacteria (see, e.g., P. L. Darke, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 264:2307-2312 (1989)) and chemically synthesized (J. Schneider and S. B. Kent, Cell, 54:363-368 (1988); and R. F. Nutt, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 85:7129-7133 (1988)). Site directed mutagenesis (P. L. Darke, et al., above); and N. E. Kohl, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 85:4686-4690 (1988)) and pepstatin inhibition (P. L. Darke, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 264:2307-2312 (1989); S. Seelmeier, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 85:6612-6616 (1988); C. -Z. Giam and I. Borsos, J. Biol. Chem., 263:14617-14720 (1988); and J. Hansen, et al., EMBO J., 7:1785-1791 (1988)) have provided evidence for HIV proteases mechanistic function as an aspartyl protease. A study has demonstrated that the protease cleaves at the sites expected in peptides modeled after the regions actually cleaved by the enzyme in the gag and pol precursor proteins during viral maturation. P. L. Darke, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Communs., 156:297-303 (1988). X-ray crystallographic analysis of the HIV-protease (M. A. Navia, et al., Nature, 337:615-620 (1989)) and a related retroviral enzyme from Rous sarcoma virus (M. Miller, et al., Nature, 337:576-579 (1989)) reveal an active site in the protease dimer that is identical to that seen in other aspartyl proteases, thus supporting the supposition (L. H. Pearl and W.

Also, the carbon atom content of various hydrocarbon-containing moieties of the present invention is indicated by a subscripted integer representing the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the moiety, e.g., C n H 2n indicates a moiety of the integer n carbon atoms, inclusive, and the integer 2n hydrogen atoms, inclusive. Thus, for example, C n H 2n wherein n is one to three carbon atoms, inclusive, and two to six hydrogen atoms, inclusive, or methyl, ethyl, propyl and isopropyl, and all isomeric, straight and branched forms thereof. Examples of alkyl of one to nine carbon atoms, inclusive, are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, and nonyl, and all isomeric forms thereof and straight and branched forms thereof. Examples of alkenyl of one to five carbon atoms, inclusive, are ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, pentenyl, all isomeric forms thereof, and straight and branched forms thereof. By halo is meant the typical halogen atoms, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. The compounds of formula I and II of the present invention inhibit retroviral proteinases and thus inhibit the replication of the virus. They are useful for treating patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which results in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and related diseases. More particularly, the compounds of the present invention are useful as novel human retroviral protease inhibitors. Therefore, the compounds inhibit retroviral proteases and thus inhibit the replication of the virus. They are useful for treating human patients infected with a human retrovirus, such as human immunodeficiency virus (strains of HIV-1 or HIV-2) or human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV-I or HTLV-II) which results in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and/or related diseases. The capsid and replicative enzymes (i.e. protease, reverse transcriptase, integrase) of retroviruses are translated from the viral gag and pol genes as polyproteins that are further processed by the viral protease (PR) to the mature proteins found in the viral capsid and necessary for viral functions and replication. If the PR is absent or nonfunctional, the virus cannot replicate. The retroviral PR, such as HIV-1 PR, has been found to be an aspartic protease with active site characteristics similar to those exhibited by the more complex aspartic protease, renin. The term human retrovirus (HRV) includes human immunodeficiency virus type I, human immunodeficiency virus type II, or strains thereof, as well as human T cell leukemia virus 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) or strains apparent to one skilled in the art, which belong to the same or related viral families and which create similar physiological effects in humans as various human retroviruses. Patients to be treated would be those individuals: 1) infected with one or more strains of a human retrovirus as determined by the presence of either measurable viral antibody or antigen in the serum and 2) in the case of HIV, having either an asymptomatic HIV infection or a symptomatic AIDS defining infection such as i) disseminated histoplasmosis, ii) isopsoriasis, iii) bronchial and pulmonary candidiasis including pneumocystic pneumonia iv) non-Hodgkins lymphoma or v) Kaposis sarcoma and being less than sixty years old; or having an absolute CD4 lymphocyte count of less than 500/mm 3 in the peripheral blood. Treatment would consist of maintaining an inhibitory level of the compound used according to this invention in the patient at all times and would continue until the occurrence of a second symptomatic AIDS defining infection indicates alternate therapy is needed. More specifically, an example of one such human retrovirus is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, also known as HTLV-III or LAV) which has been recognized as the causative agent in human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), P. Duesberg, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:755 (1989). HIV contains a retro viral encoded protease, HIV-I protease, that cleaves the fusion polypeptides into the functional proteins of the mature viral particle, E. P. Lillehoj, et al., J. Virology, 62:3053 (1988); C. Debuck, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 84:8903 (1987). This enzyme, HIV-I protease, has been classified as an aspartyl protease and has a demonstrated homology to other aspartyl proteases such as renin, L. H. Pearl, et al., Nature 329:351 (1987); I. Katoh, et al., Nature 329:654 (1987). Inhibition of HIV-I protease blocks the replication of HIV and thus is useful in the treatment of human AIDS, E. D. Clerq, J. Med. Chem. 29:1561 (1986). Inhibitors of HIV-I protease are useful in the treatment of HIV-infected individuals who are asymptomatic or symptomatic of AIDS. Pepstatin A, a general inhibitor of aspartyl proteases, has been disclosed as an inhibitor of HIV-I protease, S. Seelmeier, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:6612 (1986). Other substrate derived inhibitors containing reduced bond isosteres or statine at the scissle position have also been disclosed, M. L. Moore, et al., Biochem. Biophys, Res. Commun. 159:420 (1989); S. Billich, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263:17905 (1988); Sandoz, D. E. 3812-576-A. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are useful for treating diseases caused by retroviruses, such as human acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome (AIDS). The compounds are also useful for treating non-human animals infected with a retrovirus, such as cats infected with feline leukemia virus. Other viruses that infect cats include, for example, feline infectious peritonitis virus, calicivirus, rabies virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline parvovirus (panleukopenia virus), and feline chlamydia. Exact dosages, forms and modes of administration of the compounds of the present invention to non-human animals would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as a veterinarian. The compounds of formula I and II of the present invention are prepared as described in the Charts, Preparations and Examples below, or are prepared by methods analogous thereto, which are readily known and available to one of ordinary skill in the art of organic synthesis. CHART A Nitration of the cyclopropylphenyl ketone of formula A-1, which is commercially available, with fuming nitric acid at 40 C. produces a ca. 2:1 mixture of isomers. The desired m-nitro compound of formula A-2 is easily separated from the crude mixture by recrystallization from methanol. Catalytic hydrogenation of the cyclopropyl-(3-nitrophenyl)methanone of formula A-2 with 10% platinum on carbon in methanol gives the aniline of formula A-3. The aniline is then coupled with benzenesulfonyl chloride using pyridine in methylene chloride to give the sulfonamide derivative of formula A-4. Reduction of the ketone with sodium borohydride in tetrahydrofuran and ethanol then produces the carbinol of formula A-5. The dianion of the cyclooctylpyranone of formula A-6, prepared as described in Chart B, is formed using lithium diisopropyl amide in tetrahydrofuran at 0 C., and then alkylated with iodopropane to give the 10-propyl-cyclooctylpyranone of formula A-7. The cyclooctylpyranone of formula A-7 and the carbinol of the formula A-5 are then coupled using p-toluenesulfonic acid in methylene chloride to give the sulfonamide derivative of formula A-8. CHART B The commercially available amine of the formula B-1 is protected using benzyl chloroformate and sodium bicarbonate in THF/water solution to give the compound of formula B-2. The aldehyde of formula B-2 is then reacted with a Grignard reagent to give the secondary alcohol of formula B-3, wherein, e.g., R 1 is isobutyl. The known cyclooctylpyranone of formula B-4 is prepared by acylation of the trimethylsilyl enol ether of cyclooctanone with malonyl dichloride as described in R. Effenberger, T. Ziegler, K. -H. Schonwalder, T. Kesmarszky, B. Bauer Chem. Ber. 119:3394-3404 (1986). The alcohol of formula B-3 is then used to alkylate the cyclooctylpyranone of formula B-4 in refluxing toluene and p-toluenesulfonic acid to obtain the compound of the formula B-5, wherein, e.g., R. is isobutyl. At this point, the enantiomers of formula B-5 are separated using a chiral HPLC column. The benzyloxy protecting group is then cleaved using 10% Pd/C in cyclohexene to give the amine of formula B-6, wherein, e.g., R 1 is isobutyl, which is reacted with aryl sulfonyl chlorides to give the compounds of the formula B-7, wherein, e.g., R 1 is isobutyl and R 2 is 1-methylimidazole. CHART C 3-Bromobenzyl alcohol of formula C-1, which is commercially available, in tetrahydrofuran is treated with methyllithium, n-butyllithium and cyclpropanecarboxaldehyde in sequence at 78 C. The resulting solution is gradually warmed to room temperature and then heated at reflux affording the alcohol of formula C-2. The resulting alcohol, in dichloromethane, in the presence of molecular sieves, is treated with 4-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,9,10-hexahydrocyclooctabpyran-2-one of formula C-8, prepared as described in Chart B, and p-toluenesulfonic acid. The solution is heated at reflux to afford the alcohol of formula C-3. The benzyl alcohol is treated with carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in dichloromethane at 0 C. to afford compounds of formula C-4 and C-5 as an inseparable mixture after an aqueous brine workup. The mixture is then treated with any thiol (e.g., thiophenol) and an organic base and heated at reflux to afford sulfides of the formula C-6. Finally treatment of the compounds of the formula C-6 with oxone in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran, methanol and water gives sulfones of formula C-7. CHART D This chart describes a generic procedure for the preparation of C-3 branched 5,6-dihydropyrones via aluminum chloride (AlCl 3 ) mediated condensation with 3-nitrobenzaldehyde. Thus, the AlCl 3 catalyzed reaction of the compound of formula D-1, prepared as described below in the Preparations, (e.g., wherein R 1 is phenethyl or propyl; R 2 is phenethyl or propyl) with 3-nitrobenzaldehyde (formula D-2), which is commercially available, provides compounds of formula D-3 (e.g., wherein R 1 is phenethyl or propyl; R 2 is phenethyl or propyl). Subsequent reaction with trialkyl aluminums or Grignard reagents in the presence of cuprous bromide-dimethylsulfide complex (CuBrMe 2 S) provides compounds of formula D-4 (e.g., wherein R 1 is phenethyl or propyl; R 2 is phenethyl or propyl; R 1 is ethyl or cyclopropyl). Transfer hydrogenation with Pd/C and ammonium formate provides compounds of formula D-5 (e.g., wherein R 1 is phenethyl or propyl; R 2 is phenethyl or propyl; R 3 is ethyl or cyclopropyl). Treatment of the compound of formula D-5 with sulfonyl chlorides of formula D-7, wherein R 4 is defined below, and pyridine in methylene chloride (CH 2 Cl 2 ) provides compounds of formula D-6 (e.g., wherein R 1 is phenethyl or propyl; R 2 is phenethyl or propyl; R 3 is ethyl or cyclopropyl; R 4 is 4-cyanophenyl, 4-fluorophenyl, 1-methylimidazol-4-yl, quinolin-8-yl, 2-pyridyl, 4-cyano-2-pyridyl, quinolin-2-yl, 2-hydroxyphenyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 2-quinazoline, 7H-purin-6-yl, 1H-imidazol-2-yl, 1H-benzimidazol-2-yl or thiazol-2-yl). CHART E Treatment of commercially available 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone of formula E-1 with three equivalents of lithium diisopropylamide in tetrahydrofuran and hexamethylphosphoramide is followed by bromomethylcyclopropane to afford the compound of formula E-2. Reaction between the compound of formula E-2 and the compound of formula F-5, prepared as described in Chart F, in benzene with p-toluenesulfonic acid catalyst in the presence of molecular sieves affords the compound of formula E-3. Hydrogenolysis of the compound of formula E-3 in methanol with hydrogen and palladium on charcoal gives the free amine of formula E-4.

Under similar conditions, compounds of general formula E-5 are obtained by reacting amine E-4 with alkyl, aryl and heteroaryl sulfonyl chlorides in the presence of pyridine to give compounds of formula E-5 wherein R is alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl. Also, for example, the enantiomers of the compound of formula E-9 are separated chromatographically by chiral HPLC to give compounds of formula E-10 and E-11. Additional final compounds of the present invention of formula E-6, E-7, E-8, and E-12-E-16 are prepared using similar conditions.

CHART N Nitration of cyclopropylphenyl ketone of formula N-1, which is commercially available, with fuming nitric acid at 40 C. produces a ca. 2:1 mixture of isomers. The desired meta-nitro compound of formula N-2 is easily separated from the crude mixture by recrystallization from methanol. Catalytic hydrogenation of cyclopropyl-(3-nitrophenyl)methanone of formula N-2 with 10% platinum on carbon in methanol at 0 C. provides the aniline of formula N-3. The product is isolated by filtration and concentration. The amino group is then protected using benzyl chloroformate and diisopropylethylamine in methylene chloride to give the ketone of formula N-4. The ketone is then reduced with sodium borohydride in 5:1 THF and ethanol to give the alcohol of formula N-5. The compound of formula N-5 is then used to alkylate 4-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,9,10-hexahydrocyclooctabpyran-2-one, which is prepared as described in R. Effenberger, T. Ziegler, K. -H. Schnzoalder, T. Kesmarsky, B. Bauer, Chem. Ber. 119:3394-3404 (1986), to give the compound of formula N-6.

CHART O Treatment of the amine of formula O-1, prepared as described in Chart N, with sulfonyl chlorides and a base such as pyridine in dichloromethane gives the sulfonamides of formula O-2 wherein R 60 is, for example, 4-nitrophenyl. These sulfonamides are further modified by standard literature procedures as is apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art to give sulfonamides of formula O-3 wherein R 61 is, for example, 4-aminophenyl and other functional groups that are not readily available from readily available sulfonyl chlorides. For example, the nitro group of N-3-cyclopropyl(5,6,7,8,9,10-hexahydro-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-cyclooctabpyran-3-yl)methylphenyl-4-nitro-benzenesulfonamide is reduced by catalytic hydrogenation in ethyl acetate with palladium on carbon to give the amine in 4-amino-N-3-cyclopropyl(5,6,7,8,9,10-hexahydro-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-cyclooctabpyran-3-yl)methylphenyl-benzenesulfonamide. Also, the carboxylic acid of 3-3-cyclopropyl(5,6,7,8,9,10-hexahydro-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-cyclooctabpyran-3-yl)methylphenylaminosulfonyl-benzoic acid is esterified with methanol and catalytic sulfuric acid to give the methyl ester in 3-3-cyclopropyl(5,6,7,8,9,10-hexahydro-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-cyclooctabpyran-3-yl)methylphenylaminolsulfonyl-benzoic acid, methyl ester. Sulfonamides of formula O-3 are also obtained from compounds of formula O-2 by further elaboration of reactive functional groups. For example, the amine of 3-amino-N-3-cyclopropyl(5,6,7,8,9,10-hexahydro-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-cyclooctabpyran-3-yl)methylphenyl-benzenesulfonamide is reacted with benzoyl chloride and a base such as pyridine to give the benzamide in N-3-3-cyclopropyl(5,6,7,8,9,10-hexahydro-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-cyclooctabpyran-3-yl)methylphenylaminosulfonylhenyl-benzamide. Using commonly available sulfonyl chlorides, additional compounds of the present invention of formula II, wherein R 10 and R 20 is the moiety of formula IV, are prepared. The sulfonyl chlorides used to make the compounds of the present invention are readily prepared by methods described in the literature by those skilled in the art, as the following examples illustrate: Reaction of a suitable thiol with KHF 2 in water/methanol with chlorine gas gives the sulfonyl fluoride (D. J. Brown, J. A. Hoskins, Aust. J. Chem. 25:2641 (1972)) which is then converted into the desired sulfonyl chloride (T. Norris, J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1(11):1378 (Eng.) (1978)). Oxidation of a suitable thiol with chlorine in water with ferric chloride (FeCl 3 ) added gives the desired sulfonyl chloride (G. Pala, Ed. Sci. 13:461 (1958); W. J. Close, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 82:1132 (1960)). Reaction of the heteroaromatic compound with fuming sulfuric acid gives a heteroaromatic sulfonic acid followed by treatment with phosphorous-oxychloride (POCl 3 ) and phosphorous chloride (PCl 5 ) gives the desired sulfonyl chloride (V. Georgian, R. J. Harrison, L. L. Skaletzky, J. Org. Chem. 27:4571 (1962)). Reaction of a heteroaromatic compound with manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) and sodium sulfite (Na 2 SO 3 ) in water gives the desired sulfonic acid followed by treatment with POCl 3 and PCl 5 gives the desired sulfonyl chloride (N. A. Androva, Izvest. 455 (1972); J. O. Morley, J. Chem. Comm. 88 (1976)). Treatment of the appropriate heteroaromatic chloride with sodium sulfate and HCl in water gives the desired sulfonic acid followed by treatment with POCl 3 and PCl 5 gives the desired sulfonyl chloride (T. R. Norton, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 68:1330 (1946)). Treatment of the appropriate hydroxy compound with N,N-dimethylthiocarbonyl chloride (M. S. Newman, F. W. Hetzel, Org. Synth. Coll. Vol. IV:824 (1988); M. S. Newman, H. A. Karnes, J. Org. Chem. 31:3980 (1966)) followed by treatment of the resulting thiol, as described above, gives the desired sulfonyl chloride. Treatment of the appropriately protected thio-heteroaromatic compound with chlorine in acetic acid gives the desired sulfonyl chloride (Can. J. Chem. 55:421 (1977)). Using the literature procedures described above, the heteroaromatic sulfonyl chlorides of the present invention are prepared. CHART P The preferred procedure for the preparation of the heteroaryl sulfonamides of formula P-2 is described in Chart P. Sulfonation of the amine of formula P-1, prepared in Chart N, P-1 with various heteroarylsulfonyl chlorides of formula P-3 wherein R is, e.g., 2-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 5-cyanopyridin-2-yl, 2-pyrazinyl, 2-pyrimidinyl, 4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl, 4-methylpyrimidin-2-yl gives the sulfonamides of formula P-2 wherein R is the corresponding substituent. CHART Q Generated by sequential deprotonation with sodium hydride and n-butyl lithium in tetrahydrofuran at 0 C., the dianion of commercially available methyl acetoacetate is reacted with ketone of formula Q-1, prepared as described in Chart S (formula S-4). The resulting intermediate hydroxy-ester is cyclized with dilute aqueous hydroxide followed by aqueous hydrochloric acid to give the compound of formula Q-2. The compound of formula Q-2 is condensed with commercially available 3-nitrobenzaldehyde in tetrahydrofuran using aluminum trichloride as a catalyst followed by reaction of the intermediate benzylidene adduct with triethyl aluminum in the presence of copper bromide-dimethyl sulfide to provide the compound of formula Q-3. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation with Pd/C and ammonium formate in methanol affords the compound of formula Q-4. Treatment of the compound of formula Q-4 with the appropriate sulfonyl chloride and pyridine in dichloromethane provides the desired compound of formula Q-5 (wherein, e.g., R 1 is 5-cyano-2-pyridyl or 1-methylimidazol-4-yl). CHART R Catalytic hydrogenation of commercially available 3-nitropropiophenone of formula R-1 affords the amine of formula R-2.

Finally, treatment of the compound of formula KKK-6 with a sulfonyl chloride of formula D-7 in Chart D, wherein R 4 is, e.g., 5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridinyl, in an organic solvent, such as methylene chloride, in the presence of an organic base, such as pyridine, provides the final compound of formula KKK-7a, wherein, e.g., R 1 and R 2 are phenyl or propyl, respectively. In an analogous manner to that described for the conversion of the compound of formula KKK-4a to the compound of formula KKK-7a, the compound of formula KKK-4b is converted to the final product of formula KKK-7b. In an analogous manner to that described for the conversion of the compound of formula KKK-1 to final products of the formula KKK-7a and KKK-7b, the compounds of formula KKK-14a and KKK-14b, wherein R 1 and R 1 are, e.g., methyl or phenethyl, respectively, are prepared by starting with the compound of formula KKK-8 (same as III-6).

Where R is defined as benzyl in the compound of formula LLL-2, that compound is treated with TiCl 4 in methylene chloride below 0 C. followed by the addition of a tertiary amine, then the addition of 2-methyl-2-methoxy-1,3-dioxolane to yield the compound of formula LLL-3. The compound of formula LLL-3 is treated with a protic acid to afford the compound of formula LLL-4. The compound of formula LLL-4 is treated with TiCl 4 in methylene chloride below 0 C. followed by the addition of an amine base, then addition of either 4-heptanone or 1-phenyl-3-hexanone affords the compound of formula LLL-5 wherein R 1 is, e.g., n-propyl or phenethyl, respectively.

Finally, treatment of the compound of formula LLL-7 with a sulfonyl chloride of formula D-7 in Chart D, wherein R 4 is, e.g., 5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridinyl, in an organic solvent, such as methylene chloride, in the presence of an organic base, such as pyridine, provides the final compound of formula LLL-8, wherein R 1 is, e.g., propyl or phenethyl. The compound of formula LLL-2, where R is phenyl, is treated with TiCl 4 in methanol to yield the compound of formula LLL-9. The compound of formula LLL-9 is treated with a base to effect hydrolysis to give the compound of formula LLL-10. The acid of formula LLL-10 is treated with methyl lithium in an ether solvent to yield the compound of formula LLL-11. The ketone of formula LLL-11 is treated with TiCl 4 in methylene chloride below 0 C. followed by the addition of an amine base, then addition of either 4-heptanone or 1-phenyl-3-hexanone, to give the compound of formula LLL-12 wherein R 1 is, e.g., n-propyl or phenethyl, respectively. The compound of formula LLL-12 is treated with TiCl 4 in methylene chloride below 0 C. followed by the addition of an amine base, then the addition of trimethyl orthoformate to yield the compound of formula LLL-13. The compound of formula LLL-13, in an organic solvent such as THFor methylene chloride, is treated with a base followed by the addition of trimethylsilyl chloride. The solvent is removed from the aforementioned reaction and the resulting protected tertiary alcohol is oxidized (e.g. Ru cat./t-BuOH (see Murahashi et. al. Chemistry Letters 2237, 1992); tritylperchlorate/methylene chloride (see Mukaiyama et. al. Chemistry Letters 1255, 1985), ozone/methylene chloride (see Can. J. Chem. 49, 2465, 1971)) to afford the lactone LLL-6 directly or in a two step sequence where the intermediate ester is lactonized with the aid of either sodium hydride, potassium tert. butoxide or n-Bu 4 NF in an ether solvent. The conversion of the compound of formula LLL-6 to the final product is described above. Following the same strategy the compound of formula LLL-16 is converted to the final products of formula LLL-23 wherein R 1 is propyl or phenethyl. CHART MMM The diastereomers of formulae MMM-5 and MMM-7 are also prepared by separation of a diastereomeric mixture of these two compounds. Alternatively, the diastereomeric mixture of formula MMM-1 (X-11 where R 1 is, e.g., phenethyl) prepared as described in Chart X, is separated into the single diastereomers of formulae MMM-2 and MMM-3 using a preparative chiral HPLC column. The benzyl protecting group groups of compounds MMM-2 (less polar diastereomer) and MMM-3 (more polar diastereomer) are then removed by catalytic hydrogenation using 10% palladium on carbon in ethyl acetate to form the amines of fromulae MMM-4 and MMM-6, respectively. The amine intermediates are then converted to the desired sulfonamide derivatives of formulae MMM-5 and MMM-7, respectively, by treatment with 5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridinylsulfonyl chloride, prepared using the methods described in Chart O, and pryidine in methylene chloride. CHART NNN The commercially available (1R, 2S)-()ephedrine of formula NNN-2 is treated with triethylamine and the acid chloride of formula NNN-1 (W-2), prepared as described in Chart W, to afford the amide of formula NNN-3. A t-butyl methyl ether solution of this amide at 0 C. is treated sequentially with 1.1 equivalents of propyl magnesium chloride and 2.0 equivalents of 3-bis(trimethylsilyl)aminophenyl magnesium chloride, stirred for 3 hours at 0 C., washed with ammonium chloride solution and concentrated in vacuo. The residue is then stirred with silica gel in chloroform to afford the compound of formula NNN-4. Alternatively, the above reaction mixture may be washed with 1 N hydrochloric acid solution during the workup instead of ammonium chloride solution to generate the compound of formula NNN-4. The amine is then converted to the derivative of formula NNN-5 by heating a mixture of the compound of formula NNN-4, 2.2 equivalents of benzyl bromide and 2.2 equivalents of sodium carbonate in acetonitrile. The intermediate of formula NNN-5 is then treated with 2 equivalents of lithium diisopropylamide in tetrahydrofuran to form the lithium enolate, which is trapped with acetyl chloride to afford the -ketoamide of formula NNN-6. A solution of this amide in methylene chloride at low temperature may be treated with 1 equivalent of titanium tetrachloride and 1 equivalent of diisopropylethylamine, followed by 4-heptanone to generate the compound of formula NNN-7. Conversion of the amide of formula NNN-7 to the dihydropyrone of formula NNN-8 may be accomplished with either sodium hydride in tetrahydrofuran or with aqueous acid. The benzyl protecting groups may then be removed by catalytic hydrogenation using 10% palladium on carbon in ethyl acetate. The resulting amine of formula NNN-9 is converted to the desired sulfonamide derivative of formula NNN-10 (W-12) by treatment with 5-trifluoromethylpyridine-2-sulfonyl chloride, prepared using the methods described in Chart O, and pyridine in dichloromethane. CHART OOO The compound of formula OOO-7 (NNN-8) may also be generated as described in Chart OOO. The amide of formula OOO-1 (NNN-5) is treated with aqueous acid to afford the compound of formula OOO-2. The methyl ester of formula OOO-3 is formed from the compound of formula OOO-2 using catalytic acid in methanol. Treatment of the methyl ester of formula OOO-3 with lithium diisopropylamide, followed by trimethylsilyl chloride gives the compound of formula OOO-4. Treatment of this intermediate with either 2-methoxy-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane followed by hydrolysis or treatment with acetyl chloride affords the -keto ester of formula OOO-5. This -keto ester is converted to the compound of formula OOO-6 by treatment of either the titanium enolate (formed using 1 equivalent of titanium tetrachloride and 1 equivalent of diisopropylethylamine in methylene chloride at low temperature) or the lithium dianion (formed using 2 equivalents of lithium diisopropylamide in tetrahydrofuran at low temperature) with 4-heptanone. The dihydropyrone of formula OOO-7 (NNN-8) is formed by treatment of the compound of formula OOO-6 with either sodium hydride in tetrahydrofuran or aqueous base. CHART PPP Reduction of the commercially available ethyl 4,4,4-trifluorobutyrate of formula PPP-1, with DiBAL-H followed by in situ alkylation with 2-phenethyl magnesium bromide or chloride produces the alcohol of formula PPP-2. Swern oxidation of the alcohol gives the ketone of formula PPP-3. The ketone is converted to the dihydropyrone of formula PPP-4 by alkylation with the dianion of methyl acetoacetate followed by saponification to the acid and lactonization with base. CHART QQQ The aluminum trichloride catalyzed reaction of the dihydropyrone of formula QQQ-1 (PPP-4), prepared as described in Chart PPP, with the CBZ-protected 3-aminobenzaldehyde (which is available from the reaction of benzyl chloroformate with commercially available 3-aminobenzaldehyde) of formula QQQ-2 and subsequent reaction with trialkyl aluminums or Grignard reagents in the presence of cuprous bromide-dimethylsulfide complexes provides compounds of formula QQQ-3. The individual stereoisomers are separated by HPLC using a chiral stationary phase to give the four possible stereoisomers of formula QQQ-4, QQQ-5, QQQ-6, and QQQ-7. Transfer hydrogenation of each stereoisomer with Pd/C and ammonium formate gives the amines of formula QQQ-8, QQQ-9, QQQ-10, and QQQ-11. Treatment of the amines with sulfonyl chlorides of general formula QQQ-12 and pyridine in methylene chloride provides compounds of general formula QQQ-13, QQQ-14, QQQ-15, and QQQ-16, wherein R 2 is, e.g., 5-cyano-2-pyridinyl, 1-methyl-4-imidazolyl, or 5-amino-2-pyridinyl.

CHART UUU Reaction between commercially available thiourea in hot ethanol with commercially available 2-chloro-5-nitropyridine of formula UUU-1 affords the isothiourea compound of formula UUU-2. Treatment of the compound of formula UUU-2 with aqueous sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide provides the thiol compound of formula UUU-3. Oxidation of the compound of formula UUU-3 with chlorine gas provides the sulfonyl chloride compound of formula UUU-4. Treatment of the compound of formula D-5 (e.g., the compound of formula T-4 wherein R 1 is 2-phenylethyl, R 2 is propyl, R 1 is tert-butyl) in dichloromethane with two equivalents of pyridine followed by one equivalent of the compound of formula UUU-4 gives the sulfonamide compound of formula UUU-5 (wherein R 1 is 2-phenylethyl, R 2 is propyl, R 3 is tert-butyl). Reduction of the compound of formula UUU-5 with palladium on carbon and ammonium formate affords the compound of formula UUU-6, which is the compound: 5-amino-N-3-(1-5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-6-(2-phenylethyl)-6-propyl-2H-pyran-3-yl-2,2-dimethylpropyl)phenyl-2-pyridinesulfonamide (Formula UUU-6: R 1 is 2-phenylethyl, R 2 is propyl, R 3 is tert-butyl). CHART VVV The compound of Formula VVV-1, which is 2-mercapto-5-carbamoylpyridine, is prepared via published procedure (J. Chem. Soc. 1948, 1939-1945). Treatment of a suspension of this compound in dilute hydrochloric acid with chlorine gas at 0 provides the sulfonyl chloride of Formula VVV-2. CHART WWW Amines of the generic formula WWW-1 are reacted with benzyl chloroformate to provide CBZ derivatives WWW-2. The individual stereoisomers of formula WWW-2 are generally separated by chiral HPLC methods, and then converted back to the free amines WWW-3 via hydrogenolysis. Sulfonation of the amines in the usual manner known to one of ordinary skill in the art provides the final compounds of formula WWW-4, in stereochemically pure form. CHART XXX Dihydropyrone XXX-1, which is prepared by procedures analogous to those in described in Preparations 17 and 84, is condensed with meta-nitrobenzaldehyde in the presence of aluminum trichloride to provide the benzylidene intermediate XXX-2. Conjugate reduction of the double bond using sodium cyanoborohydride, followed by reduction of the nitro group via catalytic hydrogenation, affords amine of formula XXX-4, which is converted to the sulfonamides XXX-5 by treatment with the appropriate sulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane and pyridine. CHART YYY Dihydropyrones of Formula YYY-1, wherein R 1 and R 2 are propyl or phenethyl, and which are synthesized as described in Preparation 84, are condensed with the aldehyde of Formula B-2 using aluminum trichloride to provide the benzylidene intermediates of formula YYY-2. Conjugate addition of tert-butylmagnesium chloride in the presence of copper (I) bromide-dimethyl sulfide provides compounds of Formula YYY-3. Hydrogenolytic deprotection affords amines of formula YYY-4, which are converted to the sulfonamides of formula YYY-5 using the appropriate sulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane with added pyridine. The procedures used are analogous to those described for Chart D. CHART ZZZ Polymeric meta-aminobenzaldehyde is protected by treating with benzyl bromide and potassium carbonate in acetonitrile at reflux to yield the compound of formula ZZZ-2. A vinyl anion is generated from 2-bromovinyltrimethylsilane of formula ZZZ-3 by treatment with t-butyl lithium at 78 C. to 20 C. The vinyl anion so generated is cooled to 78 C. and the diprotected meta-aminobenzaldehyde of formula ZZZ-2 is added to afford the desired allylic alcohol of formula ZZZ-3. The alcohol is easily converted to the acetate or carbonate of formula ZZZ-5 by standard means (e.g., CH 3 COCl, pyridine, CH 2 Cl 2 , 0 C.). These substrates participate in palladium catalyzed allylic substitutions as delineated in Charts AAAA-CCCC (C. G. Frost; J. Howarth; J. M. J. Williams, Tetrahedron: Asymmetry (1992) 3:1089-1122). CHART AAAA The sodium salt of methyl acetoacetate of formula AAAA-1 generated by treating methyl acetoacetate with sodium hydride at 0 C. in either DMF or THF acts as the nucleophile in a palladium catalyzed allylic substitution. If this reaction is run in the presence of palladium allyl chloride dimer of formula AAAA-3 as the palladium source and a chiral phosphine ligand (P. von Matt; A. Pfaltz, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. (1993) 32:566-568), a kinetic resolution of the starting allylic acetate or carbonate results in the synthesis of optically enriched allylated product of formula AAAA-4. If the reaction with nucleophile is slow, the acetate generated from formation of the pi-allyl palladium intermediate isomerizes the two possible diastereomeric pi-allyl complexes so that a stereoselective synthesis of the allylated product occurs (B. M. Trost; P. E. J. Strege, Am. Chem. Soc. (1977) 99:1649). Treatment of the resulting vinyl silane of formula AAAA-4 with para-toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile at reflux affords the desilylated olefin of formula AAAA-5. The dihydropyrone product of formula AAAA-7 is formed by generating the dianion of the ketoester under standard conditions (J. R. Peterson; T. J. Winger; C. P. Miller, Syn. Comm. (1988) 18(9):949-963), (NaH, n-butyllithium, THF) and quenching with an appropriate symmetrical ketone of formula AAAA-6 (such as 4-heptanone). Hydrolysis of the ester (0.1 N NaOH/THF) and acidic work-up provide the dihydropyrone product of formula AAAA-7. Standard hydrogenation conditions reduce the olefin and deprotect the amine. Subsequent treatment of the amino compound with the appropriate sulfonyl chloride of formula AAAA-8 (pyridine, CH 2 Cl 2 ) provides the desired sulfonamide protease inhibitor of formula AAAA-9. CHART BBBB Alternatively, the palladium catalyzed allylic substitution may be performed with the sodium anion of the requisite dihydropyrone J. R. (Peterson; T. J. Winger; C. P. Miller, Syn. Comm. (1988) 18(9):949-963) of formula BBBB-1 (dihydropyrone, NaH, THF or DMF, 0 C.) as the nucleophilic partner. Once again, if palladium allyl chloride dimer of formula BBBB-3 and a chiral phosphine ligand (P. von Matt; A. Pfaltz, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. (1993) 32:566-568) are employed as catalyst, a kinetic resolution results in the synthesis of optically pure allylated dihydropyrone of formula BBBB-4; and a stereoselective synthesis of the allylated product will occur if the reaction with nucleophile is slow relative to isomerization of the two possible diastereomeric pi-allyl complexes by acetate generated from formation of the pi-allyl palladium intermediate. Subsequent, desilylation (p-TsOH, CH 3 CN), olefin reduction and amine deprotection (H 2/ Pd/C), and sulfonylation of the amine (ArSO 2 Cl, pyridine, CH 2 Cl 2 ) with a compound of the formula BBBB-5 provides the desired dihydropyrone protease inhibitor of formula BBBB-6. CHART CCCC Treatment of m-bis(benzyl)aminobenzoic acid of formula CCCC-1 with oxalyl chloride to form the acid chloride and reaction with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene and AlCl 3 in methylene chloride affords the propargylic ketone of formula CCCC-2. Asymetric reduction of the ketone with a chiral borane (H. C. Brown; Beeraraghavan Ramachandran, P. Acc. Chem. Res. (1992) 25:16-24) such as DIP chloride () or ()--chlorodiisopinocampheylborane and acetylene reduction with REDAL provides the allylic alcohol of formula CCCC-3, primarily as a single enantiomer. Formation of the carbonate of formula CCCC-4 (methyl chloroformate, pyridine, CH 2 Cl 2 , 0 C.) and subjection to palladium catalyzed allylic substitution with the desired dihydropyrone of formula CCCC-5 as nucleophile affords primarily one enantiomer of the allylated dihydropyrone of formula CCCC-6 (retention of configuration) (T. Hayashi; T. Hagihara; M. Konishi; M. J. Kumada, Am. Chem. Soc. (1983) 105:7768-7770). This product is transformed into the desired protease inhibitor of formula CCCC-7 as previously described in Chart BBBB. CHART DDDD The known cycloalkylpyranones of formula DDDD-1 are prepared by acylation of the trimethylsilyl enol ether of the corresponding cycloalkyl ketone with malonyl dichloride as described in R. Effenberger, T. Ziegler, K. -H. Schonwalder, T. Kesmarszky, B. Bauer Chem. Ber. 119: 3394-3404 (1986). Catalytic hydrogenation of the cycloalkylpyranones of formula DDDD-1 with platinum oxide (PtO 2 ) in acetic acid produces the cycloalkyldihydropyrones of Formula DDDD-2. The intermediate of formula DDDD-3 is then formed by aluminum chloride (AlCl 3 ) catalyzed condensation of the compound of formula DDDD-2 with 3-nitrobenzaldehyde, which is commercially available. Subsequent reaction of the intermediate of formula DDDD-3 with trialkyl aluminums in the presence of copper bromide-dimethyl sulfide complex (CuBrMe 2 S) or zinc reagents generated from zinc metal, alkyl halide, cuprous cyanide (CuCN) and lithium chloride (LiCl) provides compounds of formula DDDD-4 which contain a C-3a branched substituent. Catalytic hydrogenation of compounds of the formula DDDD-4 with Pd/C in ethanol (EtOH) provides the amine derivatives of the formula DDDD-5. Treatment of the compounds of formula DDDD-5 with sulfonyl chlorides of formula DDDD-6 and pyridine in methylene chloride (CH 2 Cl 2 ) provides compounds of the formula DDDD-7 (e.g., wherein n is 1, 2, or 3; R 1 is ethyl or t-butyl; R 2 is 4-cyanophenyl or 5-cyano-2-pyridyl). Procedures by which the compounds of the present invention are prepared are also described in International application, PCT/US93/10645, filed Nov. 9, 1993 (WO 94/11361, published May 26, 1994), and International application, PCT/US94/00938, filed Feb. 3, 1994 (WO 94/18188, published Aug. 18, 1994), both of which are incorporated by reference herein. As is apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, the compounds of the present invention can occur in several diastereomeric forms, depending on the configuration around the asymmetric carbon atoms. All such diastereomeric forms are included within the scope of the present invention. Also, the dihydropyrones of the present invention can be separated into individual stereoisomers or prepared as individual diastereomers. A diastereomeric pair can be prepared wherein C-3 is a homogeneous center and C-6 is a mixture. All such enantiomeric and diastereomeric forms, and mixtures thereof, are included within the scope of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention of formula I can exist in several tautomeric forms, including the particular enol forms as depicted by formula I and IA and the keto form of formula IB. (For formulas I, IA and IB, the dashed line indicates that a double bond may be present or absent.) All such tautomeric forms are included within the scope of the present invention. For compounds of the present invention which are 4-hydroxy-pyran-2-ones of formula VII, the enol form predominates. For compounds of the present invention which are 5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-pyran-2-ones of formula VI, a mixture of the enol and keto forms is commonly expected. Also, the compounds of the present invention of formula II can exist in several tautomeric forms of the 4-hydroxy-pyrone ring, including the particular enol forms depicted by formulas II and IIA, and the particular keto form depicted by formula IIB, and mixtures thereof. All such tautomeric forms are included within the scope of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention may be in either free form or in protected form at one or more of the remaining (not previously protected) carboxyl, amino, hydroxy, or other reactive groups. The protecting groups may be any of those known in the art. Examples of nitrogen and oxygen protecting groups are set forth in T. W. Greene, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley, New York, (1981); J. F. W. McOmie, ed. Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Plenum Press (1973); and J. Fuhrhop and G. Benzlin, Organic Synthesis, Verlag Chemie (1983). Included among the nitrogen protective groups are t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl, acetyl, allyl, phthalyl, benzyl, benzoyl, trityl and the like. The present invention provides for compounds of formula I and II or pharmacologically acceptable salts and/or hydrates thereof. Pharmacologically acceptable salts refers to those salts which would be readily apparent to a manufacturing pharmaceutical chemist to be equivalent to the parent compound in properties such as formulation, stability, patient acceptance and bioavailability. Examples of salts of the compounds of formula I include acidic salts, such as sodium, potassium, lysine, arginine and calcium salts, and basic salts, such as the hydrochloride salt, wherein the R substituents in formula I contain a basic moiety. Examples of salts of the compounds of formula II include the hydrohalide salts, such as the hydrochloride and hydroiodide salts; and the sodium, potassium, calcium, lysine and arginine salts. Also included as salts of the compounds of formulae I and II of the present invention are the bis-salts, such as the bis-arginine, bis-lysine, bis-sodium, bis-potassium and bis-calcium salts, provided that the compound contains, for example, NHSO 2 , SO 3 H, CONH, OH or COOH. The bis-sodium salt is most preferred. The compounds of the present invention are useful for treating patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which results in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and related diseases. For this indication, these compounds may be administered by oral, intranasal, transdermal, subcutaneous and parenteral (including intramuscular and intravenous) routes in doses of 0.1 mg to 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. Those skilled in the art would know how to formulate the compounds of this invention into appropriate pharmaceutical dosage forms. Examples of the dosage forms include oral formulations, such as tablets or capsules, or parenteral formulations, such as sterile solutions. When the compounds in this invention are administered orally, an effective amount is from about 0.1 mg to 100 mg per kg of body weight per day. Either solid or fluid dosage forms can be prepared for oral administration. Solid compositions, such as compressed tablets, are prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with conventional ingredients such as talc, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, magnesium aluminum silicate, calcium sulfate, starch, lactose, acacia, methyl cellulose, or functionally similar pharmaceutical diluents and carriers. Capsules are prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with an inert pharmaceutical diluent and placing the mixture into an appropriately sized hard gelatin capsule. Soft gelatin capsules are prepared by machine encapsulation of a slurry or solution of the compounds of this invention with an acceptable inert oil such as vegetable oil or light liquid petrolatum. Pharmaceutically acceptable formulations of the disodium salts of the compounds of the present invention include: soft elastic capsules (SEC) containing a suspension of the salt; salt tablets; salt spray coated sucrose beads; or salt spray dried matrix with an enteric or non-enteric polymer. Formulations of the compounds of the present invention, which present the compounds in free acid form, preferably contain the free acid in non-crystalline form. Examples of such formulations include: soft elastic capsules containing free acid solution; non-crystalline spray dried matrix of the free acid with an enteric or non-enteric polymer; or a solid non-crystalline matrix of free acid in polyethyleneglycol (PEG) or Gelucire 44/14 (Gattefosse, Saint Priest, France). Syrups are prepared by dissolving the compounds of this invention in an aqueous vehicle and adding sugar, aromatic flavoring agents and preservatives. Elixirs are prepared using a hydroalcoholic vehicle such as ethanol, suitable sweeteners such as sugar or saccharin and an aromatic flavoring agent. Suspensions are prepared with an aqueous vehicle and a suspending agent such as acacia, tragacanth, or methyl cellulose. When the compounds of this invention are administered parenterally, they can be given by injection or by intravenous infusion. An effective amount is from about 0.1 mg to 100 mg per kg of body weight per day. Parenteral solutions are prepared by dissolving the compounds of this invention in liquid vehicle and filter sterilizing the solution before placing in a suitable sealable vial or ampule. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same way except a sterile suspension vehicle is used and the compounds of this invention are sterilized with ethylene oxide or suitable gas before it is suspended in the vehicle. The exact route of administration, dose, or frequency of administration would be readily determined by those skilled in the art and is dependant on the age, weight, general physical condition, or other clinical symptoms specific to the patient to be treated. Patients to be treated would be those individuals: 1) infected with one or more than one strain of a human immunodeficiency virus as determined by the presence of either measurable viral antibody or antigen in the serum and 2) having either an asymptomatic HIV infection or a symptomatic AIDS defining infection such as i) disseminated histoplasmosis, ii) isoporiasis, iii) bronchial and pulmonary candidiasis including pneumocystis pneumonia, iv) non-Hodgkins lymphoma, or v) Kaposis sarcoma and being less than sixty years old; or having an absolute CD4lymphocyte count of less than 500/mm 3 in the peripheral blood. Treatment would consist of maintaining an inhibitory level of the compounds of this invention in the patient at all times and would continue until the occurrence of a second symptomatic AIDS defining infection indicates alternate therapy is needed. The utility of representative compounds of the present invention has been demonstrated in the biological tests described below: The HIV protease screening assay is based on fluorescently labeled substrate which can be resolved from nonlabeled cleavage product using special beads coated with streptavidin. The substrate is biotinylated at the amino terminal arginine and fluorescently labeled with fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC) at the carboxyl terminal lysine. This assay has been employed to detect novel, nonpeptidic inhibitors of HIV-1 protease. Substrate (20 M of 0.2 M), sample (10 l of desired concentraion), and enzyme (10 l of 0.1 M) are added to a 96 well pandex plate. The assay is run in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.5 in the presence of 1.0 M sodium chloride and 0.05% NP-40 with incubated in the dark for one hour at room temperature. Strepavidin coated polystyrene beads 40 l of 0.1% (w/v) are added and the plate is incubated in the dark for an additional half hour. The labeled cleavage product is separated from the unreacted substrate via filtration and is read on the Idexx screen machine. The data are analyzed by appropriate computer algorithms to ascertain percent inhibition values. Determination of K i values utilizes the same materials and equipment employed for percent inhibition studies. Two-fold serial dilutions are made for a given inhibitor from 2, 3 or 4 starting concentrations with a total of 24, 36 or 48 individual inhibitor concentrations. These dilutions are performed utilizing the BioMek robotics system. The assay consists of 10 L of 40 nM HIV-1 protease, 10 L of the various inhibitor concentrations, and 20 L of 200 M substrate (40 L total). The reaction is allowed to proceed for 90 min at room temperature, terminated with 40 L of avidin beads and processed (supra vide). An inhibitor with a known K; is run in parallel to verify the validity of the assay. The data is processed utilizing a computer program employing a nonlinear least square analysis of the data to generate the K i values. The % inhibition values and/or K i values of representative compounds of the present invention tested in the HIV protease screening assay are listed in Table I below. In the enzyme inhibition assay described above, the sensitivity of K i value determination is in part limited by the ability to continue to lower the enzyme concentration for compounds with high binding affinity. To prevent de-dimerization at low enzyme concentration, a tandemly linked enzyme is prepared in which the two monomers are covalently linked by an appropriate stretch of amino acid residues. Using the latter enzyme, the sensitivity of the inhibition assay is improved since much lower enzyme concentration can be utilized, as compared to the condition using the wild-type enzyme. Protocol for K. value determination with tandem HIV protease: Due to the greater stability (no dedimerization) of the single chain tethered (tandem) HIV protease enzyme, in which the two monomeric units are engineered to be linked by a polypeptide stretch, the method for the determination of K i values for inhibitors uses very low concentrations of enzyme (0.2 nM) and increased incubation times (96 hours) at room temperature to improve the sensitivity in the measurement of K i values for very potent inhibitors. The starting inhibitor concentrations are determined based on preliminary enzyme inhibition screening results which estimate the expected potency of the inhibitor. Inhibitor concentrations are then prepared using the Biomek 1000 (Beckman) and the Quadra 96 (Tomtec). Substrate (biotinylated at the amino terminal arginine and fluorescently labeled with fluorescein at the carboxyl terminal lysine), inhibitor and the tandem enzyme are allowed to react in solution at pH 5.5 (buffers identical to those used with the native dimeric enzyme) in the dark for 96 hours. Streptavidin coated polystyrene beads are added to stop the reaction. The labeled cleavage product is separated from unreacted substrate via filtration. Residual fluorescence is quantitated with the Idexx SM2000 (Idexx) and the resulting data are analyzed using the NLLSF program. The % inhibition values and/or K i values of representative compounds of the present invention tested in the HIV protease screening assay and/or tandem HIV protease assay are listed in Table II below.

preparation of substituted cyanophenyl uracils from substituted aminoalkene acid cyanophenyl amides", "abstract": "The invention relates to a novel process for preparing substituted cyanophenyluracils of the general formula (I) in which R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are each as defined in the description, said compounds being known as herbicidally active compounds, to novel substituted N-(cyanophenyl)aminoalkenamides as intermediates therefor and to an inventive process for their preparation. The invention relates to a novel process for preparing substituted cyanophenyluracils, said compounds being known as herbicidally active compounds, to novel substituted N-(cyanophenyl)aminoalkenamides as intermediates therefor and to an inventive process for their preparation. It is known that certain substituted cyanophenyluracils can be prepared by reaction of appropriate aminoalkenoic esters with appropriate cyanophenyl isocyanates or with cyanophenylurethanes in the presence of reaction auxiliaries, such as, for example, sodium hydride (cf. EP 648749). However, with this procedure, yield and quality of the resulting products are not always entirely satisfactory, and the reaction components required are not very suitable for industrial purposes. Furthermore, it is known that certain substituted phenyluracils can be prepared by reaction of appropriate substituted N-(phenyl)aminoalkenamides with suitable carbonic acid derivatives (cf. WO 95/32952). However, the synthetic group described in this publication includes many steps and is complicated. The present invention, accordingly, provides (a) a process for preparing substituted cyanophenyluracils of the general formula (I) in which R 1 represents optionally substituted alkyl, R 2 represents hydrogen, halogen or alkyl, R 3 represents hydrogen or halogen and R 4 represents amino, halogen or the grouping N(R 5 )SO 2 R 6 , in which R 5 represents hydrogen or represents respectively optionally substituted alkyl, alkylcarbonyl, alkylsulphonyl, cycloalkylcarbonyl, cycloalkylsulphonyl, arylcarbonyl or arylsulphonyl and R 6 represents respectively optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl, characterized in that substituted N-(cyanophenyl)aminoalkenamides of the general formula (II) in which R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are each as defined above, are reacted with carbonic acid derivatives of the general formula (III) Z 1 COZ 2 (III), in which Z 1 and Z 2 are identical or different and each represents halogen, alkoxy, aryloxy, imidazolyl or triazolyl, if appropriate in the presence of a reaction auxiliary and if appropriate in the presence of a diluent at temperatures between 20 C. and 150 C., (b) novel substituted N-(cyanophenyl)aminoalkenamides of the general formula (II) in which, R 1 represents optionally substituted alkyl, R 2 represents hydrogen, halogen or alkyl, R 3 represents hydrogen or halogen and R 4 represents amino, halogen or the grouping N(R 5 )SO 2 R 6 , in which R 5 represents hydrogen or represents respectively optionally substituted alkyl, alkylcarbonyl, alkylsulphonyl, cycloalkylcarbonyl, cycloalkylsulphonyl, arylcarbonyl or arylsulphonyl and R 6 represents respectively optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl, and (c) a process for preparing substituted N-(cyanophenyl)aminoalkenamides of the general formula (II), characterized in that cyanophenylpyrimidinones of the general formula (IV) in which R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are each as defined above are reacted with basic compounds in the presence of a diluent at temperatures between 20 C. and 100 C. The present invention also provides a novel preparative route to substituted cyanophenyluracils of the general formula (I), which combines the steps described above in a general manner under (c) and (a). It is surprising that this novel route gives substituted cyanophenyluracils of the general formula (I) in a much more simple way and also in higher yields and improved quality. Especially the smooth ring-opening reaction of cyanophenylpyrimidinones of the formula (IV) to give substituted N-(cyanophenyl)aminoalkenamides of the formula (II) constitutes a very surprising new way of preparing substituted N-(aryl)--aminoalkenamides. The invention preferably relates to the preparation of compounds of the formula (I) and also of novel compounds of the formula (II), in which in each case R 1 represents optionally fluorine- and/or chlorine-substituted alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R 2 represents hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine or alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R 3 represents hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine or bromine and R 4 represents amino, fluorine, chlorine or the grouping N(R 5 )SO 2 R 6 in which R 5 represents hydrogen or represents respectively optionally fluorine- and/or chlorine-substituted alkyl, alkylcarbonyl or alkylsulphonyl having in each case 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl groups, represents respectively optionally fluorine- and/or chlorine-substituted cycloalkylcarbonyl or cycloalkylsulphonyl having in each case 3 to 6 carbon atoms in the cycloalkyl groups, or represents respectively optionally fluorine- and/or chlorine-substituted phenylcarbonyl or phenylsulphonyl, and R 6 represents optionally fluorine- and/or chlorine-substituted alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, represents optionally fluorine- and/or chlorine-substituted cycloalkyl having 3 to 6 carbon atoms, or represents respectively optionally fluorine- and/or chlorine-substituted phenyl. The invention relates in particular to the preparation of compounds of the formula (I) and to novel compounds of the formula (II) in which in each case R 1 represents respectively optionally fluorine- and/or chlorine-substituted methyl or ethyl, R 2 represents hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, methyl or ethyl, R 3 represents hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine and R 4 represents fluorine, chlorine or the grouping N(R 5 )SO 2 R 6 in which, R 5 represents hydrogen or represents respectively optionally fluorine- and/or chlorine-substituted methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl, acetyl, propionyl, methyl-sulphonyl or ethylsulphonyl, represents respectively optionally fluorine- and/or chlorine-substituted cyclopropylcarbonyl, cyclobutylcarbonyl, cyclopentyl carbonyl, cyclohexylcarbonyl, cyclopropyl sulphonyl, cyclobutylsulphonyl, cyclopentylsulphonyl or cyclohexylsulphonyl, or represents respectively optionally fluorine- and/or chlorine-substituted phenylcarbonyl or phenylsulphonyl, and R 6 represents respectively optionally fluorine- and/or chlorine-substituted methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl, n-, i-, s- or t-butyl, represents respectively optionally fluorine- and/or chlorine-substituted cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl, or represents respectively optionally fluorine- and/or chlorine-substituted phenyl. If, for example, in the process step described above under (c) (process (c)) 3-(4-cyano-2,5-difluorophenyl)-6-trifluoromethylpyrimidin-4-one is used as starting material, and the resulting product is reacted according to the process step described above under (a) (process (a)) with, for example, phosgene, then the reaction may be outlined by the following scheme: The carbonic acid derivatives to be used as starting materials in the process (a) according to the invention for preparing compounds of the formula (I) are defined in a general way by formula (III). In Formula (III), Z 1 and Z 2 are identical or different and preferably represent fluorine, chlorine, bromine, C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy, phenoxy, imidazolyl or triazolyl, in particular chlorine, methoxy, ethoxy or phenoxy. Examples of starting materials of the formula (III) are: Phosgene (and also its dimers or trimersdiphosgene or triphosgene), dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, diphenyl carbonate, methyl chloroformate, ethyl chloroformate and also carbonyl-bis-imidazole. The starting materials of the formula (III) are known chemicals for synthesis. The cyanophenylpyrimidinones to be used as starting materials in process (c) according to the invention for preparing compounds of the formula (II) are defined in a general way by the formula (IV). In the formula (IV), R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 preferably or in particular have those meanings which have already been mentioned above, in connection with the description of the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention, as being preferred or particularly preferred for R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 . The starting materials of the formula (IV) are known and/or can be prepared by known processes (cf. DE 4431218, Preparation Examples). The process (c) according to the invention is carried out using a basic compound. Suitable basic compounds include all customary inorganic or organic bases. These include, for example, alkaline earth metal or alkali metal hydrides, hydroxides, amides, alkoxides, acetates, carbonates or bicarbonates, such as, for example, lithium hydride, sodium hydride potassium hydride or calcium hydride, sodium amide or potassium amide, sodium methoxide or potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide or potassium ethoxide, sodium n- or i-propoxide or potassium n- or i-propoxide, sodium t-butoxide or potassium t-butoxide, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, sodium acetate or potassium acetate, ammonium acetate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, magnesium carbonate or calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate or potassium bicarbonate, ammonium carbonate and tertiary amines, such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, tributylamine, N,N-dimethylaniline, pyridine, N-methylpiperidine, N,N-dimethylaminopyridine, diazabicyclooctane (DABCO), diazabicyclononene (DBN) or diazabicycloundecene (DBU).

In the practice of the process (c) according to the invention, generally 0.9 to 1.5 mol, preferably 0.95 to 1.2 mol of a basic compound are employed per mole of cyanophenylpyrimidinone of the formula (IV). In general, the reactants are mixed at room temperatureor if necessary with slight coolingand the reaction mixture is stirred at the particular temperature required until the reaction has ended.

No. 08/893,152 (CPA), filed on Jul. 15, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,925,765. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The invention relates to a process for preparing pyridinecarboxylic esters by reacting halogenated pyridines with carbon monoxide and a C 1-4 -alkanol in the presence of a weak base and a catalyst. The invention further relates to a novel halopyridine as starting material for the preparation according to the invention of a novel pyridinecarboxylic ester. The pyridinecarboxylic esters preparable by the invention process have the general formula: wherein R 1 is hydrogen, a C 1-6 -alkyl group, a C 1-4 -alkoxycarbonyl group, a C 1-4 -alkoxymethyl group or a fluorinated C 1-6 -alkyl group, R 2 is a C 1-4 -alkyl group and X is chlorine or bromine. 2. Background Art Pyridinecarboxylic esters are important intermediates, for example, for preparing herbicides (European Published Patent Application No. 0488474) and for preparing drugs against fibrotic diseases (European Published Patent Application No. 0673932). Processes for preparing pyridinecarboxylic esters by carbonylation reactions starting from mono- and dihalopyridines are known from the literature European Published Patent Application No. 0282266; International Published Patent Application No. WO 93/18005; U.S. Pat. No. 4,128,554; and Shokubai , (Catalysis Society of Japan), 36, (1994), 580. A disadvantage of these processes is that the pyridinecarboxylic esters are obtained in only moderate yields. A further disadvantage of the processes described in European Published Patent Application No. 0282266 and International Published Patent Application No. WO 93/18005 is that the dihalopyridines employed as starting material are carbonylated with low selectivity. In a further carbonylation process J. Mol. Cat., 66, (1991), 277, high yields of pyridinecarboxylic esters are obtained starting from monohalopyridines, but the reaction requires long reaction times. BROAD DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION An object of the invention is to provide an economical process for preparing selectively monocarbonylated pyridinecarboxylic esters of the general formula I in high yields starting from dihalopyridines. Other objects and advantages of the invention are set out herein or are obvious herefrom to one skilled in the art. The objects and advantages of the invention are achieved by the method and compounds of the invention. The invention involves a process for preparing pyridinecarboxylic esters of the general formula: wherein R 1 is hydrogen, a C 1-6 -alkyl group, a C 1-4 -alkoxycarbonyl group, a C 1-4 -alkoxymethyl group or a fluorinated C 1-6 -alkyl group, R 2 is a C 1-4 -alkyl group and X is chlorine or bromine. In the process, 2,3-dihalopyridines of the general formula: wherein R 1 and X are each as defined above, are reacted with carbon monoxide and a C 1-4 -alkanol in the presence of a weak base and a complex of palladium with a bis(diphenylphosphine) of the general formula: wherein Q is a C 3-6 -alkanediyl group or 1,1-ferrocenediyl group having optionally C 1-4 -alkyl- or aryl-substituted cyclopentadienyl groups and R 3 to R 6 , independently of one another, are each hydrogen, C 1-4 -alkyl, C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy, fluoromethyl, fluorine, aryl, phenoxy, nitrile or dialkylamino.

The invention, moreover, relates to oligomeric liquid crystalline bismaleimides of general formula (II) wherein A, X, M and R are as defined above, n represents and integer from 1 to 100 and B represents piperazinyl or a divalent radical which is derived from a primary or secondary para-substituted cyclic diamine, wherein B is bonded via the amino groups of the diamine. The invention also relates to methods of producing said bismaleimides. This invention relates to new bismaleimides comprising mesogenic groups and to methods of producing them. Polymeric networks with liquid crystalline properties are materials which are potentially of interest, since they are capable of preferentially exhibiting outstanding mechanical and optical properties in their oriented state. Amongst the optical properties of networks of this type, the change in birefringence and the direction of polarisation in electric, mechanical and magnetic fields, which are utilised for the storage and display of information, e.g. in polymer network LCDs, should be emphasised in particular. In thermally crosslinked materials a refinforcement by liquid crystalline phases results in an increase in the modulus of elasticity, in the bending and fracture strength, and in hardness. Mesogenic compounds are suitable for the synthesis of liquid crystalline crosslinking agents. Mesogenic compounds such as these are mainly aromatic compounds comprising at least two benzene rings, which are linked para to each other by suitable groups, such as ester-(COO), amide (CONH) or azomethine (CHN) groups for example, wherein the terminal aromatic rings are each substituted in the para position in relation to these linking groups by an OH, COOH or NH 2 group. In order to attain liquid crystalline properties, the mesogens generally also have to be linked to suitable spacer chains via the aforementioned reactive OH, COOH or NH 2 groups. The liquid crystals which are thus formed exhibit what are predominantly nematic textures under the polarising microscope. If the spacer chains of the mesogens which were schematically described above have functions at their ends which are capable of crosslinking, such as acrylate, vinyl ether or glycidyl ethergroups for example, liquid crystalline compounds of this type are self-crosslinking or are capable of crosslinking with other reactive compounds by copolymerization. Their solubility in solvents, compatibility with the oligomeric and polymeric reactants and the liquid crystalline temperature ranges depend on the length of the linear aliphatic spacers, which may have a length corresponding to 1 to 30, preferably 3 to 20 CH 2 groups. Due to the spacer chains, the mesogens which form the liquid crystalline phase are isolated from the crosslinking sites, which is advantageous for the formation and for the capacity of orientation of the mesogenic phase. Examples thereof include liquid crystalline diglycidyl ethers, such as those described by D. J. Broer et al. in Macromolecules, 26, 1244-47 (1993) and by B. Koscielny et al. in Polymer Bulletin, Vol. 32 (5-6), 529-36 (1994), as well as diacrylate and divinyl ethers, such as those described by R. A. M. Hikmet et al. in Macromolecules 28, 3313-27 (1995) and in Polymer, 34, 1736-40 (1993). As essential characteristic property for the existence of liquid crystallinity is the length/diameter ratio of the individual molecule, which should reach or exceed a value of 5. When the above mesogens are used, the resulting networks also predominantly exhibit nematic behaviour. The industrial use of liquid crystalline crosslinking agents for the synthesis of mesogenic networks has hitherto foundered because of the costly synthesis of compounds of this type, which cannot be employed in an economically and technically feasible manner on an industrial scale. Multistage syntheses using protective groups are necessary in many cases, as described, for example, by M. Ando and T. Uryu in J. Polymer Science, Part A, 28, 2575-84 (1990) for liquid crystalline diacrylates. This publication describes the general procedure which was known hitherto for the synthesis of crosslinking agents of this type, which consists of reacting previously prepared bifunction mesogens, which comprise aromatically bonded para-substituted reactive OH, COOH or NH 2 groups or halogen atoms, mainly fluorine, bromine or iodine, in a Williamson ether synthesis with an excess of an ,-dihalo- or dihydroxyalkane, whereby the polyalkylene chains which are necessary as spacers are introduced. If ,-dihydroxyalkanes are used, an OH function generally has to be protected by a suitable reversible protective group before di-substitution. A reaction with compounds which contain a group which is capable of polymerization is not effected until the end, optionally after the removal of the protective groups. The groups which are employed as crosslinking groups are frequently those which are only capable of reacting with themselves or with a limited selection of other groups. Examples include the aforementioned acrylate, methacrylate and vinyl ether functions, which crosslink in addition polymerization reactions with compounds which contain groups of the same type or similar groups, or such as glycidyl ethers, which react with few other compounds, such as dicarboxylic acids, anhydrides or diamines. Moreover, liquid crystalline crosslinking agents which comprise said active crosslinking groups always require initiators or catalysts in order to initiate the reaction. The object of the present invention was to identify liquid crystalline crosslinking agents which can be produced in as simple a manner as possible, and which can be produced in a simpler, less costly manner, even on an industrial scale, than the mesogenic crosslinking agents known hitherto, which could only be obtained in laboratory syntheses. At the same time, the object was to identify a method which was equally suitable for the production of as many different products as possible which differ only as regards their mesogen and by the length of their spacer group, so as to produce suitable products for as many areas of application as possible. In order to achieve this object, the number of reaction steps required for the formation of liquid crystalline crosslinking agents have had to be significantly reduced and the few steps which were required must proceed with a high yield and be only slightly dependent, or not dependent at all, on the structure of the reactants. The present invention relates to bismaleimides comprising mesogenic groups, which consist, corresponding to formula (I) given below, of two reactive terminal maleimide groups which are linked via linear or singly alkyl-substituted alkylene chains A, which are linked to an aromatic mesogen M via ester, amide or ether groups, wherein A independently represents an alkylene chain comprising 3 to 20 CH 2 groups, wherein one C atom of each alkylene chain A can be chiral due to alkyl substitution, X independently represents C(O)O, C(O)NH or O, and M represents a mesogen consisting of at least two rings including an aromatic or a heterocyclic ring, which are linked para to each other by single bond, CH 2 CH 2 , CHCH, CC, ester (COO), amide (CONH), methylstilbene (C(CH 3 CH), azomethine (CHN), azine (CHNNCH), azo (NN) or azoxy (N(O)N) groups, and which can be mono- or di-substituted by alkyl groups, wherein the terminal aromatic rings are each substituted in the para position to these linking groups by an O or NH group of X, and R independently represents an H atom, an alkyl group comprising 1 to 8 C atoms, a phenyl ring or a halogen atom. Unless otherwise stated, the term alkyl denotes a hydrocarbon group comprising 1 to 5 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and pentyl, including the isomers thereof. Methyl is preferred. The bismaleimides of formula (I) according to the invention can be produced from maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids, the single-stage synthesis of which is described in EP-A-0 847 991, by linking the acid chlorides thereof, which can be obtained in a simple manner and in good yield, with difunctional aromatic mesogens. Therefore, the present invention further relates to a method of producing bismaleimides comprising mesogenic groups of general formula (I) as defined above, in which X represents C(O)) or C(O)NH, wherein maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids of general formula wherein R and A are as defined above, are converted into the corresponding acid chloride, 2 equivalents of the acid chloride are reacted with a compound of formula HOMOH or H 2 NMNH 2 , wherein M is defined above, in a suitable solvent, optionally in the presence of a catalyst and/or an acid acceptor, and at a temperature of 0 to 70 C., and the bismaleimide is isolated. The essential advantage of the maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids which are described in EP-A-0 847 991 and which are used for the production of bismaleimides of formula (I) according to the present invention is that the polymerisable function comprising a spacer group, which consists of 1 to 20, preferably of 3 to 12 CH 2 groups, one of which can be chiral due to substitution by alkyl, already exists in them, and is linked to a reactive, terminal COOH group. The bismaleimides comprising mesogenic groups according to the invention which are produced in this manner may exhibit liquid crystalline or non-liquid crystalline behaviours above their melting point. This depends both on the length of the alkylene spacers and on the type of mesogenic group. However, non-liquid crystalline bismaleimides can be converted into liquid crystalline bismaleimides by secondary reactions such as addition reactions, and can be further used as such. Aliphatic maleimides can be homopolymerized by a radical mechanism, and can be polymerized with numerous other monomers, such as acrylates, methacrylates and vinyl compounds, such as styrene for example. Furthermore, the maleimide function enters into thermal, catalysed, uncatalysed and photochemical reactions with a multiplicity of other functional groups. Examples include the reactions thereof with glycidyl ethers, allyl ethers and esters, vinyl ethers, isocyano-esters, dithiols, diamines and phenylacetylenes. Compared with known liquid crystalline diacrylates, dimethacrylates, divinyl ethers and diglycidyl ethers, liquid crystalline bismaleimides thus exhibit a more versatile reaction behaviour, and in principle are thus outstandingly suitable for the synthesis of a multiplicity of LC networks. According to the teaching of EP-A-0 847 991, maleimidocarboxylic acids can be produced in one step and in good yields from maleic anhydride and ,-aminocarboxylic acids. The ,-aminocarboxylic acids which are required therefore can be obtained industrially with different alkylene chain lengths between (CH 2 ) 1 and (CH 2 ) 20 . Maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids with alkylene chain lengths of (CH 2 ) 3 to (CH 3 ) 12 are the most preferred starting materials for the production of liquid crystalline crosslinking agents, since they already contain, in one molecule, a polymerisable or crosslinkable function and a spacer group of suitable and selectable chain length. Compared with methods known hitherto for the production of liquid crystalline crosslinking agents, this is a decisive advantage industrially. The terminal carboxyl group of maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids enables them to be reacted with a difunctional mesogen, in only one or at most two reaction steps, to form liquid crystalline crosslinking agents. Numerous reactions which are known in the art for the production of esters or acid amines are suitable for coupling maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids to OH or NH 2 functional mesogens, such as the reaction of acid chlorides with alcohols or amines in the presence of an acid scavenger, transesterification, or condensation with the separation of water. One preferred method of producing bismaleimides according to the invention is the reaction of maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acid chlorides with OH-functional mesogens in the presence of basic acid scavengers. Bismaleimides according to the invention which comprise amide linkages can be produced analogously from NH 2 -functional mesogens and maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acid chlorides. The requisite acid chlorides can be produced, in a simple synthesis which proceeds to completion, from maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids by reaction with thionyl chloride, sulphuryl chloride or oxalyl chloride, wherein thionyl and oxalyl chlorides are preferred. Examples of suitable maleimidocarboxylic acids, to which the present invention is not exclusively restricted, however, include maleimidoacetic acid, maleimidopropionic acid, maleimidobutyric acid, D- and L-maleimidoisobutyric acids, maleimidocaproic acid, maleimidoheptanoic acid, maleimidononanoic acid, maleimidoundecanoic acid, maleimidododecanoic acid, 2-methylmaleimidocaproic acid, 2-methylmaleimidounecanoic acid, 2,3-dimethylmaleimidobutyric acid and 2,3-dimethyl-maleimidoundecanoic acid, wherein bismaleimides of long chain maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids exhibit better liquid crystalline properties. These maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids can be converted into their acid chlorides, in a simple manner and in quantitative yields, with thionyl chloride, sulphuryl chloride, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus oxychloride or oxalyl chloride, wherein thionyl and oxalyl chloride are preferred, in suitable solvents, advantageously in halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, 1,1,2-trichloroethane or 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, at temperatures of 0 to 100 C., preferably 0 to 70 C., optionally in the presence of acid scavengers such as tertiary amines or pyridine. These acid chlorides can be converted into bismaleimides according to the invention by their reactions, which are known in the art, with aromatic mesogens M corresponding to general structure (III) as shown below, with the formation of ester or amide bonds, wherein ester bond linkages are preferred: where XO or NH; and if N is present: NCOO, CONH, CHCH, C(CH 3 )CH, CC, NN, N(O)N, CHN or CHNNCH. The mesogens M must contain two OH or NH 2 groups which are reactive with acid chlorides and must contain at least two aromatic rings which are linked para to each other by single, double or triple CC bonds or by azo, azoxy, ester, amide, azomethine or azine groups, and which can be mono- or di-substituted in any position by alkyl groups or halogen atoms. An aromatic ring can be replaced by a heterocyclic ring, such as pyrimidine or 1,3-dioxane. Examples of mesogens which are suitable for the formation of bismaleimides according to the invention are the following: 4,4-dihydroxybiphenyl, 4,4-dihydroxyterphenyl, 4,4-dihydroxydiphenyl-acetylene, 4,4-dihydroxystilbene, 4,4-dihydroxymethylstilbene, 4,4-dihydroxy-azobenzene, 4,4-dihydroxyazoxybenzene, 4-hydroxyphenyl-4-hydroxy-benzoate, 4-aminophenyl-4-aminobenzoate, hydroquinone-bis-(4-hydroxybenzoate), 2-methyl-hydroquinone-1,4-bis-(4-hydroxybenzoate), bi-phenylyl-4,4-bis-(4-hydroxy-benzoate), 1,4-naphthylene-bis-(4-hydroxybenzoate), 1,5-naphthylene-bis-(4-hydroxybenzoate), 4,4-dihydroxydiphenylazomethine, 4,4-dihydroxydiphenylazine, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-hydroxypyrimidine, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-hydroxy-1,3-dioxane, and N,N-terephthalylidene-bis(4-hydroxybenzene). The mesogens which are particularly preferred for the production of bismaleimides which crosslink above 100 C. with the formation of liquid crystalline phases are 4-hydroxyphenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, hydroquinone-bis(4-hydroxybenzoate), 2-methylhydroquinone-1,4-bis(4-hydroxybenzoate) and diphenylyl-4,4-bis(4-hydroxybenzoate). These mesogens can be produced from inexpensive compounds in a simple manner and in one step, even on a large scale, according to the teaching of the DE-OS 3622611 or as described by F. N. Jones et al. Polym. Preprints ACS, 30(2), 462 (1989), and are therefore particularly suitable for the commercial production of bismaleimides according to the invention. Bismaleimides of general structure 1 in which X represents an ether linkage can also be produced. Thus -haloalkylmaleimides, preferably -bromoalkylmaleimides comprising 1 to 20, preferably 3 to 12, CH 2 groups which are linked linearly to each other, and which may also contain a chiral centre obtained by alkyl substitution, preferably by methyl substitution, can be linked to form bismaleimides by methods comprising Williamson ether synthesis under mild reaction conditions with the aromatic para-hydroxy-substituted mesogens cited above by way of example. Therefore, the present invention further relates to a method of producing bismaleimides of formula (I), wherein X represents O, in which 2 equivalents of a halogenated N-alkylmaleimide of general formula wherein R and A are as defined above and Hal represents a halogen atom, are reacted with a compound of general formula HOMOH, wherein M is defined as above, in a suitable solvent, in the presence of a catalyst or an acid acceptor, and at a temperature of 20 to 200 C., preferably 50 to 150 C., and the bismaleimides are isolated. -haloalkylmaleimides can be obtained from -hydroxyalkylmaleimides by reaction with a halogenating agent such as PX 3 , POX 3 or PX 5 , wherein X represents Cl or Br. Another method of producing the desired -haloalkylmaleimides is the reaction of an alkali metal salt of maleinimide or of 7-oxabicycloheptene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid imide, which can be obtained in a simple manner by the Diels-Alder reaction of furane with maleinimide, with an excess of an ,-dihaloalkane, wherein ,-dibromoalkanes comprising 3 to 12 CH 2 groups are preferred. The desired -haloalkylmaleimides can be isolated from the reaction mixture by filtering off the alkali metal halide and preferably by removing the excess of ,-dihaloalkane by distillation, wherein the furane is also removed when 7-oxabicycloheptene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid imide is used. The reaction of the -haloalkylmaleimides, which are produced in this manner, with para-substituted OH-functional mesogens of general formula (III) is advantageously conducted in the presence of dry K 2 CO 3 in a dipolar aprotic solvent, such as acetone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone or dimethylformamide, wherein acetone is preferred, with the addition of a catalytic amount of potassium iodide. Alternatively, bismaleimides of general formula (I) according to the invention, wherein X represents O, can be produced by method in which (i) a compound of general formula HOMOH, wherein M is as defined above, is reacted with 2 equivalents of an ,-haloalkane nitrile of general formula HalACN, wherein Hal represents a halogen atom and A represents an alkylene chain comprising 2 to 19 CH 2 groups, and wherein one C atom of each alkylene chain A can be chiral due to alkyl substitution, in a suitable aprotic dipolar solvent, in the presence of a catalyst and/or of an acid acceptor, and at a temperature of 20 to 200 C., preferably 50 to 150 C., to form an ,-dinitrile of general formula NCAOMOACN, wherein A and M are as defined above, (ii) the ,-dinitrile is reduced with a complex metal hydride in the presence of a strong acid with subsequent hydrolysis to form the corresponding ,-diamine of general formula H 2 NCH 2 AOMOACH 2 NH 2 , wherein A and M are as defined above, and (iii) the ,-diamine is imidised with two equivalents of a maleic anhydride of general formula wherein R is as defined above, in a mixture consisting of an aliphatic carboxylic acid and an aromatic hydrocarbon at a temperature of 100 to 180 C., with the separation of water, to form the liquid crystalline bismaleimides. In this method, the Williamson ether synthesis described above is first effected between the aforementioned exemplary aromatic para-hydroxy-substituted mesogens and 2 equivalents of an ,-haloalkane nitrile, preferably in the presence of dry K 2 CO 3 in a dipolar aprotic solvent, such as acetone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone or dimethylformamide for example, wherein acetone is preferred, with the addition of a catalytic amount of potassium iodide, within the temperature range from 20 to 200 C., preferably 50 to 150 C. The ,-haloalkane nitriles which are preferably used are ,-bromoalkane nitriles comprising 3 to 12 CH 2 groups, one of which may be chiral due to alkyl substitution, preferably methyl substitution. The nitrile groups are then reduced to amines by methods known in the art, e.g. by reduction with complex metal hydrides in the presence of a strong acid, by LiAlH 4 /H 2 SO 4 for example, as described by N. M. Yoon and H. C. Brown in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 90, 2927 (1968). The diamines which are thus obtained are then reacted with equivalent amounts of unsubstituted or substituted maleic anhydride by methods of cyclisation which are likewise known, for example by heating in aliphatic carboxylic acids with the azeotropic removal of water by an aromatic entraining agent according to the teaching of EP-A-0 847 991, to form bismaleimides according to the invention which comprise ether linkages. Bismaleimides according to the invention which comprise ether linkages can also be produced from diamines and maleic anhydride by the method described by C. Komehl, H.- I. Nagel and A. Phal in Agnewandte Makromolekulare Chemie 227, 139-57 (1995), wherein two equivalents of maleic anhydride are reacted with one equivalent of a diamine in dimethylformamide in the presence of one equivalent of acetic anhydride and of a catalyst constituting of nickel(II) acetate and triethylamine, at temperatures of 90 to 105 C., to form aliphatic bismaleimides. The melting temperatures and the occurrence of liquid crystalline behaviour on melting, which can be observed under the polarising microscope in the form of multi-coloured textures which are generally nematic, depends on the length of the alkylene spacers and on the type of linking between the alkylene spacers and the mesogenic group, and also depends on the type of mesogenic group used. In general, bismaleimides comprising alkylene spacers with fewer than 3 CH 2 groups are not liquid crystalline. The more para-linked rings which are present in the mesogenic group, the more is liquid crystalline behaviour to be anticipated at average alkylene spacer lengths between (CH 2 ) 5 and (CH 2 ) 10 . Thus bismaleimides comprising (CH 2 ) 5 and (CH 2 ) 10 chains and only two para-substituted benzene rings do not yet exhibit liquid crystalline properties. Furthermore, the occurrence of liquid crystallinity also depends on the mutual interactions of the mesogenic groups in the melt. Since the bismaleimides according to the invention, which are of particular interest commercially since they can be obtained from simple precursors, either do not exhibit liquid crystalline behaviour or only have very narrow LC temperature ranges above 100 C. which limit their suitability for the formation of liquid crystalline networks to relatively narrow ranges of crosslinking temperatures, a further object of the present invention was to modify the bismaleimides according to the invention, by reactions which are as simple as possible and which as far as possible proceed to completion, so that their liquid crystalline transition range becomes wider or so that liquid crystallinity occurs anyway. Therefore, the present invention also relates to oligomeric liquid crystalline bismaleimides of general formula (II) wherein A, X, M and R are as defined above, n represents an integer from 1 to 100 and B represents piperazinyl or a divalent radical which is derived from a primary or secondary para-substituted cyclic diamine, wherein B is bonded via the amino groups of the diamine. The oligomeric liquid crystalline bismaleimides of general formula (II) according to the invention are produced from liquid crystalline bismaleimides of general formula (I) by the oligomerisation thereof by a Michael addition, in a suitable solvent, with half to one equivalent of a para-substituted aromatic, alicyclic or heterocyclic primary or secondary amine at a temperature of 0 to 80 C., preferably 20 to 50 C., and the reaction products are isolated by methods known in the art. In this reaction, what are termed aspartimide linkages are formed between the diamines and the bismaleimides of general formula (I). The bismaleimides of general formula (I) which are preferably reacted are those in which the maleimide double bonds comprise H atoms or one methyl group only. The choice of solvent is not critical. Halogenated hydrocarbons, tertiary amides and ethers can be used for example, as well as mixtures thereof. Cyclic 1,4-diamines are preferably used in the method according to the invention of producing oligomeric liquid crystalline bismaleimides. Examples thereof include p-phenylenediamine, 4,4-diaminobiphenyl, 4,4-diamino-3,3,5,5-tetramethyl-biphenyl and N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine. Oligomeric compounds of this type can be described in terms of general structure IV: where Z1,4-phenylene or 4,4-biphenylene, and SH or CH 3 , wherein A, M, R and X have the same meanings as described for structure (I) and n denotes an integer between 1 and 100. The reaction of bismaleimides with piperazine is particularly preferred, and results in liquid crystalline bismaleimides of general structure (V): where A, M, R ad X have the same meanings as those described for structure (I) and n denotes an integer between 1 and 100. The reaction of bismaleimides according to the invention with half an equivalent of a cyclic diamine essentially results in bisaspartimides with n1, wherein oligomers with N1 can still be formed, depending on the temperature of reaction. In contrast, the reaction of one equivalent of a cyclic diamine with a bismaleimide results in oligomers with n1. In cases such as these, where the mixtures obtained are soluble in CHCl 3 or tetrahydrofuran, chromatographically separated individual products are obtained by gel permeation chromatography which comprise 1 to 10 repeating units and a proportion of higher polymers with molecular weights up to 20,000 g/mole. On average, both types of product comprise two terminal maleimide groups per oligomer molecule, which are available for further reaction. Chain extension of bismaleimides according to the invention with diamines, wherein piperazine is preferred, results in a plurality of significant improvements in properties. Thus the liquid crystalline temperature range, even for bisaspartimides (n1), is for the most part considerably broadened compared with the corresponding bismaleimides. Thus the bismaleimide formed from 2 moles of maleimidohexanoic acid chloride and one mole of hydroquinone-bis(4-hydroxybenzoate) exhibits a nematic phase under the polarising microscope between 125 and 140 C., whilst the reaction product thereof with one mole of piperazine exhibits a nematic phase between 100 and about 325 C. Similar broadenings of the liquid crystalline temperature range are also observed for other LC bismaleimides and are due to an increase in the typical length/diameter ratio of the liquid crystalline bismaleimides. In this connection, the liquid crystalline temperature ranges also depend on the temperature of formation of the polyaspartimides, since in the upper region of the given reaction temperature range more products of higher molecular weight are formed, the mesogenic phases of which occur at higher temperatures than those which are produced at room temperature. A characteristic of all low and high molecular weight bismaleimides according to the invention is their capacity for thermal crosslinking at temperatures above 200 C., which is due to thermal crosslinking bis maleimide groups. Depending on the mesogen used and on the alkylene spacer length, crosslinking may either occur in the mesogenic phase or may first occur in the isotropic phase above the clear point. If para-substituted primary aromatic diamines are used for chain extension, the more weakly basic secondary amino groups of the aspartimide groups can also react with the maleimide double bonds by a Michael addition at higher temperatures above 150 C. Piperazine-modified products are therefore preferred in many cases. In each case, liquid crystalline compounds are present which are capable of thermal crosslinking. It is also of considerable practical importance that liquid crystalline properties are imparted by this modification even to those bismaleimides which do in fact contain mesogenic groups but which still do not exhibit liquid crystalline behaviour. Thus, for example, 4,4-biphenyl-bis(oxycarbonylpentylmaleimide) itself does not exhibit a liquid crystalline transition, but merely exhibits a melting point at 110 C., wherein the melt remains isotropic under the polarising microscope. In contrast, the oligomeric reaction product with half an equivalent of piperazine exhibits, after isolation, a broad melting range up to 114 C. and moreover exhibits a nematic texture. The isolated oligomeric product from the reaction with one equivalent of piperazine exhibits a transition from the crystalline phase to the nematic phase at 79 C. and has a clear point of 180 C. The solubility of piperazine-modified bismaleimides in many organic solvents is also better than that of bismaleimide starting materials, which is important for many applications. The present invention embraces a liquid crystalline medium for electro-optical display, which comprises one or more than one mesogenic-group-containing bismaleimide and/or oligomeric bismaleimide obtained by oligomerization of the mesogenic-group-containing bismaleimide according to the present invention. The liquid crystalline medium for electro-optical display of the present invention may contain, as the one or more than one bismaleimide and/or oligomeric bismaleimide according to the present invention, at least one compound selected from the group of conventionally known liquid crystalline compounds within an extent not impairing the advantages of the present invention such as liquid crystallinity. Specific examples of the conventionally known liquid crystalline compound include biphenyl compounds, terphenyl compounds, phenyl or cyclohexyl benzoate compounds, phenyl or cyclohexyl cyclohexanecarboxylate compounds, phenyl or cyclohexyl cyclohexexylbenzoate compounds, phenyl or cyclohexyl cyclohexylcyclohexanecarboxylate compounds, cyclohexylphenyl benzoate compounds, cyclohexylphenyl cyclohexanecarboxylate compounds, cyclohexylphenyl cyclohexylcyclohexanecarboxylate compounds, phenylcyclohexane compounds, cyclohexylbiphenyl compounds, phenylcyclohexylcyclohexane compounds, cyclohexylcyclohexane compounds, cyclohexylcyclohexene compounds, cyclohexylcyclohexylcyclohexene compounds, 1,4-bis-cyclohexylbenzene compounds, 4,4-bis-cyclohexylbiphenyl compounds, phenyl- or cyclohexyl-pyrimidine compounds, phenyl- or cyclohexylpyridine compounds, phenyl- or cyclohexyldioxane compounds, phenyl- or cyclohexyl-1,3-dithian compounds, 1,2-diphenylethane compounds, 1,2-dicyclohexylethane compounds, 1-phenyl-2-cclohexylethane compounds, 1-cyclohexyl-2-(4-phenylcyclohexyl)ethane compounds, 1-cyclohexyl-2-biphenylethane compounds, 1-phenyl-2-cyclohexylphenylethane compounds and tolan compounds and fluorinated compounds thereof. Since the above-exemplified compounds differ in melting point and liquid crystallinity, a liquid crystalline composition suited for various liquid crystalline media can be prepared using a plurality of them in combination. Bismaleimides according to the invention and aspartimide oligomers thereof are capable of forming liquid crystalline networks in solution or in the melt by crosslinking, either purely thermally or with radical initiators. When used as additives in amounts of 5-50% by weight, commercially available aromatic bismaleimide resins give rise to an improvement in the mechanical properties, primarily the toughness, of the cured products. They can also form liquid crystalline networks in combination with other unsaturated monomers, oligomers and reactive polymers. The synthesis and properties of bismaleimides according to the invention can be demonstrated by means of the following examples.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This is a division of application Ser. No. 09/097,543, filed Jun. 15, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,020,343 which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/728,512 filed on Oct. 9, 1996, now abandon, which was based upon provisional application nos. 60/005,371 filed on Oct. 13, 1995 and 60/011,637 filed on Feb. 14, 1996, priority of which is claimed hereunder. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to methods of treating cyclooxygenase mediated diseases and certain pharmaceutical compositions therefor. Non-steroidal, antiinflammatory drugs exert most of their antiinflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity and inhibit hormone-induced uterine contractions and certain types of cancer growth through inhibition of prostaglandin G/H synthase, also known as cyclooxygenase. Initially, only one form of cyclooxygenase was known, this corresponding to cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) or the constitutive enzyme, as originally identified in bovine seminal vesicles. More recently the gene for a second inducible form of cyclooxygenase, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been cloned, sequence and characterized initially from chicken, murine and human sources. This enzyme is distinct from the COX-1 which has been cloned, sequenced and characterized from various sources including the sheep, the mouse and man. The second form of cyclooxygenase, COX-2, is rapidly and readily inducible by a number of agents including mitogens, endotoxin, hormones, cytokines and growth factors. As prostaglandins have both physiological and pathological roles, we have concluded that the constitutive enzyme, COX-1, is responsible, in large part, for endogenous basal release of prostaglandins and hence is important in their physiological functions such as the maintenance of gastrointestinal integrity and renal blood flow. In contrast, we have concluded that the inducible form, COX-2, is mainly responsible for the pathological effects of prostaglandins where rapid induction of the enzyme would occur in response to such agents as inflammatory agents, hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. Thus, a selective inhibitor of COX-2 will have similar antiinflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic properties to a conventional non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug, and in addition would inhibit hormone-induced uterine contractions and have potential anti-cancer effects, but will have a diminished ability to induce some of the mechanism-based side effects. In particular, such a compound should have a reduced potential for gastrointestinal toxicity, a reduced potential for renal side effects, a reduced effect on bleeding times and possibly a lessened ability to induce asthma attacks in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic subjects. Furthermore, such a compound will also inhibit prostanoid-induced smooth muscle contraction by preventing the synthesis of contractile prostanoids and hence may be of use in the treatment of dysmenorrhea, premature labour, asthma and eosinophil related disorders. It will also be of use in the treatment of Alzheimers disease, for decreasing bone loss particularly in postmenopausal women (i.e. treatment of osteoporosis) and for the treatment of glaucoma. A brief description of the potential utility of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors is given in an article by John Vane, Nature, Vol. 367, pp. 215-216, 1994, and in an article in Drug News and Perspectives, Vol. 7, pp. 501-512, 1994.

These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water or miscible solvents such as propylene glycol, PEGs and ethanol, or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil. Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxy-propylmethycellulose, sodium alginate, poly-vinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame. Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example, arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example, beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid. Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example, sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example, olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example, liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example, soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example, sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parentally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringers solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Cosolvents such as ethanol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols may also be used. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acid such as oleic acid fin use in the preparation of injectables. Compound I may also be administered in the form of a suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. For topical use, creams, ointments, gels, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compound of Formula I are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouth washes and gargles.) Topical formulations may generally be comprised of a pharmaceutical carrier, cosolvent, emulsifier, penetration enhancer, preservative system, and emollient. Dosage levels of the order of from about 0.01 mg to about 140 mg/kg of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions, or alternatively about 0.5 mg to about 7 g per patient per day. For example, inflammation may be effectively treated by the administration of from about 0.01 to 50 mg of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day, or alternatively about 0.5 mg to about 3.5 g per patient per day. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration of humans may contain from 0.5 mg to 5 g of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient, typically 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, or 1000 mg. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.

INHIBITION OF CYCLOOXYGENASE ACTIVITY Compounds are tested as inhibitors of cyclooxygenase activity in whole cell cyclooxygenase assays. Both of these assays measure prostaglandin E 2 synthesis in response to arachidonic acid, using a radioimmunoassay. Cells used for these assays are human osteosarcoma 143 cells (which specifically express COX-2) and human U-937 cells (which specifically express COX-1). In these assays, 100% activity is defined as the difference between prostaglandin E 2 synthesis in the absence and presence of arachidonate. Whole Cell Assays For cyclooxygenase assays, osteosarcoma cells are cultured in 1 mL of media in 24-well multidishes (Nunclon) until confluent (1-210 5 cells/well). U-937 cells are grown in spinner flasks and resuspended to a final density of 1.510 6 cells/mL in 24-well multidishes (Nunclon). Following washing and resuspension of osteosarcoma and U-937 cells in 1 mL of HBSS, 1 L of a DMSO solution of test compound or DMSO vehicle is added, and samples gently mixed. All assays are performed in triplicate. Samples are then incubated for 5 or 15 minutes at 37 C., prior to the addition of arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid (peroxide-free, Cayman Chemical) is prepared as a 10 mM stock solution in ethanol and further diluted 10-fold in HBSS. An aliquot of 10 L of this diluted solution is added to the cells to give a final arachidonic acid concentration of 10 M. Control samples are incubated with ethanol vehicle instead of arachidonic acid. Samples are again gently mixed and incubated for a further 10 min. at 37 C. For osteosarcoma cells, reactions are then stopped by the addition of 100 L of 1N HCl, with mixing and by the rapid removal of the solution from cell monolayers. For U-937 cells, reactions are stopped by the addition of 100 L of 1N HCl, with mixing. Samples are then neutralized by the addition of 100 L of 1N NaOH and PGE 2 levels measured by radioimmunoassay. Whole cell assays for COX-2 and COX-1 using CHO transfected cell lines Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines which have been stably transfected with an eukaryotic expression vector pCDNAIII containing either the human COX-1 or COX-2 cDNAs are used for the assay. These cell lines are referred to as CHO hCOX-1 and CHO hCOX-2, respectively. For cyclooxygenase assays, CHOhCOX-1 cells from suspension cultures and CHOhCOX-2 cells prepared by trypsinization of adherent cultures are harvested by centrifugation (300g, 10 min) and washed once in HBSS containing 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and resuspended in HBSS, 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, at a cell concentration of 1.510 6 cells/ml. Drugs to be tested are dissolved in DMSO to 66.7-fold the highest test drug concentration. Compounds are typically tested at 8 concentrations in duplicate using serial 3-fold serial dilutions in DMSO of the highest drug concentration. Cells (0.310 6 cells in 200 l) are preincubated with 3 l of the test drug or DMSO vehicle for 15 min at 37 C. Working solutions of peroxide-free AA (5.5 M and 110 M AA for the CHO hCOX-1 and CHO COX-2 assays, respectively) are prepared by a 10-fold dilution of a concentrated AA solution in ethanol into HBSS containing 15 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells are then challenged in the presence or absence of drug with the AA/HBSS solution to yield a final concentration of 0.5 M AA in the CHOhCOX-1 assay and a final concentration of 10 M AA in the CHOhCOX-2 assay. The reaction is terminated by the addition of 10 l 1 N HCl followed by neutralization with 20 l of 0.5 N NaOH. The samples are centrifuged at 300g at 4 C. for 10 min, and an aliquot of the clarified supernatant is appropriately diluted for the determination of PGE 2 levels using an enzyme-linked immunoassay for PGE 2 (Correlate PGE 2 enzyme immunoassay kit, Assay Designs, Inc.). Cyclooxygenase activity in the absence of test compounds is determined as the difference in PGE 2 levels of cells challenged with arachidonic acid versus the PGE 2 levels in cells mock-challenged with ethanol vehicle. Inhibition of PGE 2 synthesis by test compounds is calculated as a percentage of the activity in the presence of drug versus the activity in the positive control samples. Assay of COX-1 Activity from U937 cell microsomes U 937 cells are pelleted by centrifugation at 500g for 5 min and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and repelleted. Cells are resuspended in homogenization buffer consisting of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 2 g/ml leupeptin, 2 g/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 g/ml aprotinin and 1 mM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspension is sonicated 4 times for 10 sec and is centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min at 4 C. The supernatant is centrifuged at 100,000g for 1 hr at 4 C. The 100,000g microsomal pellet is resuspended in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA to approximately 7 mg protein/ml and stored at 80 C. Microsomal preparations are thawed immediately prior to use, subjected to a brief sonication, and then diluted to a protein concentration of 125 g/ml in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 containing 10 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenol, 1 mM reduced glutathione and 1 M hematin. Assays are performed in duplicate in a final volume of 250 l. Initially, 5 l of DMSO vehicle or drug in DMSO are added to 20 l of 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 containing 10 mM EDTA in wells of a 96-deepwell polypropylene titer plate. 200 l of the microsomal preparation are then added and pre-incubated for 15 min at room temperature before addition of 25 l of 1 M arachidonic acid in 0.1 M Tris-HCl and 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4. Samples are incubated for 40 min at room temperature and the reaction is stopped by the addition of 25 l of 1 N HCl. Samples are neutralized with 25 l of 1 N NaOH prior to quantitation of PGE 2 content by radioimmunoassay (Dupont-NEN or Amersham assay kits). Cyclooxygenase activity is defined as the difference between PGE 2 levels in samples incubated in the presence of arachidonic acid and ethanol vehicle. Assay of the activity of purified human COX-2 The enzyme activity is measured using a chromogenic assay based on the oxidation of N,N,N,N-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) during the reduction of PGG 2 to PGH 2 by COX-2 (Copeland et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 91, 11202-11206). Recombinant human COX-2 is purified from Sf9 cells as previously described (Percival et al (1994) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 15, 111-118). The assay mixture (180 L) contains 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 2 mM genapol X-100, 1 M hematin, 1 mg/ml gelatin, 80-100 units of purified enzyme (One unit of enzyme is defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce an O.D. change of 0.001/min at 610 nm) and 4 L of the test compound in DMSO. The mixture is pre-incubated at room temperature (22 C.) for 15 minutes prior to initiation of the enzymatic reaction by the addition of 20 L of a sonicated solution of 1 mM arachidonic acid (AA) and 1 mM TMPD in assay buffer (without enzyme or hematin). The enzymatic activity is measured by estimation of the initial velocity of TMPD oxidation over the first 36 sec of the reaction. A non-specific rate of oxidation is observed in the absence of enzyme (0.0070.010 O.D./min) and is subtracted before the calculation of the % inhibition. IC 50 values are derived from 4-parameter least squares non-linear regression analysis of the log-dose vs % inhibition plot. HUMAN WHOLE BLOOD ASSAY Rationale Human whole blood provides a protein and cell-rich milieu appropriate for the study of biochemical efficacy of anti-inflammatory compounds such as selective COX-2 inhibitors. Studies have shown that normal human blood does not contain the COX-2 enzyme. This is consistent with the observation that COX-2 inhibitors have no effect on PGE 2 production in normal blood. These inhibitors are active only after incubation of human whole blood with LPS, which induces COX-2. This assay can be used to evaluate the inhibitory effect of selective COX-2 inhibitors on PGE 2 production. As well, platelets in whole blood contain a large amount of the COX-1 enzyme. Immediately following blood clotting, platelets are activated through a thrombin-mediated mechanism. This reaction results in the production of thromboxane B 2 (TxB 2 ) via activation of COX-1. Thus, the effect of test compounds on TxB 2 levels following blood clotting can be examined and used as an index for COX-1 activity. Therefore, the degree of selectivity by the test compound can be determined by measuring the levels of PGE 2 after LPS induction (COX-2) and TxB 2 following blood clotting (COX-1) in the same assay. Method A. COX-2 (LPS-induced PGE 2 production) Fresh blood is collected in heparinized tubes by venipuncture from both male and female volunteers. The subjects have no apparent inflammatory conditions and have not taken any NSAIDs for at least 7 days prior to blood collection. Plasma is immediately obtained from a 2 mL blood aliquot to use as blank (basal levels of PGE 2 ). The remaining blood is incubated with LPS (100 g/ml final concentration, Sigma Chem, L-2630 from E. coli; diluted in 0.1% BSA (Phosphate buffered saline) for 5 minutes at room temperature. Five hundred L aliquots of blood are incubated with either 2 L of vehicle (DMSO) or 2 L of a test compound at final concentrations varying from 10 nM to 30 M for 24 hours at 37 C. At the end of the incubation, the blood is centrifuged at 12,000g for 5 minutes to obtain plasma. A 100 L aliquot of plasma is mixed with 400 L of methanol for protein precipitation. The supernatant is obtained and is assayed for PGE 2 using a radioimmunoassay kit (Amersham, RPA530) after conversion of PGE 2 to its methyl oximate derivative according to the manufacturers procedure. B. COX-1 (Clotting-induced TxB 2 production) Fresh blood is collected into vacutainers containing no anticoagulants. Aliquots of 500 L are immediately transferred to siliconized microcentrifuge tubes preloaded with 2 L of either DMSO or a test compound at final concentrations varying from 10 nM to 30 M. The tubes are vortexed and incubated at 37 C. for 1 hour to allow blood to clot. At the end of incubation, serum is obtained by centrifugation (12,000g for 5 min.). A 100 L aliquot of serum is mixed with 400 L of methanol for protein precipitation. The supernatant is obtained and is assayed for TxB 2 using a enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman, 519031) according to the manufacturers instruction. RAT PAW EDEMA ASSAY Protocol Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150-200 g) are fasted overnight and are given, po, either vehicle (1% methocel or 5% Tween 80) or a test compound. One hr later, a line is drawn using a permanent marker at the level above the ankle in one hind paw to define the area of the paw to be monitored. The paw volume (V 0 ) is measured using a plethysmometer (Ugo-Basile, Italy) based on the principle of water displacement. The animals are then injected subplantarly with 50 l of 1% carrageenan solution in saline (FMC Corp, Maine) into the paw using an insulin syringe with a 25-gauge needle (i.e. 500 g carrageenan per paw). Three hr later, the paw volume (V 3 ) is measured and the increases in paw volume (V 3 -V O ) are calculated. The animals are sacrificed by CO 2 asphyxiation and the absence or presence of stomach lesions scored. Data is compared with the vehicle-control values and percent inhibition calculated. All treatment groups are coded to eliminate observer bias. NSAID-INDUCED GASTROPATHY IN RATS Rationale The major side effect of conventional NSAIDs is their ability to produce gastric lesions in man. This action is believed to be caused by inhibition of Cox-1 in the gastrointestinal tract. Rats are particularly sensitive to the actions of NSAIDs. In fact, rat models have been used commonly in the past to evaluate the gastrointestinal side effects of current conventional NSAIDs. In the present assay, NSAID-induced gastrointestinal damage is observed by measuring fecal 51 Cr excretion after systemic injection of 51 Cr-labeled red blood cells. Fecal 51 Cr excretion is a well-established and sensitive technique to detect gastrointestinal integrity in animals and man. Methods Male Sprague Dawley rats (150-200 g) are administered orally a test compound either once (acute dosing) or b.i.d. for 5 days (chronic dosing). Immediately after the administration of the last dose, the rats are injected via a tail vein with 0.5 mL of 51 Cr-labeled red blood cells from a donor rat. The animals are placed individually in metabolism cages with food and water ad lib. Feces are collected for a 48 h period and 51 Cr fecal excretion is calculated as a percent of total injected dose. 51 Cr-labeled red blood cells are prepared using the following procedures. Ten mL of blood is collected in heparinized tubes via the vena cava from a donor rat. Plasma is removed by centrifugation and replenished with equal volume of HBSS. The red blood cells are incubated with 400 Ci of sodium 51 chromate for 30 min. at 37 C. At the end of the incubation, the red blood cells are washed twice with 20 mL HBSS to remove free sodium 51 chromate. The red blood cells are finally reconstituted in 10 mL HBSS and 0.5 mL of the solution (about 20 Ci) is injected per rat. PROTEIN-LOSING GASTROPATHY IN SQUIRREL MONKEYS Rationale Protein-losing gastropathy (manifested as appearance of circulating cells and plasma proteins in the GI tract) is a significant and dose-limiting adverse response to standard non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This can be quantitatively assessed by intravenous administration of 51 CrCl 3 solution. This isotopic ion can avidly bind to cell and serum globins and cell endoplasmic reticulum. Measurement of radioactivity appearing in feces collected for 24 h after administration of the isotope thus provides a sensitive and quantitative index of protein-losing gastropathy. Methods Groups of male squirrel monkeys (0.8 to 1.4 kg) are treated by gavage with either 1% methocell or 5% Tween 80 in H 2 O vehicles, (3 mL/kg b.i.d.) or test compounds at doses from 1-100 mg/kg b.i.d. for 5 days. Intravenous 51 Cr (5 Ci/kg in 1 ml/kg phosphate buffer saline (PBS)) is administered 1 h after the last drug/vehicle dose, and feces collected for 24 h in a metabolism cage and assessed for excreted 51 Cr by gamma-counting. Venous blood is sampled 1 h and 8 h after the last drug dose, and plasma concentrations of drug measured by RP-HPLC. Representative Biological Data Compounds of the present invention are inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 and are thereby useful in the treatment of cyclooxygenase-2 mediated diseases as enumerated above. The activities of the compounds against cyclooxygenase may be seen in the representative results shown below. In the assay, inhibition is determined by measuring the amount of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) synthesized in the presence of arachidonic acid, cyclooxygenase-1 or cyclooxygenase-2 and a putative inhibitor. The IC 50 values represent the concentration of putative inhibitor required to return PGE 2 synthesis to 50% of that obtained as compared to the uninhibited control. The results for certain of the biological assays may be seen in Tables II, III and IV.

Alternatively compound 109 may be prepared in the following manner: Step A1: 2-Methyl-1-(4-(thiomethyl)phenyl)propan-1-one A 500 mL flask was charged under N 2 with 34.5 g (259 mMol) of AlCl 3 and 100 mL of ODCB. The vigorously stirred slurry was cooled to 8 C. and isobutyryl chloride (28.6 mL, 261 mMol) was added over 30 min., keeping the temperature at 10-15 C. The addition of isobutyryl chloride was slightly exothermic. The AlCl 3 /isobutyryl chloride complex was aged at 7 C. for 30 min. Efficient cooling was applied and thioanisole (31.2 g) was added to the reaction mixture over 120 min., maintaining an internal temperature of 8-13 C. The addition of thioanisole was very exothermic. After the addition of about half of thioanisole a heavy yellow precipitate formed. The precipitation was accompanied by an exotherm. Gaseous HCl is formed in the reaction, so that the effluent gas stream should be scrubbed with aqueous NaOH before release into the atmosphere. The reaction was warmed to 16 C. over 1 h. The reaction mixture was a thick yellow slurry at this point. HPLC analysis of a quenched (EtOAc/H 2 O) aliquot indicated completion of reaction. The reaction mixture was cooled to 10 C. and 160 mL of 5% aqueous HCl were added over 45 min. The addition was extremely exothermic and especially the initial addition required careful temperature monitoring. The biphasic mixture was vigorously stirred for 60 min. The lower organic phase was removed. A quantitative assay of the organic phase indicated a 98% yield. Step A2: 2-Bromo-2-methyl-1-(4-(thiomethyl)phenyl)propan-1-one A 500 mL flask was charged with the solution of the compound from step A1 (246 mMol). Approximately 10% of the bromine (1.3 mL, 26 mMol) were added and the reaction mixture was stirred until the red color had dissipated after 45 min. The remainder of the Br 2 (12 mL) was added over 60 min. The reaction was exothermic and the temperature rose to ca. 32 C. Gaseous HBr was released from the reaction, thus the effluent gas stream was scrubbed with aqueous NaOH before release into the atmosphere. The reaction mixture was aged for 2 h at 30 C. when HPLC analysis indicated completion of the reaction. Addition of a slight excess of Br 2 leads to the partial oxidation of the sulfide to the sulfoxide. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 160 mL H 2 O and the resulting 182.0 mL of organic phase were used directly for the oxidation (next step) (95% assay yield). Step A3: 2-Bromo-2-methyl-1-(4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)propan-1-one To a solution of the compound from the previous step in ODCB in a 500 mL reaction vessel with heating jacket, reflux condenser and bottom valve was added under N 2 a solution of Na 2 WO 4 (0.45 g, 1.4 mMol) and Aliquat 336 (2.2 g, 5.4 mMol) in 3.0 mL H 2 O. The heterogeneous reaction mixture was heated with vigorous stirring to 35 C. and ca. 30 mL of H 2 O 2 (30%) were added. The oxidation was extremely exothermic. After an induction period of ca. 3 min. the temperature rose quickly to 50-65 C. The remainder of the H 2 O 2 (36 mL) was added over 1 h. At the end of the addition HPLC analysis indicated completion of the reaction. The reaction mixture was heated to 80 C., the lower organic phase was removed and cooled to 6 C. over 1 hr. The product precipitated at ca. 50 C. without seeding. The slurry was filtered and washed with 25.0 mL of ODCB and 30.0 mL of hexane and three times with 20.0 mL of 60 C. H 2 O. After drying 37.8 g of the title compound (97% yield, ca 91% overall yield from thioanisole) were obtained as a white powder. Step A 4: Isopropoxyacetic Acid A 500 mL vessel fitted with a mechanical stirrer, thermocouple probe, and nitrogen inlet is charged with 200 mL of IPA (K.F. 220 g/mL) and sodium hydroxide (6.0 g, 0.145 mol). The mixture was heated at reflux until the solid sodium hydroxide dissolved. A homogeneous solution is obtained after reflux for 3 hr. The solution was cooled at 70 C. and toluene (15.0 mL) was added. It was distilled until 100 mL of distillate was collected. A mixture of IPA/toluene (85:15, 100 mL) was added and 0.1 L of liquid was distilled off (repeated 3). At the end of distillation (0.4 L of distillate collected), the solution was diluted with IPA to a volume of 300 mL. The distillate is assayed to determine the amount of water removed. If the water removed is 75% of the theoretical amount (K.F. of IPAthat in NaOH1 equiv generated), the distillation should be continued. The solution was then cooled at 60-70 C. and sodium chloroacetate (15.9 g, 0.134 mol) was added in portions over 5 min. No exotherm is observed during the addition. The mixture was heated at reflux for 3 h and a sample of the slurry was taken for assay. The reaction is followed by 1 HNMR. An aliquot (0.2 mL) of the mixture is taken and evaporated to dryness. The residue is dissolved in D 2 O for 1 HNMR measurement. The reaction is considered completed when the starting material is 3% vs. product. The reaction was quenched by addition of 60.0 mL of water and concentrated under reduced pressure (150-200 mBar, 50-60 C.) until 250 mL of distillate was collected. More water was added (40.0 mL) and the solution was distilled at normal pressure until the batch temperature reached 103 C. (100 mL of solution left, 300 mL of solvent removed). The solution was cooled at 10-20 C. and neutralized by addition of conc. hydrochloric acid (12.5 mL, 0.15 mol). External cooling may be needed during the addition of acid. The final pH should be 2.3, preferably 2. t-Butyl methyl ether (80.0 mL) was added. The aqueous solution was saturated with sodium chloride (9.0 g) and the two-phase mixture was agitated for 0.5 h at 10-15 C. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was back extracted with 260.0 mL of t-butyl methyl ether. The organic layers were combined and washed with 210.0 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The pH of the 2nd brine wash should be 2.5. The organic solution was dried over 4A molecular sieves (10.0 g) for 14 h and filtered. The sieves were washed with 315.0 mL of t-butyl methyl ether. t-Butyl methyl ether was removed under reduced pressure (200 mBar, 45-50 C.). Isopropoxyacetic acid was obtained as a slightly yellow liquid. Yield: 11.8 g, 75% yield. Step A 5: 2-(isopropoxy)acetic acid 2-methyl-1-(4-methylsulfonyl)phenyl)propan-1-one-2-yl ester A 100 mL flash was sequentially charged with dry ethanol (45.0 mL, K.F.100 g/mL), isopropoxyacetic acid (2.32 g), diisopropylethylamine (4.85 mL) and the bromosulfone (step A 3)(5.0 g). The mixture is heated to reflux until the bromosulfone is not detected (HPLC, reaction time 12-14 hours). The reaction is considered complete when the bromosulfone is 0.05 A % vs. product. After the reaction was complete, the solution was allowed to cool and seeded at 42 C. Crystallization initiated immediately and the mixture was cooled to 1 C. and aged 1 hr. The product ester is filtered and washed with ethanol (0 C. 5.0 mL wash). After drying in a vacuum oven, the white crystalline title compound was used as in the next step. Yield 4.15 g. Step A 6: 5.5-dimethyl-4-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-3-(2-propoxy)-5H-furan-2-one A 1 L flash was sequentially charged with dry acetonitrile (320 mL, K.F.100 g/mL), isopropyl trifluoroacetate (30.1 g, 0.193 mol), and DBU (36.70 g, 0.24 mol). The solution was stirred at 20 C. for 15 min and the ester from Step A5 (55.0 g, 0.161 mol) was added. The solution was heated at reflux under nitrogen and the progress of the reaction was followed by HPLC. The reaction is considered complete when the intermediate peaks are 0.2 A % vs. product. After the reaction was complete, the solution was cooled at 40 C. and filtered (1 in-line capsule). The solution was then concentrated at 40-50 C. under reduced pressure until 0.20 L of distillate was collected. Water (350 mL) was added slowly at 45 C. After 130 mL of water was added, the solution turned cloudy (40-45 C.) and 0.02 g of crystalline title compound was added as the seed. The mixture was aged for 30 min and the remaining water was added. The mixture was aged for 20 C. for 6 h then filtered. The cake was washed with 265 mL of 1:4 MeCN/water and 365 mL of water.

The internal temperature was reduced to 12 C., and an addition funnel was charged with cyclopropanemethanol (1198 g, 16.6 mol) in 2 L THF. This solution was added to the sodium hydride over 75 min, maintaining an internal temperature below 15 C. The mixture was then warmed to room temperature and stirred 18 h. Sodium chloroacetate (1413 g, 12.1 mol) was added, and the mixture was heated to reflux for 8.5 h, then allowed to cool overnight. The thick slurry was cautiously quenched with water (100 mL), then 10 L of 2M HCl and 3 L of EtOAc were added. The layers were separated and the organic phase was washed with 1.5 L EtOAc. The combined organic phases were concentrated, then partitioned between 12 L EtOAc and 4 L brine. The organic phase was dried over MgSO 4 filtered and evaporated to give 1778 g of a light yellow oil. To this material was added 2-bromo-2-methyl-1-(4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)propan-1-one (Ex. 109b Step A3, 2742 g, 8.98 mol) and 15 L of anhydrous EtOH. Ethyldiisopropylamine (1706 g, 13.2 mol) was added and the slurry was heated to reflux, giving a light yellow solution. After 30 h, the solution was allowed to cool with periodic seeding with authentic product. Crystalization began at 46 C. When the internal temperature reached 35 C., 2 L of water was added slowly via an additional funnel. The mixture was cooled to 4 C. in an ice-bath. The suspension was filtered and the crystals were washed with 20% aqueous EtOH (4 L), water (34 L), 25% aqueous EtOH (4 L), and ether (34 L), then dried to give the title compound (1843 g, 5.20 mol, 58%). Step 2 3-(Cyclopropylmethoxy)-5,5-dimethyl-4-(4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-5H-furan-2-one A 50 L flask was charged with the ester from Step 2 (1843 g, 5.20 mol), acetonitrile (23 L), isopropyltrifluoroacetate (1300 g, 8.33 mol), and DBU (1067 g, 7.01 mol). The solution was heated to reflux for 18 h. The condensor was replaced with a still head, and 10.5 L of solvent was removed over 3 h. The remaining solution was allowed to cool to 30 C., then transferred into 40 L of 0.3 M HCl with vigourous stirring, and seed crystals. The resulting slurry was stirred at room temperature for 18 h, then filtered. The filter cake was washed with 25 L water, 2 L of 50% aqueous ethanol, and 3 L of ether. The solid was air-dried for 1 h, then dried under vacuum overnight to give 1859 g of a white solid (still contains residual water). This material was suspended in 8 L ether, stirred for 26 h, filtered and dried under vacuum to give 1371 g of the title compound. A further 130 g of material was obtained by reprocessing the aqueous acetonitrile and ether filtrate for a total of 1501 g. 1 HNMR (CD 3 COCD 3 ) 0.28 (2H, m), 0.53 (2H, m), 1.17 (1H, m), 1.66 (6H, s), 3.17 (3H, s), 4.16 (2H, d), 8.03 (4H, s).

group in the 1 position either directly or via a bridging group, and also a process for their preparation. The compounds are important for transition metal complexes containing d-8 metals such as Rh, Ru, Pd or Ir. These transition metal complexes are widely used in the hydrogenation of organic double or triple bonds, in particular olefinic double bonds and carbon-heteroatom double bonds. The complexes are particularly suitable for enantioselective hydrogenation using chiral ferrocenyldiphosphines and corresponding prochiral unsaturated compounds. Ferrocenyldiphosphines having a functional group in the 1 position are also important intermediates for ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands and their metal complexes of d-8 metals such as rhodium, ruthenium, palladium or iridium which are bound to inorganic polymeric supports via this functional group. These metal complexes bound to an inorganic or organic support material are likewise very suitable for the hydrogenation of organic double or triple bonds.", "related_docs": [], "pct_data": [],

This Appln. is a 371 of PCT/EP 98/04851 filed Aug. 4, 1998. The present invention relates to a process for preparing mixtures of monoolefinic C 5 mononitriles with nonconjugated CC and CN bonds by catalytic hydrocyanation of a 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixture. There is a great demand throughout the world for ,-alkylenediamines which are important starting materials in the industrial preparation of polyamides (nylons). The ,-alkylenediamines such as hexamethylenediamine are obtained almost exclusively by hydrogenation of the corresponding dinitriles. Virtually all industrial routes for preparing hexamethylenediamine are therefore essentially variants of the preparation of adiponitrile, about 1.0 million tons of which are produced around the world each year. Four routes, which differ in principle, for preparing adiponitrile are described in K. Weissermel, H.-J. Arpe, Industrielle Organische Chemie, 4th edition, VCH Weinheim, pages 266 et seq.: 1. dehydrating amination of adipic acid with ammonia in the liquid or gas phase with intermediate formation of the diamide; 2. indirect hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene via intermediate 1,4-dichlorobutenes; 3. hydrodimerization of acrylonitrile in an electrochemical process, and 4. direct hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene with hydrogen cyanide. In the last-mentioned process, monoaddition in a first stage results in a mixture of isomeric pentenonitriles, which is isomerized in a second stage mainly to 3- and 4-pentenonitriles. In a subsequent third stage, anti-Markownikoff addition of hydrogen cyanide onto 4-pentenonitrile results in adiponitrile. This reaction takes place in the liquid phase in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a temperature in the range 30-150 C. under atmospheric pressure. The catalysts used for this are nickel complexes with phosphine or phosphite ligands and metal salt promoters. Complex phosphine ligands bound to metallocenes for stabilizing the nickel are not described in the abovementioned review. There is a general description of the addition, with heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, of hydrogen cyanide onto olefins in Applied Homogeneous Catalysis with Organometalic Compounds, Vol. 1, VCH Weinheim, pages 465 et seq. The catalysts used for this are, in particular, based on phosphine and phosphite complexes, not bound to metallocenes, of nickel and palladium, which make high product selectivity, improved conversions and reduced reaction times possible. Adiponitrile is prepared by hydrocyanation of butadiene mainly using nickel(0) phosphite catalysts, in the presence or absence of a Lewis acid as promoter. The reaction can generally be divided into three steps: 1. synthesis of mononitriles by hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene; 2. isomerization; 3. synthesis of dinitriles. Formation of the monoadduct results in an isomer mixture composed of 3-pentenonitrile and 2-methyl-3-butenonitrile, and the selectivity for the linear 3-pentenonitrile is about 70% or less, depending on the catalyst used. If this first reaction step is carried out in the absence of Lewis acids, generally there is no second addition of hydrogen cyanide and the resulting product mixture can be subjected to an isomerization using the same catalyst systems as in the first reaction step, but this time in the presence or absence of a Lewis acid such as ZnCl 2 as promoter. In this there is, on the one hand, isomerization of 2-methyl-3-butenonitrile to 3-pentenonitrile and, on the other hand, isomerization of 3-pentenonitrile to the various n-pentenonitriles. This publication mentions that the most thermodynamically stable isomer, 2-pentenonitrile in which the C,N triple bond is conjugated with the C,C double bond, inhibits the reaction because it acts as catalyst poison. The required isomerization to 4-pentenonitrile is made possible only because 3-pentenonitrile is isomerized considerably faster to 4-pentenonitrile than to 2-pentenonitrile. The usual catalysts for the hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene are, in particular, the abovementioned nickel(0) phosphite catalysts with phosphite ligands without complex modification. EP-A-0 274 401 describes a process for the hydrocyanation of pure butadiene using a nickel catalyst having a mixture of phenyl and m,p-tolyl phosphite ligands. C. A. Tolman et al. describe, in Organometallics 3 (1984) 33 et seq., a catalytic hydrocyanation of olefins by nickel(0) phosphite complexes specifically taking account of the effects of Lewis acids on the addition of hydrogen cyanide. In Advances in Catalysis, Volume 33, 1985, Academic Press, Inc., page 1 et seq. there is a review-like description of the homogeneous nickel-catalyzed hydrocyanation of olefins. This deals in particular with mechanistic aspects of the monohydrocyanation of butadiene to isomeric pentenonitriles, of the isomerization of 2-methyl-3-butenonitrile to 3-pentenonitrile and of the second addition of hydrogen cyanide to prepare adiponitrile. The catalysts employed are nickel (0) complexes, preferably with phosphite ligands. Usual phosphines such as triphenylphosphine or 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane have only low catalytic activity, if any, in the hydrocyanation of olefins. WO 95/30680 describes bidentate phosphine chelate ligands in which the phosphine groups are bonded to aryl radicals which are fused by two bridges in ortho positions. In these, the first bridge comprises an O or S atom and the second bridge comprises an O, S or substituted N, Si or C atom. The two phosphine ligands are each located on a different aryl radical in the position ortho to the first bridge. These bidentate phosphine ligands are suitable, in the form of their transition metal complexes, as catalysts for hydroformylation, hydrogenation, polymerization, isomerization, carboxylation, crosscoupling, metathesis and hydrocyanation. J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. (1995) 2177 et seq. describes the effect of the bonding angle of the abovementioned bidentate phosphine ligands on the activity and selectivity in the nickel-catalyzed hydrocyanation of styrene. None of the abovementioned publications describes a process for catalytic hydrocyanation using monodentate or polydentate nickel(0)-phosphorus(III) complexes in which the phosphorus(III) ligands in turn are covalently bonded to one or both of the cyclopentadienyl ligands of a metallocene. EP-A 564 406 and EP-A 612 758 describe ferrocenyldiphosphines as ligands for homogeneous catalysts and the use of these catalysts for enantioselective hydrogenation. In these ligands, two phosphine groups are bonded in the ortho position to the same cyclopentadienyl ligand of the ferrocene, one of them directly to the C 5 ring and the other via a substituted C 1 -alkylene group. The rhodium and iridium complexes with these ligands are suitable as homogeneous enantioselective catalysts for hydrogenation of prochiral compounds with carbon or carbon/heteroatom double bonds. The use of these catalysts for hydrocyanation is not described. Catalysts for asymmetric addition of hydrogen cyanide onto alkenes based on transition metal(0) complexes have been disclosed. Thus, Aust. J. Chem. 35 (1982) 2041 et seq. describes the use of ()-(diop) 2 Pd and ()-(diop) 2 Ni (()-(diop)()-(2S,3S)-(2,3-isopropylidenedioxy-1,4-butanediyl)bis(diphenyl-phosphine)) as catalysts in enantioselective hydrocyanation. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118 (1996) 6325 et seq. describes the relationship of the electronic asymmetry of the ligands to the observed enantioselectivity in asymmetric hydrocyanation using electronically nonsymmetrical bis-3,4-diarylphosphonite ligands based on -D-fructofuranosides. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for hydrocyanation in which the catalysts employed are to show high selectivity and good catalytic activity especially in the hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixtures to prepare mixtures of monoolefinic C 5 -mononitriles with nonconjugated CC and CN bonds and in the first and second addition of hydrogen cyanide to prepare adiponitrile. We have found that this object is achieved by employing catalysts which comprise at least one metallocene-phosphorus(III)-nickel(0) complex. The present invention thus relates to a process for preparing mixtures of monoolefinic C 5 mononitriles with nonconjugated CC and CN bonds by catalytic hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene or a 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixture, wherein the hydrocyanation takes place in the presence of a catalyst which comprises at least one metallocene-phosphorus(III)-nickel(0) complex which comprises at least one monodentate or bidentate metallocene-phosphorus(III) ligand of the formula I where R 1 is a radical of the formula PL 2 where the L radicals can be identical or different and are alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl, R 1 is hydrogen, alkyl or a radical of the formula PL 2 where the L radicals have the abovementioned meaning, R 2 , R 2 , R 3 , R 3 , R 4 , R 4 , R 5 , R 5 are, independently of one another, selected from hydrogen, cycloalkyl, aryl or alkyl, which can be interrupted by an oxygen atom or substituted by a radical of the formula NE 1 E 2 where E 1 and E 2 can be identical or different and are alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl, or in each case two of the substituents R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 and/or R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 in adjacent positions can, together with the part of the cyclopentadienyl ring connecting them, be an aromatic or nonaromatic 5- to 7-membered carbocyclic or heterocyclic system which may have 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms selected from O, N and S, M is Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Os, Rh, Mn, Cr or V, or salts and mixtures thereof. For the purpose of the present invention, the term alkyl comprises straight-chain and branched alkyl groups. These are preferably straight-chain or branched C 1 -C 8 -alkyl, preferably C 1 -C 6 -alkyl, and particularly preferably C 1 -C 4 -alkyl, groups. Examples of alkyl groups are, in particular, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, 2-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, 2-pentyl, 2-methylbutyl, 3-methylbutyl, 1,2-dimethylpropyl, 1,1-dimethylpropyl, 2,2-dimethylpropyl, 1-ethylpropyl, n-hexyl, 2-hexyl, 2-methylpentyl, 3-methylpentyl, 4-methylpentyl, 1,2-dimethylbutyl, 1,3-dimethylbutyl, 2,3-dimethylbutyl, 1,1-dimethylbutyl, 2,2-dimethylbutyl, 3,3-dimethylbutyl, 1,1,2-trimethylpropyl, 1,2,2-trimethylpropyl, 1-ethylbutyl, 2-ethylbutyl, 1-ethyl-2-methylpropyl , n-heptyl, 2-heptyl, 3-heptyl, 2-ethylpentyl, 1-propylbutyl and octyl. The cycloalkyl group is preferably a C 5 -C 7 -cycloalkyl group such as cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl or cycloheptyl. If the cycloalkyl group is substituted, it preferably has 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, in particular 1, 2 or 3, alkyl radicals as substituents. Aryl is preferably phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, mesityl or naphthyl and, in particular, phenyl. Substituted aryl radicals have as substituents for example C 1 -C 8 -alkyl, C 1 -C 8 -alkoxy, halogen, trifluoromethyl, nitro or carboxyl. As a rule, 1, 2 or 3 substituents are preferred. The L radicals in the PL 2 groups are different or, preferably, identical. Examples of suitable L radicals are C 1 -C 12 -alkyl and C 5 -C 12 -cycloalkyl, each of which can be substituted by one, two or three of the following groups: C 1 -C 4 -alkyl, C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy. Further examples of suitable L radicals are aryl which can be substituted by one, two or three of the following groups: C 1 -C 4 -alkyl, C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy, halogen, trifluoromethyl, sulfo, alkylsulfonyl, carboxyl, alkanoyloxy, alkoxycarbonyl, hydroxyl, nitro or cyano. The L radicals are preferably phenyl. If one of the radicals R 2 , R 2 , R 3 , R 3 , R 4 , R 4 , R 5 or R 5 is alkyl interrupted by an oxygen atom in ether linkage, possible examples thereof are 2-methoxyethyl, 2-ethoxyethyl, 2-propoxyethyl, 2-butoxyethyl, 2- or 3-methoxypropyl, 2- or 3-ethoxypropyl, 2- or 3-propoxypropyl, 2- or 3-butoxypropyl, 2- or 4-methoxybutyl, 2- or 4-ethoxybutyl, 2- or 4-butoxybutyl and, preferably, 2-methoxyethyl. If one of the radicals R 2 , R 2 , R 3 , R 3 , R 4 , R 4 , R 5 or R 5 is alkyl substituted by a radical of the formula NE 1 E 2 , possible examples are N,N-dimethylaminomethyl, N,N-dimethylaminoethyl, N,N-diethylaminomethyl, N,N-diethylaminoethyl or N,N-dimethylaminopropyl. If in each case two of the substituents R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 and/or R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 in adjacent positions are, together with the part of the cyclopentadienyl ring connecting them, an aromatic or nonaromatic, 5- to 7-membered carbocyclic or heterocyclic system which additionally has 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms selected from O, N and S, possible examples are indenyl, fluorenyl, azulenyl etc. The two cyclopentadienyl rings in the metallocene-phosphorus(III) ligand of the formula I may be in the eclipsed or staggered conformation with various conformational angles. The planes of the cyclopentadienyl rings may be parallel or inclined toward one another, eg. depending on the central metal. The catalysts employed according to the invention comprise metallocene-phosphorus(III)-nickel(0) complexes having metallocene-phosphorus(III) ligands of the formula I having only one radical of the formula PL 2 , b) bidentate metallocene-phosphorus(III) ligands of the formula I having two radicals of the formula PL 2 where the abovementioned structural circumstances of the ligand of the formula I make two-fold coordination of a transition metal possible, and c) bidentate or polydentate metallocene-phosphorus(III) ligands of the formula I, in which case one ligand coordinates different transition metals by different radicals of the formula PL 2 , it being possible for chain-like metallocene-phosphorus(III)-nickel(0) complexes to result, eg. in a sandwich structure. A zero valency transition metal may moreover coordinate one, two, three or four ligands of the formula I and, where appropriate, further ligands which are described hereinafter. The central metal of the metallocene-phosphorus(III) ligand is preferably Fe. In a suitable embodiment of the process according to the invention, the catalysts employed are those where R 1 is a radical of the formula PL 2 where the L radicals are phenyl, R 1 is hydrogen or a radical of the formula PL 2 where the L radicals are, independently of one another, alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted aryl and, in particular, phenyl, one of the substituents R 2 , R 2 , R 3 , R 3 , R 4 , R 4 , R 5 or R 5 , preferably that in the position to R 1 or R 1 , is hydrogen or alkyl which may be interrupted by an oxygen atom or substituted by a radical of the formula NE 1 E 2 where E 1 and E 2 can be identical or different and are alkyl, and the other substituents R 2 , R 2 , R 3 , R 3 , R 4 , R 4 , R 5 , R 5 are, independently of one another, hydrogen or methyl. R 1 is then preferably hydrogen or a radical of the formula PL 2 where the L radicals are isopropyl, cyclohexyl, trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl or phenyl. The catalysts according to the invention may, in addition to the metallocene-phosphine ligands of the formula I described above, additionally have at least one other ligand which is selected from halides, amines, carboxylates, acetylacetonate, aryl- or alkylsulfonates, hydride, Co, olefins, dienes, cycloolefins, nitrites, N-containing heterocycles, aromatic and heteroaromatic systems, ethers, PF 3 and monodentate, bidentate and polydentate phosphine, phosphinite, phosphonite and phosphite ligands, which is likewise monodentate, bidentate or polydentate and coordinates to the zero valency transition metal. In a suitable embodiment of the process according to the invention, the catalysts employed comprise as metallocene-phosphorus(III) ligand 1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene, 1,1-bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)ferrocene, or 1,1-bis(diisopropylphosphino)ferrocene. In a possible embodiment, the catalyst employed according to the invention comprises a chiral metallocene-phosphine ligand of the formula I so that it is suitable for enantioselective catalysis. Enantioselective catalysis generally entails a compound which is already chiral or prochiral being reacted with use of the catalyst according to the invention, resulting in products with an enantiomeric excess or, preferably, enantiomerically pure products. The catalysts according to the invention can be prepared by reacting at least one metallocene-phosphine ligand of the formula I and nickel powder or a nickel compound or a nickel complex in an inert solvent. Suitable nickel compounds in this connection are, for example, compounds in which the transition metal has an oxidation state higher than 0 and which are reduced in situ in the reaction with the metallocene-phosphorus(III) ligand of the formula I, in the presence or absence of a suitable reducing agent. These include, for example, the halides, preferably the chlorides, the acetates and the acetylacetonates of the abovementioned transition metals. Nickel(0) complexes are preferably prepared using NiCl 2 . Examples of suitable reducing agents are alkali metals such as Na and K, and aluminum, and trialkylaluminum compounds. If complex compounds of the transition metal are employed to prepare the metallocene-phosphorus(III)-nickel(0) complexes, the transition metal preferably has zero valency therein. Complexes with ligands which correspond to the abovementioned additional ligands in the complexes according to the invention are preferably employed for the preparation. In this case, preparation takes place by partial or complete ligand exchange with the metallocene-phosphorus(III) ligands of the formula I described above. In a suitable embodiment of the process according to the invention, the nickel complex is bis(1,5-cyclo-octadiene)nickel(0). Suitable inert solvents for preparing the metallocene-phosphorus(III)-nickel(0) complexes are, for example, aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, chlorobenzene, ethers, preferably diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran, or haloalkanes, for example dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane and trichloroethane. The temperature in this case is in the range from 70 C. to 150 C., preferably from 0 C. to 100 C., particularly preferably at about room temperature. Mixtures of monoolefinic C 5 mononitriles with nonconjugated CC and CN bonds can be prepared by reacting a 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixture in the presence of one of the catalysts described above. This preferably results in mixtures with a high content of linear pentenonitriles. Mixtures of monoolefinic C 5 mononitriles which contain, for example, 3-pentenonitrile and 2-methyl-3-butenonitrile, and which are suitable as intermediates for further processing to adiponitrile, can be prepared by employing pure butadiene or 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixtures. If a hydrocarbon mixture is employed to prepare monoolefinic C 5 mononitriles by the process according to the invention, it preferably has a 1,3-butadiene content of at least 10% by volume, preferably at least 25% by volume, in particular at least 40% by volume. 1,3-Butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixtures are obtainable on the industrial scale. Thus, for example, in petroleum processing the steam cracking of naphtha results in a hydrocarbon mixture which is called the C 4 cut and has a high total olefin content, about 40% comprising 1,3-butadiene and the remainder monoolefins and polyunsaturated hydrocarbons, plus alkanes. These streams always also contain small amounts, in general up to 5%, of alkynes, 1,2-dienes and vinylacetylene. Pure 1,3-butadiene can be isolated, for example, by extractive distillation from industrial hydrocarbon mixtures. C 4 cuts are, where appropriate, essentially freed of alkynes, such as propyne or butyne, of 1,2-dienes such as propadiene, and of alkenynes such as vinylacetylene. Otherwise, in some circumstances the resulting products have a CC double bond in conjugation with the CN bond. It is disclosed in Applied Homogeneous Catalysis with Organometalic Compounds, Vol. 1, VCH Weinheim, page 479, that the conjugated 2-pentenonitrile which results from the isomerization of 2-methyl-3-butenonitrile and 3-pentenonitrile acts as inhibitor of the second addition of hydrogen cyanide to give adiponitrile. It has been found that the abovementioned conjugated nitriles obtained on hydrocyanation of a C 4 cut which has not been pretreated also act as catalyst poisons for the first reaction step in the preparation of adipic acid, the monoaddition of hydrogen cyanide. This is why the components which constitute catalyst poisons in catalytic hydrocyanation, especially alkynes, 1,2-dienes and mixtures thereof, are partly or completely removed where appropriate from the hydrocarbon mixture. To remove these components, the C 4 cut is subjected, for the addition of hydrogen cyanide, to a partial catalytic hydrogenation. This partial hydrogenation takes place in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst which is able to hydrogenate alkynes and 1,2-dienes selectively in the presence of other dienes and monoolefins. Suitable heterogeneous catalyst systems for the selective hydrogenation generally comprise a transition metal compound, eg. on an inert carrier. Suitable inorganic carriers are the oxides usual for this purpose, especially silicas and aluminas, aluminosilicates, zeolites, carbides, nitrides etc. and mixtures thereof. Preferably used as carriers are Al 2 O 3 , SiO 2 and mixtures thereof. The heterogeneous catalysts used are particularly those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,587,369; U.S. Pat. No. 4,704,492 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,493,906 which are incorporated herein by reference. Further suitable Cu-based catalyst systems are marketed by Dow Chemical as KLP catalyst. Addition of hydrogen cyanide onto 1,3-butadiene or a 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixture, eg. a pretreated, partially hydrogenated C 4 cut, can take place continuously, semicontinuously or batchwise. In a suitable variant of the process according to the invention, the addition of hydrogen cyanide takes place continuously. Reactors suitable for the continuous reaction are known to the skilled worker and are described, for example, in Ullmanns Enzyklop{umlaut over (a)}die der technischen Chemie, Vol. 1, 3rd Edition, 1951, page 743 et seq. A cascade of stirred vessels or a tubular reactor is preferably used for the continuous variant of the process according to the invention. In a preferred variant of the process according to the invention, the addition of hydrogen cyanide onto 1,3-butadiene or a 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixture takes place semicontinuously. The semicontinuous process comprises: a) charging a reactor with the hydrocarbon mixture, with or without part of the hydrogen cyanide and a hydrocyanation catalyst according to the invention which has been generated in situ where appropriate, with or without a solvent, b) reacting the mixture at elevated temperature under elevated pressure, with hydrogen cyanide being fed in at the rate of its consumption in the semicontinuous procedure, c) completing the conversion by subsequent reaction, followed by workup. Suitable pressure-resistant reactors are known to the skilled worker and are described, for example, in Ullmanns Enzyklop{umlaut over (a)}die der technischen Chemie, Vol. 1, 3rd Edition, 1951, page 769 et seq. An autoclave is generally used for the process according to the invention and can, if desired, be equipped with a stirring device and an inner lining. Account should preferably be taken of the following for the above steps: Step a): Before starting the reaction, the pressure-resistant reactor is charged with the partially hydrogenated C 4 cut, hydrogen cyanide, a hydrocyanation catalyst and, where appropriate, a solvent. Suitable solvents are those mentioned above for the preparation of the catalysts according to the invention, preferably aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene or tetrahydrofuran. Step b): The mixture is generally reacted at elevated temperature under elevated pressure. The temperature is generally in the range from about 0 to 200 C., preferably about 50 to 150 C. The pressure is generally in the range from about 1 to 200 bar, preferably about 1 to 100 bar, in particular 1 to 50 bar, particularly preferably 1 to 20 bar. Hydrogen cyanide is fed in during the reaction at the rate at which it is consumed, keeping the pressure in the autoclave essentially constant. The reaction time is about 30 minutes to about 5 hours. Step c): To complete the conversion the reaction time can be followed by a period of from 0 minutes to about 5 hours, preferably about 1 hour to 3.5 hours, for subsequent reaction without hydrogen cyanide being fed into the autoclave. The temperature during this period is kept essentially constant at the reaction temperature previously set. Workup takes place by conventional processes and comprises removal of the unreacted 1,3-butadiene and unreacted hydrogen cyanide, eg. by washing or extraction, and distillation of the remaining reaction mixture to remove the required products and recover the still active catalyst. In another suitable variant of the process according to the invention, the addition of hydrogen cyanide onto the 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixture takes place batchwise. The reaction conditions for this are essentially those described for the semicontinuous process but without additional hydrogen cyanide being fed in, but being completely present from the outset, in step b). The preparation of adiponitrile from a butadiene-containing mixture by addition of 2 mole equivalents of hydrogen cyanide can generally be divided into three steps: 1. Preparation of C 5 monoolefin mixtures with nitrile functionality. 2. Isomerization of the 2-methyl-3-butenonitrile present in the mixtures to 3-pentenonitrile and isomerization of 3-pentenonitrile thus formed and present in the mixtures from step 1 to various n-pentenonitriles. This is intended to form a maximum content of 3-pentenonitrile and a minimum content of conjugated 2-pentenonitrile and 2-methyl-2-butenonitrile, which act as catalyst poison. 3. Preparation of adiponitrile by addition of hydrogen cyanide onto the 3-pentenonitrile which was formed in step 2 and which is previously isomerized in situ to 4-pentenonitrile. By-products of this are, for example, 2-methylglutaronitrile from Markownikoff addition of hydrogen cyanide onto 4-pentenonitrile or anti-Markownikoff addition of hydrogen cyanide onto 3-pentenonitrile, and ethylsuccinonitrile from Markownikoff addition of hydrogen cyanide onto 3-pentenonitrile. The catalysts based on metallocene-phosphorus(III) ligands and employed according to the invention are also suitable and advantageous for the positional and double-bond isomerization in step 2 and the second addition of hydrogen cyanide in step 3. In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the invention, the ratio of the amounts of 3-pentenonitrile to 2-methyl-3-butenonitrile obtained in the monoaddition of hydrogen cyanide onto the 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixture is at least 5:1, preferably at least 10:1, in particular at least 20:1. It is therefore generally possible to dispense with division of the process for preparing adiponitrile into the three steps of monoaddition of hydrogen cyanide onto a 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixture; isomerization; addition of hydrogen cyanide onto 4-pentenonitrile formed in situ; and the addition of 2 mole equivalents of hydrogen cyanide onto a 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixture can be designed as a one-stage process. The present invention therefore also relates to a process for preparing adiponitrile which comprises I) catalytic hydrocyanation of a mixture, which has been prepared as previously described, of C 5 mononitriles, where appropriate after further workup or isomerization, or II) catalytic hydrocyanation of a 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixture in a one-stage process, without workup and isomerization of C 5 mononitriles, in the presence of a catalyst of the formula I. Not only do the catalysts employed according to the invention advantageously show high selectivity with regard to the monoaddition products obtained on hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixtures, but they can also be mixed with an excess of hydrogen cyanide for the hydrocyanation with negligible deposition of inactive nickel(II) compounds such as nickel(II) cyanide. In contrast to known hydrocyanation catalysts based on noncomplex phosphine and phosphite ligands, the catalysts of the formula I are thus suitable not only for continuous hydrocyanation processes in which an excess of hydrogen cyanide in the reaction mixture can generally be effectively avoided, but also for semicontinuous processes and batch processes in which, in general, a large excess of hydrogen cyanide is present. The catalysts employed according to the invention, and the hydrocyanation processes based thereon, thus generally display higher catalyst recycling rates and longer catalyst service lives than known processes. This not only improves the economics but is also ecologically advantageous because the nickel cyanide formed from the active catalyst with hydrogen cyanide is highly toxic and must be worked up or disposed of at high cost. Besides hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene-containing hydrocarbon mixtures, the catalysts of the formula I are generally suitable for all conventional hydrocyanation processes. Those which may be particularly mentioned are the hydrocyanation of styrene and of 3-pentenonitrile. The catalysts described above can also be employed for isomerizing 2-methyl-3-butenonitrile to 3-pentenonitrile. Catalysts which comprise chiral metallocene-phosphorus(III) ligands of the formula I are suitable for enantioselective hydrocyanation. The invention is illustrated in detail by the following, non-limiting examples. EXAMPLES Example 1 (according to the invention) Hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene 0.82 g of bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel(0), 3.32 g of 1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene and 10 ml of toluene are mixed together in a glass autoclave at room temperature under argon, the reaction mixture immediately becoming reddish brown. After about 1 hour, a mixture of 16.2 g of 1,3-butadiene and 40 g of toluene is added. The glass autoclave is tightly closed and the mixture is heated to 90 C., an initial pressure of 3.4 bar being set up. The temperature is kept constant at 90 C., and a mixture of 4.0 g of freshly distilled hydrocyanic acid and 30 ml of toluene is metered in continuously, over a period of 80 minutes. The pressure has fallen to 1.4 bar after this. The reaction is then completed by subsequent reaction at 90 C. for 110 minutes. Toluene is used to rinse out the reactor. The progress of the reaction is followed by measuring the pressure and temperature. In a subsequent Volhard cyanide determination, no cyanide is detected, and thus there has been virtually complete conversion of hydrogen cyanide.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention is directed to a process for the preparation of N-acylamino acids of the general Formula I R is hydrogen, a carboxyl group, a (C 1 -C 12 )-alkyl group, which may be saturated, straight chain, branched or cyclic, a (C 2 -C 12 )-alkenyl residue, which may be mono- or polyunsaturated, straight chain, branch chain, or cyclic and a (C 1 -C 8 )-acyloxy group, as well as a (C 5 -C 18 )-aryl residue. R is hydrogen, a saturated straight chain, branch chain or cyclic (C 2 -C 14 )alkenyl residue, a (C 6 -C 18 )-alkyl-(C 5 -C 18 )-aryl residue or a poly-unsaturated (C 2 -C 10 )-alkenyl-(C 5 -C 18 ) residue. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART N-acyl amino acids are important starting materials in the synthesis of peptides as well as intermediates for the preparation of bioactive materials. Furthermore, they find use as detergents, drilling additives and food additives. It is known to produce N-acyl amino acids through the acylation of corresponding amino acids with the occurrence of salt by-products. In the case of non-natural amino acids, the corresponding amino acid must frequently be produced beforehand involving several steps. A one-step process which avoids the disadvantages is the amido carbonylation of aldehydes and amides which is set forth in the following reaction scheme. Amido carbonylation was first described by Wakamatsu, et al., (Chemical Communications 1971, page 1540 and in DE-A2-21 15 985). The carbonylation is carried out in the presence of hydrogen in the molecular ratio of CO: H 2 3:1. As catalyst, there is utilized the cobalt carbonyl complex CO 2 (CO) 8 , which is used in a concentration of 30 mmol of Co-metal per liter of reaction mixture. A further cobalt catalyzed procedure based on amido carbonylation is described in British patent 2,252,770. Therein the synthesis of n-acylamino acids is carried out by reaction of a carboxylic acid amid with an aldehyde and carbon monoxide in the presence of a metal catalyst and an acid as cocatalyst. European Publication EP-B-0 338 330 describes a procedure for the preparation of N-acyl glycine derivatives through the use of a catalyst system comprising a palladium compound and an ionic halide. In DE 195 45 641 and DE 196 29 717, there is described a procedure for the preparation of N-acyl glycine derivatives from carboxylic acid amides and an aldehyde under palladium catalysis. As cocatalyst, there are utilized ionic halides and additionally acid is added. The known procedures to amido carbonylation start with carboxylic acid amides. In many cases however, such carbon acid amides are not available in sufficient amounts to be obtained economically on a production scale so that the high variable costs of the carbon acid amide stand in the way of the technical scale realization of the corresponding procedures. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The purpose of the present invention therefore, is to provide an improved procedure for the production of amino acids through amide carbonylation that permits the reaction to be carried out in a cost effective manner. The object of the present invention is a procedure for the preparation of N-acyl amino acids of Formula I wherein R is hydrogen, carboxyl group, a (C 1 -C 2 )-alkyl group which may be saturated, straight chain, branched or cyclic, a (C 2 -C 12 )-alkenyl residue, which may be mono- or polyunsaturated, straight chain, branch chain, or cyclic and a (C 1 -C 8 )-acyloxy group, as well as a (C 5 -C 18 )-aryl residue, R is hydrogen, a saturated straight chain, branch chain or cyclic (C 2 -C 14 )-alkenyl residue, a (C 6 -C 18 )-alkyl-(C 5 -C 18 )-aryl residue or a poly-unsaturated (C 2 -C 10 )-alkenyl-(C 5 -C 18 ) residue, which is characterized thereby that a nitrile of general Formula II RCN(II), wherein R has the value stated above, is reacted with an aldehyde of general Formula III RCHO(III), in which R has the meaning above in the presence of an acid; carbon monoxide and a metal catalyst. In this way, it is possible, in highly cost efficient ways, to produce the desired compounds of general Formula I. Nitriles form the precursors of the appropriate carboxylic acid amides in virtually every case, whereby their lower price may be achieved. DISCUSSION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In accordance with the present invention any nitrile may be utilized.

Until the present invention, an in situ of preparation of carboxylic acid amides from carboxylic nitriles for purposes amido carbonylation has never been suggested. This, among other things, may be attributed thereto that a selective preparation of carbon acid amides from nitriles under amido carbonylation additions is principally problematic. On the basis of the fact that in amido carbonylation the amount of water set free in the first step led to the expectation that at higher acid concentrations, the not-yet converted carboxylic acid amide would be hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid and thereby a substantial reduction of yield would occur. Furthermore, it would be expected that the amounts of acid necessary for the rapid hydrolysis for the nitrile would lead to an increase in the side reactions between the carbon acid amides and the aldehydes which would negatively affect the level of activity and life span of the metal catalyst.

In preferred embodiments of the invention, the phosphoric acid salt of N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine has the general Formula I wherein n is a number between 0.5 and 1.0, between 0.7 and 0.8, or between 0.75 and 0.78. The process for making the phosphoric acid salt of N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine comprises (a) dissolving the N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine in a first solvent, and (b) reacting the dissolved N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine with crystalline phosphoric acid or phosphoric acid dissolved in a second solvent. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to new phosphoric acid salts of N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine and processes of preparing the same. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Aromatic amines are important intermediate compounds for the synthesis of dyes, antioxidants, and particularly pharmaceuticals. Aromatic 1,2-diamines, in particular, are of great industrial importance for the manufacture of aromatic heterocycles, especially those with two heteronitrogen atoms, such as benzimidazoles. These and the salts thereof are of great interest owing to their pharmacological versatility, although it is known that aromatic amines such as aniline are highly prone to oxidation. This makes it particularly difficult to store these compounds. This property is particularly noticeable with liquid aromatic amines of those dissolved in a liquid. Even in the presence of small traces of oxygen or light, these solutions turn deep black after only a short time. This high oxidation sensitivity of the aromatic amines means that they can only be used in further chemical reactions when freshly purified, usually freshly distilled. The oxidation sensitivity of these substances can be reduced by converting the aromatic amines into their salts. Even the salts, however, are usually still sufficiently prone to oxidation that they have to be stored in the absence of oxygen, for example. Such salts also have a tendency to hygroscopy. The most common salts are the hydrohalides, particularly the hydrochlorides. The phenylenediamines are particularly oxidation-prone. Thus, in the Reports of the German Chemical Society , Volume 25, pages 2841-2842, O. Fischer states that the oily N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine turns dark incredibly quickly and after just a short time becomes totally black even in dark, well-sealed bottles. According to O. Fischer, even the dihydrochloride is a substance which is relatively sensitive to air and light (O. Fischer, loc. cit.). The same is true of other salts of N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine known from the prior art, salts of o-phenylenediamine itself, and other salts of mono-, di- and tri-N-alkylated phenylenediamines. In addition to their high sensitivity to oxidation and light, and in some cases the marked hygroscopy of the hydrohalides of the above-mentioned phenylenediamines, these compounds have other serious disadvantages for use in large-scale industrial processes. Since the salts generally have to be converted into the free base in situ when they are reacted further, the corresponding halohydric acid is formed as a by-product. This is particularly detrimental when the reaction mixture is at a temperature at which hydrohalic acid is produced in gas form. Since these gases are corrosive, highly caustic, and consequently toxic, they have to be carefully removed from the reaction. In some cases this can only be done with considerable technical input, which is accompanied by high costs. However, not only the use but also the preparation of the salts of phenylenediamines with hydrohalic acids involves some problems on the industrial scale. It would be most convenient if the hydrogen halide were supplied in gas form to the corresponding phenylenediamine in order to minimize losses of yield. This is extremely laborious from a technical point of view, however, with the result that the salts have to be formed from the aqueous hydrohalic acids and high losses of yield have to be accepted. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It is an aim of the present invention to minimize the problems known from the prior art connected with the preparation, storage, and use of N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine. A further object of the invention is to convert N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine into a form which is easy to handle, with low sensitivity to oxidation and/or light and/or which is not hygroscopic and is easy to store, such that the free bases are rapidly available for subsequent reactions. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Surprisingly, it has been found that the salt of N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine and phosphoric acid does not have the disadvantages and consequent problems known from the prior art for other salts of this kind or has them only to a significantly reduced extent. Thus, the present invention solves the problem by converting N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine into a phosphoric acid salt according to Formula I wherein n is a number between 0.5 and 1.0. The term phosphoric acid salt denotes all salts of N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine with ortho-phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4 ). The ratio of one molecule of H 3 PO 4 to one molecule of N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine according to Formula I is described as a statistical mean by the factor n. A salt as described above wherein n is from 0.7 to 0.8 is preferred; most preferably, n equals 0.75 to 0.78. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the phosphoric acid salts of N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine according to the invention are anhydrous or contain only slight traces of water. The water content of the salt is generally between 1.0 and 1.5% by weight. The advantages of the phosphoric acid salts of N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine according to the invention consist on the one hand in its resistance to oxidation, insensitivity to light, and non-hygroscopic characteristics. As a result, it is easily stored without any major expense and can be used in further reactions without additional measures, with the optional exception of conversion into the free base. Moreover, it is surprisingly easy to manufacture on a large scale since the phosphoric acid used can be added in the form of crystals. Furthermore, when the phosphoric acid salt itself is further used at elevated temperatures, no caustic or corrosive gases are produced under the reaction conditions. According to another aspect of the invention, the present invention relates to the industrial-scale manufacture of the N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine-phosphoric acid salt described above. The salt is easily obtainable in high yields by dissolving N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine in a water- or alcohol-miscible solvent such as a C 1 - to C 5 -alcohol, preferably ethanol, propanol, or isopropanol. This mixture is reacted with crystalline phosphoric acid or a phosphoric acid solution in amounts of from 75-100 mol %. The phosphoric acid may be dissolved or suspended in water, a C 1 - to C 5 -alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, or mixtures thereof. Preferably, ethanol, propanol, or isopropanol are used as the solvents. The N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine-phosphoric acid salts are either precipitated from the solvent or may optionally be precipitated by the addition of non-polar solvents such as aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons or ethers. In a preferred process, anhydrous phosphoric acid is used. An alternative embodiment of the invention relates to processes in which N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine is prepared in situ by reduction of the o-nitro-N-methylaniline. The reduction of the o-nitro-N-methylaniline may be carried out using methods known from the prior art. The preferred reducing agent is hydrogen, using a hydrogenation catalyst in an alcohol as solvent, preferably ethanol, propanol, or isopropanol. After the catalyst has been removed, the resulting solution can be reacted with phosphoric acid or a phosphoric acid solution. Preferably, a suspension of crystalline, anhydrous phosphoric acid in the alcohol used for hydrogenation is used. EXAMPLE 1 A mixture of 190 kg of o-nitro-N-methylaniline, 0.95 kg of palladium/charcoal catalyst (10% Pd) and 570 L of ethanol is hydrogenated in a 1200 L-VA-Hydrogenator at 60 - max. of 85 C. under a hydrogen pressure of 2-6 bar until the uptake of hydrogen has stopped. 99 kg of crystalline phosphoric acid and 238 L of ethanol are placed in another 1200 L apparatus and the contents of hydrogenation apparatus are allowed to flow into it, with stirring, while the catalyst is filtered off. The filter and the filtered catalyst are washed with 95 L of ethanol, cooled to 10-20 C., and stirred for a further 30-60 minutes.

The developer for the printing photosensitive material contains chlorine ion in an amount of preferably 3.010 2 to 1.510 1 mol/l, particularly preferably 3.510 2 to 1.010 1 mol/l. When the chlorine ion concentration is higher than the range of 1.510 1 mol/l to 1.010 1 mol/l, the development is retarded unfavorably. This is against the object of the present invention, i.e. to rapidly attain a high maximum density. When it is below 3.010 2 mol/l, the fogging cannot be inhibited.

The amount of the color-developer replenisher is preferably not more than 550 ml, more preferably not more than 450 ml and most preferably in the range of 80 to 400 ml, per square meter of a photographic sensitive material. The amount of this replenisher can be reduced to less than 300 ml by reducing the bromide ion concentration in the replenisher or by using a bromide ion-free replenisher. For processing a photosensitive material for prints, the amount of this replenisher is 20 to 600 ml, preferably 30 to 200 ml, and more preferably 40 to 100 ml, per square meter of the photosensitive material.

Preferably, the developer for the photographic material for prints is substantially free from benzyl alcohol. It is also preferred that the developer for the photographic material for prints is substantially free of sulfite ion so as to inhibit a change in the photographic properties due to the continuous process and also to obtain the effect of the present invention.

Most preferably, the developer is completely free of hydroxylamine. It is preferred to inhibit the evaporation of the developer and oxidation thereof by air. The contact area of the processing liquid with air in the processing vessel can be represented by the opening rate defined as follows: Opening rate(contact area of processing solution with air (cm 2 )/volume of processing solution (cm 3 ) The opening rate (cm 1 ) defined as above is preferably not higher than 0.05, more preferably in the range of 0.0005 to 0.01. The opening rate is reduced by covering the surface of the photographic processing solution in the processing vessel with a floating lid or the like, by providing a movable lid as described in J.P.

It is particularly preferred to use liquid paraffin, an organosiloxane or the like. The opening rate can be reduced not only in the color development and black-and-white development steps but also in all of the subsequent steps such as bleaching, bleach-fixing, fixing, water washing and stabilization steps. The developer can be reused after regeneration. The term regeneration of the developer herein indicates that the used developer is treated with an anion exchange resin or by electrodialysis and that the activity of the developer is increased by adding a processing agent called regenerating agent. The regeneration rate (rate of the overflow in the replenisher) is preferably at least 70%, particularly at least 90%. The 4-(N,N-dialkylamino)aniline compounds can be synthesized by a method shown below or a method similar to it. A method described on page 3,100 of Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 73 (1951) can be referred to. According to the above reaction scheme, a compound (3) is obtained by the substitution reaction of a halobenzene compound (1) with an amino compound (2). Then, the azo coupling is conducted in the p-position to the amino group, or a nitroso group or nitro group is introduced thereinto, and the product is reduced (by catalytic reduction with hydrogen, reduction with zinc under acidic condition, reduction with reducing iron, or the like) to obtain the intended product. The substitution reaction can be carried out also by replacing the above-described amino compound having R 1 with a corresponding R 1 -free primary amine compound and introducing R 1 after the substitution reaction. The substitution reaction is carried out by using, for example, one equivalent of a fluorobenzene compound, chlorobenzene compound, bromobenzene compound or iodobenzene compound as the halobenzene compound (1) and one to five equivalents, preferably one to three equivalents, of the amino compound (2) in the absence of any base or in the presence of one to five equivalents, preferably one to three equivalents, of an organic base (such as triethylamine or diazabicycloundecene) or an inorganic base (such as sodium hydrogencarbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide); without using any solvent or in a solvent such as water, an amide solvent (such as N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone), a sulfone solvent (such as sulfolane), a sulfoxide solvent (such as dimethyl sulfoxide), an ureido solvent (such as tetramethylurea), an ether solvent (such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane) or an alcohol solvent (such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, butanol or ethylene glycol) alone or in combination of two or more of them; in the absence or presence of a catalyst such as copper (I) iodide, tetra kistriphenylphosphine palladium (0) or palladium chloride alone or in combination of two or more of them; at a reaction temperature in the range of 0 to 200 C., preferably 25 to 18 C.; for a reaction time in the range of 10 minutes to 72 hours, preferably 30 minutes to 12 hours. Then the azo coupling at the p-position to the amino group is conducted, or a nitroso group or nitro group is introduced thereinto. An embodiment of the azo coupling is as follows: A substituted or unsubstituted aniline is converted into a diazonium salt thereof with an acid (organic or inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid or acetic acid) without using any solvent or in water or an organic solvent (such as an alcohol solvent, e.g. methanol, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, an amide solvent, e.g. N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, a sulfone solvent, e.g. sulfolane, a sulfoxide solvent, e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide, or a ureido solvent, e.g. tetramethylurea) at a temperature in the range of 78 to 40 C., preferably 20 to 30 C. for a reaction time in the range of five minutes to five hours, preferably five minutes to one hour; and then one to five equivalents, preferably one to two equivalents, of the diazonium salt is coupled with an N,N-dialkylaniline without using any solvent or in water or an organic solvent (such as an alcohol solvent, e.g. methanol, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, an amide solvent, e.g. N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, a sulfone solvent, e.g. sulfolane, a sulfoxide solvent, e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide, or a ureido solvent, e.g. tetramethylurea) at a temperature in the range of 78 to 40 C. preferably 20 to 30 C. for a reaction time in the range of five minutes to five hours, preferably five minutes to one hour. The coupling reaction is preferably conducted under a weakly acidic to weakly basic condition.

It is also preferred to use a halobenzene (8) having a nitro group in the 4-position to directly obtain a corresponding 4-aminonitrobenzene (7). Finally, the product is reduced by the catalytic reduction with hydrogen, reduction with zinc under an acidic condition or reduction with reduced iron to obtain the intended product. The catalytic reduction with hydrogen is conducted, for example, in the presence of a catalyst (such as palladium-carbon or Raney nickel) without using any solvent or in water or an organic solvent (such as an alcohol, e.g. methanol, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, an amide, e.g. N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, a sulfone, e.g. sulfolane, a sulfoxide, e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide, or a ureido, e.g. tetramethylurea) at a reaction temperature in the range of 0 to 150 C., preferably 0 to 50 C., under a hydrogen pressure in the range of 1 to 500 atm, preferably 1 to 200 atm. for a reaction time in the range of 5 minutes to 72 hours, preferably 1 to 8 hours.

The reduction with zinc under an acidic condition is conducted by using 3 to 10 equivalents, preferably 3 to 6 equivalents, of zinc powder in the presence of an acid (an organic acid such as acetic acid or methanesulfonic acid, or an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid) without using any solvent or in water or an organic solvent (such as an alcohol, e.g. methanol, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, an organic acid, e.g. acetic acid, an amide, e.g. N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, a sulfone, e.g. sulfolane, a sulfoxide, e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide, a ureido, e.g. tetramethylurea, or an organic acid such as acetic acid, propionic acid or methanesulfonic acid) at a reaction temperature in the range of 0 to 150 C., preferably 0 to 100 C., for a reaction time in the range of 5 minutes to 72 hours, preferably 30 minutes to 3 hours. The compound (3) can be obtained by, for example, the alkylation of an aniline compound as described above. In particular, a saccharide group derivative (10) is introduced into a secondary aniline (9); or the saccharide group derivative (10) is introduced into a primary aniline (12), then R 1 is introduced thereinto and, if necessary, it is converted into the saccharide group in the course of the introduction or finally. The alkylation is conducted, for example, by using 1 to 5 equivalents, preferably 1 to 3 equivalents, per equivalent of the alkyl group to be introduced, of a corresponding alkyl halide (such as chloride, bromide or iodide), an alkyl sulfonate (such as mesylate or tosylate) or an alkyl ester (such as acetate or benzoate) as the alkylating agent and 1 to 5 equivalents, preferably 1 to 3 equivalents, per equivalent of the alkyl group to be introduced, of an organic base (such as triethylamine or diazabicycloundecene) or an inorganic base (such as sodium hydrogencarbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide) without using any solvent or in a solvent such as water, an amide (e.g. N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone), a sulfone (e.g. sulfolane), a sulfoxide (e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide), a ureido (e.g. tetramethylurea), an ether (e.g. dioxane) or an alcohol (e.g. isopropyl alcohol or butanol) in the absence or presence of a catalyst (such as sodium iodide) at a reaction temperature in the range of 0 to 200 C., preferably 30 to 170 C., for a reaction time in the range of 10 minutes to 72 hours, preferably 30 minutes to 12 hours. The products obtained by the above-described reactions are after-treated as in ordinary organic synthesis reactions and then purified if necessary.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel compounds useful in the field of perfumery. It concerns more particularly the compounds of formula wherein the acetyl substituting group is either in position 2 or in position 3 of the ring, or any mixture of compounds of formula (I). Any further reference to a compound of formula (I) in the present application will designate either one or the other structural isomer or a mixture of both. The compounds (I) possess odor properties which are very useful and appreciated. Therefore, they can be used for the preparation of perfumes, perfuming compositions and perfumed articles. These compounds can namely confer odor effects of the natural leather type. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The compounds according to the present invention are novel. The use in the field of perfumery of compounds having a structure close to that of the compounds (I) is known in the prior art. One can cite the patents U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,677 and EP 743 297 which disclose such compounds and discuss their odor properties. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Surprisingly, we have now been able to establish that the compounds of formula (I) have a fragrance of a totally original character compared with the odor of known compounds. In fact, the odor of the compounds (I) constitutes an ensemble of woody, powdery-violet, ambergris, slightly marine seaweed type notes, accompanied with a very natural and really unexpected leather type connotation, reminiscent of the odor of fresh Suede leather. This last connotation really distinguishes the compounds of the present invention from the products of similar structure which are described in the prior art, thus conferring to said compounds a great value for their use in perfumery. The compounds according to the present invention thus make it possible to confer, improve, enhance or modify the odor of consumer products, as well as perfuming bases or concentrates. In other words, they can impart to the latter their characteristic odor, as the case may be modifying and/or improving the original odor properties of the products and compositions in which they are incorporated. These products thus become more appealing to the consumer and have an enhanced odor impact. The compounds of the invention can be used in fine perfumery, namely in perfumes, colognes, or after-shave lotions, as well as in other current uses in perfumery, namely to perfume soaps, shower or bath gels, hygiene or hair care products such as shampoos and also body or ambient air deodorants and cosmetic preparations. The compounds (I) can also be used in applications such as liquid or solid detergents for textile treatment, fabric softeners, or yet detergent compositions or cleaning products for dishes or varied surfaces. In these applications, said compounds (I) can be used alone as well as mixed with other perfuming ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in perfumery. The nature and variety of these coingredients do not require a more detailed description here, which would not be exhaustive anyway. In fact, a person skilled in the art, having a general knowledge, is able to choose them according to the nature of the product that has to be perfumed and the olfactory effect sought. These perfuming coingredients belong to varied chemical groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, nitrites, terpenic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic nitrogen- or sulfur-containing compounds, as well as natural or synthetic essential oils. Many of these ingredients are listed in reference texts such as S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969, Montclair, N.J., USA, or more recent versions thereof, or in other similar books. The proportions in which the compounds according to the invention can be incorporated in the different products mentioned above vary in a broad range of values. These values depend on the nature of the product that has to be perfumed and on the olfactory effect sought, as well as on the nature of the coingredients in a given composition when the compounds of the invention are used in admixture with perfuming coingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in the art. For instance, concentrations from 5 to 10% by weight, or even 20% by weight, of the compounds of the invention, relative to the weight of the perfuming composition in which they are incorporated, can be used. Much lower concentrations than these can typically be used when these compounds are directly applied for perfuming some of the consumer products mentioned above. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the compounds of formula (I). According to the process of the invention, an alcohol of formula is subjected to a Diels Alder type reaction in the presence of a methylvinyl ketone, and this reaction is followed by dehydration and cyclisation. These three steps are effected in a one pot cascade reaction. The alcohol of formula (II) is a novel compound and constitutes another object of the present invention. The latter can be obtained by a Grignard type reaction, starting from epoxymyrcene. The whole synthesis can be described as follows: The reaction conditions are described in more detail in an example presented hereafter. The invention will now be described in greater detail in the following examples, wherein the temperatures are indicated in degrees centigrade and the abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of 1-(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydro-7,8,8-trimethyl-2-naphtalenyl)-1-ethanone a) 1230 ml of a solution of CH 3 MgCl 3M in tetrahydrofurane (Fluka) was added to 26.5 g of CuBr (Fluka) in 11 of diisopropylether with stirring at 0 (bath temperature). After one night, the reaction mixture was cooled to 20 and 467 g of epoxymyrcene 2-(3,4-epoxy-4-methylpentyl)-1,3-butadiene in 4 l of isopropylether were added dropwise. After the addition, the reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature. After 23 h the reaction was completed. After hydrolysis with a 15% NH 4 Cl-solution and washing with brine, the product was distilled to obtain 96.6% pure 2,3-dimethyl-6-methylene-7-octen-2-ol with a yield of 453.7 g (88%).

The exothermic reaction increased the temperature of the reaction medium from 23 to 33. The latter was then heated to 40. After 22 h, the Diels-Alder type reaction was completed. Again some BF 3 .ethylether was added; the reaction mixture became brown, and then dark brown after 45 h. The reaction mixture was washed with a 10% NaOH solution and brine, and then distilled to provide the desired product in the form of a mixture of compounds comprising 1-(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydro-7,8,8-trimethyl-2-naphtalenyl)-1-ethanone (2 diastereomers) and 1-(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydro-5,5,6-trimethyl-2-naphtalenyl)-1-ethanone.
