BACKGROUND ART Recently, studies have been actively made for applications of closed vesicles such as liposome, emulsion, and lipid microsphere as drug carriers have been activity made for drug delivery system (hereinafter referred to as DDS). These closed vesicles are usually prepared using phospholipids or their derivatives, sterols, or lipids except phospholipids as basic membrane-constituting materials. However, the closed vesicles composed of only these basic materials could not overcome various problems occurring in the practical use, such as mutual aggregation of closed vesicles and shortened retention time in circulation. Furthermore, it was practically difficult for them to drive drugs to their target sites. In order to improve a drug-loading and cell binding ability of the closed vesicles, an attempt has been made to charge the surface of the closed vesicles to cationic at physiological pH range by charging a small amount of a cationic lipid such as stearylamine. In particular, cationic liposomes containing DNA are well known to promote transfer of the DNA into cells, that is, transfection, and those liposomes having higher introduction efficiency, higher expression level, and higher safety level are strongly required. But, there are limited kinds of lipid available to use for cationic liposome, then it has been desired to develop cationic lipids usable for a drug carrier that are highly safe and exhibit high performance. Such cationic lipids have been reported so far in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,897,355, 5,334,761, JP-A 2-292246, and JP-A 4-108391. However, their effects are not satisfactory. Therefore, it has been eagerly desired to develop a drug carrier that can transfect a DNA into cells efficiently and safely. And regarding other purpose in addition to the transfection of a DNA, the effective and safety carriers are also required for effective DDS therein to enable accurate, efficient, and safe targeting of a drug to such as injured sites in vascular endothelium and affected sites caused by nephritis, kidney cancer, pneumonia, lung cancer, hepatitis, hepatoma, pancreatic cancer, lymphoma, etc. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION An objective of the present invention is to provide a drug carrier that enables transfection of nucleic acids, polynucleotides, genes, and their analogues into cells efficiently and safely, and to provide a cationic lipid capable of forming such drug carrier. Another objective of the present invention is to provide a drug carrier that effectively delivers a desired drug, peptide, or protein to target sites, and to provide a cationic lipid capable of forming such drug carrier. The above objectives are achieved by the present invention as described below.

The compounds of the present invention represented by the formula 1 are all novel. An example of their synthetic process is shown below. However, the present invention is not construed to be limited thereto. For example, the compounds can be produced by introducing thiourea to the moiety of Z of the compound represented by the following formula 2 when Z is a halogen atom or by converting Z to an amidino group when Z is CN. In the formula 2, A is an aromatic ring, R 1 and R 2 are the same or different and independently represent an alkyl group having 10 to 25 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group having 10 to 25 carbon atoms, X and Y are the same or different and independently represent O, S, COO, OCO, CONH, or NHCO, and n is 0 or a natural number of 1 to 6. Z is a halogen atom or CN. The thus-produced amidine derivatives represented by the formula 1 can be isolated and recovered by per se known separation and purification methods (for example, chromatography and recrystallization). The carrier of the present invention preferably has a particle diameter of 0.02 to 250 m, more preferably 0.05 to 0.4 m. Its structure can take various forms and does not have to be limited. The carrier is most preferably formed by at least one of macromolecules, fine aggregates, fine particles, microspheres, nanospheres, liposomes, and emulsions, which can potentially function to load drugs in a high concentration. In the present invention, compositions of the drug carrier are not particularly limited as long as they can take the above-described forms. In view of safety, in vivo stability, the compositions preferably contain phospholipids, their derivatives, lipids other than phospholipids, their derivatives, a stabilizer, an antioxidant, and some other surface modifier. Examples of phospholipids are natural or synthetic phospholipids including phosphatidylcholine (lecithin), phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, sphingomyelin, cardiolipin, and their hydrogenated products obtained by usual methods. Examples of the stabilizers include sterols, such as cholesterol, which reduce membrane fluidity, glycerol, or saccharides such as sucrose. The antioxidants include tocopherol homologues, namely vitamin E. There are four tocopherol isomers, , , , and . Any of them can be used in the present invention. The other surface modifiers include derivatives of hydrophilic polymers and water-soluble polysaccharides such as glucuronic acid, sialic acid, and dextran. Examples of the hydrophilic polymers include polyethylene glycol, dextran, pullulan, Ficoll, polyvinyl alcohol, styrene-maleic anhydride alternating copolymer, divinyl ether-maleic anhydride alternating copolymer, synthetic polyamino acid, amylose, amylopectin, chitosan, mannan, cyclodextrin, pectin, and carrageenan. Among them, polyethylene glycol remarkably prolongs residency in blood. The hydrophilic Polymers can form derivatives by combining with hydrophobic compounds such as long-chain aliphatic alcohols, sterols, polyoxypropylene alkyls, and glycerol fatty acid esters. Hydrophobic compound moieties of the derivatives can be stably inserted into membranes of drug carriers (for example, liposome). Thus, hydrophilic polymers can be allowed to exist on the surface of the drug carrier. Such a hydrophilic polymer derivative that can be specifically used in the present invention is exemplified by polyethylene glycol-phosphatidylethanolamine and the like. The drugs to be enclosed in the drug carriers can be pharmacologically active compounds, physiologically active compounds, or diagnostic substances, which are pharmaceutically acceptable, depending on the diagnostic and/or therapeutic purpose. Basically the properties of the drug to be loaded are not limited to any particular substances, electrically neutral or anionic substances can be loaded in good efficiency because the surface of the carrier has characteristically the positive charge. The kind of the therapeutic drug to be entrapped is not particularly limited as long as it does not affect the formation of the drug carrier. Specific examples of the drug include nucleic acids, polynucleotides, genes and their analogues, an antiinflammatory agent, a steroid agent, an anticancer agent, an enzyme agent, an enzyme inhibitor, an antibiotic, an antioxidant, a lipid-intake inhibitor, a hormone agent, an angiotensinase inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor antagonist, an inhibitor of proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells, a platelet-aggregation inhibitor, an inhibitor of releasing a chemical mediator, an enhancer or inhibitor of proliferation of vascular endothelial cells, an aldose reductase inhibitor, a mesangial cell-proliferation inhibitor, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, an immunosuppressant, an immunpotentiator, an antiviral agent, or a radical scavenger, proteins, peptides and the like. The kind of the diagnostic drug to be entrapped is not particularly limited as long as it does not affect the formation of the drug carrier. Specifically, such drugs includes X ray contrast mediums, radioisotopically labeled nuclear medical diagnostic agents, and agents for diagnosis by nuclear magnetic resonance. The drug carriers of the present invention can be readily obtained by any suitable method in the art. An example thereof is described below. The amidine derivative represented by the formula 1, phospholipid, and the other components are mixed in an organic solvent such as chloroform in a flask. After the organic solvent is removed by evaporation, the residue is dried under vacuum to form a thin film on the inner wall of the flask. A drug is added to the flask and vigorously stirred to obtain a liposome suspension. The resulting liposome suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant containing the drug that has not been loaded is removed by decantation. Thus, the drug carrier suspension can be obtained. Alternatively, the drug carrier can be obtained by discharging the mixture of the above-described components under high pressure with a high-pressure discharging emulsifier.

Three M of an amidine derivative, 21 M of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), and 6 M of cholesterol were weighed and put into a 10-ml round bottom flask and completely dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform. Chloroform was removed by evaporation with an evaporator under reduced pressure to form a thin lipid film on the inner wall of the flask. One ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.5 M of calcein was added to the flask and stirred by vigorous shaking to obtain a suspension of calcein-entrapping liposomes (MLV). (Test Example 1) Measurement of Calcein Entrapping Ratio The ratio of entrapping calcein in liposomes was determined as follows. Forty l of a 50-fold diluted liposome suspension was added to 2.0 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer. Fluorescent intensity of the mixture was measured (exitation wavelength: 490 nm, fluorescent wavelength: 530 nm). The fluorescent intensity measured at this time is referred to as Ft. Twenty l of a 10 mM CoCl 2 solution was added to the mixture and calcein that was not entrapped into the liposomes was allowed to quench. The fluorescence of calcein entrapped in the liposome was measured. The fluorescent intensity measured at this time is referred to as Fin. Twenty l of a 20% Triton X-100 solution was added thereto to destroy the liposomes and bind calcein to Co 2 for quenching. The fluorescent intensity measured at this time is referred to as Fq. The retention efficiency of the liposome was calculated by the following equation. Retention efficiency (%)( FinFqr )/( FtFqr )100 In the formula, r is a value by calibrating volume changes of the reaction mixture brought about by adding the liposome suspensions and the drug. In this example, r (2.00.040.020.02)/2.01.04. The results are shown in Table 1.

Ten M of an amidine derivative, 20 M of dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), and 20 M of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) were weighed and dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform to obtain chloroform solution A. Twenty l of the chloroform solution A was put into a 10-ml round bottom flask and 1 ml of chloroform was added. The solvent chloroform was removed with a rotary evaporator to form a lipid thin film on the inner wall of the flask. The film was hydrated by vigorously mixing in 1 ml of steile water containing 20 m of plasmid pcDNA/Amp (manufactured by Invitrogen) in which a -galactosidase gene was incorporated to produce DNA-entrapping liposomes. (Test Example 2) Preparation of Cells and Transfection Cells: Cos-1 cells (ATCC No. CRL-1650) purchased from Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. were subcultured in an Iscoves modified Dulbeccos medium (IMDM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in an incubator under 5% CO 2 and 95% O 2 at 37 C. Transfection: The Cos-1 cells were cultured after inoculated at a density of about 2 10 4 cells per each well of a 6-well multi-well plate supplemented with 1 ml of the IMDM containing 10% FCS. After about 24-hour of incubation, the medium was replaced with a fresh medium free from FCS and the liposome suspension containing 0.2 g of DNA was added thereto. After 16-hour of transfection, the medium was replaced with a fresh IMDM containing 10% FCS and the cell were further incubated 48 hours. The cells were then fixed with formaldehyde, and then 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl--galactopyranoside (X-gal) which is a substrate of -galactosidase was added to identify the cells that expressed -galactosidase. To determine the percentage of transfected cells, the stained cells were image analyzed. The results are shown in Table 2.

(EXAMPLE 8) Rhodamine-labeled liposomes containing the amidine derivative synthesized in Example 1 as a membrane component were prepared in the following manner. A chloroform solution of lipid consisting of soybean lecithin/cholesterol/amidine derivative (total lipid content: 120 mM, 7/2/1 (molar ratio)) was added to a round bottom flask. The solution was evaporated to dryness with a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure and dried overnight at room temperature under vacuum to form a lipid thin film on the inner wall of the flask. The film was hydrated by vortexing in a vortex mixer at 65 C. in physiological saline (4 ml) to form liposome suspension. The particle size of the suspension was adjusted by filtering the suspension through a polycarbonate film. An ethanol solution of rhodamine-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine (Avanti) was added to the suspension and allowed to stand at 37 C. for 30 minutes. The mixture was then fully dialyzed against physiological saline using a cellulosic dialysis membrane at 4 C. (Test Example 3) Accumulation test Using Experimental Nephritis Animal Model. SD rats (5-week-old, male) was previously bleeded for a week and anti-Thy1.1 antibody (OX7, Serotec) was administered to the caudal vein to induce nephritis. In three to four days after the administration of the antibody, a protein content in urine accumulated for one day was measured to confirm onset of nephritis. The rhodamine-labeled amidine liposomes (the total lipid content of 10 mg/ml of physiological saline) were administered to the caudal vein in a dose of 1 ml/kg. One, six, and twenty-four hours after the administration, the rats were sacrificed by removing blood. Systemic perfusion was performed with heparinized physiological saline, then, liver, spleen, and kidney were excised. Tissue homogenate for each organ was prepared. Rhodamine pigment was extracted from the tissue homogenate with chloroform to determine the concentration of the liposomes in the tissue. The results are shown in Table 3. As shown in Table 3, the liposomes containing the amidine derivative of the present invention as a membrane component rapidly disappeared in the liver and the spleen of the nephritis induced rats, while the liposomes were outstandingly accumulated in the kidney and the accumulation was continued for 24 hours or longer.

The compounds are bis(3,4-methylenedioxyphenylamino) derivatives represented by general formula (1): wherein Ar 1 and Ar 2 each is an optionally substituted aryl group and Ar 3 is a phenylene group or an optionally substituted biphenylene group. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel bis(3,4-methylenedioxyphenylamino) derivatives represented by the following general formula (1) and an electrophotographic photoreceptor containing one or more of the derivatives: wherein Ar 1 and Ar 2 may be the same or different and each represents an optionally substituted aryl group; and Ar 3 represents a divalent aromatic group represented by wherein R 1 and R 2 each represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group, provided that when Ar 3 is a phenylene group, one of the amino substituents is meta or para to the other. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Recently, printers as terminal recording apparatuses in the field of information communications are being strongly required more and more to be of smaller size and capable of higher-rate printing and color printing. Because of this, electrophotographic photoreceptors for use in electrophotographic laser beam printers or LED printers have come to be required to be of even smaller size and capable of coping with a higher printing rate. In order to obtain such an excellent electrophotographic photoreceptor, it is, of course, necessary to employ a charge-generating substance and a charge-transporting substance each having satisfactory properties. Besides this, it is also important that the injection of charge carriers from the charge-generating substance into the charge-transporting substance, i.e., the injection of charges from a charge-generating layer into a charge-transporting layer, should be efficiently conducted. Since this charge injection depends on the properties of the interface between the charge-generating substance (or charge-generating layer) and the charge-transporting substance (or charge-transporting layer) and varies with combinations of various substances, charge-transporting substances having a variety of properties are being developed. N,N-Diphenyl-N,N-bis(3-methylphenyl)-4,4-biphenylenediamine (4) is already known to effectively function as a charge-transporting material (see JP-B-58-32372 (the term JP-B as used herein means an examined Japanese patent publication) and U.S. Pat. No. 3,265,496). Several diaminobiphenyl compounds also are known as charge-transporting materials (see JP-B-63-6864, JP-B-5-40904, Japanese Patent 2,539,641, EP 0648737 A1, JP-A-6-199745 (the term JP-A as used herein means an unexamined published Japanese patent application), JP-A-6-293716, JP-A-7-188130, JP-A-7-181693, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,453). Electrophotographic photoreceptors are known which employ a mixture of a diaminobiphenyl compound having two or more alkoxy groups on the same aromatic ring and other charge-transporting material(s) (see JP-A-7-225486, JP-A-6-342215, JP-A-6-342220, JP-A-6-342218, JP-A-6-342217, JP-A-6-342216, JP-A-5-341545, and JP-A-5-341544). Combinations of a diaminobiphenyl compound and a binder polymer are known (see JP-A-7-120941, JP-A-6-214412, and JP-A-6-130685). Also known are combinations of a diaminobiphenyl compound and a charge-generating material (see JP-A-6-75408, JP-A-6-161132, JP-A-6-75403, JP-A-5-257310, JP-A-5-188615, JP-A-5-281769, and JP-A-5-257309). Applications of m-diaminobenzene derivatives to materials for electrophotographic photoreceptors are described, e.g., in JP-A-1-142642 and JP-A-5-88389. An m-diaminobenzene derivative having a fluoroalkyl group bonded to the central benzene ring is described in JP-A-7-126224, and an electrophotographic photoreceptor employing this derivative is described in JP-A-1-128880. JP-A-3-105347 discloses an m-diaminobenzene derivative having a thiocarbonyl group. An m-diaminobenzene derivative having a methoxy group and a phenyl group bonded as substituents to the central phenyl group is described in JP-A-2-93653, and an electrophotographic photoreceptor employing this derivative is described in JP-A-2-93654. In JP-A-5-58966 and JP-A-5-301848 are disclosed m-diaminobenzene derivatives in which one of the amino groups is substituted with a pyrene ring. JP-A-4-300853 discloses a diaminobenzene derivative having an olefin substituent and an electrophotographic photoreceptor employing this derivative. Furthermore, an electrophotographic photoreceptor employing a diaminobenzene compound having three or four amino substituents in the molecule is disclosed in JP-A-3-94258 and JP-A-3-94259. As described above, electrophotographic photoreceptors employing a compound selected from many diaminobiphenyl or diaminobenzene compounds have been proposed. However, these compounds have drawbacks that they are apt to separate out as crystals because of their insufficient solubility, have poor miscibility with binder polymers, and are insufficiently compatible with phthalocyanines suitable for use as charge-generating materials. Consequently, there have been cases where the prior art electrophotographic photoreceptors have insufficient photosensitivity or have a high residual potential to cause scumming. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide novel charge-transporting materials having a high carrier mobility and high sensitivity which have satisfactory miscibility with binder polymers, are capable of forming a thin stable organic film having a high concentration, and give an electrophotographic photoreceptor having various excellent properties. Under the circumstances described above, the present inventors synthesized various compounds and made intensive investigations thereon in order to find out both a charge-transporting material having a high mobility and capable of giving a thin stable organic film even when used at a high concentration and a compound suitable for use in producing a high-performance electrophotographic photoreceptor. As a result, they have found that the problems described above can be eliminated with novel bis(3,4-methylenedioxyphenylamino) derivatives represented by the following general formula (1): wherein Ar 1 and Ar 2 may be the same or different and each represents an optionally substituted aryl group; and Ar 3 represents a divalent aromatic group represented by wherein R 1 and R 2 each represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group, provided that when Ar 3 is a phenylene group, one of the amino substituents is meta or para to the other. The present invention has been completed based on this finding. The compounds represented by general formula (1), even when used in a high concentration, neither separate out as crystals nor develop pinholes. Photoreceptors employing any of these compounds have high sensitivity and a low residual potential. The present invention include the following (1) to (5).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGS. 1 ( a )-( c ) are views illustrating the constitutions of electrophotographic photoreceptors, and FIG. 2 is an X-ray diffraction curve of a crystalline oxytitanyl phthalocyanine. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the compounds represented by general formula (1) of the present invention, Ar 1 and Ar 2 may be the same or different and each represents an optionally substituted aryl group.

Especially preferred examples of the aryl group which may have such substituents include phenyl, p-tolyl, m-tolyl, p-ethylphenyl, 2,4-xylyl, and -naphthyl. Substituents R 1 and R 2 in Ar 3 in general formula (1) each represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group.

However, the compounds of the present invention should not be construed as being limited to these examples. Exemplified Compound (1) No. Ar 1 Ar 2 Ar 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 Among the novel bis(3,4-methylenedioxyphenylamino) derivatives represented by general formula (1) of the present invention, the derivatives (1a) represented by general formula (1) wherein Ar 1 Ar 2 can be synthesized, for example, according to reaction formula 1. Specifically, reactants consisting of 3,4-methylenedioxybromobenzene (5) and an aromatic acetamide (6) or of 3,4-methylenedioxyacetanilide (7) and an aromatic bromide (8) are subjected to the Ullmann reaction to obtain a coupling product (9). A copper powder or a copper salt such as a copper sulfate is used as a catalyst to conduct the above reaction in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate. A solvent inert to the reaction, such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, diisopropylbenzene, or isobutylbenzene, is used for the reaction, which is preferably conducted at a temperature of from 170 to 230 C. In some cases, a cyclic ether, e.g., a crown ether, or a linear ether also may be caused to be present in the reaction system. Subsequently, the amide group of the coupling product (9) is decomposed with potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, or the like in an alcohol solvent such as methanol or ethanol to convert the coupling product (9) into an amine (10). This reaction is preferably conducted at a temperature of about from room temperature to 80 C. The amine (10) is coupled with a dichloro-, dibromo-, or diiodo-substituted biphenyl or benzene (11), whereby a target compound (1a) of the present invention can be synthesized. (In reaction formula 1, Ar 1 and Ar 3 have the same meanings as defined above, and X represents Cl, Br, or I.) When the coupling reaction is conducted by the Ullmann reaction, the biphenyl or benzene derivative (11) is preferably a diiodide. This reaction can be carried out in the same manner as in the synthesis of the acetamide (9). When a transition metal complex catalyst is used for the coupling reaction, compound (11) may be any of dichloro, dibromo, and diiodo derivatives. Preferred examples of the transition metal complex catalyst include Pd(dba) 2 /2P(o-tolyl) 3 (dba: dibenzylideneacetone, o-tolyl: ortho-tolyl), PdCl 2 P(o-tolyl) 3 2 , and a complex of palladium having a valence of 0 yielded by reacting a salt of palladium having a valence of 2 with a trialkylphosphine or triarylphosphine. The amount of the complex catalyst may be about from 0.05 to 5% by mole based on the halogen as a substrate. The reaction may be conducted in a solvent inert to the reaction, such as, e.g., toluene, xylene, isobutylbenzene, or diisopropylbenzene, at a temperature of from 60 to 150 C. in the presence of an alkoxide such as, e.g., sodium tert-butoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, sodium methoxide, or sodium ethoxide. Thus, the target compound can be efficiently obtained. Alternatively, the compounds of the invention represented by general formula (1a) can be synthesized according to reaction formula 2. Specifically, 3,4-methylenedioxyacetanilide (7) and a dihalide (11) are subjected to the Ullmann coupling to synthesize a diacetamide derivative (12). This Ullmann reaction can be conducted under the same conditions as in the route shown by reaction formula 1. The solvolysis of compound (12) to compound (13) can be conducted in the same manner as the conversion of compound (9) to compound (10). If compound (12) has low solubility in alcohol solvents and the reaction thereof requires much time, then another solvent may be added such as, e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The diamine (13) thus obtained is coupled with an aromatic halide (14), whereby a target compound (1a) of the present invention can be synthesized. This coupling reaction may be conducted by either the Ullmann reaction or the reaction catalyzed by any of the aforementioned transition metal catalysts. (In reaction formula 2, Ar 1 and Ar 3 have the same meanings as defined above, and X represents Cl, Br, or I.) As shown in reaction formula 3, the diacetamide (12) can be synthesized also by subjecting a diacetyl compound (16) obtained from a diamine (15) and 3,4-methylenedioxybromobenzene (5) to the Ullmann coupling. It is also possible to directly convert the diamine (15) to compound (13) by the coupling reaction of the diamine (15) with 3,4-methylenedioxybromobenzene (5) in a molar ratio of 1:2 using any of the aforementioned transition metal complexes. (In reaction formula 3, Ar 3 has the same meaning as defined above.) Still another process usable for synthesizing a compound (1a) is illustrated by reaction formula 4. This process comprises subjecting a diamine (15) and an aryl halide (14) in a molar ratio of 1:2 to a coupling reaction using any of the aforementioned transition metal complexes to obtain a diamine (18) and then coupling the diamine (18) with 3,4-methylenedioxybromobenzene (5) in a molar ratio of 1:2. The diamine (18) can be synthesized also by subjecting a diacetyl compound (16) and an aryl halide (14) to the Ullmann reaction to obtain a compound (17) and solvolyzing the compound (17) with an alcohol. (In reaction formula 4, Ar 1 and Ar 3 have the same meanings as defined above, and X represents Cl, Br, or I.) Among the diaminobiphenyl derivatives or diaminobenzene derivatives represented by general formula (1) of the present invention, the bis(3,4-methylenedioxyphenylamino) derivatives (1b) represented by general formula (1) wherein Ar 1 Ar 2 can be synthesized according to reaction formula 5. Specifically, an amine (10) is coupled with an equivalent amount of a dihalide (11) to obtain a monoamino compound (19). This monoamino compound (19) is coupled with an amine (10) different from the amine (10) to thereby obtain an asymmetric bis(3,4-methylenedioxyphenylamino) derivative (1b). The two coupling reactions used here may be carried out in the same manner as those shown in reaction formulae 1 and 2. (In reaction formula 5, Ar 1 to Ar 3 have the same meanings as defined above, and X represents Cl, Br, or I.) The electrophotographic photoreceptor of the present invention contains any of the compounds represented by general formula (1) of the present invention, which are produced by the methods described above. An example of the electrophotographic photoreceptor is a lamination type electrophotographic photoreceptor comprising a conductive support and, formed thereon, a charge-generating layer and a charge-transporting layer which perform their respective functions. In this photoreceptor, the charge-transporting layer comprises a compound represented by general formula (1) of the present invention as a charge-transporting material. As illustrated in FIG. 1 , the above electrophotographic photoreceptor may have a structure in which the charge-transporting layer 1 is provided on the charge-generating layer 2 formed over the conductive support 4 ( FIG. 1 a ) or a structure in which the charge-transporting layer 1 is provided under the charge-generating layer 2 ( FIG. 1 b ). However, the charge-transporting layer 1 is desirably provided on the charge-generating layer 2 . The use of the compounds represented by general formula (1) as charge-transporting materials is applicable also to a single-layer electrophotographic photoreceptor ( FIG. 1 c ), in which a charge-generating material and one or more charge-transporting materials are contained in the same layer as a photosensitive layer 5 . The charge-transporting layer comprising a compound represented by general formula (1) of the present invention as a charge-transporting material is formed by vapor-depositing only the compound (1) as it is on a conductive support or on a charge-generating layer, or by dissolving the compound (1) of the invention in an appropriate solvent together with a binder, applying the solution on a conductive support or on a charge-generating layer, and drying the coating. On the other hand, the single-layer photoreceptor containing a charge generator and a compound (1) of the present invention is obtained by dissolving or dispersing the charge generator and the compound (1) of the invention in an appropriate solvent together with a binder, applying the solution on a conductive support, and drying the coating. A single-layer photoreceptor containing an electron acceptor compound and a compound (1) of the present invention can be obtained in the same manner as the above. Examples of the binder include polycarbonates, polyesters, polystyrene, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, polyamides, acrylic resins, vinyl chloride resins, vinyl acetate resins, epoxy resins, polyurethanes, and copolymers and mixtures thereof. Also usable besides such insulating polymers are organic photoconductive polymers such as polyvinylcarbazole, polyvinylanthracene, and polysilanes. Especially preferred among these binders are polycarbonates. Examples of such preferred polycarbonates include bisphenol methane type polycarbonates represented by the following structural formula (A): wherein R 11 and R 12 each independently represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a lower alkoxy group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or an optionally halogen-substituted phenyl group, provided that R 11 and R 12 may be bonded to each other to form a ring; R 13 , R 14 , R 15 , R 16 , R 17 , R 18 , R 19 , and R 20 each independently represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a lower alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a lower alkoxy group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or an optionally substituted phenyl group; and o represents an integer.

These polycarbonates desirably have a high molecular weight so as to give a photoreceptor which is less apt to have cracks or be marred. In the above formulae, o represents an integer. Usable examples of the copolymers include copolycarbonates comprising a suitable combination of monomer units represented by general formula (A). Preferred examples thereof include the bisphenol/biphenol type copolycarbonate resins disclosed in JP-A-4-179961, which are represented by general formula (B): wherein R 11 and R 12 each independently represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a lower alkoxy group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or an optionally halogen-substituted phenyl group, provided that R 11 and R 12 may be bonded to each other to form a ring; R 13 , R 14 , R 15 , R 16 , R 17 , R 18 , R 19 , and R 20 each independently represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a lower alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a lower alkoxy group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or an optionally substituted phenyl group; R 21 , R 22 , R 23 , R 24 , R 25 , R 26 , R 27 , and R 28 each independently represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a lower alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a lower alkoxy group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or an optionally substituted phenyl group, provided that R 21 , R 22 , R 23 , R 24 , R 25 , R 26 , R 27 , and R 28 each may be bonded to another to form a ring; and p and q each represents an integer. Specific examples of such bisphenol copolycarbonates include bisphenol A/biphenol type polycarbonate resins represented by the following structural formulae (B-1, B-2, B-3, and B-4). (In these formulae, r and s each represents an integer; although the ratio of r to s may be any desired value, r/(rs) is preferably from 0.1 to 0.9, more preferably from 0.7 to 0.9.) Also usable besides the above-described polycarbonates are the polycarbonates disclosed in JP-A-6-214412 which comprise repeating units represented by the following structural formula (C): wherein t represents an integer. Furthermore, the polycarbonates disclosed in JP-A-6-222581 can be used which are represented by the following general formula (D): wherein R 29 , R 30 , and R 31 each independently represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a lower alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a three- to eight-membered alicyclic group containing one or more carbon atoms, a phenyl group which may be substituted with at least one substituent selected from lower alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, lower alkoxy groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and halogen atoms, or a benzyl group which may be substituted with at least one substituent selected from lower alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, lower alkoxy groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and halogen atoms; and u represents an integer. A compound represented by general formula (1) of the present invention may be mixed with such a binder in any desired proportion. However, the amount of the charge-transporting material is generally from 10 to1,000 parts by weight, preferably from 30 to 500 parts by weight, more preferably from 40 to 200 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the binder. The thickness of the charge-transporting layer obtained is generally from 2 to 40 m. However, it is preferably from 5 to 40 m, more preferably from 10 to 30 m. An organic solvent may be used without particular limitations.

Thereto was added 250 g of acetic anhydride with stirring. Immediately thereafter, a solution prepared from 198 g of sodium acetate and 800 ml of water was added thereto (the reaction mixture was cooled with ice water because the addition resulted in heat generation). The resultant mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour, and the crystals precipitated were taken out by filtration and washed with water. The crystals were taken out and recrystallized from methanol (500 ml) to obtain 188.3 g of 3,4-methylenedioxyacetanilide (7).

Thus, 98.3 g of the target compound was obtained. The Celite was further rinsed with chloroform because the target compound still remained thereon. The crude reaction product thus recovered in an amount of about 90 g was recrystallized from chlorobenzene to obtain 21.1 g of the target compound.

This solution was applied on the charge-generating layer with a doctor blade and dried at 80 C. for 3 hours. Thus, photoreceptors were produced. The electrophotographic photoreceptors thus obtained were statically examined for electrophotographic properties with electrostatic recording paper tester Type EPA-8200 (manufactured by Kawaguchi Denki Seisakusho) as follows. Each photoreceptor was electrostatically charged by 6 kV corona discharge to measure the resultant surface potential V 0 (unit: V). The charged photoreceptor was placed in the dark for 5 seconds surface potential V i (unit: V), and then irradiated with light from a halogen lamp at an illuminance of 5 lx to determine the exposure required for the surface potential V i to decrease by half, i.e., half-decay exposure E (lxsec), and the exposure required for the surface potential to decrease to one sixth, E . Subsequently, the photoreceptor was irradiated for 10 seconds with light at an illuminance of 5 lx, and the residual surface potential V R10 (V) was determined. The results obtained are shown in Table 2.

pyrrolo1,2-apyrimidine compound providing an excellent color-forming property is provided. Further, a novel cyan color-forming type diazo heat-sensitive recording material having excellent shelf life, image light-resistance and image fixing property is provided. The pyrrolo1,2-apyrimidine compound is represented by following general formula (1). The heat-sensitive recording material comprises a substrate, and on the substrate, a heat-sensitive recording layer containing a diazonium salt compound and a coupler. The coupler contains at least one of pyrrolo1,2-apyrimidine compounds represented by following general formula (1). In the formula, R 1 represents an aryl group or the like, R 2 represents an alkoxycarbonyl group or the like, R 3 and R 4 represent an acyl group or the like, and R 5 represents a hydrogen atom or the like. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a pyrrolo1,2-apyrimidine compound useful as a coupler of a heat-sensitive recording material, and to a heat-sensitive recording material using a diazonium salt compound and the pyrrolo1,2-apyrimidine compound coupler as color-developing components. 2. Description of the Related Art As heat-sensitive recording materials become more high-performance, there is required a heat-sensitive recording material which has cyan-color forming property, excellent color-forming property, long shelf life, improved storability of images and an improved image fixing property. Diazonium salt compounds are compounds having very high chemical activity, and easily react with compounds called couplers (e.g., phenol derivatives, compounds having an active methylene group) to form an azo dye, and also are light-sensitive and lose their activity when decomposed due to irradiation by light. Therefore, diazonium salt compounds have been used as light recording materials such as bydiazo copies (see, Shashin Kogaku no Kiso, Higinen Shashin Hen (Fundamentals of Photographic Technology, Non-Silver Salt Photography Volume) edited by Nippon Shashin Gakkai (Japan Photographic Society), Corona Co. (1982), pp. 89 to 117, and 182 to 201). Further, by utilizing the property of diazonium salt compounds that they lose their activity due to decomposition by light, diazonium salt compounds have recently been used in recording materials which require fixing of images. As an example, there has been proposed a light fixing type heat-sensitive recording material in which a diazonium salt compound and a coupler are heated in accordance with image signals and react to form images, and thereafter, the images are fixed by irradiation of light (Hirotsugu Sato et al., GazoDenshi Gakkai Shi (Journal of the Image Electronics Society), Vol. 11, No. 4 (1982), pp. 290-296). However, these recording materials using as a color-forming element a diazonium salt compound have a drawback in that the activity of the diazonium salt compound is extremely high, and even in dark places, the diazonium salt compound thermally decomposes gradually such that the reactivity thereof is lost, and therefore, its shelf life as a recording material is short. As one means for improving this drawback, there is a method in which a diazonium salt compound is encapsulated in microcapsules. It has become possible by this method to isolate the diazonium salt compound from substances promoting decomposition such as water, bases and the like, and to greatly improve the shelf life as a recording material (Tomomasa Usami et al., Denshi Shashin Gakkai Shi (Journal of the Electronic Photographic Society), Vol. 26, No. 2, (1987), pp. 115 to 125). When the microcapsule is a microcapsule having a wall which has a glass transition temperature and in which the glass transition temperature is somewhat higher than room temperature such as urea resins and urethane resins, this capsule is called a heat-responsive microcapsule and is useful as a heat-sensitive recording material since, at room temperature, the capsule wall exhibits non-permeability with respect to substances and, at glass transition temperature or higher, exhibits permeability with respect to substances. Namely, if a heat-sensitive recording layer comprising heat-responsive microcapsules containing a diazonium salt compound, a coupler and a base is applied onto a substrate to form a recording material, the diazonium salt compound can be kept stable for a long period of time, a color-formed image can be easily formed by heating, and further, the image can be fixed by irradiation by light. As described above, it has become possible to greatly improve the stability of a diazonium salt compound by encapsulating the compound in microcapsules. On the other hand, it is known that when 2-hydroxy-3-naphtoic anilides are used as couplers, they are excellent as heat-sensitive recording color-forming materials, and if a coupling reaction is effected with a 4-substituted amino-2-alkoxybenzene diazonium salt compound, a blue dye can be formed (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 2-225082). However, when a diazonium salt compound having max at a longer wavelength side is used, storability before use (ground coloring property during storage before copying) of the recording material deteriorates. Further, in the case of a diazonium salt compound having max at a shorter wavelength side, when the aforementioned 2-hydroxy-3-naphtoic anilides are used, there are drawbacks in that the fixing property of images when irradiated with light is hindered, the hue extends over a long wavelength even to cyan, and further, storability of color-developed images (light fastness) is not sufficient. As described above, there has not been obtained a heat-sensitive recording material which has cyan color-forming property, results in excellent color-forming property, and has a saltiscactory shelf life, image storability and image fixing property, until now. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been accomplished in view of the aforementioned, and an object thereof is to provide a pyrrolo1,2-apyrimidine compound which is useful as a coupler providing an excellent color-forming property. Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel cyan color-forming type diazo heat-sensitive recording material which contains the pyrrolo1,2-apyrimidine compound coupler and a diazonium salt compound and has excellent shelf life, image light-resistance and image fixing property in addition to the above-described properties. The present inventors have studied couplers intensively, and have found that a novel pyrrolo1,2-apyrimidine compound represented by the following general formula (1) is useful as a coupler which provides an excellent color-forming property. Further, the present inventors have found that a heat-sensitive recording material using the pyrrolo1,2-apyrimidine compound and a diazonium salt compound which will be described below has improved shelf life, image light-resistance and image fixing property, and has an excellent cyan color-forming property. Thus, the present inventors invented. The present invention provides a pyrrolo1,2-apyrimidine compound represented by following general formula (1): (wherein, in general formula (1), R 1 represents an aryl group, alkyl group, carbamoyl group, alkoxycarbonyl group or aryloxycarbonyl group; R 2 represents an alkoxycarbonyl group, aryloxycarbonyl group or cyano group; R 3 and R 4 each independently represents a hydrogen atom, aryl group, alkyl group, acyl group, carbamoyl group, alkoxycarbonyl group, aryloxycarbonyl group, alkylsulfonyl group, arylsulfonyl group, sulfamoyl group, alkylphosphoryl group or arylphosphoryl group; R 5 represents a hydrogen atom, halogen atom, cyano group, acyl group, carbamoyl group, alkoxycarbonyl group, aryloxycarbonyl group, acyloxy group, sulfamoyl group, alkylsulfonyl group, arylsulfonyl group, alkylphosphoryl group or arylphosphoryl group). Further, the present invention provides a heat-sensitive recording material comprising a substrate, and on said substrate, a heat-sensitive recording layer containing a diazonium salt compound and a coupler which forms color by reacting with the diazonium salt compound during heating, wherein the coupler contains at least one of the pyrrolo1,2-apyrimidine compounds represented by said general formula (1). DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The pyrrolo1,2-apyrimidine compound of the present invention will be described in detail hereinafter.

Details thereof are described in JP-A No. 2-141279 and the like. In addition, various organic or inorganic pigments, various stabilizers, antioxidants and the like can also be added if necessary. In the heat-sensitive recording material of the present invention, a diazonium salt compound, the pyrrolo1,2-apyrimidine compound represented by general formula (1), and the like may be contained in the same layer, or may be contained in separate layers which are layered one upon the other. Substrate Conventionally known substrates can be used for the substrate used in the present invention. Specifically, neutral paper, acidic paper, recycled paper, polyolefin resin-laminated paper, synthetic paper, polyester film, cellulose derivative films such as triacetic cellulose film and the like, polyolef in films such as polystyrene film, polypropylene film, polyethylene film and the like can be used alone, or two or more types can be laminated together for use. The thickness of the substrate may be from 20 to 200 m. Further, there can also be provided an intermediate layer between the substrate and the heat-sensitive recording layer. These are described in JP-A No. 61-54980 and the like. Other layers and the like In the heat-sensitive recording layer of the present invention, a protective layer is preferably provided on the heat sensitive-recording layer, and this protective layer is preferably laminated. The protective layer is formed from a water-soluble polymer, a pigment or the like. To achieve both light-resistance and light-stability in this protective layer, a compound having a function of controlling ultraviolet ray transmittance is preferably contained in the protective layer. Details of a heat-sensitive recording material containing a compound having a function of controlling ultraviolet ray transmittance are described in JP-A No. 7-276808. The heat-sensitive recording material of the present invention can be used as a multi-color heat-sensitive recording material. Details of a multi-color heat-sensitive recording material are described in JP-A Nos. 4-135787, 4-144784, 4-144785, 4-194842, 4-247447, 4-247448, 4-340540, 4-340541, 5-34860 and the like. Specifically, such a material can be obtained by laminating heat-sensitive recording layers which form colors in different hues. The layer structure is not particularly limited. One example thereof is a multi-color heat-sensitive recording material prepared by laminating two heat-sensitive recording layers (B layer, C layer) obtained by combining two kinds of diazonium salt compounds having different light-sensitive wavelengths with couplers which form colors of different hues by reacting with the respective diazonium salt compounds during heating, and a heat-sensitive recording layer (A layer) obtained by combining an electron donating colorless dye with an electron receiving compound. Specifically, the material comprises a substrate on which are provided a first heat-sensitive recording layer (A layer) containing an electron donating colorless dye and an electron receiving compound, a second heat-sensitive recording layer (B layer) containing a diazonium salt compound having a maximum absorption wavelength of 360 nm20 nm and a coupler which forms color by reacting with the diazonium salt compound during heating, and a third heat-sensitive recording layer (C layer) containing a diazonium salt compound having a maximum absorption wavelength of 400 nm20 nm and a coupler which forms color by reacting with the diazonium salt compound during heating. In this example, if formed color hues in the respective heat-sensitive recording layers are selected such that the three primary colors in subtractive color mixing, yellow, magenta and cyan, are obtained, full color image recording becomes possible. To record by using this multi-color heat-sensitive recording material, first, the third heat-sensitive recording layer (C layer) is heated to allow the diazonium salt and the coupler contained in the layer to form color. Then, the unreacted diazonium salt compound contained in the C layer is decomposed and fixed by irradiation with light having a wavelength of 40020 nm. Thereafter, sufficient heat for color-formation of the second heat-sensitive recording layer (B layer) is applied to allow the diazonium salt compound and the coupler contained in the layer to form color. At this time, although the C layer is simultaneously heated significantly, it does not form color since the diazonium salt compound has already decomposed (has been fixed by light) and the color-forming ability is lost. Further, the diazonium salt compound contained in the B layer is decomposed by irradiation with light having a wavelength of 32020 nm. Lastly, heat sufficient for color-formation of the first heat-sensitive recording layer (A layer) is applied to form color. At this time, although the heat-sensitive recording layers C and B are also heated significantly, they do not form color since the diazonium salt compounds have already decomposed and their color developing abilities are lost. Further, all of the heat-sensitive recording layers (A layer, B layer and C layer, in this order from the upper layer) can be heat-sensitive recording layers which are obtained by combining three kinds of diazonium salt compounds having different light-sensitive wavelengths, with couplers which form color in different hues by reacting with the respective diazonium salt compounds during heating. In particular, by setting the yellow layer having a low luminosity factor as the lower most layer, effects on images due to roughness on the surface of the substrate can be reduced, and image quality can be improved. When all of the heat-sensitive recording layers (A layer, B layer and C layer) are diazo-based heat-sensitive recording layers, it is necessary to carry out light-fixing of the A layer and the B layer after color-formation. There is no need to carry out light-fixing for the C layer. Various fluorescent lamps, xenon lamps, mercury lamps and the like may be used as the light source for fixing used in the above-described fixing by light. It is preferable that the emission spectrum approximately coincides with the absorption spectrum of the diazonium salt compound used in the heat-sensitive material since then efficient light-fixing is possible. Further, when recording the heat-sensitive recording material of the present invention, the heat-sensitive recording material can also be used as a heat-developing type light-sensitive material by which an image can be obtained by exposing the material through an original, decomposing the diazonium salt compounds at portions other than the image formed portions to form a latent image, and thereafter, heating the entire material.

The coated amounts in terms of solid components were 8.0 g/m 2 and 1.2 g/m 2 respectively. The resultant heat-sensitive recording materials were subjected to the following tests and evaluated. Color-Developing Test A sample was thermally printed using a thermal head (KST type) manufactured by Kyocera Corp. with the pulse width and power applied to the thermal head having been determined such that the recording energy per unit area was 50 mJ/mm 2 . Thereafter, the entire surface of the sample was irradiated by light for 15 seconds by using an ultraviolet ray lamp having an emission center wavelength of 365 nm and an output of 40 W. The densities of the image portions and ground portions of the resultant sample were measured by a Macbeth densitometer. Image Light-Resistance Test By using a fluorescent lamp light-resistance tester, the image portions, which had been color-developed by using a thermal head (KST type) manufactured by Kyocera Corp., were irradiated by light continuously for 24 hours at 32000 lux, and thereafter, the density of the image portions was measured. The higher the density of the image portions after irradiation, the more excellent the image light-resistance. Image Fixing Property Test For testing the image fixing property, the ground portions (non-printed portions) of the fixed sample were thermally printed by using a thermal head (KST type) manufactured by Kyocera Corp. with the pulse width and power applied to the thermal head having been determined such that the recording energy per unit area was 40 mJ/mm 2 , and the change in density was measured. The lower the density after printing, the more excellent the image fixing property.

In this reaction, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane, or carbon tetrachloride; and an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol can be used as the solvent. The reaction is preferably effected at 80 C. to room temperature. The method of producing the dihydropyran derivative represented by the general formula (II) includes, for example, the following method. (1) Case wherein the (R 81 )Ar is a group represented by the formula (A) In the case wherein the (R 81 )Ar is a group represented by the formula (A) in the compound represented by the general formula (II), the dihydropyran derivative represented by the general formula (II) can be produced in accordance with the following reaction scheme B: In the reaction scheme B, R 1 to R 7 and R 81 have the same meaning as defined above; R 83 is halogen atom; R 84 is an alkoxyl group or an aralkyloxy group (R 83 and R 84 are combined with adjacent carbon atoms); R is halogen atom, a substituted sulfonyloxy group, or a hydroxyl group; and (R 81 )Ar of the compound represented by the general formula (II) is a group represented by the formula (A). Step 1A In this step, a compound represented by the general formula (1A) is reacted with a compound represented by the general formula (2A) to produce a compound represented by the general formula (3A). The reaction can be attained by so-called Williamson synthesis which is well known to a person with an ordinary skill in the art. When a substituent R of the compound represented by the general formula (1A) is halogen atom or a substituted sulfonyloxy group, this step can be attained by directly subjecting the compound to the reaction. On the other hand, when X is a hydroxyl group, this step can be attained by subjecting the compound to the reaction after the hydroxyl group into a sulfonyloxy group in the reaction system using halogenated tosyl. Step 2A In this step, the compound represented by the general formula (3A) is oxidized to produce a compound represented by the general formula (4A). Oxidation in this step can be effected by using a chromium-based oxidizing agent or an activator. As a chromium-based oxidizing agent, for example, pyridinium chloroformate (PCC) or pyridinium dichlorochromate (PDC) can be used. As a solvent, for example, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane can be used. When using the activator, the reaction can be effected by using a combination with a solvent such as Py.SO 3 /triethylamine/DMSO or Ac 2 O/DMSO. Step 3A In this step, a compound represented by the general formula (5A) is produced by ring-formation of the compound represented by the general formula (4A). The reaction is effected by using a lithium salt of a secondary amine, such as lithium diisopropylamide, or a base such as t-butoxypotassium. As the solvent, for example, an organic solvent such as THF or DMSO can be used. The reaction is preferably effected at 0 C. to room temperature for 1 to 5 hours. Step 4A In this step, the compound represented by the general formula (5A) is dehydrated to produce a compound represented by the general formula (6A). The reaction can be effected by reacting with thionyl chloride in the presence of a base such as pyridine, or by using, as a catalyst, an acid such as phosphoric acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid. As the solvent, for example, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride, or an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene can be used. The solvent can be appropriately selected according to a reagent to be reacted. Step 5A In this step, the compound represented by the general formula (6A) is reduced to produce a compound represented by the general formula (7A). The reaction can be attained by reacting with a lithium salt such as butyllitium, reacting with an azide such as p-toluenesulfonazide, reducing with triphenyl phosphine, and reacting with a thiol such as ethanethiol. As the solvent, for example, an organic solvent such as DMF can be used. The reaction is preferably effected under reflux. Step 6A In this step, a compound represented by the general formula (II) is produced from the compound represented by the general formula (7A). The reaction can be effected by converting R 84 of the compound represented by the general formula (7A) into a hydroxyl group or a SH group, and reacting with an orthocarboxylic acid ester or carbonylimidazole, thereby making it possible to form a condensed ring. When using the orthocarboxylic acid ester, the reaction is preferably effected under heating at 100 to 200 C. When using carbonylimidazole, the reaction is preferably effected at 0 C. to room temperature. (2) Case wherein the (R 81 )Ar is a group represented by the formula (C) In case (R 81 )Ar is a group represented by the formula (C) in the compound represented by the general formula (II), the dihydropyran derivative represented by the general formula (II) can be obtained in accordance with the following reaction scheme C: In the reaction scheme C, R 1 to R 7 , R 81 and R have the same meaning as defined above; and (R 81 )Ar in the compound represented by the general formula (II) is a group represented by the formula (C). Step 1C In this step, a compound represented by the general formula (1C) is reacted with a compound represented by the general formula (2C) to produce a compound represented by the general formula (3C). The compound represented by the general formula (2C) is the same as the compound represented by the general formula (2A) used in case (R 81 )Ar is a group represented by the formula (A). This step 1C can be attained by Williamson synthesis in the same manner as in the step 1A. Steps 2C and 3C The method of producing a compound represented by the general formula (5C) through these steps can be attained in the same manner as in the steps 2A and 3A. Step 4A In this step, the compound represented by the general formula (5C) is brominated to produce a compound represented by the general formula (6C). The reaction is attained by using a brominating agent such as N-bromosuccinimide. As the solvent, for example, an organic solvent such as hydrous THF, dioxane, or DMF can be used. Step 5C This step can be effected in the same manner as in the step 4A. In this step, bromine of a compound represented by the general formula (7C) is substituted to produce a compound represented by the general formula (II) into which a desired substituent is introduced. Introduction of a substituted amino group can be effected by introducing a carboxyl group using a lithium salt such as butyllithium, and reacting with an amine or ammonia using carbonylimidazole as a condensing agent. The amide produced by the above reaction can be converted into a compound having an oxazoline ring by reacting with a substituted or non-substituted ethanolamine. Introduction of an acyl group can be attained by reacting with N-methylformanilide using a lithium salt such as butyllithium in the same manner as described above, or reacting with an aldehyde such as acetaldehyde or benzaldehyde and oxidizing a hydroxyl group using an oxidizing agent such as manganese dioxide. The compound into which the acyl group has been introduced is converted into an oxime by subjecting to the step 1 and reacting with a hydroxylamine or alkoxylamine, and the oxime can be used as a starting material of the step 3. (3) Case wherein the (R 81 )Ar is a group represented by the formula (B) In case wherein the (R 81 )Ar is a group represented by the formula (B) in the compound represented by the general formula (II), the dihydropyran derivative represented by the general formula (II) can be obtained in accordance with the following reaction scheme D. In the reaction scheme D, R 1 to R 7 , W, X and R 81 have the same meaning as defined above; and (R 81 )Ar of the compound represented by the general formula (II) is a group represented by the formula (B). Step 1B In this step, a compound represented by the general formula (1B) is condensed with a compound represented by the general formula (2B) to produce a compound represented by the general formula (3B). The reaction can be effected in the presence of a condensing agent. The condensing agent includes, for example, carbodiimide or carbonylimidazole. When the reaction is effected, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane can be used as the solvent. Step 2B This step is effected in the same manner as in the above step 2A. Step 3B In this step, an alcohol derivative is produced from a compound represented by the general formula (4B) using a reducing agent and a base in the presence of titanium, and then the alcohol derivative is subjected to a cyclodehydration reaction in the presence of an acid catalyst to produce a compound represented by the general formula (II). It is an indispensable feature for the pre-stage reaction to be effected in the presence of titanium. Halogenated titanium such as titanium chloride is preferably used as titanium. The reaction is preferably effected after the reduced state is attained by using aluminum lithium hydride as a reducing agent and using triethylamine or pyridine as a base. The reaction is preferably effected in an organic ether such as THF. The reaction proceeds at 0 to 100 C., but is preferably effected under reflux of THF in view of the operation and reactivity. In the post-stage cyclodehydration reaction, PPTS or p-toluenesulfonic acid is preferably used as an acid catalyst. The reaction can be effected by using a halogenated hydrocarbon or an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene or toluene as a solvent. The 1,2-dioxetane derivative represented by the general formula (I) of the present invention is not only discomposed with accompanying a chemiluminescence under alkali conditions to form a carbonyl compound, but also decomposed with accompanying a chemiluminescence by an enzyme, for example, esterase (carboxylic acid ester hydrolase) such as arylesterase or acetylcholinesterase, or acidic or alkali phosphatase. Accordingly, the 1,2-dioxetane derivative can be not only used as a reagent in an immunoassay for the purpose of determining the concentration of a substance to be detected in the sample, but also used as a labeled reagent. The substances to be detected in the immunoassay, includes, for example, hormones such as hCG, TSH, or LH; carcinogens such as AFP or CEA; and virus antigen such as HIV or HTLV-1, and an antibody or a nucleic acid thereof. According to the above immunoassay, the following steps are included: the step of providing a conjugate consisting of the enzyme and a substance having a specific binding property to the above substance to be detected, mixing and reacting the conjugate with a sample containing the substance to be detected for a fixed time, and the step of determining the amount of the enzyme of the conjugate which has been bound or not bound to the substance to be detected in the sample by means of measuring the intensity of chemiluminescence of the product of the enzyme reaction with the substrate 1,2-dioxetane derivative. The amount of the enzyme indicates the concentration of the substance to be detected. The reagent for immunoassay, comprising the 1,2-dioxetane derivative of the present invention, and the above-described immunoassay using the same are also included in the present invention. The 1,2-dioxetane represented by the general formula (I) of the present invention is a compound which has a high thermal stability and a very high light emission quantum efficiency. Accordingly, the compound can be stored for a long period of time without being refrigerated, and the same object can be attained using a small amount of the compound as compared with a conventional compound because of good light emission efficiency. When using it in the field of clinical analysis, the substance to be detected can be detected in an efficient and simple manner.

They can be prepared by processes according to claim 6, via intermediates, some of which are novel. It is known that phenylsulfonylureas substituted by carbamoyl groups have herbicidal properties. These are symmetric derivatives of isophthalic acid (formula A; U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,241). Surprisingly, we have now found terephthalic acid ester amides or diamides which are particularly suitable for use as herbicides or plant growth regulators. The present invention provides compounds of the formula (I) or salts thereof in which R 1 is a hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon radical or a heterocyclyl radical, where each of the two last mentioned radicals is unsubstituted or substituted and has, including substituents, 1 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 20 carbon atoms, R 2 is a group of the formula R 0 Q 0 , in which R 0 is a hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon radical or a heterocyclyl radical, where each of the two last mentioned radicals is unsubstituted or substituted and has, including substituents, 1 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and Q 0 is a direct bond or a divalent group of the formula O, SO 2 , NH, N(C 1 -C 6 )alkyl-, CO, CONH or OCONH, R 3 is a hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon radical or a heterocyclyl radical, where each of the two last mentioned radicals is unsubstituted or substituted and has, including substituents, 1 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 20 carbon atoms, R 4 is H, halogen, NO 2 , CN, (C 1 -C 4 )alkyl, (C 1 -C 4 )alkoxy, (C 1 -C 4 )alkyl-carbonyl or (C 1 -C 4 )alkoxycarbonyl, where each of the four last mentioned radicals is unsubstituted or substituted in the alkyl moiety by one or more halogen atoms, R 5 is H or (C 1 -C 4 )alkyl, preferably H or CH 3 , Q is O or NR*, R* is H, (C 1 -C 4 )alkyl, (C 3 -C 4 )alkenyl or (C 3 -C 4 )alkynyl, where each of the three last mentioned radicals is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more radicals selected from the group consisting of halogen, (C 1 -C 4 )alkoxy and (C 1 -C 4 )alkylthio, W is an oxygen or sulfur atom, X,Y independently of one another are H, halogen, (C 1 -C 4 )alkyl, (C 1 -C 4 )alkoxy, (C 1 -C 4 )alkylthio, where each of the three last mentioned radicals is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more radicals selected from the group consisting of halogen, (C 1 -C 4 )alkoxy and (C 1 -C 4 )alkylthio, or are mono- or di(C 1 -C 4 )alkylamino, (C 3 -C 4 )cycloalkyl, (C 2 -C 5 )alkenyl, (C 2 -C 5 )alkynyl, (C 2 -C 5 )alkenyloxy or (C 2 -C 5 )alkynyloxy and Z is CH or N. The compounds of the formula (I) can form salts where the hydrogen of the SO 2 NH group is replaced by an agriculturally suitable cation. These salts are, for example, metal salts, in particular alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts, in particular sodium salts and potassium salts, or else ammonium salts or salts with organic amines. Likewise, salt formation can be carried out by adding an acid to basic groups, such as, for example, amino and alkylamino. Suitable acids for this purpose are strong inorganic and organic acids, for example HCl, HBr, H 2 SO 4 or HNO 3 . In the formula (I) and all formulae below, the carbon-containing radicals, such as alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, alkylamino and alkylthio, and the corresponding unsaturated and/or substituted radicals, can in each case be straight-chain or branched in the carbon skeleton. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the lower carbon skeletons, for example having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or in the case of unsaturated groups having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, are preferred for these radicals. Alkyl radicals, also in the composed meanings such as alkoxy, haloalkyl, etc., are, for example, methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl, n-, i-, t- or 2-butyl, pentyls, hexyls, such as n-hexyl, i-hexyl and 1,3-dimethylbutyl, heptyls, such as n-heptyl, 1-methylhexyl and 1,4-dimethylpentyl; alkenyl and alkynyl radicals have the meaning of the unsaturated radicals which are possible and which correspond to the alkyl radicals; alkenyl denotes, for example, allyl, 1-methylprop-2-en-1-yl, 2-methylprop-2-en-1-yl, but-2-en-1-yl, but-3-en-1-yl, 1-methyl-but-3-en-1-yl and 1-methyl-but-2-en-1-yl; alkynyl is, for example, propargyl, but-2-in-1-yl, but-3-in-1-yl, 1-methyl-but-3-in-1-yl. Alkenyl in the form (C 3 -C 4 )alkenyl and (C 3 -C 6 )alkenyl preferably denotes an alkenyl radical having 3 to 4 and 3 to 6 carbon atoms, respectively, where the double bond is not at the carbon atom which is linked to the remainder of the molecule of the compound (I) (yl position). This applies correspondingly to (C 3 -C 4 )alkynyl, etc. Cycloalkyl is a carbocyclic saturated ring system having 3-8 carbon atoms, for example cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl. Halogen is, for example, fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. Haloalkyl, -alkenyl and -alkynyl are alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl which are partially or fully substituted by halogen, preferably by fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine, in particular by fluorine or chlorine, for example CF 3 , CHF 2 , CH 2 F, CF 3 CF 2 , CH 2 FCHCl, CCl 3 , CHCl 2 , CH 2 CH 2 Cl; haloalkoxy is, for example, OCF 3 , OCHF 2 , OCH 2 F, CF 3 CF 2 O, OCH 2 CF 3 and OCH 2 CH 2 Cl; this applies correspondingly to haloalkenyl and other halogen-substituted radicals. A hydrocarbon radical is a straight-chain, branched or cyclic and saturated or unsaturated aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical, for example alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or aryl; aryl in this context is a mono-, bi- or polycyclic aromatic system, for example phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, indenyl, indanyl, pentalenyl, fluorenyl and the like, preferably phenyl; a hydrocarbon radical is preferably alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl having up to 12 carbon atoms or cycloalkyl having 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 ring atoms or phenyl. A heterocyclic radical or ring (heterocyclyl) can be saturated, unsaturated or heteroaromatic; preferably, it contains one or more heteroatoms in the ring, preferably selected from the group consisting of N, O and S; it is preferably an aliphatic heterocyclyl radical having 3 to 7 ring atoms or a heteroaromatic radical having 5 or 6 ring atoms and contains 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms. The heterocyclic radical can be, for example, a heteroaromatic radical or ring (heteroaryl), such as, for example, a mono-, bi- or polycyclic aromatic system in which at least one ring contains one or more heteroatoms, for example pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, triazinyl, thienyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, furyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl and imidazolyl, or it is a partially or fully hydrogenated radical such as oxiranyl, oxetanyl, pyrrolidyl, piperidyl, piperazinyl, dioxolanyl, morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuryl. Substituents which are suitable for a substituted heterocyclic radical are the substituents mentioned further below, and additionally also oxo. The oxo group can also be present on the hetero ring atoms which may exist at various oxidation levels, for example on N and S. Substituted radicals, such as substituted hydrocarbon radicals, for example substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, phenyl and benzyl, or substituted heterocyclyl or heteroaryl are, for example, a substituted radical which is derived from the unsubstituted skeleton, the substituents being, for example, one or more, preferably 1, 2 or 3, radicals selected from the group consisting of halogen, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, alkylthio, hydroxyl, amino, nitro, carboxyl, cyano, azido, alkoxycarbonyl, alkylcarbonyl, formyl, carbamoyl, mono- and dialkylaminocarbonyl, substituted amino, such as acylamino, mono- and dialkylamino, and alkylsulfinyl, haloalkylsulfinyl, alkylsulfonyl, haloalkylsulfonyl and, in the case of cyclic radicals, also alkyl and haloalkyl, and also unsaturated aliphatic radicals which correspond to the abovementioned saturated hydrocarbon-containing radicals, such as alkenyl, alkynyl, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy etc. Preferred among radicals having carbon atoms are those having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, in particular 1 or 2 carbon atoms. Preferred are, in general, substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, for example fluorine and chlorine, (C 1 -C 4 )alkyl, preferably methyl or ethyl, (C 1 -C 4 )haloalkyl, preferably trifluoromethyl, (C 1 -C 4 )alkoxy, preferably methoxy or ethoxy, (C 1 -C 4 )haloalkoxy, nitro and cyano.

Mono- or disubstituted amino is a chemically stable radical selected from the group consisting of the substituted amino radicals, which are N-substituted, for example, by one or two identical or different radicals selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkoxy, acyl and aryl; preferably monoalkylamino, dialkylamino, acylamino, arylamino, N-alkyl-N-arylamino and N-heterocycles; preferred in this context are alkyl radicals having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; aryl is in this context preferably phenyl or substituted phenyl; acyl is as defined further below, preferably (C 1 -C 4 )alkanoyl. This also applies correspondingly to substituted hydroxylamino or hydrazino. An acyl radical is the radical of an organic acid, for example the radical of a carboxylic acid and radicals of acids derived therefrom, such as thiocarboxylic acid, optionally N-substituted iminocarboxylic acids or the radical of carbonic monoesters, of optionally N-substituted carbamic acid, of sulfonic acids, sulfinic acids, phosphonic acids and phosphinic acids. Acyl is, for example, formyl, alkylcarbonyl such as (C 1 -C 4 )alkylcarbonyl, phenylcarbonyl, where the phenyl ring may be substituted, for example as shown above for phenyl, or alkyloxycarbonyl, phenyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, alkylsulfonyl, alkylsulfinyl, N-alkyl-1-iminoalkyl and other radicals of organic acids. The invention also provides all stereoisomers embraced by formula (I) and mixtures of these. Such compounds of formula (I) contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms or else double bonds which are not mentioned separately in formula (I). Formula (I) embraces all possible stereoisomers which are defined by their specific spatial form, such as enantiomers, diastereomers and Z and E isomers; they can be obtained by customary methods from mixtures of the stereoisomers or be prepared by stereoselective reactions in combination with the use of stereochemically pure starting materials. The abovementioned examples of radicals or ranges of radicals which come under the general terms such as alkyl, acyl, substituted radicals, etc., are not meant to be complete lists. The general terms also include the definitions of ranges of radicals in groups of preferred compounds given further below, in particular ranges of radicals which include specific radicals from the examples in the tables.

Particularly preferred compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention or salts thereof are those in which R 1 is (C 1 -C 3 )alkyl, allyl or propargyl and/or R 4 is H and/or Q is an oxygen atom. Particular preference is also given to compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention and salts thereof which contain a combination of radicals from the abovementioned compounds of particular interest or the preferred compounds, and also those which contain one or more radicals from the compounds listed in Tables 1 and 2 (see below). The present invention also provides processes for preparing the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention or salts thereof, which comprises a) reacting a compound of the formula (II) with a heterocyclic carbamate of the formula (III), in which R is optionally substituted aryl or an aliphatic radical, preferably phenyl or (C 1 -C 4 )alkyl, or b) reacting a sulfonylcarbamate of the formula (IV) in which R is optionally substituted phenyl or (C 1 -C 4 )alkyl with an amino heterocycle of the formula (V) or c) reacting a sulfonyl isocyanate of the formula (VI) with an amino heterocycle of the formula (V) or d) reacting a sulfonamide of the formula (II) with a (thio)isocyanate of the formula (VII) in the presence of a base or e) reacting an amino heterocycle of the formula (V) initially under base-catalysis with a carbonate, for example diphenyl carbonate, and reacting the intermediate formed in a one-pot reaction with a sulfonamide of the formula (II) (see variant a), where in the formulae (II)-(VII) the radicals or groups R 1 -R 5 , W, X, Y and Z are as defined in formula (I) and in process variants a) to c) and e), initially compounds (I) where WO are obtained. The compounds of the formulae (II) and (III) are preferably reacted base-catalyzed in an inert organic solvent, such as, for example, dichloromethane, acetonitrile, dioxane or THF, at temperatures between 0 C., preferably 20 C., and at the boiling point of the solvent. Suitable bases here are, for example, organic amine bases, such as 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene (DBU), or alkali metal hydroxides, such as, for example, NaOH, in particular when R 0 (subst.) phenyl (cf. EP-A44807), or trimethylaluminum or triethylaluminum, the two last mentioned compounds in particular when R 0 alkyl (cf. EP-A-166 516). The base in question is employed here in the range of 1 to 3 molar equivalents, for example, based on the compound of the formula (II). The sulfonamides (II) and the structurally related compounds of the formulae (IV) and (VI) are novel compounds. The compounds and their preparation also form part of the subject matter of this invention. The compounds of the formula (II) are obtained, for example, starting from compounds of the formula (VIII) in which R 1 -R 4 are as defined in formula (I), by reaction with a strong acid (cf. in this context WO 89/10921). Suitable strong acids are, for example, mineral acids, such as H 2 SO 4 or HCl, or strong organic acids, such as trifluoro acetic acid. The tert-butyl protective group is cleaved off, for example, at temperatures from 20 C. to the respective reflux temperature of the reaction mixture, preferably at from 0 C. to 40 C. The reaction can be carried out neat or else in an inert solvent, such as, for example, dichloromethane or trichloromethane. Alternatively, the sulfonamides of the formula (II) where QO are also obtainable starting from the saccharin derivatives of the formula (IX) by reaction with gaseous hydrogen chloride in the presence of an alcohol of the formula R 1 OH (R 1 -R 4 are as defined in the formula (I) The reaction is carried out, for example, at temperatures between 0 C. and the boiling point of the alcohol R 1 OH, and the alcohol R 1 OH may at the same time serve as solvent (cf. in this context: U.S. Pat. No. 4,566,898; J. Pharmaceutical Sciences 56, 134 1967)). A further synthesis possibility for preparing the compounds of the formula II) consists in reacting the sulfonyl chlorides of the formula (X) with ammonia, where the radicals R 1 to R 4 and Q are as defined in the formula (I). The reaction is carried out, for example, in inert solvents, such as, for example, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxan, toluene or dimethylformamide (DMF), at temperatures of from 70 C. to the boiling point of the solvent, preferably up to 25 C. It is preferred here to use an amount of ammonia of 1.5-2.5 equivalents, based on the sulfonyl chloride. The intermediates of the formula (VIII) are obtained, for example, in accordance with scheme 1: The compounds of the formula (XI) are described in WO 96/05182. Their reaction with amines to give the amides of the formula (XII) is carried out by methods which are known in principle (cf. Houben-Weyl Methoden der Organischen Chemie, 4th Ed., Vol. 8, p. 655 ff, Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1952). A base-catalyzed opening of the saccharin ring in (XII) finally leads to the compounds of the formula (VII) where QO, where the alcohol R 1 OH in question serves as solvent and the base used is the corresponding alkoxide, preferably the sodium alkoxide. The reaction is preferably carried out at temperatures between 20 C. and the boiling point of the alcohol. Similar to known methods, the compounds (VII) where QNR* are obtained from the compounds (VII) where QO by reaction with the amines HNR 1 R*, where R 1 and R* are as defined in formula (I) (cf. Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, 4th Ed., Vol. 8, p. 658 ff, Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1952). A further method for synthesizing compounds of the formula (VII) consists in the opening of the saccharin ring in (XII) using an equivalent of potassium hydroxide. The reaction is carried out, for example, in aqueous ethanol, acetone, acetonitrile or pyridine, at temperatures of from 25 C. to the boiling point of the solvent mixture. The resulting potassium carboxylate of the formula (VIII), in which QO and R 1 K, can subsequently be alkylated using 1 to 5 equivalents of alkyl halide R-Hal, preferably in the presence of 1,4,7,10,13,16-hexacyclooctane (18-crown-6), for example of 0.1 equivalents of 18-crown6 under phase-transfer conditions, to give the compound (VIII; QO, R 1 R). The reaction is carried out, for example, in acetonitrile or benzene, at temperatures between 25 C. and the boiling point of the solvent (cf. in this context Tetrahedron Lett. 28, 2417-2420 (1974)). Besides the synthesis route described in WO 96/05182, the acyl chlorides of the formula (XI) are advantageously obtained in accordance with scheme 2. The starting material dimethyl aminoterephthalate, for example, is commercially available; all reaction steps can be carried out similar to methods known from the literature. The intermediates (IX) can be obtained in accordance with scheme 3. In the compounds of the formulae of schemes 1 to 3, in particular of the formulae (VIII) and (IX), (XI), (XII), (XIII) and (XIV), the radicals R 1 -R 4 are as defined in formula (I). R 1 in formula (XIII), scheme 3, is H or an optionally substituted hydrocarbon radical, such as (C 1 -C 4 )alkyl, (C 1 -C 4 )haloalkyl or phenyl. In the case where RH, the carboxyl function first has to be activated by a suitable agent. Suitable agents are, in particular, alkyl chloroformates, such as, for example, isobutyl chloroformate, carbonyidiimidazole or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The reaction is carried out, for example, in an inert solvent at temperatures between 20 C. and the boiling point of the solvent. The starting material (XIII) where RR 4 H is known (cf. in this context Chem. Ber. 115, 1740 (1982)). The esters of the formula (XIII) where R(C 1 -C 6 )alkyl are described in WO 96/05184. Their reaction with the amines (XIV) is preferably carried out in an inert solvent at temperatures between 20 C. and the boiling point of the solvent. Secondary alkyl- or allylamines of the formula (XIV) can be prepared by reacting primary amines with halogen compounds using methods which are known in principle (cf. in this context Ind. J. Chem. 15B, 135 (1977); J. Am. Chem. Soc. 81, 719, 722, 727 (1959); Bull. Chim. Soc. France II, 9-10, 395 (1984); Tetrahedron 29, 4118 (1973)). Many of the amines (XIV) are commercially available or can be prepared similarly to methods which are generally known to the person skilled in the art. The invention also provides the saccharin derivatives of the formula (IX) and their preparation in which R 1 to R 4 are as defined in formula (I) according to claim 1 and R is a protective group such as alkyl, in particular tert-butyl, and which preferably include the compounds (IX) and (XII). The intermediates of the formula (X) can be obtained in accordance with scheme 4. In the formulae of scheme 4, the radicals R 1 -R 4 and Q are as defined in formula (I) and X is OH or Cl. In the case where XOH, for example the compound where R 1 methyl, R 4 H and QO is commercially available. Other compounds of the type (XV) are obtainable by known routes (cf. in this context Monatsh. Chem. 23, 406, 410, 412 (1902)). To react the compounds (XV) where XOH with the amines (XIV), the carboxyl function first has to be activated using a suitable agent. Suitable agents are, in particular, alkyl chloroformates, such as, for example, isobutyl chloroformate, carbonyidiimidazole or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The reaction is carried out, for example, in an inert solvent at temperatures between 20 C. and the boiling point of the solvent. In the case where XCl, some of the compounds (XV) are known, or they can be prepared similarly to known methods (cf. in this context J. Chem. Soc. 113, 66 (1918)). Their reaction to give amides is likewise carried out similarly to known methods (cf. in this context Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, 4th Ed., Vol. 8, p. 655 ff, Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, 1952). The further reactions to give the aniline derivatives (XVI) or the sulfonyl chlorides (X) can be carried out similarly to known methods; cf. Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, 4th Ed., Vol.11/1, p. 360 ff, Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, 1957 or ibid. 9, p. 579ff, 1955. The carbamates of the formula (III) can be prepared by methods which are described in the South African patent applications 82/5671 and 82/5045 or EP-A 70804 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,480,101) or RD 275056. The reaction of the compounds (IV) with the amino heterocycles (V) is preferably carried out in inert aprotic solvents, such as, for example, dioxane, acetonitrile or tetrahydrofuran, at temperatures between 0 C. and the boiling point of the solvent. The required starting materials (V) are known from the literature or can be prepared by methods known from the literature. The phenylsulfonylcarbamates of the formula (IV) are obtained similarly to U.S. Pat. No. 4,684,393 or U.S. Pat. No. 4,743,290. The phenylsulfonyl isocyanates of the formula (VI) can be prepared and reacted with the amino heterocycles (V) similarly to U.S. Pat. No. 4,481,029. The (thio)isocyanates of the formula (VII) are obtainable by processes known from the literature (EP-A-232067, EP-A-166516). The reaction of the (thio)isocyanates (VII) with compounds (II) is carried out, for example, at from 10 C. to 100 C., preferably from 20 C. to 100 C., in an inert aprotic solvent, such as, for example, acetone or acetonitrile, in the presence of a suitable base, for example N(C 2 H 5 ) 3 or K 2 CO 3 . Avoiding the isolation of intermediates, such as, for example, the isocyanates of the formula (VI), the compounds of the formula (I) can also be prepared directly from the sulfonyl chlorides (X) and the amino heterocycles (V) in the presence of an alkali metal cyanate or ammonium cyanate and pyridine (cf. in this context U.S. Pat. No. 5,157,119). The reaction of an amino heterocycle of the formula (V) with diphenyl carbonate and a sulfonamide of the formula (II) in a one-pot reaction can be carried out in accordance with EP-A-562 575. The abovementioned compounds of the formulae (II), (IV), (VI), (VIII) and (X) are structurally related novel intermediates of the formula (II)* in which Z*NH 2 , NHCOOR***, NCO, NH-tert-butyl or Cl and R 1 -R 4 R*** and Q are as defined in formula (I) or formula (IV). The salts of the compounds of the formula (I) are preferably prepared in inert polar solvents, such as, for example, water, methanol or acetone, at temperatures of from 0 C. to 100 C. Suitable bases for preparing the salts according to the invention are, for example, alkali metal carbonates, such as potassium carbonate, alkali metal hydroxides and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, for example NaOH or KOH, or alkali metal alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide or sodium tert-butoxide, or ammonia or ethanolamine. The inert solvents mentioned in the process variants above are to be understood as meaning in each case solvents which are inert under the reaction conditions in question, but which need not be inert under any reaction conditions. The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention and their salts, hereinbelow together referred to as compounds of the formula (I) (according to the invention), have an outstanding herbicidal activity against a broad spectrum of economically important monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous harmful plants. The active compounds also act efficiently on perennial weeds which produce shoots from rhizomes, root stocks or other perennial organs and which are difficult to control. In this context, it is immaterial whether the substances are applied pre-sowing, pre-emergence or post-emergence. Specifically, examples may be mentioned of some representatives of the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed flora which can be controlled by the compounds according to the invention, without these being a restriction to certain species. Examples of weed species on which the active compounds act efficiently are, from amongst the monocotyledons, Avena, Lolium, Alopecurus, Phalaris, Echinochloa, Digitaria, Setaria and also Cyperus species from the annual sector and from amongst the perennial species Agropyron, Cynodon, Imperata and Sorghum, and also perennial Cyperus species. In the case of the dicotyledonous weed species, the spectrum of action extends to species such as, for example, Galium, Viola, Veronica, Lamium, Stellaria, Amaranthus, Sinapis, lpomoea, Matricaria, Abutilon and Sida from amongst the annuals, and Convolvulus, Cirsium, Rumex and Artemisia in the case of the perennial weeds. The active ingredients according to the invention also effect outstanding control of weeds which occur under the specific conditions of rice growing such as, for example, Echinochloa, Sagittaria, Alisma, Eleocharis, Scirpus and Cyperus. If the compounds according to the invention are applied to the soil surface prior to germination, then the weed seedlings are either prevented completely from emerging, or the weeds grow until they have reached the cotyledon stage but then their growth stops, and, eventually, after three to four weeks have elapsed, they die completely. If the active compounds are applied post-emergence to the green parts of the plants, growth also stops drastically a very short time after the treatment and the weed plants remain at the developmental stage of the point in time of application, or they die completely after a certain time, so that in this manner competition by the weeds, which is harmful to the crop plants, is eliminated at a very early point in time and in a sustained manner. Although the compounds according to the invention have an excellent herbicidal activity against monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds, crop plants of economically important crops such as, for example, wheat, barley, rye, rice, corn, sugarbeet, cotton and soya, are not damaged at all, or only to a negligible extent. For these reasons, the present compounds are highly suitable for selectively controlling undesired plant growth in plantings for agricultural use or in plantings of ornamentals. In addition, the substances according to the invention have outstanding growth-regulating properties in crop plants. They engage in the plant metabolism in a regulating manner and can this be employed for the targeted control of plant constituents and for facilitating harvesting, for example by provoking desiccation and stunted growth. Furthermore, they are also suitable for generally regulating and inhibiting undesirable vegetative growth, without destroying the plants in the process. Inhibition of vegetative growth plays an important role in many monocotyledon and dicotyledon crops because lodging can be reduced hereby, or prevented completely. Owing to their herbicidal and plant growth-regulatory properties, the active compounds can also be employed for controlling harmful plants in crops of known or still to be developed genetically engineered plants. The transgenic plants generally have particularly advantageous properties, for example resistance to certain pesticides, in particular certain herbicides, resistance to plant diseases or causative organisms of plant diseases, such as certain insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other particular properties relate, for example, to the quantity, quality, storage-stability, composition and to specific ingredients of the harvested product. Thus, transgenic plants having an increased starch content or a modified quality of the starch or those having a different fatty acid composition of the harvested produce are known. The use of the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention or their salts in economically important transgenic crops of useful and ornamental plants, for example of cereal, such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice, maniok and corn, or else in crops of sugarbeet, cotton, soya, rapeseed, potato, tomato, pea and other vegetable species is preferred. The compounds of the formula (I) can preferably be used as herbicides in crops of useful plants which are resistant or which have been made resistant by genetic engineering toward the phytotoxic effects of the herbicides. Conventional ways for preparing novel plants which have modified properties compared to known plants comprise, for example, traditional breeding methods and the generation of mutants. Alternatively, novel plants having modified properties can be generated with the aid of genetic engineering methods (see, for example, EP-A 0 221 044, EP-A 0 131 624). For example, there have been described several cases of genetically engineered changes in crop plants in order to modify the starch synthesized in the plants (for example WO 92/11376, WO 92/14827, WO 91/19806), transgenic crop plants which are resistant to certain herbicides of the glufosinate- (cf., for-example, EP-A 0 242 236, EP-A 0 242 246) or glyphosate-type (WO 92/00377), or of the sulfonylurea-type (EP-A 0 257 993, U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,659), transgenic crop plants, for example cotton, having the ability to produce Bacillus thuringiensis toxins (Bt toxins) which impart resistance to certain pests to the plants (EP-A 0 142 924, EP-A 0 193 259), transgenic crop plants having a modified fatty acid composition (WO 91/13972). Numerous molecular biological techniques which allow the preparation of novel transgenic plants having modified properties are known in principle; see, for example, Sambrook et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; or Winnacker Gene und Klone Genes and Clones, VCH Weinheim, 2nd edition 1996, or Christou, Trends in Plant Science 1 (1996) 423-431). In order to carry out such genetic engineering manipulations, it is possible to introduce nucleic acid molecules into plasmids which allow a mutagenesis or a change in the sequence to occur by recombination of DNA sequences. Using the abovementioned standard processes it is possible, for example, to exchange bases, to remove partial sequences or to add natural or synthetic sequences. To link the DNA fragments with each other, it is possible to attach adaptors or linkers to the fragments. Plant cells having a reduced activity of a gene product can be prepared, for example, by expressing at least one appropriate antisense-RNA, a sense-RNA to achieve a cosuppression effect, or by expressing at least one appropriately constructed ribozyme which specifically cleaves transcripts of the abovementioned gene product. To this end it is possible to employ both DNA molecules which comprise the entire coding sequence of a gene product including any flanking sequences that may be present, and DNA molecules which comprise only parts of the coding sequence, it being necessary for these parts to be long enough to cause an antisense effect in the cells. It is also possible to use DNA sequences which have a high degree of homology to the coding sequences of a gene product but which are not entirely identical. When expressing nucleic acid molecules in plants, the synthesized protein can be localized in any desired compartment of the plant cells. However, to achieve localization in a certain compartment, it is, for example, possible to link the coding region with DNA sequences which ensure localization in a certain compartment. Such sequences are known to the person skilled in the art (see, for example, Braun et al., EMBO J. 11 (1992), 3219-3227; Wolter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85 (1988), 846-850; Sonnewald et al., Plant J. 1 (1991), 95-106). The transgenic plant cells can be regenerated to whole plants using known techniques. The transgenic plants can in principle be plants of any desired plant species, i.e. both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. In this manner, it is possible to obtain transgenic plants which have modified properties by overexpression, suppression or inhibition of homologous (natural) genes or gene sequences or by expression of heterologous (foreign) genes or gene sequences. The compounds (I) according to the invention can preferably be used in transgenic crops which are resistant to herbicides from the group consisting of the sulfonylureas, glufosinate-ammonium or glyphosate-isopropylammonium and analogous active compounds. When using the active compounds according to the invention in transgenic crops, in addition to the effects against harmful plants which can be observed in other crops, there are frequently effects which are specific for the application in the respective transgenic crop, for example a modified or specifically broadened spectrum of weeds which can be controlled, modified application rates which can be used for the application, preferably good combinability with the herbicides to which the transgenic crops are resistant, and an effect on the growth and the yield of the transgenic crop plants. The invention therefore also provides for the use of the compounds (I) according to the invention as herbicides for controlling harmful plants in transgenic crop plants. The novel compounds can be applied in the customary formulations in the form of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, sprayable solutions, dusts or granules. The invention therefore also provides herbicidal and plant growth-regulating compositions comprising compounds of the formula (I). The compounds of the formula (I) can be formulated in various ways depending on the prevailing biological and/or chemico-physical parameters. Examples of suitable formulation options are: wettable powders (WP), water-soluble powders (SP), water-soluble concentrates, emulsifiable concentrates (EC), emulsions (EW), such as oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, sprayable solutions, suspension concentrates (SC), oil- or water-based dispersions, oil-miscible solutions, capsule suspensions (CS), dusts (DP), seed-dressing compositions, granules for broadcasting and soil application, granules (GR) in the form of microgranules, spray granules, coating granules and adsorption granules, water-dispersible granules (WG), water-soluble granules (SG), ULV formulations, microcapsules and waxes. These individual formulation types are known in principle and are described, for example, in Winnacker-Kchler, Chemische Technologie Chemical Technology, Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th. Edition 1986; Wade van Valkenburg, Pesticide Formulations, Marcel Dekker, N.Y., 1973; K. Martens, Spray Drying Handbook, 3rd Ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd. London. The necessary formulation auxiliaries, such as inert materials, surfactants, solvents and other additives, are likewise known and are described, for example, in Watkins, Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers, 2nd Ed., Darland Books, Caldwell N.J., H.v. Olphen, Introduction to Clay Colloid Chemistry; 2nd Ed., J. Wiley Sons, N.Y.; C. Marsden, Solvents Guide; 2nd Ed., Interscience, N.Y. 1963; McCutcheons Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual, MC Publ.

Inc., N.Y. 1964; Schnfeldt, Grenzflchenaktive thylenoxidaddukte Surface-active ethylene oxide adducts, Wiss. Verlagsgesell., Stuttgart 1976; Winnacker-Kchler, Chemische Technologie Chemical Technology, Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th Edition 1986. Based on these formulations it is also possible to produce combinations with other pesticidally active substances, for example insecticides, acaricides, herbicides and fungicides, and also with safeners, fertilizers and/or growth regulators, for example in the form of a ready-mix or tank mix. Wettable powders are preparations which are uniformly dispersible in water and which contain, in addition to the active compound and as well as a diluent or inert substance, surfactants of ionic and/or nonionic type (wetting agents, dispersants), for example polyethoxylated alkyl phenols, polyethoxylated fatty alcohols, polyethoxylated fatty amines, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethersulfates, alkanesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, sodium ligninsulfonate, sodium 2,2-dinaphthylmethane-6,6-disulfonate, sodium dibutylnaphthalenesulfonate or else sodium oleoylmethyltaurinate. To prepare the wettable powders, the herbicidally active compounds are finely ground, for example in customary apparatus such as hammer mills, fan mills and air-jet mills, and are mixed simultaneously or subsequently with the formulation auxiliaries. Emulsifiable concentrates are prepared by dissolving the active compound in an organic solvent, for example butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, xylene or else relatively high-boiling aromatic compounds or hydrocarbons or mixtures of the organic solvents, with the addition of one or more surfactants of ionic and/or nonionic type (emulsifiers). Examples of emulsifiers which can be used are calcium alkylarylsulfonates, such as Ca dodecylbenzenesulfonate, or nonionic emulsifiers, such as fatty acid polyglycol esters, alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, propylene oxide-ethylene oxide condensation products, alkyl polyethers, sorbitan esters, for example sorbitan fatty acid esters or polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters. Dusts are obtained by grinding the active compound with finely divided solid substances, for example talc, natural clays, such as kaolin, bentonite and pyrophyllite, or diatomaceous earth. Suspension concentrates can be water- or oil-based. They can be prepared, for example, by wet milling using commercially customary bead mills, with or without the addition of surfactants as already mentioned above, for example, in the case of the other formulation types. Emulsions, for example oil-in-water emulsions (EW), can be prepared for example by means of stirrers, colloid mills and/or static mixers using aqueous organic solvents and, if desired, surfactants as already mentioned above, for example, in the case of the other formulation types. Granules can be prepared either by spraying the active compound onto adsorptive, granulated inert material or by applying active-compound concentrates to the surface of carriers such as sand, kaolinites or granulated inert material, by means of adhesive binders, for example polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate or else mineral oils. Suitable active compounds can also be granulated in the manner which is customary for the preparation of fertilizer granules, if desired as a mixture with fertilizers. Water-dispersible granules are generally prepared by the customary processes, such as spray-drying, fluidized-bed granulation, disk granulation, mixing using high-speed mixers, and extrusion without solid inert material. For the preparation of disk, fluidized-bed, extruder and spray granules, see for example processes in Spray-Drying Handbook 3rd ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd., London; J. E. Browning, Agglomeration, Chemical and Engineering 1967, pages 147 ff.; Perrys Chemical Engineers Handbook, 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill, New York 1973, pp. 8-57. For further details on the formulation of crop protection products, see for example G. C. Klingman, Weed Control as a Science, John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York, 1961, pages 81-96 and J. D. Freyer, S. A. Evans, Weed Control Handbook, 5th Ed., Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, 1968, pages 101-103. The agrochemical formulations generally contain from 0.1 to 99% by weight, in particular from 0.1 to 95% by weight, of active compound of the formula (I). In wettable powders the concentration of active compound is, for example, from about 10 to 90% by weight, the remainder to 100% by weight consisting of customary formulation constituents. In emulsifiable concentrates the concentration of active compound can be from about 1 to 90%, preferably from 5 to 80%, by weight. Formulations in the form of dusts contain from 1 to 30% by weight of active compound, preferably most commonly from 5 to 20% by weight of active compound, while sprayable solutions contain from about 0.05 to 80%, preferably from 2 to 50%, by weight of active compound. In the case of water-dispersible granules the content of active compound depends partly on whether the active compound is in liquid or solid form and on the granulation auxiliaries, fillers, etc. that are used. In water-dispersible granules the content of active compound, for example, is between 1 and 95% by weight, preferably between 10 and 80% by weight. In addition, said formulations of active compound may comprise the tackifiers, wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, penetrants, preservatives, antifreeze agents, solvents, fillers, carriers, colorants, antifoams, evaporation inhibitors and pH and viscosity regulators which are customary in each case. Suitable active ingredients which can be combined with the active ingredients according to the invention in mixed formulations or in a tank mix are, for example, known active ingredients as described in for example Weed Research 26, 441-445 (1986), or The Pesticide Manual, 11th edition, The British Crop Protection Council and the Royal Soc. of Chemistry, 1997 and in the literature cited therein.

For use, the formulations which are present in commercially available form are, if appropriate, diluted in the customary manner, for example using water in the case of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions and water-dispersible granules. Products in the form of dusts, granules for soil application or broadcasting and sprayable solutions are usually not further diluted with other inert substances prior to use. The application rate of the compounds of the formula (I) required varies with the external conditions, such as temperature, humidity, the nature of the herbicide used and the like. It can vary within wide limits, for example between 0.001 and 10.0 kg/ha or more of active substance, but it is preferably between 0.005 and 5 kg/ha. A. CHEMICAL EXAMPLES Example A1 Dimethyl chlorosulfonylterephthalate At 10 C., a solution of 36.2 g (0.52 mol) of sodium nitrite in 100 ml of water was added over a period of approximately 20 minutes to a solution of 104.6 g (0.5 mol) of dimethyl aminoterephthalate in 500 ml of glacial acetic acid and 165 ml of conc. hydrochloric acid. The mixture was stirred at this temperature for another 10 min, small amounts of undissolved material were filtered off and the filtrate was added dropwise at 15-20 C. and over a period of 35 min to a solution which had been prepared as follows: At room temperature, 8.5 g (0.1 mol) of CuCl 2 in 100 ml of water were added dropwise to 360 ml of conc. hydrochloric acid, and the mixture was cooled to 5 C. A solution of 118.8 g (0.625 mol) of Na 2 S 2 O 5 in 180 ml of water was added dropwise to this mixture. After addition of the diazonium salt solution, the mixture was stirred at 15-20 C. for another 30 min and subsequently poured into 2 l of ice-water. The mixture was extracted with diethyl ether and the ether phase was washed with water, dried and concentrated, giving 118.3 g (81% of theory) of dimethyl chlorosulfonylterephthalate as a brown oil which was used for the following reaction without purification. Example A2 Dimethyl tert-butylsulfamoylterephthalate At 5 C., 59.1 g (0.81 mol) of tert-butylamine were added dropwise to a solution of 118.3 g (0.4 mol) of crude dimethyl chlorosulfonylterephthalate (from Example A1) in 500 ml of dichloromethane, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for another 1 h. The reaction solution was washed with water, dried and concentrated. Trituration of the crude product with heptane gave 106.7 g (81% of theory) of dimethyl tert-butylsulfamoylterephthalate of m.p. 132-134 C. Example A3 tert-Butylsulfamoylterephthalic acid At 50 C., 45.0 g (1.13 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 600 ml of water were added dropwise to a solution of 106.0 g (0.32 mol) of dimethyl tert-butylsulfamoylterephthalate in 1600 ml of methanol. The mixture was stirred at reflux temperature for 2 h and evaporated, the residue was taken up in approximately 500 ml of water and a pH of 1 was established using conc. hydrochloric acid. The precipitated solid was filtered off with suction and dried. This gave 87.4 g (90% of theory) of tert-butylsulfamoylterephthalic acid of m.p. 210-213 C. Example A4 2-tert-Butylsaccharin-6-carbonyl chloride 15.0 g of (0.05 mol) of tert-butylsulfamoylterephthalic acid in 95 ml of thionyl chloride were heated under reflux for 8 h. The mixture was concentrated and the residue was triturated with ethyl acetate. This gave 14.6 g (97% of theory) of 2-tert-butylsaccharin-6-carbonyl chloride of m.p. 185-186 C. Example A5 N-isopropyl-2-tert-butylsaccharin-6-carboxamide At 10 C., 2.6 g (0.044 mol) of isopropylamine were added dropwise to 6.0 g (0.02 mol) of 2-tert-butylsaccharin-6-carbonyl chloride in 30 ml of THF, and the mixture was stirred at 10-15 C. for another 3 h. The mixture was poured into water and extracted with dichloromethane and the organic phase was washed with water, dried and concentrated. This gave 5.6 g (86% of theory) of N-isopropyl-2-tert-butylsaccharin-6-carboxamide of m.p. 152-154 C. Example A6 Methyl 2-tert-butylsulfamoyl-4-isopropylcarbamoylbenzoate 22.0 g (0.068 mol) of N-isopropyl-2-tert-butylsaccharinn-carboxamide were added to a solution of 1.56 g (0.068 mol) of sodium in 250 ml of abs. methanol and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 h. The mixture was concentrated, the residue was taken up in dichloromethane and the solution was washed with 2N HCl and water, dried and concentrated. This gave 20.8 g (86% of theory) of methyl 2-tert-butylsulfamoyl-4-isopropylcarbamoylbenzoate of m.p. 159 to 160 C. Example A7 Methyl 4-isopropylcarbamoyl-2-sulfamoylbenzoate At room temperature, 19.6 g (0.055 mol) of methyl 2-tert-butylsulfamoyl-4-isopropylcarbamoylbenzoate were stirred in 200 ml of trifluoroacetic acid for 3 h. The mixture was concentrated and the residue was triturated with diethyl ether and filtered off. This gave 15.6 g (95% of theory) of methyl 4-isopropylcarbamoyl-2-sulfamoylbenzoate of m.p. 203-205 C.

At room temperature, 2.9 g (19 mmol) of 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene (DBU) were added dropwise, and the mixture was stirred at this temperature for 3 h. The mixture was poured into ice-water and the pH was adjusted to 1 using 2N hydrochloric acid. The precipitated solid was filtered off with suction and washed with water. After drying, 3.9 g (94% of theory) of methyl 2-3-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl)ureidosulfonyl-4-isopropylcarbamoylbenzoate of m.p. 149-151 C. (decomp.) were obtained. Example A9 Methyl 2-3-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl)ureidosulfonyl-4-pyrrolidinocarbonylbenzoate, sodium salt Similarly to Examples A5 to A8, and using pyrrolidine as amine in Example A5, methyl 2-3-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl)ureidosulfonyl-4-pyrrolidinocarbonylbenzoate was prepared first. 0.2 g (1.1 mmol) of a 30% strength sodium methoxide solution in methanol was subsequently added dropwise to 0.5 g (1.0 mmol) of this compound in 15 ml of methanol at room temperature. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h and filtered off with suction, and the residue was washed with methanol and dried. This gave 0.5 g (96% of theory) of methyl 2-3-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl)-ureidosulfonyl-4-pyrrolidinocarbonylbenzoate, sodium salt, of m.p. 233-235 C. (decomp.). Example A 10 N,N-dimethyl-2-tert-butylsulfamoyl-4-carbamoylbenzamide Similarly to Examples A5 to A6, and using ammonia as basic reagent in Example A5, methyl 2-tert-butylsulfamoyl-4-carbamoylbenzoate was prepared first. At room temperature, 3.0 g (0.01 mol) of this compound were subsequently added to a solution of 45 g (1.0 mol) of dimethylamine in 60 ml of methanol, and the reaction mixture was left standing at room temperature for 7 h. The mixture was concentrated and the desired product was isolated by silica gel column chromatography (mobile phase: ethyl acetate; R f 0.2). This gave 1.0 g (31% of theory) of N,N-dimethyl-2-tert-butylsulfamoyl-4-carbamoylbenzamide of a glass-like consistency. Example A11 N,N-dimethyl-4-carbamoyl-2-sulfamoylbenzamide At room temperature, 1.0 g (3.1 mmol) of N,N-dimethyl-2-tert-butylsulfamoyl-4-carbamoylbenzamide in 10 ml of trifluoroacetic acid was stirred for 2.5 h. The mixture was concentrated and the residue was triturated with diethyl ether, filtered off with suction and dried. This gave 0.53 g (63% of theory) of N,N-dimethyl-4-carbamoyl-2- sulfamoylbenzamide of m.p. 202-205 C. Example A12 N,N-dimethyl-2-3-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl)ureidosulfonyl-4-carbamoylbenzamide 0.53 g (2.0 mmol) of N,N-dimethyl-4-carbamoyl-2-sulfamoylbenzamide and 0.59 g (2.2 mmol) of phenyl N-(2,4-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl)carbamate were initially charged in 15 ml of acetonitrile. At room temperature, 0.39 g (2.5 mmol) of 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene (DBU) were added dropwise, and the mixture was stirred at this temperature for 3 h. The mixture was poured into water and a pH of approximately 2 was established using 2 N hydrochloric acid. The aqueous phase was extracted three times with CH 2 Cl 2 . The organic phase was washed with 2 N hydrochloric acid and water, dried and concentrated. The residue was triturated with diisopropyl ether. The mixture was filtered off with suction and dried, giving 0.60 g (67% of theory) of N,N-dimethyl-2-3-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl)ureidosulfonyl-4-carbamoylbenzamide of m.p. 194-196 C. (decomp.). Example A13 N-Allylisopropylamine 20.7 g (0.35 mol) of isopropylamine were added dropwise to a solution of 8.0 g (0.2 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 25 ml of water. The mixture was subsequently admixed dropwise over a period of 1 h with 15.3 g (0.2 mol) of allyl chloride, and the temperature was kept at 35-40 C. during this time. The mixture was heated at 60 C. for a further 2.5 h and then allowed to cool. For work-up, the phases were separated and the aqueous phase was extracted with ether. The organic phases were combined, dried over sodium hydroxide, decantered and distilled. This gave 9.6 g (48% of theory) of colorless N-allylisopropylamine of b.p. 96-98 C. Example A14 2-tert-Butylsulfamoyl-4-dimethylcarbamoylbenzoic acid, potassium salt At 25 C. and with stirring, 254 ml of a 0.25 M aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide were poured into a solution of 19.7 g (63.5 mmol) of 2-tert-butylsaccharin-6-dimethylamide in 235 ml of ethanol. The mixture was subsequently heated under reflux for 6 h, and then allowed to cool and evaporated to dryness. This gave 23.3 g (100% of theory) of 2-tert-butylsulfamoyl-4-dimethylcarbamoylbenzoic acid, potassium salt, of m.p. 260 C. as a colorless solid. Example A15 Ethyl 2-tert-butylsulfamoyl-4-dimethylcarbamoylbenzoate A suspension of 3.0 g (8.2 mmol) of the potassium salt of 2-tert-butylsulfamoyl-4-dimethylcarbamoylbenzoic acid, and 0.21 g (0.79 mmol) of 1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaoxacyclooctane in 25 ml of acetonitrile was stirred at room temperature for half an hour, and 890 mg (8.2 mmol) of bromoethane were then added. The mixture was subsequently heated under reflux for 6 h and then allowed to cool to room temperature. For work-up, the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and extracted with 1 M aqueous hydrochloric acid solution, saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and water. The organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered off and concentrated. This gave 2.31 g (79% of theory) of ethyl 2-tert-butylsulfamoyl-4-dimethylcarbamoylbenzoate as a colorless solid of m.p. 101 to 102.5 C.

C. BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES 1. Pre-Emergence Effect on Weeds Seeds or rhizome pieces of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed plants were placed in sandy loam soil in cardboard pots and covered with soil. The compounds according to the invention which were formulated in the form of wettable powders or emulsion concentrates were then applied to the surface of the soil cover in the form of aqueous suspensions or emulsions at an application rate of 600 to 800 l of water/ha (converted), in various dosages. After the treatment, the pots were placed in a greenhouse and kept under good growth conditions for the weeds. After the test plants had emerged, the damage to the plants or the negative effects on the emergence was scored visually after a test period of 3 to 4 weeks by comparison with untreated controls. As shown by the test results, the compounds according to the invention have a good herbicidal pre-emergence activity against a broad spectrum of grass weeds and dicotyledonous weeds. For example, the compounds of Examples No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 31, 32, 33, 34, 41, 42, 43, 44, 61, 62, 63, 64, 71, 72, 91, 92, 93, 94, 101, 102, 103, 104, 121, 122, 123, 124, 131, 132, 133, 134, 151, 152, 271, 272, 273, 274, 301, 302, 331, 361, 362, 391, 392, 405, 406, 435, 436, 449, 450, 479, 480, 499, 500, 529, 539, 749, 769, 770, 839, 840, 859, 860, 889, 890, 1289, 1290, 1559, 1560, 1561, 1562, 1565, 1566, 1567, 1568, 1569, 1570, 1579, 1599, 1600, 1609, 1619, 1620, 1629, 1630, 1739, 1740, 1749, 1750, 1759, 1760, 1779, 1780, 1799, 1800, 1809, 1810, 1819, 1839, 1840, 1859, 1860, 1869, 1870, 1909, 1910, 1989, 1990, 2003, 2004, 2031, 2043, 2044, 2063, 2064, 2075, 2076, 2087, 2088, 2095, 2103, 2115, 2119, 2120, 2123, 2131, 2132, 2135, 2136, 2139, 2140, 2143, 2167, 2168, 2171, 2172, 2175, 2176, 2179, 2180, 2183, 2184, 2187, 2188, 2192, 2199, 2219, 2227, 2228, 2247, 2251, 2253, 2256, 2276, 2277, 2280, 2281, 2284, 2285, 2304, 2305, 2-1, 2-2, 2-9, 2-10, 2-17, 2-18, 2-25, 2-26, 2-29, 2-30, 2-33, 2-34, 2-37, 2-38 and other compounds of Tables 1 and 2 have a very good herbicidal activity against harmful plants such as Sinapis alba, Chrysanthemum segetum, Avena sativa, Stellaria media, Echinochloa crus - galli, Lolium multiflorum , Setaria spp., Abutilon theophrasti, Amaranthus retroflexus and Panicum miliaceum , pre-emergence at an application rate of 0.3 kg and less of active substance per hectare. 2. Post-Emergence Effect on Weeds Seeds or rhizome pieces of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds were placed in sandy loam soil in plastic pots, covered with soil and grown in a greenhouse under good growth conditions. Three weeks after sowing, the test plants were treated at the three-leaf stage. The compounds according to the invention which were formulated as wettable powders or emulsion concentrates were sprayed, at various dosages, onto the green parts of the plants at an application rate of 600 to 800 l of water/ha (converted). After the test plants had remained in the greenhouse for about 3 to 4 weeks under ideal growth conditions, the effect of the preparations was scored visually by comparison with untreated controls. The agents according to the invention also have a good herbicidal activity post-emergence against a broad spectrum of economically important grass weeds and dicotyledonous weeds. For example, the compounds of Examples No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 31, 32, 33, 34, 41, 42, 43, 44, 61, 62, 63, 64, 71, 72, 91, 92, 93, 94, 101, 102, 103, 104, 121, 122, 123, 124, 131, 132, 133, 134, 151, 152, 271, 272, 273, 274, 301, 302, 331, 361, 362, 391, 392, 405, 406, 435, 436, 449, 450, 479, 480, 499, 500, 529, 539, 749, 769, 770, 839, 840, 859, 860, 889, 890, 1289, 1290, 1559, 1560, 1561, 1562, 1565, 1566, 1567, 1568, 1569, 1570, 1579, 1599, 1600, 1609, 1619, 1620, 1629, 1630, 1739, 1740, 1749, 1750, 1759, 1760, 1779, 1780, 1799, 1800, 1809, 1810, 1819, 1839, 1840, 1859, 1860, 1869, 1870, 1909, 1910, 1989, 1990, 2003, 2004, 2031, 2043, 2044, 2063, 2064, 2075, 2076, 2087, 2088, 2095, 2103, 2115, 2119, 2120, 2123, 2131, 2132, 2135, 2136, 2139, 2140, 2143, 2167, 2168, 2171, 2172, 2175, 2176, 2179, 2180, 2183, 2184, 2187, 2188, 2192, 2199, 2219, 2227, 2228, 2247, 2251, 2253, 2256, 2276, 2277, 2280, 2281, 2284, 2285, 2304, 2305, 2-1, 2-2, 2-9, 2-10, 2-17, 2-18, 2-25, 2-26, 2-29, 2-30, 2-33, 2-34, 2-37, 2-38 and other compounds of the Tables 1 and 2 have a very good herbicidal activity against harmful plants such as Sinapis alba, Echinochloa crus - galli, Lolium multiflorum, Chrysanthemum segetum , Setaria spp., Abutilon theophrasti, Amaranthus retroflexus, Panicum miliaceum and Avena sativa post-emergence at an application rate of 0.3 kg and less of active substance per hectare. 3. Tolerance by Crop Plants In further greenhouse experiments, seeds of a substantial number of crop plants and weeds were placed in sandy loam soil and covered with soil. Some of the pots were treated immediately as described under Section 1, and the remaining pots were placed in a greenhouse until the plants had developed two to three true leaves and then sprayed with various dosages of the substances of the formula (I) according to the invention, as described under Section 2. Visual scoring four to five weeks after the application and after the plants had been in the greenhouse revealed that the compounds according to the invention did not inflict any damage to Gramineae crops such as, for example, barley, wheat, rye, sorghum species, corn or rice when used pre- and post-emergence, even when high dosages of active ingredient were used. Moreover, some substances also left dicotyledonous crops such as, for example, soya, cotton, oil seed rape, sugar beet and potatos unharmed.

Moreover, the invention relates to processes for the preparation of these compounds, to compositions comprising them, and to their use for controlling animal pests and harmful fungi. Compounds of the type I where Y is oxygen and R 2 is unsubstituted or substituted aryl or hetaryl are described in the literature in general form as fungicides (WO-A 95/06,033). However, only compounds which have attached to them an unsubstituted or substituted aryl group which is bonded to the pyridyl radical via oxygen, sulfur, oxymethylene or CH 2 ONC(CH 3 ) are disclosed in this publication. It was an object of the present invention to provide compounds with an improved activity and a broadened spectrum of action. We have found that this object is achieved by the compounds I defined at the outset. Furthermore, we have found processes for the preparation of these compounds, compositions comprising them, and their use for controlling animal pests and harmful fungi. The compounds I can be prepared by various routes, it generally being irrelevant whether the group YNCR 1 R 2 or the radical R is first synthesized. 1. In the preparation of the compounds I where R is C(CO 2 CH 3 )CHCH 3 , C(CO 2 CH 3 )CHOCH 3 or C(CO 2 CH 3 )NOCH 3 , a procedure is followed, for example, in which a pyridinecarboxylic acid of the formula IIa is first converted in a manner known per se into the acid chloride IIb and subsequently into the acid cyanide IIc; IIc is reacted via a Pinner reaction to give the corresponding -keto ester IIIa; IIIa is subsequently reacted with an oxime of the formula IV in the presence of a base to give the corresponding -keto ester IIIb; and IIIb is subsequently converted in a manner known per se either a) with a Wittig or Wittig-Horner reagent of the formula Va into the corresponding compound Ia RC(CO 2 CH 3 )CHOCH 3 , or b) with a Wittig or Wittig-Horner reagent of the formula Vb into the corresponding compound Ib RC(CO 2 CH 3 )CHCH 3 , or c) with O-methylhydroxylamine or a salt thereof (Vc) into the corresponding compound Ic RC(CO 2 CH 3 )NOCH 3 . L 1 in formula IIa is a nucleophilically exchangeable leaving group such as lacuna R in formula IIa is hydrogen or a C 1 -C 4 -alkyl group, in particular hydrogen. P* in formulae Va and Vb is a phosphonate or a phosphonium halide radical which is suitable for a Wittig or Wittig-Horner reaction, in particular PO(OCH 3 ) 2 , PO(OCH 2 CH 3 ) 2 and (C 6 H 5 ) 3 P Cl . Z in formula Vc is the anion of an inorganic acid, especially a halide anion, in particular chloride. 1A. The reaction of the pyridinecarboxylic acid IIa to give the acid chloride IIb is carried out in a manner known per se Houben-Weyl, Supplementary Volume 5, p.59 et seq., 225 et seq. and 664 et seq.; J.Heterocycl.Chem, 30, (1993), 771 by means of customary chlorinating agents at from 0 C. to 150 C., preferably 10 C. to 100 C., in the presence or absence of an inert organic solvent. Suitable chlorinating agents are all reagents customary for this purpose, in particular SOCl 2 , (COCl) 2 , PCl 3 , AlCl 3 and PCl 5 . In general, the chlorinating agents are used in an excess or, if appropriate, as the solvent. Suitable solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane and petroleum ether, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene, halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform and chlorobenzene, nitrites such as acetonitrile and propionitrile, especially preferably halogenated hydrocarbons or mixtures of these. In general, the starting materials are reacted with each other in equimolar amounts. It may be advantageous for the yield to employ the chlorinating agent in an excess based on IIa. The starting materials required for the preparation of the compounds I which are not already known from the literature WO-A 95/06,033; J.Heterocycl.Chem. 30, (1993), 717; DE Appl. No. 19 540 989.2; DE Appl. No. 19 548 370.7 can be prepared in accordance with the literature cited. 1B. The reaction of the acid chloride IIb to give the cyanide IIc is carried out in a manner known per se DE Appl. No. 19 603 990.8 at from 0 C. to 150 C., preferably 10 C. to 100 C., using an inorganic cyanide in an inert organic solvent, if appropriate as a mixture with water, in the presence of a customary phase-transfer catalyst (eg. tetraalkylammonium halides such as tetrabutylammonium chloride or tetrabutylammonium bromide). Suitable inorganic cyanides are cyanides of metals of the first main group or of the sub-groups of the Periodic Table, for example lithium, sodium, potassium, copper and silver, in particular copper and sodium, and inorganic cyanides such as trimethylsilyl cyanide. Suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, o-, m- and p-xylene, nitrites such as acetonitrile and propionitrile, especially preferably methylene chloride and acetonitrile. Mixtures of these may also be used. When using organic cyanides such as trimethylsilyl cyanide, it may be advantageous to carry out the reaction in the presence of an acidic catalyst. Acidic catalysts which are used are Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride, aluminum trichloride, iron(III) chloride, tin(IV) chloride, titanium(IV) chloride and zink(II) chloride, in particular tin(IV) chloride. In general, the starting materials are reacted with each other in equimolar amounts. It may be advantageous for the yield to employ the cyanide in an excess based on IIb. 1C. The reaction of the cyanide IIc to give the -keto ester IIIa is carried out in a manner known per se via a Pinner reaction DE Appl. No. 19 603 990.8 at from 0 C. to 150 C., preferably 10 C. to 100 C., in the presence of an acid in methanol as the solvent. Acids which are used are inorganic acids such as hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid. In general, the acids are used in equimolar amounts or in an excess. The reaction is usually carried out in such a way that the cyanide IIc is first hydrolyzed with aqueous acids (eg. hydrochloric acid) at from 10 C. to 100 C. and the product is subsequently esterified by reaction with methanol, in the presence or absence of a reaction auxiliary (eg. sulfuric acid) and in the presence or absence of a diluent (eg. toluene) at from 10 C. to 150 C. by methods similar to known processes EP-A 493 711. 1D. The reaction of the -keto ester IIIa with the oxime of the formula IV is carried out in a manner known per se at from 0 C. to 150 C., preferably 10 C. to 100 C., in an inert organic solvent in the presence of a base.

The compounds I are distinguished by outstanding efficacy against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi, in particular from the classes of the Ascomycetes, Deuteromycetes, Phycomycetes and Basidiomycetes. Some of them act systemically and can be employed as foliar- and soil-acting fungicides. They are especially important for controlling a large number of fungi on a variety of crop plants such as wheat, rye, barley, oats, rice, maize, grass, bananas, cotton, soybeans, coffee, sugar cane, grapevines, fruit species, ornamentals and vegetables such as cucumbers, beans, tomatoes, potatoes and cucurbits, and on the seeds of these plants. Specifically, they are suitable for controlling the following plant diseases: Erysiphe graminis (powdery mildew) in cereals, Erysiphe cichoracearum and Sphaerotheca fuliginea on cucurbits, Podosphaera leucotricha on apples, Uncinula necator on grapevines, Puccinia species on cereals, Rhizoctonia species on cotton, rice and lawns, Ustilago species on cereals and sugar cane, Venturia inaequalis (scab) on apples, Helminthosporium species on cereals, Septoria nodorum on wheat, Botrytis cinerea (gray mold) on strawberries, vegetables, ornamentals and grapevines, Cercospora arachidicola on peanuts, Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides on wheat, barley, Pyricularia oryzae on rice, Phytophthora infestans on potatoes and tomatoes, Fusarium and Verticillium species on a variety of plants, Plasmopara viticola on grapevines, Pseudocercosporella species in hops and cucumbers, Alternaria species on vegetables and fruit and Mycosphaerella species in bananas. Moreover, the compounds I are suitable for controlling harmful fungi in the protection of materials (eg. wood, paper, paint dispersions, fibers or tissues) and in the protection of stored products. The compounds I are applied by treating the fungi, or the plants, seeds, materials or the soil to be protected against fungal infection, with a fungicidally active amount of the active ingredients. Application is effected before or after infection of the materials, plants or seeds by the fungi. They can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, dusts, powders, pastes and granules. The use form depends on the specific intended use; in any case, it should guarantee fine and uniform distribution of the compound according to the invention. The formulations are prepared in a known manner, eg. by extending the active ingredient with solvents and/or carriers, if desired using emulsifiers and dispersants, it also being possible to use other organic solvents as auxiliary solvents if water is used as the diluent. Suitable auxiliaries are essentially: solvents such as aromatics (eg. xylene), chlorinated aromatics (eg. chlorobenzenes), paraffins (eg. mineral oil fractions), alcohols (eg. methanol, butanol), ketones (eg. cyclohexanone), amines (eg. ethanolamine, dimethylformamide) and water; carriers such as ground natural minerals (eg. kaolins, clays, talc, chalk) and ground synthetic minerals (eg. highly disperse silica, silicates); emulsifiers such as nonionic and anionic emulsifiers (eg. polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, alkylsulfonates and arylsulfonates), and dispersants such as lignin-sulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose. The fungicidal compositions generally comprise from 0.1 to 95, preferably from 0.5 to 90, % by weight of active ingredient. Depending on the nature of the desired effect, the rates of application in crop protection are from 0.01 to 2.0 kg of active ingredient per ha. In the treatment of seed, amounts of active ingredient of from 0.001 to 0.1 g, preferably 0.01 to 0.05 g, are generally required per kilogram of seed. When used in the protection of materials or stored products, the rate of application of active ingredient depends on the nature of the field of application and on the desired effect. Normal rates of application in the protection of materials are, for example, 0.001 g to 2 kg, preferably 0.005 g to 1 kg, of active ingredient per cubic meter of material treated. In the use form as fungicides, the compositions according to the invention can also exist together with other active ingredients, eg. with herbicides, insecticides, growth regulators, fungicides, or else with fertilizers. A mixture with fungicides frequently results in a widened fungicidal spectrum of action.

In this test, the infection level of plants which had been treated with the compounds 1, 3 and 7 according to the invention was 15% and less, while the infection level of the untreated (control) plants was 75%. Activity Against Plasmopara viticola (downy mildew grapevines) Grapevines in pots (cultivar: Mller Thurgau) were sprayed to run off with the preparation of active ingredient (rate of application: 250 ppm). After 8 days, the plants were sprayed with a zoospore suspension of the fungus Plasmopara viticola and kept for 5 days at 20-30 C. and high atmospheric humidity. Thereupon, prior to assessment, the plants were kept for 16 hours at high atmospheric humidity. The test was evaluated visually. In this test, the infection level of the plants which had been treated with the compounds 1, 3 and 7 according to the invention was 15% and less, while the infection level of the untreated (control) plants was 70%.

CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/172,321, filed Oct. 14, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,066,722, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/949,388, filed Oct. 14, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,848, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD The invention relates to certain nucleoside analogues, the use of these compounds as pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds and processes for preparing the compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) catalyses the phosphorolytic cleavage of ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides, for example, those of guanine and hypoxanthine to give the corresponding sugar-1-phosphate and guanine, hypoxanthine, or other purine bases. Humans deficient in purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) suffer a specific T-cell immunodeficiency due to an accumulation of dGTP and its toxicity to stimulated T lymphocytes. Because of this, inhibitors against PNP are immunosuppressive, and are active against T-cell malignancies. Clinical trials are now in progress using 9-(3-pyridylmethyl)-9-deazaguanine in topical form-against soriasis and in oral form for T-cell lymphoma and immunosuppression (BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc). The compound has an IC 50 of 35 nM for the enzyme. In animal studies, a 50 mg/kg oral dose is required for activity in a contact sensitivity ear swelling assay in mice. For human doses, this would mean approximately 3.5 grams for a 70 kg human. With this inhibitor, PNP is difficult to inhibit due to the relatively high activity of the enzyme in blood and mammalian tissues. Nucleoside and deoxynucleoside hydrolases catalyse the hydrolysis of nucleosides and deoxynucleosides. These enzymes are not found in mammals but are required for nucleoside salvage in some protozoan parasites. Purine phosphoribosyltransferases (PPRT) catalyze the transfer of purine bases to 5-phospho--D-ribose-1-pyrophosphate to form purine nucleotide 5-phosphates. Protozoan and other parasites contain PPRT which are involved in essential purine salvage pathways. Malignant tissues also contain PPRT. Some protozoan parasites contain purine nucleoside phosphorylases which also function in purine salvage pathways. Inhibitors of nucleoside hydrolases, purine nucleoside phosphorylases and PPRT can be expected to interfere with the metabolism of parasites and therefore be usefully employed against protozoan parasites. Inhibitors of PNP and PPRT can be expected to interfere with purine metabolism in malignant tissues and therefore be usefully employed against malignant tissues. It is an object of the invention to provide pharmaceuticals which are very effective inhibitors-of PNP, PPRT and/or nucleoside hydrolases.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In one aspect the invention provides compounds having the formula: wherein A is CH or N; B is chosen from OH, NH 2 , NHR, H or halogen; D is chosen from OH, NH 2 , NHR, H, halogen or SCH 3 ; R is an optionally substituted alkyl, aralkyl or aryl group; and X and Y are independently selected from H, OH or halogen except that when one of X and Y is hydroxy or halogen, the other is hydrogen; and Z is OH or, when X is hydroxy, Z is selected from hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, SQ or OQ, Q is an optionally substituted alkyl, aralkyl or aryl group; or a tautomer thereof; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; or an ester thereof; or a prodrug thereof. Preferably when either of B and/or D is NHR, then R is C 1 -C 4 alkyl. Preferably when one or more halogens are present they are chosen from chlorine and fluorine. Preferably when Z is SQ or OQ, Q is C 1 -C 5 alkyl or phenyl. Preferably D is H, or when D is other than H, B is OH. More preferably, B is OH, D is H, OH or NH 2 , X is OH or H, Y is H, most preferably with Z as OH, H or methylthio, especially OH. It will be appreciated that the representation of a compound of formula (I) wherein B and/or D is a hydroxy group used herein is of the enol-type tautomeric form of a corresponding amide, and this will largely exist in the amide form. The use of the enol-type tautomeric representation is simply to allow fewer structural formulae to represent the compounds of the invention. The present invention also provides compounds having the formula: wherein A, X, Y, Z and R are defined for compounds of formula (I) where first shown above; E is chosen from CO 2 H or a corresponding salt form, CO 2 R, CN, CONH 2 , CONHR or CONR 2 ; and G is chosen from NH 2 , NHCOR, NHCONHR or NHCSNHR; or a tautomer thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or an ester thereof, or a prodrug thereof.

The biological availability of a compound of formula (I) or formula (Ia) can be enhanced by conversion into a pro-drug form. Such a pro-drug can have improved lipophilicity relative to the compound of formula (I) or formula (Ia), and this can result in enhanced membrane permeability. One particularly useful form of a pro-drug is an ester derivative. Its utility relies upon the action of one or more of the ubiquitous intracellular lipases to catalyse the hydrolysis of these ester group(s), to release the compound of formula (I) and formula (Ia) at or near its site of action. In one form of a prodrug, one or more of the hydroxy groups in a compound of formula (I) or formula (Ia) can be O-acylated, to make, for example a 5-O-butyrate or a 2,3-di-O-butyrate derivative. Prodrug forms of 5-phosphate ester derivative of a compounds of formula (I) or formula (Ia) can also be made and may be particularly useful, since the anionic nature of the 5-phosphate may limit its ability to cross cellular membranes. Conveniently, such a 5-phosphate derivative can be converted to an uncharged bis(acyloxymethyl) ester derivative. The utility of such a pro-drug relies upon the action of one or more of the ubiquitous intracellular lipases to catalyse the hydrolysis of these ester group(s), releasing a molecule of formaldehyde and the compound of formula (I) or formula (Ia) at or near its site of action. Specific examples of the utility of, and general methods for making, such acyloxymethyl ester pro-drug forms of phosphorylated carbohydrate derivatives have been described, e.g. Kang et al., Nucleosides Nucleotides 17 (1998) 1089; Jiang et al., J. Biol. Chem ., 273 (1998) 11017; Li et al., Tetrahedron 53 (1997) 12017; and Kruppa et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett ., 7 (1997) 945.

This generates a compound of formula (III) wherein Z is as defined for formula (II) where first shown above which is then elaborated following the approach used to prepare 9-deazainosine Lim et al., J.

A compound of formula (VII) wherein R is an alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonyl group or an optionally substituted alkyl- or aryl-carbonyl group and Z is a hydroxy group can also be prepared from a compound of formula (II) wherein Z is a trialkylsilyloxy, alkyldiarylsilyloxy or optionally substituted triarylmethoxy group, by N-alkyl- or aralkyl-carboxylation or N-acylation as above, then selective 5-O-deprotection by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis, catalytic hydrogenolysis, or treatment with a source of fluoride ion (eg tetrabutylammonium fluoride) as required for the 5-O-protecting group in use. The compound of formula (II) wherein Z is a hydrogen atom can be prepared from either: (i) a 5-hydroxy compound of formula (VII) wherein R is an alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonyl group or an optionally substituted alkyl- or aryl-carbonyl group and Z is a hydroxy group, by formation and radical deoxygenation of a 5-O-thioacyl derivative; or (ii) a 5-deoxy-5-halogeno-compound of formula (VII) wherein Z is a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom by reduction, either using a hydride reagent such as tributyltin hydride under free radical conditions, or by catalytic hydrogenolysis, typically with hydrogen over a palladium catalyst; followed by selective N-deprotection by acid- or alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis or catalytic hydrogenolysis as required for the N-protecting group in use. A compound of formula (II) wherein Z is an optionally substituted alkylthio, aralkylthio or arylthio group can be prepared by reaction of a 5-deoxy-5-halogeno or a 5-O-sulfonate derivative of formula (VII) wherein R is an alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonyl group or an optionally substituted alkyl- or aryl-carbonyl group and Z is a halogen atom or an optionally substituted alkyl- or aryl-sulfonyloxy group mentioned above, with an alkali metal or tetraalkylammonium salt of the corresponding optionally substituted alkylthiol, aralkylthiol or arylthiol followed by selective N-deprotection by acid- or alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis or catalytic hydrogenolysis as required for the N-protecting group in use see e.g. Montgomery et al., J.

It will be appreciated that the conversions above are conventional reactions employed in carbohydrate chemistry. Many alternative reagents and reaction conditions can be employed that will effect these conversions, and references to many of these can be found in the Specialist Periodical Reports Carbohydrate Chemistry, Volumes 1-28, published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, particularly in the chapters on Halogeno-sugars, Amino-sugars, Thio-sugars, Esters, Deoxy-sugars, and Nucleosides. Method (B): (2-amino-4-hydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidines) reacting a compound of formula (V) wherein Z is as defined for formula (II) where first shown above, and R is an alkyl group with benzoyl isothiocyanate then methyl iodide in the presence of a base (e.g. DBU or DBN) following the approach used to prepare 9-deazaguanosine and its derivatives see e.g. Montgomery et al., J. Med. Chem., 36 (1993) 55, Lim et al., J. Org. Chem., 48 (1983) 780, and references therein to give a compound of formula (VIII) wherein Z is a trialkylsilyloxy, alkyldiarylsilyloxy or optionally substituted triarylmethoxy group, a hydrogen or halogen atom, SQ or OQ wherein Q is an optionally substituted alkyl, aralkyl or aryl group and R is an alkyl group (typically Z, when a protected hydroxy group, is a tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy, trityloxy or similar group, and R is a methyl or ethyl group) which is then cyclized in the presence of ammonia to give a separable mixture of compounds of formula (IX) wherein D is an amino or methylthio group, and Z and R are as defined for formula (VIII) where first shown above, or Z is a hydroxy group (where for example a tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy group has been cleaved under the reaction conditions) and the product of formula (IX) wherein D is an amino or methylthio group is fully deprotected under acidic conditions by the procedures set out in Method (A). Method (C):(4-aminopyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidines) reacting a compound of formula (IV) wherein Z is as defined for formula (II) where first shown above with aminoacetonitrile under mildly basic conditions, cyclization of the product by reaction with a simple ester of chloroformic acid (typically benzyl chloroformate or methyl chloroformate) to give a compound of formula (X) wherein Z is a trialkylsilyloxy, alkyldiarylsilyloxy or optionally substituted triarylmethoxy group, a hydrogen or halogen atom, SQ or OQ wherein Q is an optionally substituted alkyl, aralkyl or aryl group and R is an aralkyl or alkyl group (typically Z, when a protected hydroxy group, is a tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy, trityloxy or similar group, and R is a benzyl or methyl group) which is then deprotected on the pyrrole nitrogen by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a noble metal catalyst (e.g. Pd/C) in the case of a benzyl group or under mildly basic conditions in the case of a simple alkyl group such as a methyl group, and processed as described above for the transformation (V)(VI)(I) or (V)(VIII)(IX)(I). This method follows the approach used to prepare 9-deazaadenosine and its analogues Lim and Klein, Tetrahedron Lett., 22 (1981) 25, and Xiang et al., Nucleosides Nucleotides 15 (1996) 1821. Method (D): (7-hydroxypyrazolo4,3-dpyrimidinesDaves methodology) reacting a compound of formula (II) as defined where first shown above sequentially with N-chlorosuccinimide and a hindered base (such as lithium tetramethylpiperidide) to form an imine, then condensing this with the anion produced by abstraction of the bromine or iodine atom from a compound of formula (XIb) or (XIc) wherein R 3 is a bromine or iodine atom and R 4 is a tetrahydropyran-2-yl group typically using butyllithium or magnesium, to give a product which is then fully deprotected under acidic conditions (as in Method (A)).

Chem., 44 (1979) 505, and references therein. It will be appreciated that while the tetrahydropyran-2-yl group is favoured as the protecting group for this reaction, other O,N-protecting groups can be used, and that this method will also be applicable to the synthesis of analogous pyrazolo4,3-dpyrimidines bearing substituents at position-5 and/or -7 of the pyrazolo4,3-dpyrimidine ring independently chosen from a hydroxy group, an amino, alkylamino, or aralkylamino group or a hydrogen atom using analogues of compounds of formula (XIb) and (XIc) in which the ionizable hydrogen atoms of any hydroxy or amino groups harry been replaced by a suitable protecting groups. Method (E): (7-hydroxypyrazolo4,3-dpyrimidinesYokoyama method) subjecting a 5-O-ether protected 2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribofuranose derivative, where the 5-ether substituent is typically a trialkylsilyl, alkyldiarylsilyl, an optionally substituted triarylmethyl or an optionally substituted aralkyl group, particularly a tert-butyldimethylsilyl, tert-butyldiphenylsilyl, triisopropylsilyl, trityl or benzyl group, to the following reaction sequence: (i) condensation with the anion produced by abstraction of the bromine or iodine atom from a compound of formula (XIb) or (XIc) from Method (D); (ii) oxidation of the resulting diol to a diketone, typically using a Swern oxidation or a variant thereof using a dimethylsulfoxide-based oxidant (e.g. using a dimethylsulfoxide and trifluoroacetic anhydride reagent combination in dichloromethane solution at low temperature, typically 78 C., followed by triethylamine and warming to room temperature); (iii) double reductive amination to form a 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-ribitol moiety, typically with sodium cyanoborohydride and ammonium formate, ammonium acetate or benzhydrylamine in methanol; and (iv) removal of the protecting groups by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (e.g. with 70% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid) and if required (as in the case of the product made with benzhydrylamine or where an optionally substituted aralkyl group has been used for protecting the primary hydroxyl group in the iminoribitol moiety) hydrogenolysis over a metal catalyst (typically a palladium catalyst) or if desired (as in the case of silyl ether protecting group) exposure to a reagent capable of acting as a source of fluoride ion, e.g. tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran or ammonium fluoride in methanol). Conditions suitable for effecting this sequence of reactions are reported in Yokoyama et al., J. Org. Chem., 61 (1996) 6079, and conditions for double reductive amination with ammonium acetate or benzhydrylamine can be found in Furneaux et al., Tetrahedron 42 (1993) 9605 and references therein. Method (F): (7-hydroxypyrazolo4,3-dpyrimidinesthe Kalvoda method) reacting a compound of formula (II) as defined where first shown above sequentially with N-chlorosuccinimide and a hindered base (such as lithium tetramethylpiperadide) to form an imine, then with a combination of trimethylsilyl cyanide and a Lewis acid (typically boron trifluoride diethyl etherate) followed by acid catalyzed hydrolysis to give a compound of formula (XII) wherein Z is a hydrogen or halogen atom, a hydroxy group, or a group of formula SQ or OQ where Q is an optionally substituted alkyl, aralkyl or aryl group which is then converted by sequential selective N-protection (typically with trifluoroacetic anhydride, di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, benzyl chloroformate, or methyl chloroformate and a base), and O-protection with an acyl chloride or anhydride and a base (typically acetic anhydride or benzoyl chloride in pyridine) to a suitably protected derivative of formula (XIII) wherein R 1 is an alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonyl group or an optionally substituted alkyl- or aryl-carbonyl group, Z is a hydrogen or a halogen atom, a group of formula SQ or OQ where Q is an optionally substituted alkyl, aralkyl or aryl group, or a group of formula R 2 O, and R 2 is an alkylcarbonyl or optionally substituted arylcarbonyl group (typically R 1 will be a trifluoroacetyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl group, and R 2 will be an acetyl or benzoyl group). The carboxylic acid moiety in the resulting compound of formula (XIII) is then transformed into a pyrazolo4,3-dpyrimidin-7-one-3-yl moiety following the method described by Kalvoda Collect. Czech.

Method (G): (7-aminopyrazolo4,3-dpyrimidinesthe Buchanan method) reacting a compound of formula (II) as defined where first shown above sequentially with N-chlorosuccinimide and a hindered base (such as lithium tetramethylpiperadide) to form an imine, which is then transformed into a 7-amino-pyrazolo4,3-dpyrimidine derivative following the approach used to prepare formycin and its analogues by Buchanan and co-workers J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. I (1991) 1077 and references therein by the following sequence of reactions: (i) addition of 3,3-diethoxyprop-1-ynylmagnesium bromide or 3,3-diethoxyprop-1-ynyllithium to the imine; (ii) N-protection, typically with trifluoroacetic anhydride, di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, benzyl chloroformate, or methyl chloroformate and a base; (iii) mild acid hydrolysis to remove the acid sensitive O-protecting groups and convert the diethyl acetal moiety into an aldehydic moiety; (iv) condensation with hydrazine to convert the 3-substituted prop-2-ynal derivative into a 3-substituted pyrazole derivative; (v) acylation, typically with acetic anhydride or benzoyl chloride in pyridine; (vi) nitration, typically with ammonium nitrate, trifluoroacetic anhydride and trifluoroacetic acid, to produce an 3-substituted 1,4-dinitopyrazole derivative; (vii) reaction with a reagent capable of delivering cyanide ion, typically sodium cyanide in aqueous ethanol to cause a cine-substitution of one of the two nitro-groups; (viii) reduction of the residual nitro-group, typically with sodium dithionite or by catalytic hydrogenation over a metal catalyst; (ix) condensation with formamidine acetate to give a compound of formula (XIV) wherein R 1 is an alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonyl group or an optionally substituted alkyl- or aryl-carbonyl group, Z is a hydrogen or a halogen atom, SQ or OQ where Q is an optionally substituted alkyl, aralkyl or aryl group, or a group of formula R 2 O wherein R 2 is an alkylcarbonyl or optionally substituted arylcarbonyl group, A is a nitrogen atom, B is an amino group and D is a hydrogen atom which is thenand O-deprotected by acid- or alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis or catalytic hydrogenolysis as required for the O- and N-protecting groups in use. Method (H): (2-deoxy-analogues) effecting the overall 2 -deoxygenat ion of a compound of formula (I) wherein X and Z are hydroxy groups, Y is a hydrogen atom, and A, B and D are as defined where this formula is first shown above through sequential: (i) selective N-alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonylation (typically with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, benzyl chloroformate, or methyl chloroformate and a base) or N-acylation (typically with trifluoroacetic anhydride and a base) of the 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-iminoribitol moiety in such a compound of formula (I); and (ii) 3,5-O-protection of the resulting product by reaction with 1,3-dichloro-1,1,3,3-tetraisopropyldisiloxane and a base to give a compound of formula (XV): wherein R 1 is an alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonyl group or an optionally substituted alkyl- or aryl-carbonyl group, R 2 is either the same as R 1 or is a hydrogen atom, and A, B and D are as defined for formula (I) where first shown above (iii) 2 -O-thioacylation of the resulting compound of formula (XV) (typically with phenoxythionocarbonyl chloride and a base; or sodium hydride, carbon disulfide and methyl iodide); (iv) Barton radical deoxygenation (typically with tributyltin hydride and a radical initiator); (v) cleavage of the silyl protecting group by a reagent capable of acting as a source of fluoride ion, e.g. tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran or ammonium fluoride in methanol; and (vi) cleavage of the residual N- and O-protecting groups by acid- or alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis or catalytic hydrogenolysis as required for the protecting groups in use. Reagents and reaction conditions suitable for conducting the key steps in this transformation can be found in Robins et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 105 (1983) 4059; Solan and Rosowsky, Nucleosides Nucleotides 8 (1989) 1369; and Upadhya et al., Nucleic Acid Res., 14(1986) 1747. It will be appreciated that a compound of formula (I) has a nitrogen atom in its pyrrole or pyrazole ring capable of undergoing alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonylation or acylation during step (i), or thioacylation during step (ii), depending upon the reaction conditions employed. Should such derivatives be formed, the pyrrole or pyrazole N-substituents in the resulting derivatives are either sufficiently labile that they can be removed by mild acid- or alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis, or do not interfere with the subsequent chemistry in the imino-ribitol moiety, and can be removed during the final deprotection step(s). If desired, this approach can be applied to a compound of formula (XV) as defined above, but additionally bearing N-protecting groups on the pyrazolo- or pyrrolo-pyrimidine moiety.

Suitable conditions for the formation of the acetoxymethyl esters, using acetoxymethyl bromide and diisopropylethylamine in dimethylformamide, can be found in Kruppa et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett ., 7 (1997) 945. When desired, e.g. as when the aforementioned N-benzyloxycarbonyl derivative is not sufficiently soluble in the reaction solvent, this derivative may first be converted into the corresponding stannyl intermediates, e.g. the bis(tributylstannyl) phosphate derivative by reaction with tributyltin methoxide in methanol, prior to reaction with the acyloxymethyl halide in the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide, following the method described by Kang et al., Nucleosides Nucleotides 17 (1998) 1089.

Typically this requires the use of hydrogenolysis conditions for deprotection, so that O- and N-benzyl, -benzyloxymethyl or -benzyloxycarbonyl groups are favoured. FURTHER METHODS Compounds of the invention may also be prepared by other methods as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. FURTHER ASPECTS The compounds of the invention are useful both in free base form and in the form of salts. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts is intended to apply to non-toxic salts derived from inorganic or organic acids including for example salts derived from the following acidshydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, lactic, fumaric, succinic, tartaric, gluconic, citric, methanesulphonic and p-toluenesulphonic acids. The compounds of the invention are potent inhibitors of purine nucleoside phosphorylases, nucleoside hydrolases and/or phosphoribosyltransferases. For example, the IC 50 values for the compounds of formula (Ib) and formula (Ic) are less than 0.1 nM for both calf spleen PNP and human red blood cell PNP. The examples below provide further detail of the effectiveness of this inhibitor. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitory activity can be determined by the coupled xanthine oxidase method using inosine as the purine substrate (H. M. Kalckar, J.) Biol. Chem. 167 (1947) 429-443. Purine phosphoribosyltransferase activity is detected in the same assay using inosine 5-phosphate as the substrate. Slow onset inhibitor binding can be determined using methods such as those described by Merkler et al., Biochemistry 29 (1990) 8358-64. Parasite nucleoside hydrolase activity may be measured inter alia by methods disclosed in published PCT international patent application WO97/31008 and the references cited therein. The potency of the inhibitors of the invention provides important advantages over the prior art because of the relatively high activity of PNP in blood and mammalian tissue. As mentioned above the required dosage of 9-(3-pyridylmethyl)-9-deazaguanine may be of the order of 3.5 grams per dose for a human adult. The present invention provides the advantage that considerably lower quantities of the compounds are required. This allows cost saving and may also reduce unwanted side effects. The amount of active ingredient to be administered can vary widely according to the nature of the patients and the nature and extent of the disorder being treated. Typically the dosage for an adult human will be in the range less than 1 to 1000 milligrams, preferably 0.1 to 100 milligrams. The active compound can be administered with a conventional pharmaceutical carrier and may be administered orally, by injection or topically. The preferred route of administration is oral administration. For administration by this route the compounds can be formulated into solid or liquid preparations, eg tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions and dispersions. Such preparations are well known in the art as are other oral dosage forms not listed here. In a preferred embodiment the compounds of the invention are tableted with conventional tablet bases such as lactose, sucrose and corn starch together with a binder, a disintegration agent and a lubricant. These exipients are well known in the art. The binder may be for example corn starch or gelatin, the disintegrating agent may be potato starch or alginic acid and the lubricant may be magnesium stearate. Other components such as colouring agents and flavouring agents may be included. Liquid forms for use in the invention include carriers such as water and ethanol, with or without other agents such as a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant or suspending agent. The compounds of the invention may also be administered by injection in a physiologically acceptable diluent such as water or saline. The diluent may comprise one or more of other ingredients such as ethanol, propylene glycol, an oil or a pharmaceutically acceptably surfactant. Compounds of the invention may be applied to skin or mucous membranes. They may be present as ingredients in creams, preferably including a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent to assist passage through the skin or mucous membranes. Suitable cream bases are well known to those skilled in the art. The compounds of the invention may be administered by means of sustained release systems for example they may be incorporated into a slowly dissolving tablet or capsule containing a solid or porous or matrix form from a natural or synthetic polymer. EXAMPLES The following examples further illustrate practice of the invention. Ratios of solvents are by volume. Example 1 Preparation of (1S)-1,4-dideoxy-1-C-(4-hydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-1,4-imino-D-ribitol Example 1.1. A solution of 5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (Furneaux et al, Tetrahedron 53 (1997) 2915 and references therein) (2.0 g) in pentane (40 ml) was stirred with N-chlorosuccinimide (1.2 g) for 1 h. The solids and solvent were removed and the residue was dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (40 ml) and cooled to 78 C. A solution of lithium tetramethylpiperidide (25 ml, 0.4 M in tetrahydrofuran) was added slowly dropwise. The resulting solution was then added via cannula to a solution of lithiated acetonitrile prepared by the dropwise addition of acetonitrile (2.08 ml, 40 mmol) to a solution of butyl lithium (29.8 ml, 41.8 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (50 ml) at 78 C., followed by stirring for 45 min and then addition of tetramethylpiperidine (0.67 ml, 4 mmol) at 78 C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 15 min then quenched with water and partitioned between water and chloroform. The organic phase was dried and concentrated, and then chromatography afforded (1S)-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1-C-cyanomethyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (1) (0.83 g). Example 1.2 A solution of the product from Example 1.1 (0.80 g) in dichloromethane (20 ml) containing di-tert-butyldicarbonate (0.59 g) was stirred at room temperature for 16 h. The solution was concentrated and then chromatography afforded (1S)-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1-C-cyanomethyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (2) (0.89 g). Example 1.3 To a solution of the product from Example 1.2 (0.88 g) in N,N-dimethylformamide (5 ml) was added tert-butoxy bis(dimethylamine)methane (1.5 ml) and the solution was heated at 65-70 C. for 1 h. Toluene (20 ml) was added and the solution was washed (3) with water, dried and concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran/acetic acid/water (1:1:1 v/v/v, 40 ml) at room temperature. After 1.5 h chloroform (50 ml) was added and the mixture was washed with water (2), aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and then dried and evaporated to dryness. Chromatography of the residue gave (1S)-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1-C-(1-cyano-2-hydroxyethenyl)-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (3) (0.68 g). Example 1.4 Glycine hydrochloride ethyl ester (0.76 g) and sodium acetate (0.9 g) were added to a stirred solution of the product from Example 1.3 (0.51 g) in methanol (10 ml). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 h and then concentrated to dryness. Chromatography of the residue gave the (1S)-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1-C-1-cyano-2-(ethoxycarbonylmethylamino)ethenyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (4) (0.48) g as a diastereomeric mixture. Example 1.5 A solution of the product from Example 1.4 (0.28 g) in dry dichloromethane (12 ml) containing 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene (1.5 ml) and benzyl chloroformate (0.74 ml) was heated under reflux for 8 h, then cooled and washed with dilute aqueous HCl, aqueous sodium bicarbonate, dried and concentrated. Chromatography of the residue afforded (1S)-1-C-3-amino-1-N-benzyloxycarbonyl-2-ethoxycarbonyl-4-pyrrolyl-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (5) (0.22 g). Example 1.6 A solution of the product from Example 1.5 (0.22 g) in ethanol (10 ml) was stirred with 10% Pd/C (50 mg) in an atmosphere of hydrogen for 3 h. The solids and solvent were removed and the residue was dissolved in ethanol (10 ml) containing formamidine acetate (0.40 g) and the solution was heated under reflux for 8 h. The solvent was removed and chromatography of the residue gave (1S)-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1,4-dideoxy-1-C-4-hydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (6) (156 mg). Example 1.7 A solution of the product from Example 1.6 (66 mg) in trifluoroacetic acid (3 ml) was allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. The solution was concentrated and a solution of the residue in water was washed (2) with chloroform and then evaporated. The residue was dissolved in methanol and treated with Amberlyst-A21 base resin until the solution was pH7. The solids and solvent were removed and the residue was dissolved in water, treated with excess aqueous HCl and then lyophilized. Trituration of the residue with ethanol gave (1S)-1,4-dideoxy-1-C-(4-hydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-1,4-imino-D-ribitol (7) hydrochloride salt as a white solid (25 mg). Recrystallised from 90% ethanol, the crystalline solid darkened but did not melt below 300 C.

Example 2 Preparation of (1S)-1-C-(2-amino-4-hydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-ribitol Example 2.1 A solution of (1S)-1-C-3-amino-1-N-benzyloxycarbonyl-2-ethoxycarbonyl-4-pyrrolyl-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1,4dideoxy 1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (Example 1.5) (0.87 g) in ethanol was stirred with 10% Pd/C (100 mg) in an atmosphere of hydrogen for 1.5 h. The solids and solvent were removed to give a residue (0.61 g). To a solution of a portion of this residue (0.12 g) in dichloromethane (10 ml) at 0 C. was added a solution of benzoyl isothiocyanate in dichloromethane (31 mL in 1 ml). After 0.5 h the solution was warmed to room temperature and 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene (80 mL) and methyl iodide (100 mL) were added. After another 0.5 h the reaction solution was applied directly to a silica gel column and elution afforded 0.16 g of (1S)-1-C-3-(N-benzoyl-S-methylisothiocarbamoyl)amino-2-ethoxycarbonyl-4-pyrrolyl-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol. Example 2.2 A solution of this S-methylisothiocarbamoylamino derivative, (0.20 g) in methanol saturated with ammonia was heated in a sealed tube at 95 C. for 16 h. The solvent was removed and chromatography of the residue afforded (1S)-1-C-2-amino-4-hydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl -N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol. Example 2.3 A solution of this protected iminoribitol (64 mg) in trifluoroacetic acid was allowed to stand at room temperature for 16 h. The solvent was removed and a solution of the residue in aqueous methanol (1:1) was treated with Amberlyst A21 base resin until the pH of the solution was 7. The solids and solvent were removed and a solution of the residue in water was treated with excess HCl and then concentrated to dryness. Trituration with ethanol gave (1S)-1-C-(2-amino-4-hydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-ribitol hydrochloride salt (24 mg), which darkened at ca. 260 C. but did not melt below 300 C.

Example 25 Enzyme Inhibition Results Example 25.1 Inhibition of Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylases Enzyme assays were conducted to assess the effectiveness of the products of Examples 1 and 2 (compounds Ib and Ic respectively) as inhibitors of purine nucleoside phosphorylase. The assays used human RBC and calf spleen purine nucleoside phosphorylase (ex Sigma, 90% pure) with inosine as substrate, in the presence of phosphate buffer, with detection of released hypoxanthine using xanthine oxidase coupled reaction. Materials. Inosine was obtained from Sigma. Xanthine oxidase (EC 1.1.3.22, buttermilk), human erythrocyte (as a lyophilized powder) and bovine spleen (in 3.2 M ammonium sulfate) purine nucleoside phosphorylases (EC 2.4.2.1) were purchased from Sigma. Human purine nucleoside phosphorylases obtained as a powder was reconstituted in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and rapidly frozen and stored at 80 C. Kinetic experiments were performed on a Uvikon 933 double beam ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments, San Diego, Calif.). Protein Concentrations. Protein concentrations for both isozymes were determined based on the quantative ultraviolet absorbance, using E 1cm 1%9.64 at 280 nm Stoelkler et al, Biochemistry, 32 (1978) 278 and a monomer moleculer weight of 32,000 Williams et al, Nucleic Acids Res. 12 (1984) 5779. Enzyme Assay. Enzymes were assayed spectrophotometrically using the coupled xanthine oxidase method Kalckar, J. Biol. Chem. 167 (1947) 429; Kim et al, J. Biol. Chem., 243 (1968) 1763. Formation of uric acid was monitored at 293 nm. A 40 mM inosine solution gave an absorbance change of 0.523 units at 293 m, upon complete conversion of inosine to uric acid and ribose 1-phosphate. Unless otherwise noted, the standard assay reaction contained: inosine (500 M), potassium phosphate (50 mM, pH 7.5); xanthine oxidase (0.06 units) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase in a final volume of 1.0 mL. One-Third-the-Sites Inhibition. Reaction mixtures of 6.7 nM bovine purine nucleoside phosphorylase containing varying amounts of compound Ib were pre-incubated at 30 C. for 1 hour. Reactions were initiated by addition of substrate (40 M inosine, 3 times the K m value) and assayed at 30 C. The reaction containing 0.6 nM inhibitor (concentration ratio of compound Ib/purine nucleoside phosphorylase0.09) showed 29% inhibition, that containing 1 nM inhibitor (compound Ib/purine nucleoside phosphorylase0.15) showed 44%, whereas the reaction containing 3 nM inhibitor (compound Ib/purine nucleoside phosphorylase0.44) had a rate decrease of 96%, and that containing 6 nM inhibitor (compound Ib/purine nucleoside phosphorylate87%) showed 99% inhibition. These interactions are shown in FIG. 1 . Purine nucleoside phosphorylase is known to be a homotrimer with a catalytic site on each of the three protein subunits Stoelkler et al, Biochemistry 32, (1978) 278. When the concentration of enzyme subunits is 6.7 nM, 50% inhibition of purine nucleoside phosphorylase occurs at approximately 1.1 nM. This result demonstrates that compound Ib binds tightly and that binding of compound Ib to one site of the trimeric enzyme leads to complete inhibition. Activity Recovery from the Complex of Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase with Compound Ib. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (6.7 M) and sufficient compound Ib (3 M) to inhibit 96% of purine nucleoside phosphorylase activity were incubated at 30 C. for 1 hour. An aliquot of this solution was diluted 1000-fold into a buffered solution of 500 M inosine containing xanthine oxidase (0.06 units). The production of uric acid was monitored over time and the progres curve was fit to the kinetic model of FIG. 2 . Dilution of inhibited purine nucleoside phosphorylase into a large volume of solution without inhibitor provided the rate of release of compound Ib from inhibited purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Under conditions of the experiment in FIG. 2 , the time to achieve the new enzyme-inhibitor equilibrium is 5000 sec, an indication of a slow, tight-binding inhibitor Morrison and Walsh, Advances Enzymol. 61 (1988) 201. The rate contant k 6 is an estimate of the apparent first-order rate constant for dissociation of the complex under these experimental conditions and is 2.910 4 sec 1 in this example. Inhibitory Mechanism. Slow, tight-binding inhibitors generally follow the kinetic mechanism Morrison and Walsh, Advances Enzymol. 61 (1988) 201: where EI is a rapidly formed, initial collision complex of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (E) and compound Ib (I) that slowly isomerizes to a tighter complex EI*. Product formation curves are described by the following integrated rate equation 1: Pv s t(v o v s )(1e kt )/k1 where P is the amount of product hypoxanthine (observed as uric acid in the present assay system), t is time, v o is the initial rate, v s is the final steady-state rate and k is the overall (observed) rate constant given by equation 2: kk6k5(I/K i )/(1(S/K m )(I/K i where K m is the Michaelis complex for purine nucleoside phosphorylase, S is inosine concentration, I is the concentration of compound Ib and K i is as described below. The rate of formation of the tightly bound complex is k5 and the rate of its dissociation is k6. K i , the inhibition constant for standard competitive inhibition (which influences v o ) and K i *, the overall inhibition constant (which influences v.), are defined as: K i k4/k3 K i *K i k 6 /(k 5 k 6 ) Determination of K i *. K i * was determined by measuring v s for reactions at a range of inhibitor concentrations, plotting v s vs I and fitting the curve to the competive inhibition equation 3: v s V max S/K m (1I/K i *)S3 where V max is the uninhibited reaction rate for purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and the remaining terms are described above. The result of this analysis indicates an overall effective inhibition constant (K i *) of 2.50.210 11 M (252 pM) for compound Ib (FIG. 3 ). Approximation of K i , k 5 and k6. Calculation of K i directly from v o and the competitive inhibition equation (above) is difficult for compound Ib because v o changes very little as a function of I at inhibitor concentrations which cause complete inhibition following slow onset. This result establishes that the initial dissociation constant K i is much greater than the equilibrium dissociation constant K i *. Approximations of k 5 and K i were calculated from k (values obtained from curve fits of equation 1, FIG. 4 ) by using equation 2. Using the knowledge that k 6 k 5 (I/K i )/(1(A/K m )(I/K i ), equation 2 can be rearranged so that a double reciprocal plot of 1/k vs 1/I gives a straight line with y intercept1/k 5 and x intercept of (1/k 5 )/K i /k 5 )*(A/K m )). Substitution of these values into equation 2 give an approximation for k 6 . FIG. 4 demonstrates the slow-onset, tight-binding inhibition which occurs when a small concentration of enzyme (0.8 nM) competes for 200 nM compound Ib in the presence of 500 M inosine. Under these conditions the apparent first order rate constant for onset of inhibition in FIG. 4 was 2610 4 sec 1 . The result of FIG. 4 demonstrates that even at inosine concentrations over 100 times that present in human serum or tissues, compound Ib can give 99% inhibition of the enzyme after several minutes of slow-onset inhibition. Based on analyses of experiments of the type shown in FIGS. 1-4 , the experimentally estimated dissociation constants and rates for the bovine purine nucleoside hosphorylase with compound Ib are: K m 15 M K i 194 nM K i *252 pM k 5 1.40.210 2 sec 1 k 6 1.80.510 5 sec 1 Inhibition of Human Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase. Studies similar to those described above for the interaction of bovine purine nucleoside phosphorylase were conducted with purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) from human erythrocytes. The values for the overall inhibition constant, K i *, for the interaction of human and bovine PNP with compound Ib are: enzyme K i *, compound Ib K i *, compound Ic human PNP 72 26 pM 29 8 pM bovine PNP 23 5 pM 30 6 pM The compound Ic is a more efficient inhibitor for the human enzyme than compound Ib, but compound Ib is slightly more efficient at inhibiting the bovine enzyme. Compounds Ib and Ic are more efficient at inhibiting both PNP enzymes than previously reported compounds. Summary of Compounds Ib and Ic as Inhibitors of Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylases. Inhibitors usually function by binding at every catalytic site to cause functional inhibition in living organisms. The one-third-the-sites inhibition and the slow-onset tight-binding inhibition described above indicate that compounds Ib and Ic are very potent inhibitors of purine nucleoside phosphorylases able to function in the presence of a large excess of substrate. The methods for the determination of the kinetic constants are given in detail in Merkler, D. J., Brenowitz, M., and Schramm, V. L. Biochemistry 29 (1990) 8358-8364. Example 25.2 Oral Availability and in vivo Efficacy of Compound Ib as a PNP Inhibitor. A single oral dose of 10 7 mole of Compound Ib (27 g) was administered with food to a young adult male mouse. Blood samples were collected from the tail at times indicated in FIG. 5 . Dilution of blood into saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (final concentration 0.15%) resulted in lysis of blood cells and release of enzyme. PNP activity was measured with inosine and phosphate as substrates as indicated above. The results establish that Compound Ib is absorbed into the blood and taken up by blood cells to cause PNP inhibition with a half-time (t ) of 14 minutes. Blood samples were taken for an extended time and analyzed for PNP activity to determine the biological t for Compound Ib for inhibitors of blood PNP. The activity of blood PNP recovered with a t of 100 hours. These results establish that Compound Ib is orally available and has an extended period of biological effectiveness. These tests establish that the compounds described herein have favorable pharmacological lifetimes. Inhibition of Protozan Nucleoside Hydrolases by Compounds Ib and Ic. Protozan parasites use the hydrolysis of purine nucleosides such as inosine to provide purine bases such as hypoxanthine to provide essential precursors for RNA and DNA synthesis. Protozoan parasites are purine auxotrophs. Using inhibition methods similar to those described above, a nucleoside hydrolase from Crithidia fasciculata Parkin, et al, J Biol, Chem. 266 (1991) 20658 and a nucleoside hydrolase from Trypanosoma brucei brucei Parkin, J. Biol. Chem. (1996) 21713 were tested for inhibition by compounds Ib and Ic. The inhibition of nucleoside hydrolase from C. fasciculata by Compound Ib is exemplified in FIG. 6 . Similar studies indicated that Coumpound Ib and Ic are nanamolar inhibitors for nucleoside hydrolases from C. fasciculata and from T. brucei brucei . Compound Ic (ACH, BNH 2 , DH, XOH, YH, ZOH) is a nanamolar inhibitor of both enzymes and Compound Va (ORNH 2 , zOH, CO 2 BuH or H 2 , and the isopropylidine group removed to form two hydroxyl groups) is also a nanamolar inhibitor of both enzymes. The results are summarised below.

The inhibitors bind in direct competition with substrate, therefore the K i inhibition constants are direct competitive inhibition values. The compounds provide sufficient inhibition to the purine nucleoside hydrolases to inhibit protozoan parasites at readily accessible pharmacological doses. The methods and materials used are as described in published PCT international application WO 97/31008 using p-nitrophenyl riboside as substrate. Example 25.3 Inhibition of Purine Phosphoribisyl Transferases (PPRT) by 5-Phosphates of Compounds Ib and Ic. Protozoan parasites, human tissues and tumors use PPRT for salvage of purine bases. Interruption of PPRT activity is expected to disrupt purine metabolism in these systems. 5-phosphorylated Compounds I and Ic were anlyzed for inhibition of PPRT from human and malarial origins. The slow-onset inhibition curve for the 5-phosphate of Compound Ib with malaria PPRT is illustrated in FIG. 7 . The K i * determination for the 5-phosphate of Compound Ib with malarial PPRT is shown in FIG. 8 . Analysis of both human and malarial enzymes with the 5-phosphates of Compounds Ib and Ic are summarized below. enzyme Compound Ib-5-phosphate Compound Ic-5-phosphate source K i K i * K i K i * PPRT human 40 nM 3 nM 14 nM 8 nM PPRT 33 nM 3 nM 48 nM slow onset malaria not observed Full inhibition studies indicated that the inhibitors are competitive with IMP. The nanamolar inhibition constants for both inhibitors with both enzymes are readily accessible pharmacologic doses of these inhibitors. It is anticipated that the nucleoside kinase activities of human and/or parasitic organisms will convert one or more of the compounds described herein to the respective 5-phosphates. These compounds thereby provide precursors for pharmacologic doses of the 5-phosphates for intracellular interruption of PPRT activity. The cellular uptake of Compounds I and Ic have been documented with mice and with human red cells.

Example 36 Preparation of (1S)-1,4-dideoxy-1-C-(2,4-dihydroxypyrrolo-3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-1,4-imino-D-ribitol Example 36.1 2,4-Dihydroxy-6-methyl-5-nitropyrimidine (G. N. Mitchell and R. L. McKee, J. Org. Chem ., 1974, 39, 176-179) (20 g) was suspended in phosphoryl chloride (200 ml) containing N,N-diethylaniline (20 ml) and the mixture was heated under reflux for 2 h. The black solution was concentrated to dryness and the residue was partitioned between water (600 ml) and ether (150 ml). The aqueous phase was further extracted with ether (150 ml) and the combined organic phases were washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate and processed conventionally to give 2,4-dichloro-6-methyl-5-nitropyrimidine (23.1 g). Example 36.2 To a solution of the product of Example 36.1 (17 g) in benzyl alcohol (80 ml) was added a 1.1 M solution of sodium benzylate in benzyl alcohol (199 ml). After 1 h at room temperature, ether (500 ml) was added and the solution was washed with water. The organic phase was dried and concentrated to dryness under high vacuum. The crude residue in dry N,N-dimethylformamide (100 ml) and N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (25 ml) was heated at 100 C. for 3 h and then the solution was concentrated to dryness. Trituration of the residue with ethanol and filtration afforded 2,4-dibenzyloxy-6-(2-dimethylaminovinyl)-5-nitropyrimidine as an orange solid (24.5 g). Example 36.3 Zinc dust (30 g) was added to a solution of the product from Example 36.2 (20 g) in acetic acid (300 ml) with cooling to control the exotherm. The resulting mixture was then stirred for 2 h, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to dryness. The residue was partioned between chloroform and aqueous sodium bicarbonate, the organic layer was dried and then concentrated to dryness to give a solid residue of 2,4-dibenzyloxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidine (15.2 g). Example 36.4 Sodium hydride (0.5 g, 60% dispersion in oil) was added to a solution of the product from example 36.3 (2.0 g) in tetrahydrofuran (40 ml) followed by tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (1.37 g) and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. The reaction was quenched with dropwise addition of water and then partitioned between ether (100 ml) and water (150 ml). The organic phase was dried and concentrated to dryness. A solution of the residue in dichloromethane (40 ml) was stirred while N-bromosuccinimide added slowly poriton-wise until t.l.c. analysis indicated complete conversion to a less polar product. The solution was washed with water, aqueous sodium bicarbonate, dried and concentrated. Chromatography of the residue afforded 2,4-dibenzyloxy-7-bromo-9-N-tert-butyldimethylsilylpyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidine as a white solid (1.8 g). Example 36.5 An imine was prepared from 5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (0.30 g) by N-chlorination with N-chlorosuccinimide followed by elimination of hydrogen chloride with lithium tetramethylpiperidide as described in Example 1.1, but with the following modifications: (i) when addition of the solution of lithium tetramethylpiperidide was complete, petroleum ether was added and the solution was washed with water, dried and concentrated to dryness; (ii) the residue was chromatographed on silica gel eluted with 0.2% triethylamine and 30% ethyl acetate in hexanes to afford the pure imine (0.215 g). A solution of this imine in ether (2 ml) was added to a solution prepared by slow addition of butyllithium (1.4 M in hexanes) to a solution of the product from Example 36.4 (0.786 g) in anisole (20 ml) and ether (30 ml) at 70 C. until t.l.c. analysis indicated lithium exchange with the starting material was complete. The mixture was allowed to slowly warm to 15 C., and then was washed with water, dried and concentrated. Chromatography of the residue afforded (1S)-1-C-)2,4-dibenzyloxy-9-N-tert-butyldimethylsilylpyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (0.225 g). Example 36.6 A solution of the product from Example 36.5 (0.10 g) in ethanol (5 ml) was stirred in a hydrogen atmosphere with 10% palladium on charcoal (0.05 g) for 2 h. The solids and solvent were removed and concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid (1 ml) was added to a solution of the residue in methanol (5 ml). After standing overnight, the solution was concentrated to dryness and the residue was extracted with ether and then triturated with ethanol and filtered to give (1S)-1,4-dideoxy-1-C-)2,4-dihydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-li4-imino-D-ribitol hydrochloride (0.025 g). 13 C NMR (D 2 O), (ppm) : 159.8 (C), 155.8 (C), 137.1 (C), 131.4 (CH), 114.2 (C), 104.1 (C), 76.2 (CH), 73.7 (CH), 68.5 (CH), 61.6 (CH 2 ) and 58.5 (CH). Example 37 Preparation of 1,4-dideoxy-(1S)-1-C-(2,4-dihydroxypyrrolo-3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-1,4-imino-D-ribitol 5-phosphate bis-ammonium salt Example 37.1 A solution tetrabutylammonium fluoride (1 M, 0.5 ml) was added to a solution of the bis-silylated product from Example 36.5 (110 mg) in tetrahydrofuran. After 2 h, the solution was diluted with toluene, washed with water (2), dried, and evaporated to dryness. The resulting syrup was dissolved in methanol and tert-butoxycarbonic anhydride (65 mg) was added. After 30 min, the reaction mixture was concentrated to dryness and subjected to chromatography to give (1S)-1-C-(2,4-dibenzyloxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (64 mg). Example 37.2 The product for Example 37.2 (64 mg) was converted by the method detailed in Example 33 into, 1,4-dideoxy-(1S)-1-C-(2,4-dihydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-1,4-imino-D-ribitol 5-phosphate bis-ammonium salt (11 mg); 13 C-NMR (D 2 O), (ppm): 156.0 (C), 151.9 (C), 134.0 (C), 127.3 (CH), 110.9 (C), 102.8 (C), 75.1 (CH), 70.4 (CH), 65.1 (CH), 61.9 (CH 2 ), and 54.5 (CH).

The invented RAR antagonists can be administered to mammals, including humans, for the purpose of preventing or diminishing action of RAR agonists on the bound receptor sites. Specifically, the RAR agonists are administered or coadministered with retinoid drugs to prevent or ameliorate toxicity or side effects caused by retinoids or vitamin A or vitamin A precursors. The retinoid negative hormones can be used to potentiate the activities of other retinoids and nuclear receptor agonists. For example, the retinoid negative hormone called AGN 193109 effectively increased the effectiveness of other retinoids and steroid hormones in in vitro transactivation assays. Additionally, transactivation assays can be used to identify compounds having negative hormone activity. These assays are based on the ability of negative hormones to down-regulate the activity of chimeric retinoid receptors engineered to possess a constitutive transcription activator domain.",

formula (I): which comprises adsorbing said compound, contained into an aqueous solution resulting from fermentation broths or process streams, on an adsorbent polymeric resin having a styrenic or acrylic matrix and subsequently desorbing the said compound by eluting the resin with suitable mixture of water with a water-miscible organic solvent. This application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. 371 of PCT/EP96/05392, filed Apr. 12, 1996. The present invention refers to a new process for the purification of the compound 11-21-dihydroxy-2-methyl-5H-pregna-1,4-dieno17,16-d-oxazoline-3,20-dione of formula I; The above compound is related to deflazacort (INNInternational Nonproprietary Name), in that the acetate moiety on the C-21 of deflazacort is substituted by a hydroxy moiety. Deflazacort is a compound employed in therapy since some years as a calcium-sparing gluco-corticoid agent. These compounds belong to the more general class of pregneno-oxazolines, for which anti-inflammatory, glucocorticoid and hormone-like pharmaceological activities are reported. Examples of compounds of the above class are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,413,286 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,440,764. The preparation of the compound of formula I is disclosed in EP-B-322630, wherein said compound is referred to as 11-21-dihydroxy-2-methyl-5H-pregna-1,4-dieno17,16-doxazoline-3,20-dione. According to the fermentation process disclosed in the above cited EP-B-322630, 2-methyl-4-pregnen-21-ol-17a,16a-doxazolinyl-3,20-dione or 2-methyl-4-pregnen-21-acetyloxy-17a,16a-doxazolinyl-3,20-dione is contacted with a sequentially growing mixed culture of a Curvularia strain and an Arthrobacter strain. More in particular, according to a preferred embodiment, the above compound is added to a growing culture of C. lunata NRRL 2380 in a suitable fermentation medium after 12-24 hours from inoculum, and, after 48-72 hours from inoculum, a growing culture of A. simplex ATCC 6946 of 18-36 hours is added to the mixture and further cultivated for 40-55 hours; the fermentation is carried out under submerged conditions, temperature is kept between 27 C. and 32 C. and pH between 6 and 8; the fermentation product of formula I is then recovered by extracting the fermentation broth with an organic solvent (e.g. chloroform), concentrating the organic extracts and precipitating the compound by adding a non-solvent (e.g. petroleum ether). As the concentration of the compound of formula I in the fermentation broth is very low, high amounts of organic solvent are necessary for completely extracting the compound. The use of high amounts of organic solvents, in particular halogenated solvents, may give rise to some problems, with respect to the safety, industrial hygiene and environment protection. It has now been found that the compound of formula I can be conveniently recovered from an aqueous solution resulting from fermentation broths or process streams, by adsorbing the compound contained in said aqueous solution on an adsorbent polymeric resin having a styrenic or acrylic matrix and subsequently desorbing the said compound by eluting the resin with a suitable mixture of water with a water-miscible organic solvent. Typical aqueous solutions containing the compound of formula I accompained by undesired products are the filtered fermentation broths from the suitable mycelia, optionally together with the aqueous washings of said mycelia, or partially purified process streams. Examples of the undesired accompanying products are colored impurities, side-products, unhexausted starting materials, salts and water soluble components of the fermentation media. In particular, the purification process of the present invention may conveniently be applied for recovering the compound of formula I from the filtered fermentation broth obtained from the fermentation process disclosed in EP-B-322630. Suitable resins for the present purification process will have an average particle size of about 20-50 mesh and the following average physical characteristics: Porosity volume: about 30%-75%; Surface Area: about 140-800 m 2 /g; Skeletal Density: about 1.06-1.10 g/ml (styrenic resin) about 1.20-1.26 g ml (acrylic resins); Average pore diameter: about 20-100 . Examples of adsorbent styrenic based polymeric resins suitable for the above recovering process are the commercially available resins such as Kastel S/112 (Dow Chemical), Amberlite XAD/2, XAD/4 or XAD/16 (Rohm Haas), or the like. Examples of adsorbent acrylic based polymeric resins suitable for the above recovering process are the commercially available resins such as Kastel S/221 or S/223 (Dow Chemical), Amberlite XAD/7 or XAD/8 (Rohm Haas), and the like. In general for the process of the present invention, the acrylic based polymeric resins are preferably employed, particularly preferred being those having a particle size of about 20-50 mesh and the following average physical characteristics: Porosity volume: about 30%-60% Surface Area: about 350-550 m 2 /g; Skeletal Density: about 1.24-1.25 g/ml; Average pore Diameter: about 20-80 . Examples of adsorbent acrylic based polymeric resins with the above characteristics which may be suitably employed are the previously mentioned Kastel S/221 and Amberlite XAD/7. Particularly preferred for the present purification process is an acrylic based polymeric resins having a particle size of about 20-50 mesh and the following average physical characteristics: Porosity volume: about 30%-60% Surface Area: about 350-550 m 2 /g; Skeletal Density: about 1.25 g/ml; Average pore Diameter: about 20-40 . For instance, the commercially available resin Kastel S/221 may suitably be employed. Suitable eluting mixtures are mixtures from 0% to 80% of water with a water miscible organic solvent such as lower ketones (e.g. acetone, ethylmethylketone); lower alcohols (e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol); and the like. Preferably, mixtures from 10% to 50% of water with one of the above organic solvents are employed, particularly preferred being a mixture containing about 30% of water Acetone is the preferred solvent. When the process of the present invention is employed for the purification of the compound of formula I obtained according to the fermentation process as described in EP-B-322630, the following general procedure may conveniently be applied. When the said fermentation process is completed, the fermentation mass is first filtered according to the known techniques. The mycelial cake is repeatedly washed with water and the washings are then combined with the filtered broth. Alternatively, the mycelium can be washed with an organic solvent selected from those previously listed, in order to recover the activity contained therein; in this case, the washings are combined with the filtered broth only after having removed the solvent, e.g. by stripping under vacuum. The filtered broth combined with the washings is then applied on the top of a column containing the adsorbing resin; in general, the eluted solution contains only traces of product. The resin is then washed with water for eliminating salts and other water-soluble impurities (as above, also this washing water will generally contain only traces of the product). The compound of formula I is then desorbed from the resin, by eluting with a mixture of water and an organic solvent as above defined, preferably a mixture 30/70 water/acetone. The eluate is concentrated and the product is recovered by filtration. With this procedure the major amount of product is recovered from the filtered broth; as a general indication, more than 90% of the total amount of the desired compound initially applied on the column is recovered with this first elution. The remaining amount can be recovered by repeating the above procedure after having combined the mother liquors from the first elution and the washings with water. The total recovery yield is about 96%. For better illustrating the invention, the following examples are given. EXAMPLE 1 SEQUENTIAL GROWTH OF C. LUNATA AND A. SIMPLEX I) Slant Media Sabouraud medium (for C. lunata ) Antibiotic Agar No. 1 (for A. simplex ) II) Vegetative and pre-culture media a) for C. lunata Soybean meal 13 g/l KH 2 PO 4 5 g/l Dextrose 10 g/l Peptone 5 g/l pH adjusted to 6.5-7.5 before autoclaving; b) for A. simplex Dextrose 1.0 g/l Soybean meal 5.0 g/l Peptone 5.0 g/l Basamin Busch 3.0 g/l KH 2 PO 4 5.0 g/l NaCl 5.0 g/l Silicone 0.1 ml/l pH adjusted to 6.5-7.5 before autoclaving. III) Fermentation media A fermentation medium having the same composition of the pre-culture medium of C. lunata reported above. IV) Fermentation procedure The slants are used to separately inoculate 500 ml flasks which are cultured at about 28 C. for about 12-24 h ( C. lunata ) or 18-36 h. ( A. simplex ) in the presence of 100 ml of the vegetative media indicated above. These inocula are used in the procedure described below: Aliquots (about 1 to 5%) of the culture of C. lunata obtained above are transferred in a 8 liter fermentor containing the above reported fermentation medium and cultivated for about 24 h at 29-32 C. Then 4 g of 2-methyl-4-pregnen-21-ol-17a,16a-d-oxazolinyl-3,20-dione are added and the fermentation is continued until about 36-72 h from the inoculum. Afterwards, the 18-36 h culture of A. simplex is added thereto and the fermentation is continued for further 40-55 h. The reaction course is monitored as known in the art by TLC or preferably HPLC by following the disappearance of the starting material and/or appearance of the final product. As a further control, the appearance disappearance of intermediates can also be followed. HPLC conversion yield: 70-75%. Example 2 Recovery of the Compound of Formula I After 40-55 h from the addition of A. simplex, the transformation can be generally considered as completed and the fermentation mass can be worked up to isolated the desired compound of formula I. The pH of the fermentation mass is adjusted at about 3-4 with H 2 SO 4 and the mixture is separated by filtration using filter aid; the filtered mycelium is then repeatedly washed with acidified water (3pH4). The filtered broth and the washings are combined, obtaining 11 l of a mixture containing the compound of formula I, with a title of 270 ppm (determined by HPLC on silica gel; Column Spherisorb 3 m, 1004, 6 mm; flow rate 1.3 ml/min, mobile phase 0.0025M NaH 2 PP 4 :CH 3 CN 7:3, UV Detector at 254 nm). The above mixture is then applied at room temperature on the top of a chromatographic column (611 cm) containing about 300 ml of an aqueous-swollen acrylic based polymeric resins (Kastel S/221, Dow Chemical), at a flow rate of about 300 ml/h. The eluted broth (mother liquors), which contains less than 2 ppm of activity, is collected separately. The resin is then washed with 600 ml of demineralized water for removing salts and other water-solubile impurities. Also in this case the eluate (washings), which contains less than 2 ppm of activity, is collected separately. The product is then desorbed from the resin by eluting with a mixture 70/30 of acetone/water at a flow rate of about 150 ml/h, collecting about 200 ml of eluate. The eluate is concentrated under vacuum at a volume of about 100 ml, while product precipitates. The suspension is cooled to about 5 C. and after 2 hours the precipitate is collected by filtration and washed with cold water. After drying under vacuum at 50 C., 2.8 g of the compound of formula I are obtained (title 98%). Mother liquors and washings are combined and after diluting with water (about 1-2 volume with respect to the volume of mother liquors) are applied on the top of a column (213 cm) containing 40 ml of the above swollen resin at a flow rate of about 40 ml/h. After washing the resin with 80 ml of water, the product is desorbed by eluting with a mixture 70/30 of acetone/water at a flow rate of about 20 ml/h. Upon concentration under vacuum, cooling, filtration, washing with cold water and drying, further 0.14 g of the compound of formula I are obtained. The total recovery yield from the fermentation mixture is typically about 96%. By repeating the procedure outlined in Example 1 and 2, but using 2-methyl-4-pregnen-21-acetyloxy-17a,16a-d-oxazolinyl-3,20-dione instead of 2-methyl-4-pregnen-21-ol-17a,16a-d-oxazolinyl-3,20-dione, the compound of formula I is obtained substantially with the same yields.

having the formula: are described as well as formulations containing the compounds. Methods of treating cancer and/or tumors are also disclosed. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to aromatic esters of camptothecins. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Camptothecin, a natural product originally found in China, but now grown in many countries, was isolated and purified by Wall and his coworkers in 1966 (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 88, 3888, 1966). This compound was initially tested against the mouse leukemia L 1210 system and showed good activity. Since it proved to be a potent anticancer in animal models, camptothecin was quickly tested in human clinical trials. At this time, unfortunately, anticancer activity was not found; instead, severe toxicity was observed for those patients who participated in the trials (Gottlieb et al, Cancer Chemother. Rep. 54, 461, 1970, and 56, 103, 1972, Muggia et al, Cancer Chemother. Rep. 56, 515, 1972, Moertel et al, Cancer Chemother. Rep. 56, 95, 1972, and Schaeppi et al, Cancer Chemother. Rep. 5:25, 1974). Trials were accordingly discontinued. The reason for the failure of the early trial was later found to be an incorrect drug formulation selected. Camptothecin is insoluble in water itself. In order to use the drug for i.v. administration, camptothecin was converted to its sodium form (CPT sodium carboxylate). This form although water-soluble, is practically devoid of anticancer activity, and quite toxic. For example, a careful evaluation of these agents in animal models made by Wani et al revealed that the sodium salt is only 10-20% as potent as the parent camptothecin (J. Med. Chem. 23, 554, 1980). In addition, important parameters for anticancer activity in the camptothecin series have now been established (Wall et al., Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 17, 117, 1977). The intact lactone form with an -hydroxyl group at the position 20 of the molecule is believed to be essential for antitumor activity. Keeping the molecule as an intact lactone form is the key for success of the treatment. In the laboratory, camptothecin and its derivatives have shown a promising activity against a wide spectrum of human tumors grown in xenografts in nude mice (Giovanella et al., Cancer Res. 51, 3052, 1991, and Natelson et al., Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci. 803, 224, 1996), but much less activity was observed in human clinical trials. This difference in antitumor activity has been associated with the finding that the hydrolysis of lactone to carboxylate of the molecule is much faster in human plasma than in mouse. For example, about 50% of 9-nitrocamptothecin is present as lactone form in mice plasma, but only 5% of the molecule can be found as the lactone form in human plasma. The lactone camptothecin molecule is not stable in human. More studies on the stability of camptothecin derivatives in human serum have been conducted by Burke et al. (Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci. 803, 29. 1996). Clearly, there is a need to obtain a camptothecin compound that keeps the molecule as an intact lactone when it is in circulation in the body. In other words, a camptothecin product having longer biological life span is wanted. A number of attempts have been made to obtain protected camptothecin derivatives, but none of the compounds has been disclosed to significantly increase the biological life span. U.S. Pat. No. 4,943,579 relates to the preparation of several water-soluble camptothecin esters by the esterification of camptothecin with amino acids as acylating reagents at the 20 position. U.S. Pat. No. 5,646,159 relates to the esterification of 10,11-dioxymethylenecamptothecin with amino acid derivatives as acylating reagents at the position 20 to provide several water-soluble compounds. These two patents use the same acylating reagents (amino acids) for the esterification reaction, and the products are water-soluble, thus they are not related to water-insoluble camptothecin esters and are not within the scope of the present invention. U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,316 discloses esterification of camptothecins with various different acylating reagents rather than amino acids to provide a wide range water-insoluble ester compounds of camptothecins. The compounds disclosed in this invention significantly increase the biological life span while maintaining the inherent antitumor activity and lowering the toxicity. However, the previous patent did not use any aromatic functionality for the esterification reaction. The present invention relates, for the first time, to making aromatic esters of camptothecins. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide new camptothecin compounds which are active against various types of tumors and are non-toxic. It is a further object of the present invention to provide aromatic esters of camptothecins. It is another object of the present invention to provide the prodrugs of camptothecins. These prodrugs can regenerate to the parent active camptothecin compounds by an enzymatic hydrolysis after in vivo administration. It is still another objection of the present invention to provide the methodology of preparing the above-described aromatic esters of camptothecins. It is still a further object of the present invention to provide an improved treatment for certain types of cancers. Additional objects and advantages of the present invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the present invention. The objects and advantages of the present invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. To achieve the objects and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, the present invention relates to a compound of formula (I). The present invention also relates to a method for treating malignant tumors or cancer in a mammal and comprises administering an effective amount of a composition containing one or more of the compounds of formula (I) depicted above.

Mammalian carboxylesterases represent a multigene family and are present in a wide variety of organs and tissues of many mammalian species (Satoh, in reviews in Biochemical Toxicology, 8:155-81, New York: Elsevier, 1987; Heymann, in Enzymatic Basis of Detoxication, 2:291-323, New York: Academic, 1980, and in Metabolic Basis of Detoxication, 1:229-45, New York: Academic, 1982). In general, the highest hydrolase activity occurs in the liver. Carboxylesterase activity is present in many tissues in addition to liver. More information about distribution of carboxylesterases in tissues can be found in a review article written by Satoh et al. (Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 38, 257, 1998). Carboxylesterases are known to be responsible for the hydrolysis of many exogenous compounds, the consequences of which include both activation of prodrugs and deactivation of drugs. CPT-11, a semisynthetic camptothecin derivative and now commercially available for cancer treatment, is a prodrug of SN-38. This compound is converted to SN-38 by carboxylesterases (Danks et al., Cancer Res. 58, 20, 1998; Potter et al., Cancer Res. 58, 2646, 1998; Tsuji et al., J. Pharmacobio-Dyn. 14, 341, 1991). The prodrugs disclosed by the present invention are rapidly distributed throughout the body within a short period of time after delivery and are then converted to active camptothecin compounds by carboxylesterases specifically in tissues. The prodrugs of the present invention are prepared by esterifying the 20-hydroxyl group of camptothecins with the corresponding aromatic carboxylic acids. The reaction can be done in DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide, Aldich, Milwaukee, Wis.) with DCC (1, 3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wis.) as catalyst as depicted in Scheme 1. From among these formulae, preferred structures represented by formula 1 are as follows: The preparation is preferably carried out in the following way: The starting camptothecin compound, preferably 2 to 10 molar equivalent of the reacting aromatic acid of the general formula C 6 R 2-6 COOH, preferably 2 to 8 molar equivalent of DCC, and a catalytic amount of DMAP are added to about 60-100 ml DMF in a 250 ml round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer. The mixture is stirred at room temperature under nitrogen gas for 72-96 hr. Dicyclohexyl urea formed is removed by filtration. The filtrate is poured onto 500-800 ml ice water while stirring. The crude product is collected by filtration, air-dried at room temperature, then separated by column chromatography with THF-C 2 H 2 (from 1:7 to 1:15) as eluent. The pure ester prodrug is obtained as white or yellow powders after precipitation from petroleum ether. Reaction yields can range from 5 to 98%. Any camptothecin compound having an available hydroxyl group may be used to prepare the aromatic esters of the present invention. Suitable camptothecin compounds are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,894,456, 4,981,968, 5,053,512, 5,049,668, 5,106,742, 5,180,722, 5,244,903, 5,227,380, 5,122,606, 5,122,526, 5,225,404, 4,914,205, 4,545,880, 4,604,463, 4,473,692, 4,031,098, EP 0 220 601, EP 0 074 256. These U.S. and EP patents as well as the earlier mentioned patents and publications are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference for a more complete description of camptothecin compounds which can be employed to prepare the aromatic esters of the present invention as well formulations and methods of using and preparing formulations. Preferred hydroxyl group containing camptothecin compounds for use in the present invention are carnptothecin itself, 9-nitrocamptothecin and 9-aminocainptothecin. The (R, S,) or (S), versions, or both can be used to prepare the compounds of the present invention. The S-camptothecin is preferred. Accordingly, the aromatic esters of camptothecin can be (R, S,) or (S) aromatic esters of camptothecin. The compounds disclosed in the present invention were tested against 14 human cell lines and the results are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. Table 1 shows the average response of 14 human cell lines to camptothecin and its aromatic esters. Table 2 shows the average response of 14 human cell lines to 9-nitrocamptothecin and its aromatic esters. What is interesting from these in vitro data is that the activity of these esters is related to the substituents on their side aromatic rings. The esters with nitro group(s) on their side aromatic ring are more active than the others. Esters without any substitutent on their side aromatic rings such as CZ176 and CZ222 do not show any activity. Thus, the difference in activity among the esters of the present invention are due to the different substituents on their side aromatic ring. The compounds of the present invention are effective in the treatment of cancer, including, but not limited to, malignant tumors and other forms of cancer. As used herein, the term malignant tumor is intended to encompass all forms of human carcinomas, sarcomas, and melanomas which occurs in the poorly differentiated, moderately differentiated, and well differentiated forms. In administering the compounds of the present invention to patients in need of such treatment, an effective amount of the compound or formulation containing one or more compounds of the present invention is administered to the patient. As used herein, an effective amount of the compound of the present invention is intended to mean that amount of the compound which will inhibit the growth of, or retard cancer, or kill cancer or malignant cells, and/or cause the regression and/or palliation of cancer such as malignant tumors, i.e., reduce the volume or size of such tumors or eliminate the tumor entirely. The compounds of the present invention and formulations of the present invention can be used in the treatment of a number of tumors and/or cancers including, but not limited to, human cancers of the lung, breast, colon, prostate, melanoma, pancreas, stomach, liver, brain, kidney, uterus, cervix, ovaries, urinary track, gastrointestinal, and other solid tumors which grow in a anatomical site other than the blood stream as well as blood borne tumors such as leukemia. Other solid tumors include, but are not limited to, colon and rectal cancer. The compounds of the present invention are also useful as inhibitors of the enzyme topoisomerase I. The compounds of the present invention can be administered by any acceptable route including, but not limited to, orally, intramuscularly, transdernally, intravenously, through an inhaler or other air borne delivery systems, and the like. Preferably, the compounds and the formulations of the present invention are administered orally, intramuscularly, or transdermally and most preferably delivered orally. Examples of transdermally delivery systems can be found, for instance in U.S. Pat. No. 5,552,154 and 5,652,244 incorporated in their entirety by reference herein. The compounds or formulations of the present invention can also be administered to a patient through a liposome system such as ones described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,882,679; 5,834,012; 5,783,211; 5,718,914; 5,631,237; 5,552,156; 5,059,421; 5,000,958; 5,874,105; 5,567,434; 5,549,910; 5,043,165; 5,736,156; 5,567,433; and 4,663,161, all incorporated in their entirety by reference herein. In addition, the compounds and formulations of the present invention can be used in combination with other drugs and formulations for the treatment of cancers such as taxol, taxotere, or their derivatives as well as cisplatin and derivatives thereof With mammals, including humans, the effective amounts can be administered on the basis of body surface area. The interrelationship of dosages for animals of various sizes, species and humans (based on mg/M 2 of body surface) is described by E. J. Freireich et al., Cancer Chemother. Rep ., 50(4):219 (1966). Body surface area may be approximately determined from the height and weight of an individual (see, e.g., Scientific Tables , Geigy Pharmaceuticals, Ardsley, N.Y., pp. 537-538 (1970). An effective amount of the camptothecin compounds in the present invention can range from about 12.5 mg/m 2 of body surface per day to about 31.3 mg/M 2 of body surface per day. The preferred effective amounts or dosages of the compounds of the present invention in mice are about 1 to about 4 mg per/kg of body weight twice a week for an intramuscular route and about 0.75 to about 1.5 mg per/kg/day for the oral route. Effective amounts or dosages of the compounds of the present invention in mice are, for instance about 1.5 mg/Kg/week to about 10 mg/Kg/week for the transdermal route. For all of the administering routes, the exact timing of administration of the dosages can be varied to achieve optimal results. Generally, when using Intralipid 20 as the carrier for the compound, the actual dosage of the compound reaching the patient may be less. This is due to some loss of the compound on the walls of the syringes, needles, and preparation vessels, which is prevalent with the Intralipid 20 suspension. When a carrier, such as cottonseed oil is used, the above-described loss is not so prevalent because the compound does not adhere as much to the surfaces of syringes, and the like. For instance, and preferably, it has been found that generally about 2.5 mg compound per kg of body weight twice per week using cottonseed oil, administered by an intramuscular route, will deliver the same amount to the patient as 4.0 mg per/kg of body weight twice per week using Intralipid 20 as a carrier. Generally, about 1 mg to about 4 mg of the compound is added to about 0.1 ml to about 1 ml of carrier. Levels of the compounds were well tolerated by mice in the examples set forth below without weight loss or other signs of toxicity. These dosages have been administered for up to six months continuously without any ill effect. Another important feature of the method provided by the present invention relates to the relatively low or no apparent overall toxicity of the camptothecin compounds administered in accordance herein. Overall toxicity can be judged using various criteria. For example, loss of body weight in a subject over 10% of the initially recorded body weight (i.e., before treatment) can be considered as one sign of toxicity. In addition, loss of overall mobility and activity and signs of diarrhea or cystitis in a subject can also be interpreted as evidence of toxicity. The compounds of the present invention may be administered in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or dilutents, such as Intralipid 10 or 20 or natural oils, or other suitable emulsifiers for lipophilic compounds. Other features of the present invention will become apparent in view of the following description of exemplary embodiments which are given for illustration of the invention and are not intended to be limiting thereof.

The compounds of this invention: (i) potently inhibit farnesyl protein transferase, but not geranylgeranyl protein transferase I, in vitro; (ii) block the phenotypic change induced by a form of transforming Ras which is a farnesyl acceptor but not by a form of transforming Ras engineered to be a geranylgeranyl acceptor; (iii) block intracellular processing of Ras which is a farnesyl acceptor but not of Ras engineered to be a geranylgeranyl acceptor; and (iv) block abnormal cell growth in culture induced by transforming Ras. The compounds of this invention inhibit farnesyl protein transferase and the farnesylation of the oncogene protein Ras. Thus, this invention further provides a method of inhibiting farnesyl protein transferase, (e.g., ras farnesyl protein transferase) in mammals, especially humans, by the administration of an effective amount of the tricyclic compounds described above. The administration of the compounds of this invention to patients, to inhibit farnesyl protein transferase, is useful in the treatment of the cancers described below. This invention provides a method for inhibiting or treating the abnormal growth of cells, including transformed cells, by administering an effective amount of a compound of this invention. Abnormal growth of cells refers to cell growth independent of normal regulatory mechanisms (e.g., loss of contact inhibition). This includes the abnormal growth of: (1) tumor cells (tumors) expressing an activated Ras oncogene; (2) tumor cells in which the Ras protein is activated as a result of oncogenic mutation in another gene; and (3) benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant Ras activation occurs. This invention also provides a method for inhibiting or treating tumor growth by administering an effective amount of the tricyclic compounds, described herein, to a mammal (e.g., a human) in need of such treatment. In particular, this invention provides a method for inhibiting or treating the growth of tumors expressing an activated Ras oncogene by the administration of an effective amount of the above described compounds. Examples of tumors which may be inhibited or treated include, but are not limited to, lung cancer (e.g., lung adenocarcinoma), pancreatic cancers (e.g., pancreatic carcinoma such as, for example, exocrine pancreatic carcinoma), colon cancers (e.g., colorectal carcinomas, such as, for example, colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma), myeloid leukemias (for example, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)), thyroid follicular cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), bladder carcinoma, epidermal carcinoma, breast cancer and prostate cancer. It is believed that this invention also provides a method for inhibiting or treating proliferative diseases, both benign and malignant, wherein Ras proteins are aberrantly activated as a result of oncogenic mutation in other genesi.e., the Ras gene itself is not activated by mutation to an oncogenic formwith said inhibition or treatment being accomplished by the administration of an effective amount of the tricyclic compounds described herein, to a mammal (e.g., a human) in need of such treatment. For example, the benign proliferative disorder neurofibromatosis, or tumors in which Ras is activated due to mutation or overexpression of tyrosine kinase oncogenes (e.g., neu, src, abl, lck, and fyn), may be inhibited or treated by the tricyclic compounds described herein. The tricyclic compounds useful in the methods of this invention inhibit or treat the abnormal growth of cells. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that these compounds may function through the inhibition of G-protein function, such as ras p21, by blocking G-protein isoprenylation, thus making them useful in the treatment of proliferative diseases such as tumor growth and cancer. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that these compounds inhibit ras farnesyl protein transferase, and thus show antiproliferative activity against ras transformed cells.

()-Isomers of compounds of Formula 19.2 can be prepared with high enantioselectivity by using a process comprising enzyme catalyzed transesterification. Preferably, a racemic compound of Formula 19.3 is reacted with an enzyme such as Toyobo LIP-300 and an acylating agent such as trifluoroethly isobutyrate; the resultant ()-amide is then isolated from the ()-enantiomeric amine by techniques well known in the art, and then the ()-amide is hydrolyzed, for example by refluxing with an acid such as H 2 SO 4 , and the resulting compound is then reduced with DIBAL by techniques well known in the art to obtain the corresponding optically enriched ()-isomer of Formula 19.2. Alternatively, a racemic compound of Formula 19.3, is first reduced to the corresponding racemic compound of Formula 19.2 and then treated with the enzyme (Toyobo LIP-300) and acylating agent as described above to obtain the ()-amide, which is hydrolyzed to obtain the optically enriched ()-isomer. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that compounds of Formula 1.0 having other R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 substituents may be made by the above enzyme process. To produce the compounds of Formula 1.0, wherein W is r is 0, and R 13 and R 14 are selected from H or C(O)OR 16 , the compounds of Formulas 20.0 or 22.0 are reacted with the appropriate protected amino acid: in the presence of DEC and HOBt in dimethylformamide to produce a compound of the formula: respectively. Reaction of compounds of Formulas 23.0 or 24.0 with TFA in methylene chloride results in the deprotected compounds: respectively. Compounds of Formula 1.0 wherein W is r is 0, R 12 is H, R 13 or R 14 is H, and the remaining R 13 or R 14 is C(O)OR 16 can be prepared by reacting a compound of Formula 1.0 wherein W is r is 0, R 12 is H, and R 13 and R 14 are both H, with the appropriate chloroformate TEA and CH 2 Cl 2 . Compounds of Formulas 25.0 or 26.0 wherein R 13 is selected from SO 2 R 17 or C(O)R 18 can be prepared by reacting a compound of Formula 25.0 or 26.0 with a suitable sulfonyl chloride (R 17 SO 2 Cl) or a suitable acyl chloride (R 18 C(O)Cl) with TEA in a suitable organic solvent (e.g., CH 2 Cl 2 ). Compounds of Formula 1.0 wherein W is r is 1 or 2 and R 12 is H can be prepared by reacting a compound of Formula 20.0 or 22.0 with the appropriately substitued 5 carboxylic acid and, for example DEC, HOBT and N-methylmorpholine, or by reacting a compound of Formula 20.0 or 22.0 with the appropriately substituted acid chloride. For example, a compound of Formula 20.0 or 22.0 can be reacted with from propionic acid, wherein R 13 and R 14 are, for example, alkyl (e.g., methyl). Where the amino carboxylic acid is not commercially available, it can be prepared by reaction of ethyl acrylate with the appropriate amino compound (as described by Ahn, K. H. et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 35, 1875-1878 (1994)) with subsequent hydrolysis of the ester to the desired aminocarboxylic acid. Also, for example, a compound of Formula 20.0 or 22.0 can be reacted with from butyric acid, wherein R 13 and R 14 are, for example, alkyl (e.g., methyl). Where the amino carboxylic acid is not commercially available, the appropriate acid chloride can be prepared in a manner similar to that described by Goel, O. P. et al., Synthesis, p. 538 (1973). The acid chloride is then reacted with a compound of Formula 20.0 or 22.0 to give the compound respectively. The chloro atom can then be displaced with the appropriate amine to give the desired compound. Where either R 13 or R 14 is H, then the starting material would be a protected amino carboxylic acid wherein Z is an appropriater protecting group (e.g., BOC, CBZ (carbonylbenzyloxy) or TFA). Coupling this protected amino carboxylic acid with a compound of Formula 20.0 or 22.0 would then give the amino protected intermediate respectively. The amino protected intermediate (20.0B or 22.0B) would then be alkylated, and then the protecting group removed, using standard procedures known in the art. Compounds of Formula 1.0 wherein W is v is 0, and R 12 is H can be prepared by reacting a compound of Formula 20.0 or 22.0 with chloroacetylchloride, TEA and CH 2 Cl 2 to produce a compound of the formula: The chloro atom in the C(O)CH 2 Cl group in the compound of Formula 26.0 or 27.0 is then displaced with an appropriate nucleophile, R 15 , using a suitable base, e.g., sodium carbonate, and optionally, a suitable suitable solvent (e.g., DMF). Compounds of Formula 1.0 wherein W is can be prepared from compounds of Formula 20.0 or 22.0 by reaction with oxallyl chloride and an excess of the amine Compounds of Formula 1.0 wherein W is z is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 and R 22 is OR 23 , and R 23 is, for example, alkyl, can be prepared by reaction of a compound of Formula 20.0 or 22.0 with the appropriate substituted dicarboxylic acid which is protected as a mono ester with an appropriate alkyl or aryl group. The corresponding acids (i.e., R 23 is H) can be obtained by base hydrolysis (e.g., NaOH) of the ester. The compounds, wherein R 22 is NR 24 R 25 , can be prepared by reacting the appropriately substituted amine with the carboxylic acid generated above using DEC, HOBT and NMM. For example, for compounds wherein z is 3 a glutarate (wherein R 23 is alky, e.g., methyl) can be used, and for compounds wherein z is 2 a succinate (wherein R 23 is alkyl, e.g., methyl) can be used, and for compounds wherein z is 1 a malonate wherein R 23 is alky, e.g., ethyl) can be used.

ASSAYS FPT IC 50 (inhibition of farnesyl protein transferase, in vitro enzyme assay) and COS Cell IC 50 (Cell-Based Assay) were determined following the assay procedures described in WO 95/10516, published Apr. 20, 1995. GGPT IC 50 (inhibition of geranylgeranyl protein transferase, in vitro enzyme assay), Cell Mat Assay, and anti-tumor activity (in vivo anti-tumor studies) could be determined by the assay procedures described in WO 95/10516. The disclosure of WO 95/10516 is incorporated herein by reference thereto. Additional assays can be carried out by following essentially the same procedure as described above, but with substitution of alternative indicator tumor cell lines in place of the T24-BAG cells. The assays can be conducted using either DLD-1-BAG human colon carcinoma cells expressing an activated K-ras gene or SW620-BAG human colon carcinoma cells expressing an activated K-ras gene. Using other tumor cell lines known in the art, the activity of the compounds of this invention against other types of cancer cells could be demonstrated. Soft Agar Assay: Anchorage-independent growth is a characteristic of tumorigenic cell lines. Human tumor cells are suspended in growth medium containing 0.3% agarose and an indicated concentration of a farnesyl transferase inhibitor. The solution is overlayed onto growth medium solidified with 0.6% agarose containing the same concentration of farnesyl transferase inhibitor as the top layer. After the top layer is solidified, plates are incubated for 10-16 days at 37 C. under 5% CO 2 to allow colony outgrowth. After incubation, the colonies are stained by overlaying the agar with a solution of MTT (3-4,5-dimethylthiazol 2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Thiazolyl blue) (1 mg/ml in PBS). Colonies can be counted and the IC 50 s can be determined. The results are given in Table 3. In Table 3 Ex. No. stands for Example Number.

Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. The powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 70 percent active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are known in the art, e.g. magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed homogeneously therein as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby solidify. Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection. Liquid form preparations may also include solutions for intranasal administration. Aerosol preparations suitable for inhalation may include solutions and solids in powder form, which may be in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as an inert compressed gas. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. The compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal compositions can take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose. Preferably the compound is administered orally. Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose. The quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from about 0.1 mg to 1000 mg, more preferably from about 1 mg. to 300 mg, according to the particular application. The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. The amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of the invention and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the symptoms being treated. A typical recommended dosage regimen is oral administration of from 10 mg to 2000 mg/day preferably 10 to 1000 mg/day, in two to four divided doses to block tumor growth.

This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/069,371, filed Dec. 12, 1997. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Asthma is a complex disease involving the concerted actions of multiple inflammatory and immune cells, spasmogens, inflammatory mediators, cytokines and growth factors. In recent practice there have been four major classes of compounds used in the treatment of asthma, namely bronchodilators (e.g., -adrenoceptor agonists), anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., corticosteroids), prophylactic anti-allergic agents (e.g., cromolyn sodium) and xanthines (e.g., theophylline) which appear to possess both bronchodilating and anti-inflammatory activity. Theophylline has been a preferred drug of first choice in the treatment of asthma. Although it has been touted for its direct bronchodilatory action, theophyllines therapeutic value is now believed to also stem from anti-inflammatory activity. Its mechanism of action remains unclear. However, it is believed that several of its cellular activities are important in its activity as an anti-asthmatic, including cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibition, adenosine receptor antagonism, stimulation of catecholamine release, and its ability to increase the number and activity of suppressor T-lymphocytes. While all of these may actually contribute to its activity, only PDE inhibition may account for both the anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory components. However, theophylline is known to have a narrow therapeutic index and a wide range of untoward side effects which are considered problematic. Of the activities mentioned above, theophyllines activity in inhibiting cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase has received considerable attention recently. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) have received considerable attention as molecular targets for anti-asthmatic agents. Cyclic 3,5-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic 3,5-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) are known second messengers that mediate the functional responses of cells to a multitude of hormones, neurotransmitters and autocoids. At least two therapeutically important effects could result from phosphodiesterase inhibition, and the consequent rise in intracellular adenosine 3,5-monophosphate (cAMP) or guanosine 3,5-monophosphate (cGMP) in key cells in the pathophysiology of asthma. These are smooth muscle relaxation (resulting in bronchodilation) and anti-inflammatory activity. It has become known that there are multiple, distinct PDE isoenzymes which differ in their cellular distribution. A variety of inhibitors possessing a marked degree of selectivity for one isoenzyme or the other have been synthesized. The structure-activity relationships (SAR) of isozyme-selective inhibitors has been discussed in detail, e.g., in the article of Theodore J. Torphy, et al., Novel Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors For The Therapy Of Asthma, Drug News Prospectives, 6(4) May 1993, pages 203-214. The PDE enzymes can be grouped into five families according to their specificity toward hydrolysis of cAMP or cGMP, their sensitivity to regulation by calcium, calmodulin or cGMP, and their selective inhibition by various compounds. PDE I is stimulated by Ca 2 /calmodulin. PDE II is cGMP-stimulated, and is found in the heart and adrenals. PDE III is cGMP-inhibited, and inhibition of this enzyme creates positive inotropic activity. PDE IV is cAMP specific, and its inhibition causes airway relaxation, antiinflammatory and antidepressant activity. PDE V appears to be important in regulating cGMP content in vascular smooth muscle, and therefore PDE V inhibitors may have cardiovascular activity. While there are compounds derived from numerous structure activity relationship studies which provide PDE III inhibition, the number of structural classes of PDE IV inhibitors is relatively limited. Analogues of rolipram, which has the following structural formula (A): and of RO-20-1724, which has the following structural formula (B): have been studied. U.S. Pat. No. 4,308,278 discloses compounds of the formula (C) wherein R 1 is (C 3 -C 6 ) cycloalkyl or benzyl; each of R 2 and R 3 is hydrogen or (C 1 -C 4 ) alkyl; R 4 is R 2 or alkoxycarbonyl; and R 5 is hydrogen or alkoxycarbonyl. Compounds of Formula (D) are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,636,039. These compounds are benzylimidazolidinones which act as hypertensive agents. Substituents R 1 -R 4 in Formula D represent a variety of groups, including hydrogen and lower alkyl. PCT publication WO 87/06576 discloses antidepressants of Formula E: wherein R 1 is a polycycloalkyl group having from 7 to 11 carbon atoms; R 2 is methyl or ethyl; X is O or NH; and Y comprises a mono-or bicyclic heterocyclic group with optional substituents. Rolipram, which was initially studied because of its activity as an anti-depressant, has been shown to selectively inhibit the PDE IV enzyme and this compound has since become a standard agent in the classification of PDE enzyme subtypes. There appears to be considerable therapeutic potential for PDE IV inhibitors. Early work focused on depression as a CNS therapeutic endpoint and on inflammation, and has subsequently been extended to include related diseases such as dementia and asthma. In-vitro, rolipram, RO20-1724 and other PDE IV inhibitors have been shown to inhibit (1) mediator synthesis/release in mast cells, basophils, monocytes and eosinophils; (2) respiratory burst, chemotaxis and degranulation in neutrophils and eosinophils; and (3) mitogen-dependent growth and differentiation in lymphocytes (The PDE IV Family Of Calcium-Phosphodiesterases Enzymes, John A. Lowe, III, et al., Drugs of the Future 1992, 17(9):799-807). PDE IV is present in all the major inflammatory cells in asthma including eosinophils, neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells. Its inhibition causes down regulation of inflammatory cell activation and relaxes smooth muscle cells in the trachea and bronchus. On the other hand, inhibition of PDE III, which is present in myocardium, causes an increase in both the force and rate of cardiac contractility. These are undesirable side effects for an anti-inflammatory agent. Theophylline, a non-selective PDE inhibitor, inhibits both PDE III and PDE IV, resulting in both desirable anti-asthmatic effects and undesirable cardiovascular stimulation. With this well-known distinction between PDE isozymes, the opportunity for concomitant anti-inflammation and bronchodilation without many of the side effects associated with theophylline therapy is apparent. The increased incidence of morbidity and mortality due to asthma in many Western countries over the last decade has focused the clinical emphasis on the inflammatory nature of this disease and the benefit of inhaled steroids. Development of an agent that possesses both bronchodilatory and antiinflammatory properties would be most advantageous. It appears that selective PDE IV inhibitors should be more effective with fewer side effects than theophylline. Clinical support has been shown for this hypothesis. Furthermore, it would be desirable to provide PDE IV inhibitors which are more potent and selective than rolipram and therefore have a lower IC 50 so as to reduce the amount of the agent required to effect PDE IV inhibition. In recent years, several different compounds have been suggested as possible therapeutic compositions which achieve the desired PDE IV inhibition without the side effects alluded to above. However, these efforts have been chiefly directed to developing non-specific derivatives of particular classes of compounds, i.e. rolipram analogs, benzoxazoles, adenines, thioxanthines, etc. These efforts, however, have resulted in a myriad of compounds having a wide range of PDE IV IC 50 s. Often, the general formulas disclosed yield several compounds which have poor levels of PDE IV inhibition and/or lack sufficient specificity. Consequently, these efforts often provide no assurance that any particular derivative within the formula will have the desired combination of high PDE IV inhibition and selectivity. OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is accordingly a primary object of the present invention to provide new compounds which are more effective selective PDE IV inhibitors than known prior art compounds. It is another object of the present invention to provide new compounds which act as effective PDE IV inhibitors with lower PDE III inhibition. It is another object of the present invention to provide methods for treating a patient requiring PDE IV inhibition. It is another object of the present invention to provide new compounds for treating disease states associated with abnormally high physiological levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor.

After application of the sample, the column is washed with several bed volumes of buffer B, after which the different forms of PDE are eluted from the column using two successive linear NaCl gradients (0.05-0.15 M, 300 ml total; 0.15-0.40 M, 200 ml total). Five milliliter fractions are collected and assayed for cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP PDE activity. Fractions containing PDE III activity are pooled and dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of buffer B. The dialyzed PDE III is then concentrated to 10% of the original volume, diluted to 50% with ethylene glycol monoethyl ether and stored at 20 C. PDE III can typically be retained for up to four weeks with little or no loss of activity. Measuring Type III PDE Activity: Enzyme activity is assessed by measuring the hydrolysis of 3 H-cyclic AMP, as described by Thompson, W. J., Teraski, W. L., Epstein, P. N., Strada, S. J.: Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 10:69, 1979. The cyclic AMP concentration used in this assay is 0.2 mM, which approximates to the K m value. Protein concentration is adjusted to ensure that no more than 15% of the available substrate is hydrolyzed during the incubation period. All test compounds are dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (final concentration of 2.5%). This concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide inhibits enzyme activity by approximately 10%. Type IV Phosphodiesterase Protocol for Enzyme Isolation: The Type IV PDE is isolated from bovine tracheal smooth muscle using a procedure similar to that previously described by Silver, P. J., et al.: Eur. J. Pharmacol. 150:85, 1988.(1). Briefly, smooth muscle from bovine trachea is minced and homogenized using a polytron in 10 volumes of an extraction buffer containing 10 mM Tris-acetate (pH 7.5), 2 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 2,000 units/ml of aprotinin. This and all subsequent procedures are performed at 0-4 C. The homogenate is sonicated and then centrifuged at 48,000g for 30 minutes. The resulting supernatant is applied to a DEAE Trisacryl M column previously equilibrated with sodium acetate and dithiothreitol. After applications of the sample, the column is washed with sodium acetate/dithiothreitol, after which the different forms of PDE are eluted from the column using a linear Tris-HCl/NaCl gradient. Fractions containing Type IV PDE are collected, dialyzed and concentrated to 14% of the original volume. The concentrated fractions are diluted to 50% with ethylene glycol and stored at 20 C. Measuring Type IV PDE Activity: Enzyme activity is assessed by measuring the hydrolysis of 3 H-cyclic AMP, as describcd by Thompson, W. J., et al.: Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 10:69, 1979. The cyclic AMP concentration used in this assay is 0.2 mM, which approximates to the K m value. Protein concentration is adjusted to ensure that no more than 15% of the available substrate is hydrolyzed during the incubation period. All test compounds are dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (final concentration of 2.5%). This concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide inhibits enzyme activity by approximately 10%. Measuring Type V PDE Activity Protocol for Enzyme Isolation: The Type V PDE is isolated using a procedure similar to that previously described by Weishaar et al., Hypertension 15:528, (1990). Briefly, 1-2 units of platelets are suspended in an equal volume of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 5 mM Na 2 EDTA) using a polytron. The proteinase inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) are also included in this buffer at a final concentration of 200 uM. This and all subsequent procedures are performed at 0-4 C. The homogenate is then centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 60 minutes. The supernatant is then removed and filtered through four layers of gauze and applied to a DEAE-Trisacryl M column. The column is washed with several bed volumes of buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 200 mM PMSF) and eluted by two successive linear NaCl gradients (0.05-0.15 M, 300 ml total; 0.15-0.40 M, 200 ml total). Five ml fractions are collected and assayed for cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP PDE activity. Fractions that contain PDE V are pooled and dialyzed overnight against 4 L of buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 mM magnesium acetate and proteinase inhibitors). The dialyzed PDE V is then concentrated to 10% of the original volume, diluted to 50% with ethylene glycol monoethyl ether and stored at 20 C. PDE V can typically be retained for up to four weeks with little or no loss of activity. Measuring Type V PDE Activity: Enzyme activity is assessed by measuring the hydrolysis of 3 H-cyclic GMP, as described by Thompson et al. (Thompson, W. J., Teraski, W. L., Epstein, P. N., Strada, S. J.: Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 10:69, 1979). The cyclic GMP concentration used in this assay is 0.2 uM, which approximates to the K m value. Protein concentration is adjusted to ensure that no more than 15% of the available substrate is hydrolyzed during the incubation period. All test compounds are dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (final concentration of 2.5%). This concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide inhibits enzyme activity by approximately 10%. The reference Type V PDE inhibitor zaprinast is evaluated with each assay. The compounds are tested over concentration range: 0.1, 1, 10, 100 uM (n1), and IC 50 determinations are made using 5 appropriate concentrations (n2). As can be seen from the foregoing, the compositions of the present invention are also potent inhibitors of PDE V in mammals. Such activity is useful in the medical arts to reduce smooth muscle cell proliferation and increase pulmonary vasodilation. In certain aspects of the invention, the compounds demonstrate a combination of selective PDE IV and PDE V inhibition and can be used in diseases such as restenosis and related diseases. Such aspects, of course, include administering an effective amount of a compound of the present invention possessing said combination of PDE IV and V inhibitory activities to a mammal in need of such therapy. Following the above procedures, the PDE III, PDE IV and PDE V inhibition for the compounds of Examples 1-5 were tested and compared. The results are shown in Table I below: TABLE I EX- AMPLE PDE III IC 50 (M) PDE IV IC 50 (M) PDE V IC 50 (micro M) 1 381 0.82 373 2 257 0.19 30.5 3 1000 0.25 800 4 1000 0.59 1000 5 1000 2.25 1000 While the invention has been illustrated with respect to the production and use of particular compounds, it is apparent that variations and modifications of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.

Retroviral infections are a serious cause of disease, most notably, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS*. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been recognized as the etiologic agent of AIDS. Compounds having an inhibitory effect on HIV multiplication or otherwise effective in the therapy of retroviral infections are being actively sought. H. Mitsuya et al., 3-Azido-3-deoxythymidine (BW A509U): An antiviral agent that inhibits the infectivity and cytopathic effect of human T-lymphotropic virus type III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus in vitro, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82, pp. 7096-7100 (1985), refers to 3-azido-3-deoxythymidine of formula (A), commonly referred to as AZT. This compound is said to be useful in providing some protection for AIDS carriers against the cytopathogenic effect of immunodeficiency virus (HIV). H. Mitsuya and S. Broder, Inhibition of the in vitro infectivity and cytopathic effect of human T-lymphotrophic virus type III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus (HTLV-III/LAV) by 2,3-dideoxynucleosides, Proc. Natl.

While 3-fluoro analogues of 3-deoxythymidine and 2,3-dideoxy-cytidine shown in formulas (C) and (D) are found to possess potent antiretroviral activity, substituents linked to the 3-carbon via a thio or oxygen bridge did not yield active products.

Belleau et al., Design and activity of a novel class of nucleoside analogues effective against HIV-1, Abstracts of papers, Fifth International Conference on AIDS, Montreal, T.C.O. 1, p. 515 (1989), refer to dioxolanes and oxathiolanes of formulas (J) and (K) as having potent anti-HIV activity. The cis isomer of formula (K) has been found to be active against HIV and HBV, and its unnatural enantiomer ((2R,5S cis) referred to as the (-) enantiomer has been found to have surprisingly low toxicity. Now named lamivudine or 3TC, this new anti-viral drug is becoming the treatment of choice for combination therapy of AIDS patients and for sole therapy for HBV patients. Although lamivudine (3TC) has been found to be an extremely interesting compound in the clinic, there is always the possibility that the patient develops virus strains that are resistant to it after prolonged periods of treatment. There is therefore, still a need to develop anti-viral agents that are active against nucleoside-resistant viral strains, in particular, against 3TC-resistant viral strains. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Classes of compounds known as 2-substituted 4-substituted 1,3-oxathiolanes have been found to have potent antiviral activity. In particular, these compounds have been found to act as potent inhibitors of HIV-1 replication in T-lymphocytes over a prolonged period of time with less cytotoxic side effects than compounds known in the art. These compounds have also been found active against 3TC-resistant HIV strains. These compounds are also useful in prophylaxis and treatment of hepatitis B virus infections. There are accordingly provided in a first aspect of this invention a single enantiomer of compounds of formula (I) in the cis configuration: wherein R 1 is hydrogen, R 2 is cytosine or 5-fluorocytosine, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof. As used herein, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or salt of such ester, of a compound of formula (I) or any other compound which, upon administration to the recipient, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of formula (I) or an antivirally active metabolite or residue thereof. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of suitable acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, perchloric, fumaric, maleic, phosphoric, glycollic, lactic, salicylic, succinic, p-toluene sulfonic, tartaric, acetic, citric, methanesulfonic, formic, benzoic, malonic, naphthalene-2-sulfonic and benzenesulfonic acids. Other acids such as oxalic, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be useful in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal (e.g., sodium), alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N-(C 1-4 alkyl) 4 salts. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the compounds of formula (I) may be modified to provide pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof, at functional groups in both the cytosine moiety, and at the hydroxymethyl group of the oxathiolane ring, respectively. Modification at all such functional groups is included within the scope of the invention. However, of particular interest are pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters (e.g., esters or esters of amino acids) obtained by modification of the 2-hydroxymethyl group of the oxathiolane ring. Preferred esters of the compounds of formula (I) include the compounds in which R 1 is replaced by a carboxyl function R-(CO) in which the non-carbonyl moiety R of the ester grouping is selected from hydrogen, straight or branched chain alkyl (e.g., methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, t-butyl, n-butyl), alkoxyalkyl (e.g., methoxymethyl), aralkyl (e.g., benzyl), aryloxyalkyl (e.g., phenoxymethyl), aryl (e.g., phenyl optionally substituted by halogen, C 1-4 alkyl or C 1-4 alkoxy); substituted dihydro pyridinyl (e.g., N-methyldihydro pyridinyl); sulphonate esters such as alkyl- or aralkylsulphonyl (e.g., methanesulphonyl); sulfate esters; amino acid esters (e.g., L-valyl or L-isoleucyl) and mono, di- or triphosphate esters. Also included within the scope of such esters are esters derived from polyfunctional acids such as carboxylic acids containing more than one carboxyl group, for example, dicarboxylic acids HO 2 C(CH 2 ) n CO 2 H where n is an integer of 1 to 10 (for example, succinic acid) or phosphoric acids. Methods for preparing such esters are well known. See, for example, E. Hahn et al., Nucleotide dimers as anti-human immunodeficiency virus agents, Nucleotide Analogues As Antiviral Agents , J. C. Martin, Ed. Symposium Series 401, American Chemical Society, pp. 156-159 (1989) and M. Busso et al., Nucleotide dimers suppress HIV expression in vitro, AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses, 4(6), pp. 449-455 (1988). Specific compounds of formula (I) include: 2R-hydroxymethyl-4R-(cytosin-1-yl)-1,3-oxathiolane; 2S-hydroxymethyl-4S-(cytosin-1-yl)-1,3-oxathiolane; 2R-hydroxymethyl-4R-(5-fluorocytosin-1-yl)-1,3-oxathiolane; and 2S-hydroxymethyl-4S-(5-fluorocytosin-1-yl)-1,3-oxathiolane; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof. In the processes for preparing the compounds of this invention, the following definitions are used: R 2 is cytosine or 5-fluorocytosine; R w is hydrogen, trisubstituted silyl, C 1-6 alkyl, aralkyl such as benzyl or trityl, C 1-16 acyl, preferably a benzoyl or a benzoyl substituted in any position by at least one halogen (bromine, chlorine, fluorine or iodine), C 1-6 alkyl, C 1-6 alkoxy, nitro, or trifluoromethyl group; R x is C 1-6 alkyl; and L is a leaving group, i.e., an atom or group which is displaceable upon reaction with an appropriate base, with or without a Lewis acid. Suitable leaving groups include acyloxy groups, alkoxy groups, e.g., alkoxy carbonyl groups such as ethoxy carbonyl; halogens such as iodine, bromine, chlorine, or fluorine; amido; azido; isocyanato; substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated thiolates, such as thiomethyl or thiophenyl; substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated seleno or selenino compounds, such as phenyl selenide or alkyl selenide; and substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic or aromatic ketones such as methyl ketone. A suitable leaving group may also be -OR, where R is a substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated alkyl group, e.g., C 1-6 alkyl or alkenyl group; a substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic or aromatic acyl group, e.g., a C 1-6 aliphatic acyl group such as acetyl and an aromatic acyl group such as benzoyl; a substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated alkoxy or aryloxy carbonyl group, such as methyl carbonate and phenyl carbonate; substituted or unsubstituted sulphonyl imidazolide; substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic or aromatic amino carbonyl group, such as phenyl carbamate; substituted or unsubstituted alkyl imidate group such as trichloroacetamidate; substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated phosphonates, such as diethylphosphonate; substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic or aromatic sulphonyl group, such as tosylate; or hydrogen. Oxathiolane compounds of formula (I), and pharmaceutically acceptable, salts and esters, may be prepared according to the processes discussed herein or by any method known in the art for the preparation of compounds of analogous structure. The compound of this invention can be produced by the methods described by Mansour et al., Anti-Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Anti-Hepatitis-B Virus Activities and Toxicities of the Enantiomers of 2-Deoxy-3-oxa-4-thiacytidine and Their 5-Fluoro Analogues in vitro, J. Med. Chem. , 1995, Vol. 38, No. 1, pp. 1-4, which is incorporated herein by reference. In one such process for producing oxathiolanes of this invention, a compound of formula (V), wherein R w is hydrogen or a hydroxyl protecting group and L is a displaceable atom or group, i.e., a leaving group, is reacted with an appropriate base. In a second process for producing oxathiolanes of this invention, a compound of formula (VI) may be converted to a compound of formula (I) by conversion of the anomeric NH 2 group to the required base by methods well known in the art of nucleoside chemistry. The 1,3-oxathiolanes of formula (I) may also be prepared, for example, by reaction of an aldehyde of formula (VII) C 6 H 5 COOCH 2 CHO (VII) with 2-mercaptoethanol in a compatible organic solvent followed by Pummerer rearrangements as is known in the art (T. Durst, Dimethylsulfoxide in organic Synthesis, Adv. Org. Chem., E. C. Taylor and B. Wynberg, Eds., 6, pp. 356-365 (1969)) to give 1,3-oxathiolanes of formula (V), which are converted to 1,3-oxathiolanes of formula (I) by methods known in the art of nucleoside chemistry. Another process for preparing the 1,3-oxathiolanes of formula (I) is illustrated in SCHEME 1. The various steps involved in the synthesis of 1,3-oxathiolanes of formula (I) as illustrated in SCHEME 1 may be briefly described as follows: Step 1: Benzoyloxyacetaldehyde of formula (VII) or any aldehyde of the formula R w OCH 2 CHO (C. D. Hurd and E. M. Filiachione, A new approach to the syntheses of aldehyde sugars, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 61, pp. 1156-1159 (1939)) is condensed with a mercaptoalcohol such as 2-mercaptoethanol in a compatible organic solvent, such as toluene, containing a catalytic amount of a strong acid to give the intermediate shown in formula (VIII). Step 2: The 1,3-oxathiolane of formula (VIII) is then oxidized with a peracid such as magnesium monoperoxyphthalic acid in a compatible organic solvent such as methylene chloride containing a salt such as tetrabutyl ammonium bromide to give the sulfoxide intermediate shown in formula (IX) Step 3: The sulfoxide intermediate shown in formula (IX) is treated with an acid anhydride such as acetic anhydride or any other anhydride of the formula (R x CO) 2 O in the presence of a buffer such as tetra-n-butylammonium acetate to give the 2,4-disubstituted-1,3-oxathiolane of formula (X) (T. Durst, Adv. Org. Chem., 6, pp. 356-365 (1969)). Step 4: The 1,3-oxathiolane of formula (X) is then reacted with a pyrimidine base or analogue thereof, (e.g., cytosine) previously silylated with, for example, hexamethyldisilazane in a compatible solvent using a Lewis acid or trimethylsilyl triflate to give the intermediate of formula (XI) as cis and trans isomers. The isomers may be separated, preferably by chromatography, to give pure cis (XI) and pure trans (XI). Step 5: The benzoate function of the compound of formula (XI) (cis or trans isomer), is hydrolyzed using a base such as methanolic ammonia to obtain the compound shown in formula (XII) as cis- or trans- isomer. preferably under pressure, to give the product shown in Many of the reactions in the above-described processes have been extensively reported in the context of pyrimidine nucleoside synthesis, for example, in L. B. Townsend, Synthesis and reaction of pyrimidine nucleoside, Chemistry of Nucleoside and Nucleotides vol. 1, Eds., Plenum Press, New York (1989) at pages 1-95, the text of which is incorporated by reference herein. In the above-described process, the compounds of formula (I) are generally obtained as a mixture of the cis and trans isomers. The cis and trans isomers may be separated, for example, by acetylation, e.g., with acetic anhydride followed by separation by physical means, e.g., chromatography on silica gel and deacetylation, e.g., with methanolic ammonia or by fractional crystallization. Resolution of the final product, or an intermediate or starting material therefore may be effected by any suitable method known in the art: see for example, Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds , by E. L. Eliel (McGraw Hill, 1962) and Tables of Resolving Agents, by S. H. Wilen. Where the compound of formula (I) is desired as a single enantiomer it may be obtained either by resolution of the mixture of the two cis enantiomers (by chiral HPLC) or by stereospecific synthesis from isometrically pure starting material or any convenient intermediate. Thus, the compound of formula (I) or any convenient intermediate may be obtained by chiral HPLC using a suitable stationary phase for example acetylated -cyclodextrin or cellulose triacetate and a suitable solvent for example an alcohol such as ethanol or an aqueous solution such as triethyl ammonioum acetate. Alternatively, the compound of formula (I) or any convenient intermediate may be resolved by enzyme mediated enatioselective catabolism with a suitable enzyme such as cytidine deaminase or selective enzymatic degradation of a suitable derivative using a 5-nucleotidase for example see Storer et al., The resolution and Absolute Stereochemistry of the Enantiomers of cis-12(Hydroxomethyl)-1,3-Oxathiolan-5-Yl)Cytosine (BCH-189): Equipotent Anti-HIV Agents, Nucleosides Nucleotides , 12(2), 225-236 (1993). When the resolution is effected enzymatically, the enzyme may be employed either in solution or in immobilized form. Enzymes in immobilized form are known in the art for example, by adsorption onto a resin such as Eupergit. It will be appreciated that the reactions of the above-described processes may require the use of, or conveniently may be applied to, starting materials having protected functional groups, and deprotection might thus be required as an intermediate or final step to yield the desired compound. Protection and deprotection of functional groups may be effected using conventional means. Thus, for example, amino groups may be protected by a group selected from aralkyl (e.g., benzyl), acyl or aryl (e.g., 2,4-dinitrophenyl); subsequent removal of the protecting group being effected when desired by hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis as appropriate using standard conditions. Hydroxyl groups may be protected using any conventional hydroxyl protecting group, for example, as described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Ed. J. F. W. McOmie (Plenum Press, 1973) or Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by Theodora W. Greene (John Wiley and Sons, 1981 which is incorporated by reference herein. Examples of suitable hydroxyl protecting groups include groups selected from alkyl (e.g., methyl, t-butyl or methoxymethyl), aralkyl (e.g., benzyl, diphenylmethyl or triphenylmethyl), heterocyclic groups such as tetrahydropyranyl, acyl, (e.g., acetyl or benzoyl) and silyl groups such as trialkylsilyl (e.g., t-butyldimethylsilyl). The hydroxyl protecting groups may be removed by conventional techniques. Thus, for example, alkyl, silyl, acyl and heterocyclic groups may be removed by solvolysis, e.g., by hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions. Aralkyl groups such as triphenylmethyl may similarly be removed by solvolysis, e.g., by hydrolysis under acidic conditions. Aralkyl groups such as benzyl may be cleaved, for example, by treatment with BF 3 /etherate and acetic anhydride followed by removal of acetate groups so formed at an appropriate stage in the synthesis. Silyl groups may also conveniently be removed using a source of fluoride ions such as tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention may be prepared as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,383,114, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. Thus, for example, when it is desired to prepare an acid addition salt of a compound of formula (I), the product of any of the above procedures may be converted into a salt by treatment of the resulting free base with a suitable acid using conventional methods. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared by reacting the free base with an appropriate acid optionally in the presence of a suitable solvent such as an ester (e.g., ethyl acetate) or an alcohol (e.g., methanol, ethanol or isopropanol). Inorganic basic salts may be prepared by reacting the free base with a suitable base such as an alkoxide (e.g., sodium methoxide) optionally in the presence of a solvent such as an alcohol (e.g., methanol). Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also be prepared from other salts, including other pharmaceutically acceptable salts, of the compounds of formula (I) using conventional methods. A compound of formula (I) may be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable phosphate or other ester by reaction with a phosphorylating agent, such as POCl 3 , or a suitable esterifying agent, such as an acid halide or anhydride, as appropriate. An ester or salt of a compound of formula (I) may be converted to the parent compound, for example, by hydrolysis. The compounds of the invention possess anti-viral activity. In particular these compounds are effective in inhibiting the replication of hepatitis B virus and retroviruses, including human retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs), the causative agents of AIDS. There is thus provided as a further aspect of the invention a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof for use as an active therapeutic agent in particular as an antiviral agent, for example in the treatment of hepatitis B viral and retroviral infections such as HIV infection. There is also provided in a further or alternative aspect of this invention, use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a viral infection. Such viral infections may be, in particular HIV and HBV infections. In a further or alternative aspect there is provided a method for the treatment of a viral infection, in particular an infection caused by hepatitis B virus or a retrovirus such as HIV, in a mammal, including man, comprising administration of an effective amount of an antiviral compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof. The compounds of the invention are also useful in the treatment of AIDS-related conditions such as AIDS-related complex (ARC), persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL), AIDS-related neurological conditions (such as dementia), anti-HIV antibody-positive and HIV-positive conditions, Kaposils sarcoma, thrombocytopenia purpura and opportunistic infections. The compounds of the invention are also useful in the prevention or progression to clinical illness of individuals who are anti-HIV antibody or HIV-antigen positive and in prophylaxis following exposure to HIV. The compounds of formula (I) or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof, may also be used for the prevention of viral contamination of biological fluids such as blood or semen in vitro. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that references herein to treatment extends to prophylaxis as well as the treatment of established infections or symptoms. It will be further appreciated that the amount of a compound of the invention required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular compound selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. In general, however, a suitable dose will be in the range from about 1 to about 750 mg/kg of body weight per day, such as 3 to about 120 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, preferably in the range of 6 to 90 mg/kg/day, most preferably in the range of 15 to 60 mg/kg/day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The compound is conveniently administered in unit dosage form; for example containing 10 to 1500 mg, conveniently 20 to 1000 mg, most conveniently 50 to 700 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form. Ideally the active ingredient should be administered to achieve peak plasma concentrations of the active compound of from about 1 to 75 M, preferably about 2 to 50 M, most preferably about 3 to about 30 M. This may be achieved, for example, by the intravenous injection of a 0.1 to 5% solution of the active ingredient, optionally in saline, or administered as a bolus containing about 0.1 to about 110 mg/kg of the active ingredient. Desirable blood levels may be maintained by a continuous infusion to provide about 0.01 to about 5.0 mg/kg/hour or by intermittent infusions containing about 0.4 to about 15 mg/kg of the active ingredient. While it is possible that, for use in therapy, a compound of the invention may be administered as the raw chemical it is preferable to present the active ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation. The invention thus further provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and, optionally, other therapeutic and/or prophylactic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Pharmaceutical formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sub-lingual), vaginal or parenteral (including intramuscular, sub-cutaneous and intravenous) administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation. The formulations may, where appropriate, be conveniently presented in discrete dosage units and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for oral administration may conveniently be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution; as a suspension; or as an emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, lubricants, disintegrants, or wetting agents. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in the art. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils) or preservatives. The compounds according to the invention may also be formulated for parenteral administration (e.g., by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and may be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilization from solution, for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use. For topical administration to the epidermis, the compounds according to the invention may be formulated as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch. Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilizing agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or coloring agents. Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising active ingredient in a flavored based, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier. Pharmaceutically formulations suitable for rectal administration wherein the carrier is a solid, are most preferably represented as unit dose suppositories. Suitable carriers include cocoa butter and other materials commonly used in the art, and the suppositories may be conveniently formed by admixture of the active compound with the softened or melted carrier(s) followed by chilling and shaping in molds. Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the active ingredient, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. For intra-nasal administration the compounds of the invention may be used as a liquid spray or dispersible powder or in the form of drops. Drops may be formulated with an aqueous or non-aqueous base also comprising one or more dispersing agents, solubilizing agents or suspending agents. Liquid sprays are conveniently delivered from pressurized packs. For administration by inhalation, the compounds according to the invention are conveniently delivered from an insufflator, nebulizer or a pressurized pack or other convenient means of delivering an aerosol spray. Pressurized packs may comprise a suitable propellant such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Alternatively, for administration by inhalation or insufflation, the compounds according to the invention may take the form of a dry powder composition, for example a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. The powder composition may be presented in unit dosage form in, for example, capsules or cartridges or, e.g., gelatin or blister packs from which the powder may be administered with the aid of an inhalator or insufflator. When desired, the above described formulations adapted to give sustained release of the active ingredient, may be employed. The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may also contain other active ingredients such as antimicrobial agents, or preservatives. The compounds of the invention may also be used in combination therapy to avoid the production of resistant viral strains. In particular, the compounds of the invention may also be used in combination with other therapeutic agents, for example, other anti-infective agents. In particular the compounds of the invention may be employed together with known antiviral agents. The invention thus provides, in a further aspect, a combination comprising a compound of formula (I) or a physiologically acceptable derivative thereof together with another therapeutically active agent, in particular, an antiviral agent. Suitable therapeutic agents for use in such combinations include nucleoside analogues such as 3TC, 3-azido-3-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2,3-dideoxycytidine (ddC), 2,3-dideoxyadenosine, 2,3-dideoxyinosine (ddI), 3-deoxythymidine, 2,3-dideoxy-2,3-didehydro-thymidine, and 2,3-dideoxy-2,3-didehydrocytidine and ribavirin; acyclic nucleosides such as acyclovir, ganciclovir, interferons such as alpha-, beta-and gamma-interferon; glucuronation inhibitors such as probenecid; nucleoside transport inhibitors such as dipyridamole; immunomodulators such as interleukin II (IL2) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), erythropoietin, ampligen, thymomodulin, thymopentin, foscarnet, glycosylation inhibitors such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose, castanospermine, 1-deoxynojirimycin; and inhibitors of HIV binding to CD4 receptors such as soluble CD4, CD4 fragments, CD4-hybrid molecules and inhibitors of the HIV aspartyl protease such as L-735,524. Suitable further therapeutic agents for use in such combinations also include non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as revirapine, TIBO, HEPT, BHAP, MKC-422, -APA, TSAO, calanolides, and L-697,661. Preferably, the further therapeutic agent is selected from: 3TC, AZT, ddC, and ddI. The individual components of such combinations may be administered either sequentially or simultaneously in separate or combined pharmaceutical formulations. The combinations referred to above may conveniently be presented for use in the form of a pharmaceutical formulation and thus pharmaceutical formulations comprising a combination as defined above together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier thereof comprise a further aspect of the invention. When the compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof is used in combination with a second therapeutic agent active against the same virus, the dose of each compound may be either the same or differ from that when the compound is used alone. Appropriate doses will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. It will be further appreciated that the amount of a compound of the invention and the amount of the further therapeutic agent required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular compound of the invention and the further therapeutic agent selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. In general, however, a suitable dose of the compound of the invention will be in the range from about 1 to about 750 mg/kg of body weight per day, such as 3 to about 120 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, preferably in the range of 6 to 90 mg/kg/day, most preferably in the range of 15 to 60 mg/kg/day. A suitable dose of the further therapeutic agent will be in the range from about 1 to about 750 mg/kg of body weight per day, such as 3 to about 120 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, preferably in the range of 6 to 90 mg/kg/day, most preferably in the range of 15 to 60 mg/kg/day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The invention will be further described by the following examples which are not intended to limit the invention in any way. All temperatures are in degrees Celsius.

Test compounds were serially diluted in 10-fold decrements from 100 g/ml to 0.01 g/ml (final concentrations in two 96 well microtitre plates. 20 l of infected cell suspension were inoculated into each well of one of the plates (anti-viral), while 20 l of uninfected cell suspension were added to each well of the second plate (cytotoxicity). The plates were then incubated for 7 days at 37 C. After incubation, 10 l of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) at 20 mg/ml was added to all wells and the plates incubated for a further 90 minutes at 37 C. 150 l of 10% (v/v) alcoholic Triton X-100 was then added and the cells resuspended.

The method used for this test is described in detail in Korba et al., Antiviral Research 15, 217-228 (1992) which is shortly described as follows: Hep G2 cells transfected with human hepatitis B virus genomic DNA (2.2.15 cells) were grown and maintained in RPMI-1640 culture medium containing 5 foetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine and 50 g/ml gentamicin sulphate, and checked routinely for G418 resistance. Cultures of 2.2.15 cells were grown to confluence in 24 well tissue culture plates and maintained for 2 to 3 days in that condition prior to drug treatment. Drugs were dissolved in sterile water or sterile 50% DMSO in water at concentrations 100-fold higher than the higher test concentration. These solutions were diluted as needed in culture medium. The culture medium on the confluent cells was changed 24 hours prior to exposure to test compounds. During the 10 day treatment, the culture medium was changed daily. After 10 days of the treatment, the culture medium was collected and frozen at 70 C. for HBV DNA analysis. To analyze extracellular HBV DNA, 0.2 ml samples of culture medium were incubated for 20 minutes at 25 C. in 1 M NaOH/10X SSC (1X SSC is 0.15 M NaCl/ 0.015 M Sodium Citrate, pH 7.2) and then applied to nitrocellulose membranes presoaked in 20X SSC. Filters were then rinsed in 2X SSC and baked at 80 C. for 1 hour under vacuum. A purified 3.2 kb EcoR1 HBV DNA fragment was labeled with 32 PdCTP by nick translation and used as a probe to detect HBV DNA on the dot-blot by DNA hybridization. After washing, the hybridized blot was dried and 32 P was quantified using an Ambis beta scanner.

BACKGROUND WO 95/10516, published Apr. 20, 1995 discloses tricyclic compounds useful for inhibiting famesyl protein transferase. In view of the current interest in inhibitors of farnesyl protein transferase, a welcome contribution to the art would be compounds useful for the inhibition of farnesyl protein transferase. Such a contribution is provided by this invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention provides compounds useful for the inhibition of farnesyl protein transferase (FPT). The compounds of this invention are represented by the formula: or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, wherein: a represents N or NO; R 1 and R 3 are the same or different halo atom; R 2 and R 4 are selected from H and halo, provided that at least one of R 2 and R 4 is H; the dotted line X is N, C when the optional bond is present, or CH when the optional bond is absent; T is a substituent selected from: wherein: A represents (CH 2 ) b ; B represents (CH 2 ) d ; b and d are independently selected from: 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 such that the sum of b and d is 3 or 4; and Y is selected from: O, S, SO, or SO 2 ; wherein: D represents (CH 2 ) e ; E represents (CH 2 ) f ; e and f are independently selected from: 0, 1, 2, or 3 such that the sum of e and f is 2 or 3; and Z is O: wherein: F represents (CH 2 ) g ; G represents (CH 2 ) h ; U represents (CH 2 ) i ; h represents 1, 2, or 3 g and i are independently selected from: 0, 1 or 2 such that the sum of h, g and i is 2 or 3; and V and W are independently selected from O, S, SO, or SO 2 ; wherein: the dotted line k is 1 or 2 such that when the optional bond is present k represents 1, and when the optional double bond is absent then k represents 2; R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 are the same alkyl (preferably methyl); or R 5 and R 7 are the same alkyl (preferably methyl), and R 6 and R 8 are H; wherein: the dotted lines Y represents O, S, SO, or SO 2 ; wherein: Y represents O, S, SO, or SO 2 ; wherein: R 9 is selected from: CN, CO 2 H, or C(O)N(R 10 ) 2 ; each R 10 is the same or different alkyl group (preferably, methyl); wherein: I represents (CH 2 ) m ; m represents 2 or 3; Y represents O, S, SO, or SO 2 ; and R 11 represents alkyl (preferably ethyl); The compounds of this invention: (i) potently inhibit farnesyl protein transferase, but not geranylgeranyl protein transferase I, in vitro; (ii) block the phenotypic change induced by a form of transforming Ras which is a farnesyl acceptor but not by a form of transforming Ras engineered to be a geranylgeranyl acceptor; (iii) block intracellular processing of Ras which is a farnesyl acceptor but not of Ras engineered to be a geranylgeranyl acceptor; and (iv) block abnormal cell growth in culture induced by transforming Ras. The compounds of this invention inhibit farnesyl protein transferase and the farnesylation of the oncogene protein Ras. Thus, this invention further provides a method of inhibiting farnesyl protein transferase, (e.g., ras farnesyl protein transferase) in mammals, especially humans, by the administration of an effective amount of the tricyclic compounds described above. The administration of the compounds of this invention to patients, to inhibit famesyl protein transferase, is useful in the treatment of the cancers described below. This invention provides a method for inhibiting or treating the abnormal growth of cells, including transformed cells, by administering an effective amount of a compound of this invention. Abnormal growth of cells refers to cell growth independent of normal regulatory mechanisms (e.g., loss of contact inhibition). This includes the abnormal growth of: (1) tumor cells (tumors) expressing an activated Ras oncogene; (2) tumor cells in which the Ras protein is activated as a result of oncogenic mutation in another gene; and (3) benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant Ras activation occurs. This invention also provides a method for inhibiting or treating tumor growth by administering an effective amount of the tricyclic compounds, described herein, to a mammal (e.g., a human) in need of such treatment. In particular, this invention provides a method for inhibiting or treating the growth of tumors expressing an activated Ras oncogene by the administration of an effective amount of the above described compounds. Examples of tumors which may be inhibited or treated include, but are not limited to, lung cancer (e.g., lung adenocarcinoma), pancreatic cancers (e.g., pancreatic carcinoma such as, for example, exocrine pancreatic carcinoma), colon cancers (e.g., colorectal carcinomas, such as, for example, colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma), myeloid leukemias (for example, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)), thyroid follicular cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), bladder carcinoma, epidermal carcinoma, breast cancer and prostate cancer. It is believed that this invention also provides a method for inhibiting or treating proliferative diseases, both benign and malignant, wherein Ras proteins are aberrantly activated as a result of oncogenic mutation in other genesi.e., the Ras gene itself is not activated by mutation to an oncogenic formwith said inhibition or treatment being accomplished by the administration of an effective amount of the tricyclic compounds described herein, to a mammal (e.g., a human) in need of such treatment. For example, the benign proliferative disorder neurofibromatosis, or tumors in which Ras is activated due to mutation or overexpression of tyrosine kinase oncogenes (e.g., neu, src, abl, lck, and fyn), may be inhibited or treated by the tricyclic compounds described herein. The tricyclic compounds useful in the methods of this invention inhibit or treat the abnormal growth of cells. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that these compounds may function through the inhibition of G-protein function, such as ras p21, by blocking G-protein isoprenylation, thus making them useful in the treatment of proliferative diseases such as tumor growth and cancer. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that these compounds inhibit ras farnesyl protein transferase, and thus show antiproliferative activity against ras transformed cells.

Certain compounds of the invention may exist in different isomeric (e.g., enantiomers and diastereoisomers) forms. The invention contemplates all such isomers both in pure form and in admixture, including racemic mixtures. Enol forms are also included. Certain tricyclic compounds will be acidic in nature, e.g. those compounds which possess a carboxyl or phenolic hydroxyl group. These compounds may form pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of such salts may include sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, gold and silver salts. Also contemplated are salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable amines such as ammonia, alkyl amines, hydroxyalkylamines, N-methylglucamine and the like. Certain basic tricyclic compounds also form pharmaceutically acceptable salts, e.g., acid addition salts. For example, the pyrido-nitrogen atoms may form salts with strong acid, while compounds having basic substituents such as amino groups also form salts with weaker acids. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic and other mineral and carboxylic acids well known to those in the art. The salts are prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in the conventional manner. The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous NaOH, potassium carbonate, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate. The free base forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the acid and base salts are otherwise equivalent to their respective free base forms for purposes of the invention. All such acid and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention and all acid and base salts are considered equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the invention. Compounds of the invention may be prepared according to the procedures described in WO 95/10516 published Apr. 20, 1995, U.S. Pat. No. 5,719,148 issued Feb. 17, 1998, and copending application Ser. No. 08/766,601 filed Dec. 12, 1996; the disclosures of each being incorporated herein by reference thereto; and according to the procedures described below. Compounds of the invention can be prepared according to the reaction: In the reaction, the cyclic ether carboxylic acid (14.0) is coupled to the tricyclic amine (14.0) using amide bond forming conditions well known to those skilled in the art.

For example, using the carbodiimide coupling methods, compounds of the invention can be produced according to the reaction: The cyclic ether carboxylic acids (14.0) are prepared by methods well known in the art. Commercially available cyclic ether ketones can be reacted in a Wittig reaction to produce olefinesters. The olefin is then reduced by catalytic hydrogenation or by metal hydride reduction to the saturated cyclic ether acetates which are then hydrolyzed to the cyclic ether acids (14.0). See, for example, J. Med. Chem. (1993), 36, 2300, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto. The reaction is illustrated in Scheme 1 below. In Scheme 1, n represents 0 or 1, and Q represents O or S. The exocyclic olefin from the Wittig reaction in Scheme 1 can be reacted with cyanide in a Michael reaction to form a nitrile, or with hydrogen peroxide to form an epoxide. The nitrile can be hydrolyzed to a carboxy group and later converted to amides. The epoxide can be hydrolyzed or reduced to an alcohol. This reaction, well known to those skilled in the art, is illustrated in Scheme 2 below. wherein n and Q are as defined in Scheme 1. The cyclic ether acetates can also be produced by the insertion of an acetate carbene into a CH bond next to the ether heteroatom of a cyclic ether, as described in Tetrahedron (1989), 45, 69. The acetate carbene can be produced from a diazo-acetate, such as ethyl diazoacetate, and a rhodium or copper catalyst, such as dirhodium diacetate of copper sulfate and heat. This is illustrated by the reaction: wherein n and Q are as defined in Scheme 1. If the cyclic ether contains a double bond, the acetate carbene can add to the double bond to produce a bicyclocyclic ether acetate as described in Comp. Rend. (1957), 244, 2806. If the double bond is adjacent to the ether heteroatom, the resulting cyclopropyl ring can be opened by catalytic hydrogenation by an alcohol and acid. This reaction is illustrated in Scheme 3 below. wherein n and Q are as defined in Scheme 1. Cyclic ethers containing a carboxy group directly attached can be prepared by a base catalyzed cyclization of a dihalo ether with diethyl malonate followed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation as described in J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1995), 15, 8401. This is illustrated by Scheme 4 below. wherein n and Q are as defined in Scheme 1. Many bicyclic-cyclic ether ketones are known in the literature. Many of these can be made by Deils-Alder processes. For example, J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1978), 100, 1765 describes the the reaction: These bicyclic-cyclic ether ketones can be reacted in a Wittig reaction as above to produce bicyclic-cyclic ether acetates. Compounds of Formula 13.0a are prepared by methods known in the art, for example by methods disclosed in WO 95/10516, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,151,423 and those described below.

Methods for preparing compounds of Formula 13.0a disclosed in WO 95/10516, U.S. Pat. No. 5,151,423 and described below employ a tricyclic ketone intermediate. Such intermediates of the formula wherein R 11b , R 1a , R 2a , R 3a and R 4a are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and halo, can be prepared by the following process comprising: (a) reacting a compound of the formula (i) with an amine of the formula NHR 5a R 6a , wherein R 5a and R 6a are as defined in the process above; in the presence of a palladium catalyst and carbon monoxide to obtain an amide of the formula: (ii) with an alcohol of the formula R 10a OH, wherein R 10a is C 1 -C 6 lower all or C 3 -C 6 cycloalkyl, in the presence of a palladium catalyst and carbon monoxide to obtain the ester of the formula followed by reacting the ester with an amine of formula NHR 5a R 6a to obtain the amide; (b) reacting the amide with an iodo-substituted benzyl compound of the formula wherein R 1a , R 2a , R 3a , R 4a and R 7a are as defined above, in the presence of a strong base to obtain a compound of the formula (c) cyclizing a compound of step (b) with a reagent of the formula R 8a MgL, wherein R 8a is C 1 -C 8 alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl and L is Br or Cl, provided that prior to cyclization, compounds wherein R 5a or R 6a is hydrogen are reacted with a suitable N-protecting group. Compounds of Formula 1.0, wherein substituent a is NO (Ring I) and X is C or CH, can be made from compounds of Formula 13.0a using procedures well known to those skilled in the art. For example the compound of Formula 13.0a can be reacted with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in a suitable organic solvent, e.g., dichloromethane (usually anhydrous) or methylene chloride, at a suitable temperature, to produce a compound of Formula 13.0b Generally, the organic solvent solution of Formula 13.0a is cooled to about 0 C. before the m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid is added. The reaction is then allowed to warm to room temperature during the reaction period. The desired product can be recovered by standard separation means. For example, the reaction mixture can be washed with an aqueous solution of a suitable base, e.g., saturated sodium bicarbonate or NaOH (e.g., 1 N NaOH), and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solution containing the product can be concentrated in vacuo. The product can be purified by standard means, e.g., by chromatography using silica gel (e.g., flash column chromatography). Alternatively, compounds of Formula 1.0, wherein substituent a is NO and X Is C or CH, can be made from i compounds of Formula 1.0, wherein substituent a is N, by the m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid oxidation procedure described above. Also, alternatively, the compounds of Formula 1.0, wherein substituent a is NO and X is C or CH, can be made from tricyclic ketone compounds using the oxidation procedure with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid. The oxidized intermediate compounds are then reacted by methods known in the art to produce compounds of the invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the oxidation reaction can be conducted on racemic mixtures and the isomers can then be separated by know techniques, or the isomers can be separated first and then oxidized to the corresponding N-oxide. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that it is preferable to avoid an excess of m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid when the oxidation reaction is carried out on the compounds having a C-11 double bond to piperidine Ring IV. In these reactions an excess of m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid can cause epoxidation of the C-11 double bond. ()-Isomers of compounds of Formula 13.0a wherein X is CH can be prepared with high enantioselectivity by using a process comprising enzyme catalyzed transesterification. Preferably, a racemic compound of Formula 13.0a, wherein X is C, the double bond is present and R 4 is not H, is reacted with an enzyme such as Toyobo LIP-300 and an acylating agent such as trifluoroethly isobutyrate; the resultant ()-amide is then hydrolyzed, for example by refluxing with an acid such as H 2 SO 4 , to obtain the corresponding optically enriched ()-isomer wherein X is CH and R 3 is not H. Alternatively, a racemic compound of Formula 13.0a, wherein X is C, the double bond is present and R 4 is not H, is first reduced to the corresponding racemic compound of Formula 13.0a wherein X Is CH and then treated with the enzyme (Toyobo LIP-300) and acylating agent as described above to obtain the ()-amide, which is hydrolyzed to obtain the optically enriched ()-isomer. Compounds of the invention, wherein a is NO and X is N, can be prepared from the tricyclic ketone (II) described above. Ketone (II) can be converted to the corresponding C-11 hydroxy compound which in turn can be converted to the corresponding C-11 chloro compound and (IV) can then be reacted with piperazine to produce the intermediate Intermediate (V) can then be reacted with the reagents, using techniques well known in the art, which will provide the desired compound.

ASSAYS FPT IC 50 (inhibition of farnesyl protein transferase, in vitro enzyme assay) and COS Cell IC 50 (Cel-Based Assay) were determined following the assay procedures described in WO 95/10516, published Apr.20, 1995. GGPT IC 50 (inhibition of geranylgeranyl protein transferase, in vitro enzyme assay), Cell Mat Assay, and anti-tumor activity (in vivo anti-tumor studies) could be determined by the assay procedures described in WO 95/10516. The disclosure of WO 95/10516 is incorporated herein by reference thereto. Additional assays can be carried out by following essentially the same procedure as described above, but with substitution of alternative indicator tumor cell lines in place of the T24-BAG cells. The assays can be conducted using either DLD-1-BAG human colon carcinoma cells expressing an activated K-ras gene or SW620-BAG human colon carcinoma cells expressing an activated K-ras gene. Using other tumor cell lines known in the art, the activity of the compounds of this invention against other types of cancer cells could be demonstrated. Soft Agar Assay Anchorage-independent growth is a characteristic of tumorigenic cell lines. Human tumor cells can be suspended in growth medium containing 0.3% agarose and an indicated concentration of a farnesyl transferase inhibitor. The solution can be overlayed onto growth medium solidified with 0.6% agarose containing the same concentration of farnesyl transferase inhibitor as the top layer. After the top layer is solidified, plates can be incubated for 10-16 days at 37 C. under 5% CO 2 to allow colony outgrowth. After incubation, the colonies can be stained by overlaying the agar with a solution of MIT (3-4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Thiazolyl blue) (1 mg/mL in PBS). Colonies can be counted and the lC 50 s can be determined. The results are given in Table 3. In Table 3, nM represents nanomolar.

For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds described by this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. The powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 70 percent active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are known in the art, e.g. magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed homogeneously therein as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby solidify. Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection. Liquid form preparations may also include solutions for intranasal administration. Aerosol preparations suitable for Inhalation may include solutions and solids in powder form, which may be in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as an inert compressed gas. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. The compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal compositions can take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose. Preferably the compound is administered orally. Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose. The quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from about 0.1 mg to 1000 mg, more preferably from about 1 mg. to 300 mg, according to the particular application. The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. The amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of the invention and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the symptoms being treated. A typical recommended dosage regimen is oral administration of from 10 mg to 2000 mg/day preferably 10 to 1000 mg/day, in two to four divided doses to block tumor growth. The compounds are non-toxic when administered within this dosage range. The following are examples of pharmaceutical dosage forms which contain a compound of the invention.

formula (I): wherein all symbols are defined in the specification, or an acid addition salt thereof or a hydrate thereof; a process for preparing the same; and a nitrogen monoxide synthase inhibitor comprising the same as an active ingredient. This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/056,867 filed Apr. 8, 1998, U.S. Pat. No. 6,110,930 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a nitrogen monoxide synthase inhibitor. More particularly, it relates to a condensed piperidine compound represented by formula (I): wherein all the symbols have the same meanings as defined below, or an acid addition salt or a hydrate thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The discovery that microphages, one kind of immunocompetent cells, produce a large quantity of nitrates led to the discovery that nitrogen monoxide (NO) is biologically synthesized ( Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A., Vol. 82, pp. 7738-7742 (1985) and J. Immunol., Vol. 138, pp. 550-565 (1987)). In the field of circulatory organs, a substance having a relaxing action that is released from endothelial cells was discovered and named an endothelial cell-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). It was found later that the substance of EDRF is NO ( Nature, Vol. 327, pp. 524-526 (1987)). NO, which has recently been revealed to be produced biologically, is synthesized through the following route by the action of a nitrogen monoxide synthase (hereinafter abbreviated as NOS) on an L-arginine substrate. NOS includes at least a constitutive isozyme (endothelial type and neuronal type) and an inducible isozyme. Endothelial NOS exists chiefly in endothelial cells, and its activity is controlled by an intercellular calcium concentration. Neuronal NOS exists in central nervous cells, peripheral nervous cells, islet cells, gastrointestinal nerves, the medulla of the suprarenal glands, renal macula densa, etc., and its activity is under control by an intercellular calcium concentration similarly to the endothelial type NOS. The constitutive NOS (inclusive of endothelial type and neuronal type, hereinafter abbreviated as c-NOS) always exist in the cells in amounts almost unchangeable under physiological conditions. On the other hand, the inducible NOS (hereinafter abbreviated as i-NOS) can exist in hepatocytes, neutrophil leucocytes, macrophages, smooth muscle, fibroblasts, mesangium cells, gastrointestinal eliphelium, islet cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, gliocytes, etc. Usually, the inducible NOS is not observed in cells but induced on stimulation by endotoxins and/or various cytokines. NO synthesized by the action of NOS exhibits a wide variety of actions, for example, vascular relaxation, inhibition on blood platelet aggregation and adherence, inhibition on leucocyte adherence and migration, inhibition on sympathetic activity, endotoxin shocks, endotoxin- or cytokine-induced hypotension, action as a neurotransmitter, ischemic cerebral cell disturbances, antitumor action, bactericidal action, induction of autoimmune diseases, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or arthritis, induction of post-transplantation tissue disturbances and graft rejection, and the like. An NO synthase inhibitor (NOS inhibitor) is not only useful in analyzing the in vivo physiological activities of NO but is expected as a therapeutic agent for shocks or ischemic diseases. Therefore, various NOS inhibitors have recently been developed. For example, arginine analogues, such as N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), N-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA), N-amino-L-arginine (L-NAA), and N-iminoethylornithine (L-NIO), are known as a substrate competitive agent. Known cofactor competitive inhibitors include diphenylene iodonium (DPI), di-2-thienyl iodonium (DTI), and calcineurin. Known gene transcription induction inhibitors include corticosteroid, TGF, IL-4 and IL-10.

The capsules include hard capsules and soft capsules. The liquid compositions for oral administration include solutions, emulsions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs. The liquid compositions for oral administration can contain generally used inert diluents (e.g., purified water, ethanol). If desired, the liquid compositions can contain adjuvants, such as wetting agents and suspending agents, sweeteners, flavors, aromatics, and antiseptics in addition to the inert diluents. Other compositions for oral administration include sprays containing one or more active ingredients, which are prepared in a conventional manner. Sprays can contain stabilizers (e.g., sodium sulfite) and buffers for making the composition isotonic (e.g., sodium chloride, sodium citrate, citric acid) as well as inert diluents. The sprays can be prepared by the methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,868,691 and 3,095,355. The injectable preparations for non-oral administration include sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, suspension or emulsions. The injectable preparations are prepared by mixing at least one active ingredient with at least one inert aqueous diluent (e.g., distilled water for injections, physiological saline) or inert nonaqueous diluent (e.g., propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, olive oil, ethanol, Polysorbate 80 (registered trade name)). They can further contain antiseptics and adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifiers, dispersants, stabilizers (e.g., human serum albumin, lactose), dissolution aids (e.g., arginine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone), and the like. The resulting liquid compositions are usually sterilized by filtration through a bacteria-trapping filter, etc., incorporation of bactericides or irradiation. The sterilized composition may be solidified by, for example, freeze-drying, to obtain a solid composition, which is dissolved in aseptic water or aseptic diluent on use. The present invention will now be illustrated in greater detail with reference to Reference Examples, Preparation Examples, Formulation Example, and Test Examples, but it should be understood that the present invention is not construed as being limited thereto.

thereof which are useful as antagonists of GnRH and as such may be useful for the treatment of a variety of sex-hormone related and other conditions in both men and women. This application claims the benefit of Provisional No. 60/080,405 filed Apr. 2, 1998. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), also referred to as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), is a decapeptide that plays a key role in human reproduction. The hormone is released from the hypothalamus and acts on the pituitary gland to stimulate the biosynthesis and secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). LH released from the pituitary gland is primarily responsible for the regulation of gonadal steroid production in both sexes, whereas FSH regulates spermatogenesis in males and follicular development in females. GnRH agonists and antagonists have proven effective in the treatment of certain conditions which require inhibition of LH/FSH release. In particular, GnRH-based therapies have proven effective in the treatment of endometriosis, uterine fibroids, polycystic ovarian disease, precocious puberty and several gonadal steroid-dependent neoplasia, most notably cancers of the prostate, breast and ovary. GnRH agonists and antagonists have also been utilized in various assisted fertilization techniques and have been investigated as a potential contraceptive in both men and women.

Unless otherwise stated or indicated, the following definitions shall apply throughout the specification and claims. When any variable (e.g., aryl, heterocycle, R 1 , etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent or in formula I, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. The term alkyl is intended to include both branched-and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms, e.g., methyl (Me), ethyl (Et), propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonanyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, and the isomers thereof such as isopropyl (i-Pr), isobutyl (i-Bu), sec-butyl (s-Bu), tert-butyl (t-Bu), isopentane, isohexane, etc. The term aryl includes phenyl and naphthyl. In a preferred embodiment, aryl is phenyl. The term halogen or halo is intended to include fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. The term heterocycle or heterocyclic ring is defined by all non-aromatic, heterocyclic rings of 3-7 atoms containing 1-3 heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, such as oxirane, oxetane, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, pyrrolidine, piperidine, tetrahydropyridine, tetrahydropyrimidine, tetrahydrothiophene, tetrahydrothiopyran, morpholine, hydantoin, valerolactam, pyrrolidinone, and the like. As used herein, the term composition is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. In addition, it is well known to those skilled in the art that many of the foregoing heterocyclic groups can exist in more than one tautomeric form. It is intended that all such tautomers be included within the ambit of this invention. The optical isomeric forms, that is mixtures of enantiomers, e.g., racemates, or diastereomers as well as individual enantiomers or diastereomers of the instant compound are included. These individual enantiomers are commonly designated according to the optical rotation they effect by the symbols () and (), (L) and (D), (1) and (d) or combinations thereof. These isomers may also be designated according to their absolute spatial configuration by (S) and (R), which stands for sinister and rectus, respectively. The individual optical isomers may be prepared using conventional resolution procedures, e.g., treatment with an appropriate optically active acid, separating the diastereomers and then recovering the desired isomer. In addition, the individual optical isomers may be prepared by asymmetric synthesis. Additionally, a given chemical formula or name shall encompass pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts thereof and solvates thereof, such as hydrates. The compounds of the present invention, while effective themselves, may be formulated and administered in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts for purposes of stability, convenience of crystallization, increased solubility and other desirable properties. The compounds of the present invention may be administered in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salt is intended to include all acceptable salts. Examples of acid salts are hydrochloric, nitric, sulfuric, phosphoric, formic, acetic, trifluoroacetic, propionic, maleic, succinic, malonic, methanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic and the like which can be used as a dosage form for modifying the solubility or hydrolysis characteristics or can be used in sustained release or prodrug formulations. Depending on the particular functionality of the compound of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include those formed from cations such as sodium, potassium, aluminum, calcium, lithium, magnesium, zinc, and from bases such as ammonia, ethylenediamine, N-methyl-glutamine, lysine, arginine, ornithine, choline, N,N-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, diethanolamine, procaine, N-benzylphenethylamine, diethylamine, piperazine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, and tetramethylammonium hydroxide. These salts may be prepared by standard procedures, e.g. by reacting a free acid with a suitable organic or inorganic base, or alternatively by reacting a free base with a suitable organic or inorganic acid. Also, in the case of an acid (COOH) or alcohol group being present, pharmaceutically acceptable esters can be employed, e.g. methyl, ethyl, butyl, acetate, maleate, pivaloyloxymethyl, and the like, and those esters known in the art for modifying solubility or hydrolysis characteristics for use as sustained release or prodrug formulations. The compounds of the present invention may have chiral centers other than those centers whose stereochemistry is depicted in formula I, and therefore may occur as racemates, racemic mixtures and as individual enantiomers or diastereomers, with all such isomeric forms being included in the present invention as well as mixtures thereof. Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for compounds of the present invention may exist as polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention. In addition, some of the compounds of the instant invention may form solvates with water or common organic solvents. Such solvates are encompassed within the scope of this invention. The compounds of the invention are prepared according to the following reaction schemes. All of the substituents are as defined above unless indicated otherwise. A preferred method for the synthesis of the substituted tryptamines described in this invention utilizes a palladium-catalyzed cross coupling reaction as a key step as shown in Scheme A. This 7-azaindole synthesis involves the reaction of a suitably functionalized 3-iodo-2-aminopyridine (1) with substituted acetylenes such as 2 in the presence of a base like sodium carbonate, lithium chloride, and a palladium catalyst such as (dppf)PdCl 2 CH 2 Cl 2 . The reaction is conducted in an inert organic solvent such as dimethylformamide at elevated temperatures, for instance at 100 C., and the reaction is conducted for a period of about 30 minutes to about 24 hours. A standard workup and isolation affords the substituted isomeric indole derivatives 3 and 4, and the isomer of general formula 3 is the preferred isomer. The acetylene utilized in this reaction may be a terminal acetylene (2a) or be optionally substituted on the terminal carbon atom with a substituent Z (2b, 2c). The substituent abbreviated PG 1 indicates an alcohol protecting group such as a benzyl ether, tert-butyl ether or the like. The nature of the Z substituent determines the distribution of the 7-azaindole isomers (3 and 4) produced in the reaction. For example, if the substituent Z on the acetylene is a hydrogen atom then the isomer 4a is the major product of the reaction. When the substituent Z is chosen to be a substituted silyl group such as trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl (as shown), or the like, then isomer 3b is formed almost exclusively. When Z is a substituted aryl group, then both isomers 3c and 4c may be formed and the product mixture is separated using chromatographic or crystallization techniques to afford the individual isomers. If the synthesis is conducted with a silyl-substituted acetylene 2b to produce a silyl-substituted 7-azaindole 3b, then the silyl group is next converted to an aryl or substituted aryl group of general formula 3c using the reactions described later in Scheme E. The 2-arylsubstituted 7-azaindole derivatives 3c formed either directly from arylacetylenes (2c) as shown in Scheme A or from 2-trialkylsilyl-7-azaindoles using the method of Scheme E are then fuirther elaborated as described below to produce the novel 7-azaindole derivatives described in this invention. Scheme B illustrates the preparation of substituted 3-iodo-2-aminopyridines (1) which are utilized in the Larock 7-azaindole synthesis described in Scheme A. The 3-iodo-2-aminopyridines (1) may be prepared in several ways described in the literature of organic synthesis. A preferred method involves the ortho-iodination of substituted 2-aminopyridine derivatives of general formula 9 with an electrophilic iodination reagent such as iodine, iodine monochloride, N-iodosuccinimide or the like. The ortho-iodination of 2-aminopyridine derivatives (9) as illustrated in Scheme B employs iodine and silver trifluoroacetate in a suitable organic solvent like methanol at room temperature and 3-iodo-2-aminopyridines of general formula 1 are produced in high yield. In some cases, 2-aminopyridine derivatives such as 9 may be commercially available or alternatively they may be prepared using methodologies known in organic chemistry. For instance, application of methodology reported by Wachi and Terada (Wachi, K.; Terada, A. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1980, 28, 465) allows the conversion of pyridines of general formula 5 to 2-aminopyridines of general formula 9 as shown at the top of Scheme B. In this synthetic transformation, a substituted pyridine (5) is first converted to the corresponding N-oxide (6) with a suitable oxidant such as meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. In the next step, the substituted pyridine N-oxide 6 is reacted with 4-chloro-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1,3-benzoxazine (7) in an inert high boiling solvent such as 1,2-dichloroethane. An adduct initially formed in this reaction undergoes a thermal rearrangement and the N-pyridyl substituted 4-oxo-4H1-1,3-benzoxazine 8 is produced. Finally, the substituted benzoxazine 8 is hydrolyzed with concentrated hydrochloric acid at elevated temperature to afford the substituted 2-aminopyridines of general formula 9. Acetylenic compounds of general structure 2 are prepared using one of several methods depending upon the choice of the desired substituents. When the substituents R 9 , R 9a , R 10 and R 10a , a are selected to be hydrogen or lower alkyl groups, compounds of formula 2 may be prepared from known acetylenic alcohols such as 3-butyn-1-ol, 4-pentyn-2-ol or similar acetylenic alcohols reported in the chemical literature. The conversion of acetylenic alcohols of general formula 10 to acetylene derivatives of general formula 2 is shown in Scheme C. For clarity the hydroxyl protecting group (PG 1 ) illustrated in Scheme C is exemplified as an O-benzyl ether. Thus, reaction of 10 with O-benzyl-2,2,2-trichloroacetimidate in the presence of a catalytic amount of a strong acid such as trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and in a suitable inert organic solvent like carbon tetrachloride at room temperature affords after 2 to 24 hours the protected acetylenic alcohol 2a. Compounds of formula 2a may in turn be converted to acetylenes (2b) of general formula 2 wherein Z is a trialkylsilyl group by deprotonation of the acetylene with a base such as n-butyllithium in an inert organic solvent like tetrahydrofuran followed by reaction with a trialkylsilyl chloride such as triethylchlorosilane. The deprotonation and silylation reactions are generally conducted at low temperatures, for instance between about 78 C. and room temperature, and after standard workup and purification a silylacetylene of formula 2b is obtained. As previously stated, acetylenes of general formula 2c wherein Z is an aryl or substituted aryl group, are also useful in the 7-azaindole synthesis illustrated in Scheme A. Arylacetylenes 2c may be prepared using a coupling reaction of cuprous acetylides derived from acetylenic alcohols of formula 2a with various aryl halides or aryl triflates (11). Such coupling reactions produce aryl acetylenes of general formula 12 as shown at the bottom of Scheme C. These reactions are generally carried out in a basic organic solvent like triethylamine at elevated temperatures, typically between about 60 C. and about 120 C., and the coupling reaction is catalyzed by copper(I) salts such as cuprous iodide and a palladium catalyst such as palladium acetate in combination with triphenylphosphine. The hydroxyl group of the arylacetylenes of general formula 12 can be protected with a suitable protecting group such as the O-benzyl ether group shown in Scheme C, to afford an arylacetylene (2c) of general formula 2 wherein Z is an aryl or substituted aryl group. It is also recognized that in some cases it may 5 be preferable to reverse the order of the steps illustrated in Scheme C. For instance, acetylenic alcohols (7) may be subjected to silylation or arylation prior to the hydroxyl group protection step. Another useful approach for the preparation of acetylenic compounds of general formula 2a employs an ethynylation reaction sequence of aldehydes of general formula 16 as shown in Scheme D. The aldehydes (16) used in the ethynylation sequence may be prepared using various methods known in organic synthesis starting with hydroxyesters of general formula 13, from protected hydroxyesters of formula 14, or from alcohols related to the mono-hydroxyl protected diols of formula 15. The choice of preferred starting material depends upon the nature of the substituents R 9 , R 9a , R 10 , and R 10a selected. Scheme D illustrates this strategy begining with the generalized hydroxy ester 13. Protection of the hydroxyl group of 13, for instance as the O-benzylether shown, affords a protected hydroxy ester of formula 14. The ester group of compounds of formula 14 can then be converted to an aldehyde of formula 16 either directly using a reagent like diisobutylaluminum hydride in a solvent like toluene, or through a two step process. In the two step process, reduction of the ester group with a reagent such as lithium aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran affords alcohols of formula 15 which are then subjected to reoxidation, for instance using a Swern-Moffatt oxidation, to afford the desired aldehydes of formula 16. The ethynylation of aldehydes of formula 16 is accomplished in two steps. First, aldehydes (16) are reacted with carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in an inert organic solvent like dichloro-methane to produce the dibromo olefins of formula 17. Next, the dibromo olefins (17) are treated with two equivalents of a strong base such as n-butyllithium in tetrahydrofiran at low temperature, for instance at about 78 C. The strong base induces dehydrohalogenation and metal-halogen exchange to afford lithium acetylides which upon quenching and workup afford acetylenes of general formula 2a. Alternatively, the intermediate lithium acetylides formed in the reaction may be treated with a trialkylsilyl chloride, such as triethylchlorosilane, to afford silylacetylenes of general formula 2b. The conversion of 2-silyl-substituted 7-azaindoles of general formula 3b to 2-aryl-substituted 7-azaindoles of general formula 3c may be accomplished in two steps as shown in Scheme E. The first step is a halodesilylation reaction which converts silyl-substituted 7-azaindoles of formula 3b into 2-halo7-azaindoles of general formula 18. Scheme E illustrates this process using iodine monochloride so that the product obtained is a 2-iodoindole of general formula 18. Silver tetrafluoroborate is also employed in this example to increase the reactivity of the halogenating reagent. It is possible to effect the halodesilylation reaction with other electrophilic halogenating reagents such as N-bromosuccinimide in dichloromethane which affords a 2-bromo-7-azaindole derivative. Both 2-bromo and 2-iodo-7-azaindoles of formula 18 are useful in the subsequent step. The second step is a palladium-catalyzed cross coupling reaction of the 2-halo-7-azaindole 18 with a suitable aryl or substituted aryl organometallic reagent 19. Scheme E illustrates this process with an aryl or substituted arylboronic acid as the organometallic reagent, however, other organometallic reagents known to participate in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions such as arylboronic esters or arylstannanes may also be employed. In the example, a 2-iodo-7-azaindole of general formula 18 is coupled with a generalized boronic acid (19) using a catalyst such as 1,1-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene dichloropalladium(II) complex with dichloromethane (shown), tetrakis (triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0) or the like. The reaction is usually conducted at temperatures between room temperature and about 100 C., for instance at about 80 C. This palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reaction may be effected using various combinations of palladium catalysts and solvent compositions known in organic chemistry, and the selection of the conditions is made depending upon the type of organo-metallic reagent (19) used and the identity of the substituent groups in the two starting materials. When the organometallic reagent is a boronic acid or boronate ester then a preferred solvent mixture consists of toluene, ethanol and an aqueous solution of a base like cesium or sodium carbonate. If instead the organometallic reagent 19 is an arylstannane, then no additional base is required, and a polar aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide is employed. The next stage of the synthesis of the novel 7-azaindole derivatives is illustrated in Scheme F. This sequence of reactions begins with protection of the 7-azaindole with an amine protecting group (PG 2 ) to afford compounds of general formula 20. The protection step is required to avoid competing side rections of the 2-aryltryptophol of formula 21 (where PG 2 is H) in the later conversion of compounds of formula 21 to compounds of formula 22. The indole protection is followed by removal of the hydroxyl protecting group (PGh) from the side chain at the C-3 position of the 7-azaindole ring to afford compounds of general formula 21. Finally, the hydroxyl group of 21 is converted to a primary amine of general formula 23 which is then further functionalized as shown below in the following schemes. The choice of an appropriate amine protecting group (PG 2 ) for the 7-azaindole is determined primarily by which protecting group (PG 1 ) is present on the hydroxyl group in the C-3 sidechain, and by consideration of the chemical stability of the amine protecting group (PG 1 ) required in the remaining steps of the synthesis. When the hydroxyl protecting group (PG 1 ) is an O-benzyl ether as illustrated previously in Schemes C and D, the 7-azaindole may be protected as a carbamate derivative such as a tert-butylcarbamate (BOC). In this case, the BOC-protected 7-azaindole is stable under the hydrogenolysis conditions which are used to remove the O-benzyl ether and it may be conveniently removed at the end of the synthesis using acidic conditions. If it is desired to synthesize compounds of formula (I) wherein R 0 is alkyl, substituted alkyl or the like, then it is possible to introduce that substituent at this point and the use of a protecting group and its subsequent removal is not required. An alcohol of general formula 21 may be converted to a primary amine of general formula 23 using a variety of methods known in the literature of organic chemistry. The bottom of Scheme F illustrates a process where the alcohol 21 is first converted to an azide of general formula 22, followed by reduction to afford the amine derivative 23. The synthesis of an azide of general formula 22 from alcohols like 21 is best accomplished by performing a Mitsunobu reaction in the presence of an appropriate azide source such as diphenylphosphoryl iazide or zinc azide pyridine complex. Scheme F illustrates the reaction of alcohol 21 with triphenylphosphine, diethylazodicarboxylate, zinc azide pyridine complex and a proton source such as imidazole in an inert solvent like methylene chloride or tetrahydrofuran. The reaction is usually conducted at room temperature for periods between 1-24 hours, typically overnight or about 15 hours, and affords the azide of general formula 22 in good yield. Finally, an azide of formula 22 may then be reduced to an amine of formula 23 using one of several methods common in organic synthesis. One preferred method is catalytic hydrogenation in a solvent like methanol or ethanol in the presence of a catalyst such as 10% palladium on carbon. Alternatively, azides like 22 may be reacted with triphenylphosphine to form an iminophosphorane which upon hydrolysis with water affords the amine of formula 23 and triphenylphophine oxide. The final stage of the synthesis of the novel 7-azaindole derivatives (I) involves elaboration of the sidechain at the C-3 position of the 7-azaindole core. One method for the completion of the synthesis is illustrated in Scheme G. As shown, the 2-aryltryptamine (23) may be condensed with a carboxylic acid of type 24 using the coupling reagent 1-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), 1,3-dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide (DCC) or the like with or without 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and a tertiary amine base such as N-methylmorpholine (NMM), triethylamine or the like in an inert organic solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, dimethylformamide, or mixtures thereof at or near room temperature for a period of 3-24 hours to provide the corresponding amide derivative (25). Alternatively, 2-aryltryptamine 23 can be treated with an active ester or acid chloride of formula 26 in an inert organic solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, or the like and a tertiary amine base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine or the like at a temperature of 0-25 C. for 30 minutes to 4 hours to give compound 25. As shown in reaction Scheme H, the amide carbonyl of 25 can be reduced by treatment with borane, lithium aluminum hydride, or equivalent hydride sources in an inert organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, 1,4-dioxane or the like at about 25 to about 100 C., preferably about 65 C., for a period of 1-8 hours to give the corresponding amine 27. As shown in reaction Scheme I, the 2-aryltryptamine 23 can be modified by treatment with an aldehyde or ketone of type 28 in the presence of a weak acid such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), acetic acid or the like, with or without a dessicant such as 3 molecular sieves or magnesium sulfate, and a hydride source such as sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride, in an inert organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, chloroform, or mixtures thereof at a temperature of about O to about 25 C. for a period of 1-12 hours to give the corresponding secondary or tertiary amine derivative 29. As shown in reaction Scheme J, the tryptamine 23 can be modified using the Fukuyama modification of the Mitsunobu reaction (Fukuyama, T.; Jow, C.-K.; Cheung, M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995, 36, 6373-74). The tryptamine 23 may be reacted with an arylsufonyl chloride such as 2-nitrobenzene-sulfonyl chloride, 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride or 2,4-dinitrobenzene-sulfonyl chloride and a hindered amine base such as 2,4,6-collidine, 2,6-lutidine or the like in an inert organic solvent such as methylene chloride to provide the corresponding sulfonamide 30. The sulfonamides can be further modified by reaction with an alcohol of type 31 in the presence of triphenylphosphine and an activating agent such as diethylazodicarboxylate (DEAD), diisopropylazodicaboxylate or the like in an inert organic solvent such as benzene, toluene, tetrahydro-furan or mixtures thereof to give the dialkylsulfonamide adduct. Removal of a dinitrobenzenesulfonyl group is accomplished by treatment with a nucleophilic amine such as n-propylamine or the like in an inert organic solvent such as methylene chloride to give secondary amines of type 32. When a mono-nitrobenzenesulfonyl derivative is employed, the removal of the sulfonamide is accomplished with a more nucleophilic reagent such as thiophenol or mercaptoacetic acid in combination with lithium hydroxide in DMF. Reaction Scheme K illustrates a method that is complimentary to reaction Scheme J for completing the synthesis of the novel compounds of formula (I). Scheme K also employs the Fukuyama modification of the Mitsunobu reaction similar to that illustrated in reaction Scheme J. However in this instance, the alcohol partner employed is a 2-aryltryptophol of general formula 21 which has been decribed previously in reaction Scheme F. The 2-aryltryptophol (21) is reacted with a substituted sulfonamide of general formula 33, triphenylphosphine and diethylazodicarboxylate in a suitable inert organic solvent such as benzene, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane or the like. The reaction is generally conducted at room temperature for a period of 2 to 24 hours, typically overnight or for about 12-16 hours. The product is an N,N-disubstituted sulfonamide which is then separately subjected to reaction with a base such as n-propylamine which removes the sulfonamide substituent and furnishes a secondary amine related to formula 32. The sulfonamides of formula 33 employed are readily obtained from a primary amine and either 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride, 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride or 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (as shown) in the presence of a hindered amine base such as 2,4,6-collidine, 2,6-lutidine or the like in an inert organic solvent such as methylene chloride. The final stage of the synthesis requires removal of the protecting group on the 7-azaindole nitrogen atom (PG 2 ) which produces a compound of general formula 32 wherein Ro is a hydrogen atom. It will be recognized by individuals skilled in the art of organic synthesis that a preference for utilizing either the synthetic sequences outlined in reaction Schemes J or K will be determined by the substituents selected to be present in the compounds of formula (I). The compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of various sex-hormone related conditions in men and women. This utility is manifested in their ability to act as antagonists of the neuropeptide hormone GnRH as demonstrated by activity in the following in vitro assays. GnRH receptor binding assay The ligand binding assay is conducted with the human GnRH receptor (hGnRHR) obtained from CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the cloned receptor. Crude membrane suspensions are prepared from large batches of hGnRHR-CHO-K1 cells and stored as aliquots at 80 C. The radioactive peptide ligand 5-( 125 Iodo-Tyr)-Buserelin is obtained from Woods Assays (Portland, Oreg.) and has a radioactive specific activity of 1000 Ci/mmol. The membranes and the radioligand are diluted in assay buffer which consists of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl 2 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The ligand binding assay is performed at 22 C. for 1 hour in 96well polypropylene plates in a final volume of 200 ul. Each well in the assay plate contains 0.1 nM 152 I-buserelin, 10-15 ug of hGnRH receptor-membrane protein and the test compound. Test compounds are examined over a range of concentrations from 0.01 to 10,000 nM. The incubation is terminated by vacuum filtration onto 96well Packard GF/C Unifilter plates (pretreated with 0.1% polyethyleneimine) and then washed with 2 mL of cold phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.5). The Unifilter plates are dried prior to addition of scintillation fluid and counting in a Packard TopCount detector Phosphoinositide (PI) turnover assay Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing the human GnRH receptor finctionally coupled to phospholipase C were established and seeded at a concentration of 60,000 cells/mL/well in inositol-free F12 medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 1% Pen/Strep, 2 mM glutamine, 500 g/mL G418 and 1 Ci ( 3 H)inositol in 24-well tray. Forty-eight hours after seeding, cells were washed with 31 mL of PBS containing 10 mM LiCl and treated with various concentrations of GnRH antagonist for 2 hrs at 37 C. before the addition of 0.5 nM GnRH. After incubation at 37 C. for an additional 60 min, the medium was removed and the cells were lysed with 1 mL of 0.1 M formic acid. The trays were freeze-thawed once and the cell extract was applied onto a Dowex AG1-X8 column. The column was washed with 21 mL H 2 O to remove free ( 3 H)inositol and ( 3 H)inositol phosphates were eluted with 31 mL 2 M ammonium formate in 1M formic acid. The eluate was then counted in a scintillation counter. The compounds of formula I are useful in a number of areas affected by GnRH.

Such peptide compounds include leuprorelin, gonadorelin, buserelin, triptorelin, goserelin, nafarelin, histrelin, deslorelin, meterlin and recirelin. For combination treatment with more than one active agent, where the active agents are in separate dosage formulations, the active agents may be administered separately or in conjunction. In addition, the administration of one element may be prior to, concurrent to, or subsequent to the administration of the other agent. The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil. Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethylene-oxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame. Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid. Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy beans, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringers solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. Compounds of Formula I may also be administered in the form of a suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compound of Formula I are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouth washes and gargles.) The compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered as a suppository employing bases such as cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights and fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol. The dosage regimen utilizing the compounds of the present invention is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic function of the patient; and the particular compound thereof employed. A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter, arrest or reverse the progress of the condition. Optimal precision in achieving concentra- tion of drug within the range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the drugs availability to target sites. This involves a consideration of the distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of a drug. Preferably, doses of the compound of structural formula I useful in the method of the present invention range from 0.01 to 1000 mg per adult human per day. Most preferably, dosages range from 0.1 to 500 mg/day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 0.01 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, particularly 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of from about 0.0002 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg of body weight per day. The range is more particularly from about 0.001 mg/kg to 1 mg/lkg of body weight per day. Advantageously, the active agent of the present invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in dividend doses of two, three or four times daily. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. The following examples illustrate the preparation of some of the compounds of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the invention disclosed herein.

treating cancer. Also disclosed are pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds of Formula I, and methods of treating cancer in a mammal. This application is a continuation-in-part of copending U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/094,241, filed Jul. 27, 1998, hereby incorporated by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to substituted oxadiazolines which are useful for treating pathological states which arise from or are exacerbated by cell proliferation, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, and to methods of inhibiting cell proliferation in a mammal. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Neoplastic diseases are characterized by the proliferation of cells which are not subject to normal cell growth and are a major cause of death in humans and other mammals. Cancer chemotherapy has not only provided new and more effective drugs to treat these diseases but has also demonstrated that drugs which disrupt the microtubule system of the cytoskeleton are effective in inhibiting the proliferation of neoplastic cells. The microtubule system of eucaryotic cells is a major component of the cytoskeleton and is a dynamic assembly and disassembly wherein heterodimers of tubulin are polymerized and form microtubule. Microtubules play a key role in the regulation of cell architecture, metabolism, and division and in their dynamic state are critical to normal cell function. With respect to cell division, tubulin is polymerized into microtubules that form the mitotic spindle. The microtubules are then depolymerized when the mitotic spindles use has been fulfilled. Accordingly, agents which disrupt the polymerization or depolymerization of microtubules, and thereby inhibit mitosis, comprise some of the most effective cancer chemotherapeutic agents in clinical use. Thus agents which have the ability to disrupt the microtubule system are useful for cancer treatment. Certain cryptophycin compounds are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,835, 4,845,085, 4,845,086, and 4,868,208; however, compounds having greater metabolic stability and longer duration of action are desired for most therapeutic uses. Thus there is still a need for compounds which inhibit mitosis.

Determination of Biological Activity Compounds of this invention were tested in a 48-hour cellular proliferation assay that uses human colon adenocarcinoma, MDR positive (HCT-15) cells, and human lung large cell carcinoma, MDR negative (NCI-H460) cells, in the 96-well microtitre format described in Skehan P., et al. New Colorimetric Cytotoxicity Assay for Anticancer Drug Screening. 1990, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 82:1107-1112, hereby incorporated by reference. Briefly, the wells of a microtitre plate were charged sequentially with cultured cells and compounds of the invention (1.010 4 to 1.010 11 M in 10% DMSO prepared by dissolving compounds of the invention in DMSO and adding 11 L of the DMSO solution to 100 L of culture medium for a final DMSO concentration of 10%). Two of the following controls were also present in each microtitre plate: a solvent (DMSO) control without drug that yielded a 0% inhibition level and a trichloroacetic acid-treated well that yielded a 100% inhibition level. The cells were grown in culture (37 C., 5% CO 2 atmosphere) for 48 hours then fixed by the addition of trichloroacetic acid. The wells were stained with sulforhodamine, washed with 1% acetic acid, and treated with 0.01 M tris buffer (100 L) to solubilize the adherent dye. The absorbance of the dye solution was measured with a Molecular Devices SpectraMax340 plate reader. Percent inhibition and Inhibitory Concentrations (IC 50 ) values were obtained by calculating the proportional response of the experimental values to the absorbance values of the controls. These data are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

Methods of Treatment The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise compounds of the present invention formulated together with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The pharmaceutical compositions may be specially formulated for oral administration in solid or liquid form, for parenteral injection, or for rectal administration. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally , intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, or as an oral or nasal spray. The term parenteral administration as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion. Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil), and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservative, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like, Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin. In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides) Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-mentioned excipients. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof. Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. Compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the present invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients, and the like. The preferred lipids are the phospholipids and the phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic. Methods to form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example, Prescott, Ed., Methods in Cell Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. (1976), p. 33 et seq. Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound of this invention include powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound is mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required. Opthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Actual dosage levels of active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active compound(s) that is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, compositions, and mode of administration. The selected dosage level will depend upon the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the severity of the condition being treated, and the condition and prior medical history of the patient being treated. However, it is within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required for to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. Generally dosage levels of about 1 to about 50, more preferably of about 5 to about 20 mg of active compound per kilogram of body weight per day are administered orally to a mammalian patient. If desired, the effective daily dose may be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration, e.g. two to four separate doses per day.

The compounds of this invention may be prepared by a variety of synthetic routes. Representative procedures are outlined in Scheme I where R A , R B , R C , R D , R E , and R 2 , are defined previously unless indicated otherwise. Depending on the nature of R A , R B , R C , R D , R E , and R 2 , protection and subsequent deprotection of other reactive groups can be required to successfully complete the described synthetic sequences.

These zinc containing endopeptidases consist of several subsets of enzymes including collagenases, stromelysins and gelatinases. Of these classes, the gelatinases have been shown to be the MMPs most intimately involved with the growth and spread of tumors, while the collagenases have been associated with the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis Howell, D.

Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that gelatinase is involved in plaque rupture associated with atherosclerosis Dollery, C. M.; McEwan, J. R.; Henney, A. M. Circ.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996, 16, 1070.. Other conditions mediated by MMPs are restenosis, MMP-mediated osteopenias, inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, skin aging, tumor growth, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, corneal ulceration, abnormal wound healing, bone disease, proteinuria, aneurysmal aortic disease, degenerative cartilage loss following traumatic joint injury, demyelinating diseases of the nervous system, cirrhosis of the liver, glomerular disease of the kidney, premature rupture of fetal membranes, inflammatory bowel disease, periodontal disease, age related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, ocular inflammation, keratoconus, Sjogrens syndrome, myopia, ocular tumors, ocular angiogenesis/neovascularization and corneal graft rejection. The hypothesis that MMPs are important mediators of the tissue destruction that occurs in arthritis has long been considered, since it was first recognized that these enzymes are capable of degrading collagens and proteoglycans which are the major structural components of cartilage Sapolsky, A. I.; Keiser, H.; Howell, D. S.; Woessner, J. F., Jr.; J. Clin. Invest. 1976, 58, 1030; Pelletier, J.-P.; Martel-Pelletier, J.; Howell, D. S.; Ghandur-Mnaymneh, L.; Enis, J. E.; Woessner, J. F., Jr., Arthritis Rheum. 1983, 26, 63., and continues to develop as new MMPs are identified. For example, collagenase-3 (MMP-13) was cloned from breast cancer cells in 1994, and the first report that it could be involved in arthritis appeared in 1995 Freiji, J. M.; Diez-Itza, I.; Balbin, M.; Sanchez, L. M.; Blasco, R.; Tolivia, J.; Lopez-Otin, C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994, 269, 16766; Flannery, C. R.; Sandy, J. D. 102-17, 41 st Ann. Meet. Orth Res. Soc. Orlando, Fla. Feb. 13-16, 1995.. Evidence is accumulating that implicates MMP-13 in the pathogenesis of arthritis. A major structural component of articular cartilage, type II collagen, is the preferred substrate for MMP-13 and this enzyme is significantly more efficient at cleaving type II collagen than the other collagenases Knauper, V.; Lopez-Otin, C.; Smith, B.; Knight, G.; Murphy, G. J. Biol. Chem., 1996, 271, 1544-1550; Mitchell, P. G.; Magna, H. A.; Reeves, L. M.; Lopresti-Morrow, L. L.; Yocum, S. A.; Rosner, P. J.; Geoghegan, K. F.; Hambor, J. E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996, 97, 761.. MMP-13 is produced by chondrocytes, and elevated levels of MMP-13 has been found in human osteoarthritic tissues Reboul, P.; Pelletier, J-P.; Hambor, J.; Magna, H.; Tardif, G.; Cloutier, J-M.; Martel-Pelletier, J. Arthritis Rheum. 1995, 38 (Suppl. 9), S268; Shlopov, B. V.; Mainardi, C. L.; Hasty, K. A. Arthritis Rheum. 1995, 38 (Suppl. 9), S313; Reboul, P.; Pelletier, J-P.; Tardif, G.; Cloutier, J-M.; Martel-Pelletier, J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996, 97, 2011. Potent inhibitors of MMPs were described over 10 years ago, but the poor bioavailability of these early peptidic, substrate mimetic MMP inhibitors precluded their evaluation in animal models of arthritis. More bioavailable, non-peptidic MMP inhibitors may be preferred for the treatment of diseases mediated by MMPs. TNF- converting enzyme catalyzes the formation of TNF- from membrane bound TNF- precursor protein. TNF- is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is now thought to have a role in rheumatoid arthritis, septic shock, graft rejection, insulin resistance and HIV infection in addition to its well documented antitumor properties. For example, research with anti-TNF- antibodies and transgenic animals has demonstrated that blocking the formation of TNF- inhibits the progression of arthritis Rankin, E. C.; Choy, E. H.; Kassimos, D.; Kingsley, G. H.; Sopwith, A. M.; Isenberg, D. A.; Panayi, G. S. Br. J Rheumatol. 1995, 34, 334; Pharmaprojects, 1996, Therapeutic Updates 17 (October), 197. This observation has recently been extended to humans as well. Other conditions mediated by TNF- are congestive heart failure, cachexia, anorexia, inflammation, fever, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, and inflammatory bowel disease. It is expected that small molecule inhibitors of gelatinase and TACE therefore have the potential for treating a variety of disease states. While a variety of MMP and TACE inhibitors have been identified and disclosed in the literature, the vast majority of these molecules are peptidic or peptide-like compounds that may have bioavailability and pharmacokinetic problems that would limit their clinical effectiveness. Low molecular weight, potent, long-acting, orally bioavailable inhibitors of gelatinases, collagenases and/or TACE are therefore highly desirable for the potential chronic treatment of the above mentioned disease states. Several non-peptidc, sulfur-containing hydroxamic acids have recently been disclosed and are listed below. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,455,258, 5,506,242 and 5,552,419, as well as European patent application EP606,046A1 and WIPO international publications WO96/00214 and WO97/22587 disclose non-peptide matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors of which the compound CGS27023A is representative. The discovery of this type of MMP inhibitor is further detailed by MacPherson, et. al. in J. Med. Chem., (1997),40, 2525. Additional publications disclosing sulfonamide based MMP inhibitors which are variants of the sulfonamide-hydroxamate shown below, or the analogous sulfonamide-carboxylates, are European patent application EP-757984-A1 and WIPO international publications WO95/35275, WO95/35276, WO96/27583, WO97/19068 and WO97/27174. Publications disclosing -sulfonamide-hydroxamate MMP inhibitor analogs of CGS 27023A in which the carbon alpha to the hydroxamic acid has been joined in a ring to the sulfonamide nitrogen, as shown below, include WIPO international publications WO96/33172 and WO97/20824. The German patent application DE19,542,189-A1 discloses additional examples of cylic sulfonamides as MMP inhibitors. In this case the sulfonamide-containing ring is fused to a phenyl ring to form an isoquinoline. Analogs of the sulfonamide-hydroxamate MMP inhibitors in which the sulfonamide nitrogen has been replaced by a carbon atom, as shown in the general structure below, are European patent application EP-780386-A1 and WIPO international publication WO97/24117.

The following scheme (Scheme I) illustrates the reaction sequence employed. In the schemes which follow, the moiety A is defined as the bicyclic heteroaryl moiety of B, as shown immediately below: For purposes of illustration only, wherein the bicyclic heteroaryl group A shown is a quinoline, 4-chloro-7-trifluoromethylquinoline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester, prepared from the corresponding aniline, is reacted with N-benzyl-p-methoxybenzenesulfonamide, wherein Z is p-methoxybenzene, to provide the requisite N,N-disubstituted sulfonamido-ester which is then converted into the corresponding hydroxamic acid in two steps. Alternatively, the 4-chloroquinoline carboxylic acid ester could be first reacted with R 7 NH 2 and the resulting 4-(R 7 -amino)quinoline carboxylic acid ester then reacted with the appropriate ZSO 2 Cl. Hydrolysis of the ester and reaction with hydroxylamine hydro-chloride would then give the invention compound. Functionalization of the quinoline ring via a palladium catalyzed Heck coupling between the iodoquinoline and tributylvinyltin is shown in Scheme II. ,-Unsaturated esters and amides can be coupled to the haloquinoline via Heck reactions. A variety of other trialkyltin reagents are readily available and may be similarly used. Boronic acids, commercially available or readily prepared, may also be coupled to the iodoquinoline using the Suzuki reaction. Functionalization of haloquinolines may also be accomplished via palladium catalyzed couplings of alkynes, as illustrated in Scheme III. Hydrogenation of the alkynes accesses the olefins and alkanes as well. Schemes IV and V illustrate two methods for incorporating amino groups into the substituent attached to the sulfonamide nitrogen of the compounds of the invention. Thus, in Scheme IV the NH-sulfonamide is alkylated with propargyl bromide to provide the propargyl sulfonamide. This alkyne is reacted with paraformaldehyde in the presence of a primary or secondary amine and cuprous chloride to give the propargyl amine which is converted, as before, to the desired hydroxamic acid. In Scheme V, selective hydrolysis of the ester of the p-carboethoxybenzyl sulfonamide group provides a mono-carboxylic acid. This acid may be converted into an amide (not shown), followed by conversion of the second ester, ACO 2 R, into the corresponding hydroxamate, or reduced to the corresponding alcohol with diborane. The alcohol may be converted into the analogous amine via the benzylic bromide, followed by conversion of the the ester, ACO 2 R, into the corresponding hydroxamate. Methods for synthesizing variations of substituents on the sulfonyl aryl group are shown in Schemes VI through VIII. As shown in Scheme VI, biaryl sulfonyl groups are synthesized by Suzuki couplings on a bromo-substituted benzene sulfonamide. The starting bromo-substituted benzene sulfonamide is synthesized from the commercially available bromobenzenesulfonyl chloride and the amino-acid or amino-ester, H 2 NACO 2 R, followed by alkylation of the resulting NH-sulfonamide. Alternatively, the bromo aryl sulfonamide is converted into the corresponding boronic acid by the method of Ishiyama, et.al. J. Org. Chem. (1995), 60, 7508 followed by coupling with an appropriate aryl halide. Methods for synthesizing sulfonyl aryl ethers are shown in Schemes VII through IX. In Scheme VII biaryl ethers, or aryl heteroaryl ethers, are synthesized starting from the known sulfonyl chlorides (see for example: Zook S E; Dagnino, R; Deason, M E, Bender, S L; Melnick, M J WO 97/20824). Alternatively, the biaryl ethers may be prepared from the corresponding boronic acids or via the sulfonyl phenols as shown in Scheme VIII. Aryl ethers may also be prepared via displacement of the fluorine from a para-fluorobenzene sulfonamide, as shown in Scheme IX. Aryl or alkyl ethers may be prepared in this manner. Scheme X illustrates the synthesis of pyrazolopyridines, isoxazolopyridines, and isothiazolopyridines of the invention. Thus, an aminopyrazole, aminoisoxazole or aminoisothiazole is condensed with ethoxymethylene malonate to provide the intermediate, B. This compound is converted into the pyrazolopyridine, isoxazolopyridine, or isothiazolopyridine, C, by heating at 240 C. Compound C is then converted into the chloro-ester, D, via reaction with phosphorus oxychloride. Displacement of the chloro substituent with a sulfonamide then gives compound E. Hydrolysis of the ester and conversion of the carboxylate into the hydroxamate then gives compound G. Salts of the invention compounds can be prepared according to standard procedures. Pyrazolo1,5-bpyrimidines of the invention are prepared according to scheme XI using reactions as described for scheme X. The following specific examples illustrate the preparation of representative compounds of this invention. The starting materials, intermediates, and reagents are either commercially available or can be readily prepared following standard literature procedures by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. EXAMPLE 1 4-Benzyl-(4-methoxy-benzenesulfonyl)-amino-7-trifluoromethylquinoline-3-carboxylic Acid Ethyl Ester To a solution of 1.85 g (6.67 mmol) of N-benzyl 4-methoxyphenylsulphonamide in 15 mL of DMF was added, in one portion, 0.267 g (6.67 mmol) of 60% sodium hydride and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 15 min. Ethyl 4-chloro-7-trifluoromethyl-3-quinolinecarboxylate (2.02 g, 6.67 mmol) was then added to the solution in one portion and the resulting mixture was heated at 85 C. for 24 h. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature, poured into a mixture of water (300 mL) and HCl (1N, aqueous, 100 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (2100 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was then chromatographed on silica gel eluting with 15%-50% ethyl acetate/hexane to give 3.11 g (88%) of the desired product. Electrospray Mass Spec 545.1 (MH).

As described for Example 91, the preceding compound is converted to the title compound. Representative compounds of this invention were evaluated as inhibitors of the enzymes MMP-1, MMP-9, MMP-13 and TNF- converting enzyme (TACE). The standard pharmacological test procedures used, and results obtained which establish this biological profile are shown below. Test Procedures for Measuring MMP-1, MMP-9, and MMP-13 Inhibition These standard pharmacological test procedures are based on the cleavage of a thiopeptide substrates such as Ac-Pro-Leu-Gly(2-mercapto-4-methyl-pentanoyl)-Leu-Gly-OEt by the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1, MMP-13 (collagenases) or MMP-9 (gelatinase), which results in the release of a substrate product that reacts colorimetrically with DTNB (5,5-dithiobis(2-nitro-benzoic acid)). The enzyme activity is measured by the rate of the color increase. The thiopeptide substrate is made up fresh as a 20 mM stock in 100% DMSO and the DTNB is dissolved in 100% DMSO as a 100 mM stock and stored in the dark at room temperature. Both the substrate and DTNB are diluted together to 1 mM with substrate buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM CaCl 2 ) before use. The stock of enzyme is diluted with buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM CaCl 2 , 0.02% Brij) to the desired final concentration. The buffer, enzyme, vehicle or inhibitor, and DTNB/substrate are added in this order to a 96 well plate (total reaction volume of 200 l) and the increase in color is monitored spectrophotometrically for 5 minutes at 405 nm on a plate reader and the increase in color over time is plotted as a linear line. Alternatively, a fluorescent peptide substrate is used. In this test procedure, the peptide substrate contains a fluorescent group and a quenching group. Upon cleavage of the substrate by an MMP, the fluorescence that is generated is quantitated on the fluorescence plate reader. The assay is run in HCBC assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mM Ca 2 , 0.02% Brij, 0.5% Cysteine), with human recombinant MMP-1, MMP-9, or MMP-13. The substrate is dissolved in methanol and stored frozen in 1 mM aliquots. For the assay, substrate and enzymes are diluted in HCBC buffer to the desired concentrations. Compounds are added to the 96 well plate containing enzyme and the reaction is started by the addition of substrate. The reaction is read (excitation 340 nm, emission 444 nm) for 10 min. and the increase in fluorescence over time is plotted as a linear line. For either the thiopeptide or fluorescent peptide test procedures, the slope of the line is calculated and represents the reaction rate. The linearity of the reaction rate is confirmed (r 2 0.85). The mean (xsem) of the control rate is calculated and compared for statistical significance (p0.05) with drug-treated rates using Dunnetts multiple comparison test. Dose-response relationships can be generated using multiple doses of drug and IC 50 values with 95% CI are estimated using linear regression. In vivo MMP Inhibition Test Procedure A 2 cm piece of dialysis tubing (molecular weight cut-off 12-14,000, 10 mm flat width) containing matrix metalloproteinase enzyme (stromelysin, collagenase or gelatinase in 0.5 mL of buffer) is implanted either ip or sc (in the back) of a rat (Sprague-Dawley, 150-200 g) or mouse (CD-1, 25-50 g) under anesthesia. Drugs are administered PO, IP, SC or IV through a canula in the jugular vein. Drugs are administered in a dose volume of 0.1 to 0.25 mL/animal. Contents of the dialysis tubing is collected and enzyme activity assayed. Enzyme reaction rates for each dialysis tube are calculated. Tubes from at least 3 different animals are used to calculate the meansem. Statistical significance (p0.05) of vehicle-treated animals versus drug-treated animals is determined by analysis of variance. ( Agents and Actions 21: 331, 1987). Test Procedure for Measuring TACE Inhibition Using 96-well black microtiter plates, each well receives a solution composed of 10 L TACE (final concentration 1 g/mL), 70 L Tris buffer, pH 7.4 containing 10% glycerol (final concentration 10 mM), and 10 L of test compound solution in DMSO (final concentration 1 M, DMSO concentration 1%) and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. The reaction is initiated by addition of a fluorescent peptidyl substrate (final concentration 100 M) to each well and then shaking on a shaker for 5 sec. The reaction is read (excitation 340 nm, emission 420 nm) for 10 min. and the increase in fluorescence over time is plotted as a linear line. The slope of the line is calculated and represents the reaction rate. The linearity of the reaction rate is confirmed (r 2 0.85). The mean (xsem) of the control rate is calculated and compared for statistical significance (p0.05) with drug-treated rates using Dunnetts multiple comparison test. Dose-response relationships can be generate using multiple doses of drug and IC 50 values with 95% CI are estimated using linear regression.

Suitable solid carriers include, for example, calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine, low melting waxes and ion exchange resins. Liquid carriers may be used in preparing solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups and elixirs. The active ingredient of this invention can be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as water, an organic solvent, a mixture of both or pharmaceutically acceptable oils or fat. The liquid carrier can contain other suitable pharmaceutical additives such a solubilizers, emulsifiers, buffers, preservatives, sweeteners, flavoring agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, colors, viscosity regulators, stabilizers or osmo-regulators. Suitable examples of liquid carriers for oral and parenteral administration include water (particularly containing additives as above, e.g., cellulose derivatives, preferable sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols, e.g., glycols) and their derivatives, and oils (e.g., fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil). For parenteral administration the carrier can also be an oily ester such as ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate. Sterile liquid carriers are used in sterile liquid form compositions for parenteral administration. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions which are sterile solutions or suspensions can be utilized by, for example, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection. Sterile solutions can also be administered intravenously. Oral administration may be either liquid or solid composition form. The compounds of this invention may be administered rectally in the form of a conventional suppository. For administration by intranasal or intrabronchial inhalation or insufflation, the compounds of this invention may be formulated into an aqueous or partially aqueous solution, which can then be utilized in the form of an aerosol. The compounds of this invention may also be administered transdermally through the use of a transdermal patch containing the active compound and a carrier that is inert to the active compound, is non-toxic to the skin, and allows delivery of the agent for systemic absorption into the blood stream via the skin. The carrier may take any number of forms such as creams and ointments, pastes, gels, and occlusive devices. The creams and ointments may be viscous liquid or semi-solid emulsions of either the oil in water or water in oil type. Pastes comprised of absorptive powders dispersed in petroleum or hydrophilic petroleum containing the active ingredient may also be suitable. A variety of occlusive devices may be used to release the active ingredient into the blood stream such as a semipermeable membrane covering a reservoir containing the active ingredient with or without a carrier, or a matrix containing the active ingredient. Other occlusive devices are known in the literature. The dosage to be used in the treatment of a specific patient suffering a MMP or TACE dependent condition must be subjectively determined by the attending physician. The variables involved include the severity of the dysfunction, and the size, age, and response pattern of the patient. Treatment will generally be initiated with small dosages less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter the dosage is increased until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. Precise dosages for oral, parenteral, nasal, or intrabronchial administration will be determined by the administering physician based on experience with the individual subject treated and standard medical principles. Projected oral daily dosages are 2-500 mg/kg, preferred oral daily dosages are 2-50 mg/kg, and more preferred oral daily dosages are 5-25 mg/kg. Preferably the pharmaceutical composition is in unit dosage form, e.g., as tablets or capsules. In such form, the composition is sub-divided in unit dose containing appropriate quantities of the active ingredient; the unit dosage form can be packaged compositions, for example packed powders, vials, ampoules, prefilled syringes or sachets containing liquids. The unit dosage form can be, for example, a capsule or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any such compositions in package form. What is claimed: 1.

alkoxymethyl-oxazolidinone compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are disclosed. The synthesis of these compounds and their use as alpha 1a adrenergic receptor antagonists is also described. One application of these compounds is in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. These compounds are selective in their ability to relax smooth muscle tissue enriched in the alpha 1a receptor subtype without at the same time inducing hypotension. One such tissue is found surrounding the urethral lining. Therefore, one utility of the instant compounds is to provide acute relief to males suffering from benign prostatic hyperplasia, by permitting less hindered urine flow. Another utility of the instant compounds is provided by combination with a human 5-alpha reductase inhibitory compound, such that both acute and chronic relief from the effects of benign prostatic hyperplasia can be achieved.", "related_docs": [], "pct_data": [{"country": null, "doc_number": "60/107838", "kind": "00", "date": "19981110"}], "external_files": [{"file":

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for angiotensin II-mediated diseases, which comprises a compound having angiotensin II antagonistic activity or a salt thereof in combination with a compound having diuretic activity or a compound having calcium antagonistic activity, and to a method of its use. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Diuretic drugs, due to their having mild hypotensive effects, have long been clinically used as antihypertensive agents. However, as undesirable side effects caused by the use for a long time, influences on metabolism, for example, hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperlipemia and diabetes melitus, have been taken up. While calcium antagonists have been used as therapeutic agents of circulatory diseases such as hypertension, cardiac diseases, cerebral apoplexy, nephritis and arteriosclerosis, it has also been known that they tend to cause such undesirable side effects as tachycardia, hypotension, erythroprosopalgia and encephalagia, which are considered to be due to their abrupt vasodilative action. On the other hand, it is disclosed in EP-0425921, EP-0459136 and EP-0520423 that benzimidazole derivatives have an angiotensin II antagonistic activities and are useful for the therapy of circulatory diseases including hypertension, cardiac diseases (cardiac insufficiency, myocardial infarction, etc.), cerebral apoplexy, nephritis and arteriosclerosis. The mechanism of the action is considered that the benzimidazole derivatives inhibit the binding of angiotensin II having a strong vasoconstrictive action to an angiotensin II acceptor. And, while, in JPA H3(1991)-27362 and JPA H5(1993)-132467, it is disclosed that an imidazole derivative having angiotensin II antagonistic action is administered together with a diuretic agent or a calcium antagonistic agent. OBJECT OF THE INVENTION The invention is intended, by combination of a compound having angiotensin II antagonistic action or a salt thereof with a compound having diuretic action or a compound having calcium antagonistic activity, to perform especially remarkable effects, to reduce undesirable side effects and to cover up defects observed in administration of a medicine consisting of a single component. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Circumstances being such as above, the present inventors have made extensive and intensive studies on the effects of co-use of a benzimidazole derivative having angiotensin antagonistic activity with a compound having diuretic activity or a compound having calcium antagonistic activity, and, as a result, they have found that the co-use performs especially remarkable effects which were not observed in the administration of the respective compounds singly, thus accomplishing the present invention.

In the case of formulating the effective components individually, while thus individually formulated agents can be administered in the form of their mixture prepared by using, for example, a diluent when administered, the individually formulated agents can also be administered separately or simultaneously or with time intervals to the one and same subject. The pharmaceutical composition for angiotensin II-mediated diseases of the present invention can be formulated in accordance with conventional procedures. In the present specification, non-orally include subcutaneous injection, intravenous injection, intramuscular injections, intraperitoneal injection or instillation. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous suspensions or oil suspensions can be prepared by known procedure in the fields concerned, using a suitable dispersant or wetting agent and suspending agent. The sterile injections may be in the state of, for example, a solution or a suspension, which is prepared with a non-toxic diluent administrable non-orally, e.g. an aqueous solution, or with a solvent employable for sterile injection. Examples of usable vehicles or acceptable solvents include water, Ringers solution and an isotonic aqueous saline solution. Further, a sterile non-volatile oil can usually be employed as solvent or suspending agent. Any non-volatile oil and a fatty acid can be used for this purpose, which includes natural or synthetic or semi-synthetic fatty acid oil or fatty acid, and natural or synthetic or semi-synthetic mono- or di- or tri-glycerides. Rectal suppositories can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritable vehicle, for example, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycol, which is in the solid state at ordinary temperatures, in the liquid state at temperatures in intestinal tubes and melts in rectum to release the drug. As a solid formulation for oral administration, mention is made of powders, granules, tablets, pills and capsules as referred to in the above. In such formulations as exemplified above, the active component compounds can be mixed with at least one additive, for example, sucrose, lactose, cellulose sugar, mannitol, maltitol, dextran, starch, agar, alginates, chitins, chitosans, pectins, tragacanth gum, gum arabic, gelatins, collagens, casein, albumin, synthetic or semi-synthetic polymers or glycerides. These formulations can contain, as in conventional cases, further additives, for example, an inactive diluent, a lubricant such as magnesium stearate, a preservative such as paraben or sorbic acid, an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid, -tocopherol or cysteine, a disintegrator, a binder, a thickening agent, a buffer, a sweetener, a flavoring agent and a perfuming agent. Tablets and pills can further be prepared with enteric coating. Examples of liquid preparations for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, syrups, elixirs, suspensions and solutions, which may contain an inactive diluent, for example, water, which is conventionally employed in the field concerned. The pharmaceutical composition of this invention against angiotensin II-mediated diseases are less toxic, which is used as a medicine for animals, especially mammals (e.g. human being, dog, rabbit, mouse, etc.), can be advantageously used for angiotensin II-mediated diseases. The pharmaceutical composition of this invention for angiotensin II-mediated diseases formulated by combining a compound having angiotensin II antagonistic activity or a salt thereof with a compound having diuretic activity or a compound having calcium antagonistic activity. This composition serves to decrease the dosages of the individual effective components, and, as a result, suppresses undesirable side effects observed in the case of administering the respective compounds singly. Also, by incorporation of polymers of alkylene oxide into a formulation comprising a compound having angiotensin II antagonistic activity represented by the formula (I), or a salt thereof and a compound having diuretic activity or a compound having calcium antagonistic activity, decomposition of the active components is remarkably suppressed to afford a stable composition. The above polymers of alkylene oxide may be evenly admixed with the active components in preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for oral use so that more stable compositions are produced. Furthermore, among the polymers of alkylene oxide, any one may be soluble or insoluble in water. As the polymer of alkylene oxide, use is made of those having a molecular weight of 1,000 to 10,000 (e.g. polyethylene glycol 6000). Examples of the alkylene oxide include ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, trimethylene oxide and tetrahydrofuran (preferably ethylene oxide). The polymers of alkylene oxide may be used singly or as a mixture of two or more of them. The polymers are added to the active components in a solid or liquid state. The method for preparing a pharmaceutical composition using polymers of alkylene oxide is more conveniently applied to a solid composition (e.g., granules and tablets, preferably tablets) prepared by molding (e.g. granulation or molding under elevated pressure). Preparation of a solid composition is usually conducted by incorporating polymers of alkylene oxide into the active components, followed by subjecting the mixture to molding. The incorporation is conducted by a method conventionally employed in the field of pharmaceutical preparations, for example, mixing, massing, kneading, sieving and stirring. For example, polymers of alkylene oxide are directly added to the active components and to make a mixture (addition in powdery state), or a solvent is added to the mixture, followed by conventional granulating and drying. Alternatively, polymers of alkylene oxide are dissolved in a suitable solvent, then the solution is mixed with the active components, followed by conventional kneading, granulating and drying (addition in liquid state). Further, a liquid material containing polymers of alkylene oxide and a liquid material containing the active components can be independently sprayed onto a powdery material such as an excipient, followed by mixing the resultant material. In the case of addition in liquid state, any solvent which does not exert undesirable influence on the active component, for example, water, dimethylformamide, acetone, ethanol, propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, methylene chloride and trichloroethane, can be employed. After completing the blending, the material is subjected to a conventional molding process under elevated pressure to prepare tablets containing the active components. The molding under elevated pressure means that a material is compressed under elevated pressure into a desired form, and it refers to, most generally, tabletting. Incorporation or polymers of alkylene oxide as described above serves to minimize crystalline disorder possibly caused in the steps of kneading, granulating and molding under elevated pressure and is considered to further serve advantageously to improve the moldability and to lower the pressure to be elevated. In the method of preparing the composition, a variety of additives to be employed for solid compositions can be added in an adequate step. These additives are exemplified by excipients such as crystalline cellulose (e.g. Avicel PH 101 (manufactured by Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, corn starch, wheat starch, lactose, sucrose, glucose, calcium sulfate, calcium phosphate or sodium chloride, binders such as gum arabic, gelatin, methyl cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose (hereinafter sometimes abbreviated as HPC) or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, lubricants such as magnesium stearate, talc, synthetic aluminum silicate, sodium lauryl sulfate, boric acid, magnesium oxide or paraffin, colorants, flavoring agents, odor-improving agents, etc. Furthermore, the composition may be prepared into coated tablets as well. The coating process may be accomplished by a known method. Use is made of conventional coating agents (e.g., hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, methyl cellulose and polyvinyl pyrrolidone). Polyethylene glycol 6000, polysorbate, titanium oxide and pigments such as red iron oxide are used as auxiliary agents for coatings. In the stabilized pharmaceutical composition for oral use prepared by admixing polymers of alkylene oxide with the active components, the amount of the polymers is 0.005 to 0.15 weight, preferably 0.01 to 0.1 weight, preferably 0.02 to 0.05 weight per 1 weight of the composition. The dose of a specific patient is dependent on the age, body weight, general health conditions, sex, diet, dose interval, administration routes, excretion rate, combinations of drugs and conditions of the diseases treated, while taking these and other necessary factors into consideration. Typical daily doses of the compositions having various combinations of a compound represented by the formula (I) or a salt thereof and a compound having diuretic activity or a compound having calcium antagonistic activity are within the range of from about 1/50 of the minimal recommendable clinical dose to maximal recommendable dose in the case of practical administration of these compounds individually. For example, a compound represented by the formula (I) having an angiotensin II antagonistic activity to be administered at a dose of about 0.01 to 150 mg/patient/day can be administered at a dose of about 0.0002 to 150 mg/patient/day, preferably 0.001 to 60 mg/patient/day, more preferably 0.01 to 20 mg/patient/day by combining with the following daily doses of the following compounds: trichloromethiazide (1 to 8 mg), cyclopenthiazide (0.25 to 1 mg), cyclothiazide (1 to 2 mg), chlorothiazide (500 to 1000 mg), bendroflumethiazide (2 to 10 mg), hydrochlorothiazide (5 to 200 mg), methyclothiazide (2.5 to 5 mg), benzylhydrochlorothiazide (4 to 16 mg), penfluthiazide (1.5 to 7.5 mg), ethiazide (2.5 to 10 mg), hydroflumethiazide (10 to 200 mg), polythiazide (0.25 to 4 mg), meticrane (150 to 300 mg), chlorothalidone (50 to 200 mg), tripamide (15 to 30 mg), methrazone (2.5 to 5 mg), indapamide (0.5 to 2 mg), quinethazone (25 to 150 mg), clofenamide (50 to 400 mg), furosemide (20 to 500 mg), bumetanide (0.5 to 2 mg), mefruside (1.25 to 50 mg), diltiazem hydrochloride (10 to 200 mg), nicardipine hydrochloride (3 to 40 mg), valnidipine hydrochloride (2 to 15 mg), flunarizine hydrochloride (2 to 10 mg), verapamil hydrochloride (2 to 80 mg), manidipine hydrochloride (2 to 20 mg), cinnarizine (10 to 50 mg), nisoldipine (2 to 10 mg), nitrendipine (2 to 10 mg), nifedipine (3 to 40 mg), nilvadipine (1 to 8 mg), or benidipine (2 to 8 mg). Needless to say, while these dosage ranges can be adjusted by a necessary unit base for dividing a daily dose, as described above, such doses are decided depending on the diseases to be treated, conditions of such diseases, the age, body weight, general health conditions, sex, diet of the patient then treated, dose intervals, administration routes, excretion rate, and combinations of drugs, while taking these and other necessary factors into consideration. The desired unit dose of the composition of this invention is administered once or twice daily (preferably once). For example, the unit dose composition contains about 0.0002 to 150 mg, preferably 0.001 to 60 mg, more preferably 0.01 to 20 mg of a compound represented by the formula (I) by combining with the following amount of the following compound: trichloromethiazide (1 to 8 mg), cyclopenthiazide (0.25 to 1 mg), cyclothiazide (1 to 2 mg), chlorothiazide (500 to 1000 mg), bendroflumethiazide (2 to 10 mg), hydrochlorothiazide (5 to 200 mg), methyclothiazide (2.5 to 5 mg), benzylhydrochlorothiazide (4 to 16 mg), penfluthiazide (1.5 to 7.5 mg), ethiazide (2.5 to 10 mg), hydroflumethiazide (10 to 200 mg), polythiazide (0.25 to 4 mg), meticrane (150 to 300 mg), chlorothalidone (50 to 200 mg), tripamide (15 to 30 mg), methrazone (2.5 to 5 mg), indapamide (0.5 to 2 mg), quinethazone (25 to 150 mg), clofenamide (50 to 400 mg), furosemide (20 to 500 mg), bumetanide (0.5 to 2 mg), mefruside (1.25 to 50 mg), diltiazem hydrochloride (10 to 200 mg), nicardipine hydrochloride (3 to 40 mg), valnidipine hydrochloride (2 to 15 mg), flunarizine hydrochloride (2 to 10 mg), verapamil hydrochloride (2 to 80 mg), manidipine hydrochloride (2 to 20 mg), cinnarizine (10 to 50 mg), nisoldipine (2 to 10 mg), nitrendipine (2 to 10 mg), nifedipine (3 to 40 mg.), nilvadipine (1 to 8 mg), or benidipine (2 to 8 mg). The composition of this invention as described above is advantageously carried out in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. The amount of hydrochlorothiazide present in a dosage unit is from about 5 mg to 200 mg, preferably 5 mg to 100 mg, more preferably 5 to 50 mg. By the following test examples and working examples, the present invention will be illustrated in more detail, and they should not be construed as limiting the invention thereto. The physiological activities of the composition comprising a compound having angiotensin II antagonistic activity or a salt thereof and a compound having diuretic activity or a compound having calcium antagonistic activity are described by the following test examples. TEST EXAMPLE 1 Antihypertensive Activity in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR) By The Co-administration With A Diuretic Drug Compound 1: ()-1-(cyclohexyloxycarbonyloxy)ethyl 2-ethoxy-1-2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzimidazole-7-carboxylate HCT: hydrochlorothiazide Method: Male SHR of 20 week old were divided into 6 groups (five animals in one group). The respective groups were administered orally with the compound 1 (0.1 or 1 mg/kg, p.o.) or HCT (10 mg/kg, p.o.) alone or both drugs simultaneously once a day for two weeks. On the first, 7th and 14th day at 5 hr after the administration, blood pressure of each test animal was measured by the tail cuff method under unanesthesia. Results: As shown in Table 1. Single dose of HCT (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.) did not show antihypertensive action. The compound 1 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day) showed dose dependent antihypertensive action. Efficiency of the antihypertensive activity of the compound 1 was enhanced by its co-administration with HCT. The antihypertensive activity observed by the combination of the compound 1 (0.1 mg/kg) and HCT was stronger or substantially the same as that observed by administering the compound 1 alone (1 mg/kg). This result shows that the combination of both drugs can decrease the dosages of the respective drugs.

The respective groups were administered orally with the compound 1 (0.1 or 1 mg/kg, p.o.) or MDP (3 mg/kg, p.o.) alone or with a mixture of them once a day for two weeks. On the first, 7th and 14th day at 5 hr after the administration, blood pressure of each test animal was measured by the tail cuff method under unanesthesia. Results: As shown in Table 2. Single administration of MDP (3 mg/kg/day, p.o.) showed apparent antihypertensive effect, and the compound 1 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day) performed dose dependent antihypertensive effect. The antihypertensive activity of the compound 1 was enhanced by the co-administration with MDP (3 mg/kg/day). The hypotensive activity observed by the co-administration of the compound 1 (0.1 mg/kg) with MDP was stronger or substantially the same as that observed by administering the compound 1 alone (1 mg/kg). This result shows that simultaneous usage of both drugs can decrease in the dosages of the respective drugs.

Single dose of HCT (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.) did not show antihypertensive action. The compound 2 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg/day) showed dose dependent antihypertensive action. Efficiency of the antihypertensive activity of the compound 2 was enhanced by its co-administration with HCT. The antihypertensive activity observed by the combination of the compound 2 (0.1 mg/kg) and HCT was stronger or substantially the same as that observed by administering the compound 2 alone (1 mg/kg). This result shows that the co-use of both drugs can decrease the dosages of the respective drugs.

As a result, suppression of the occurrence of undesirable side effects observed when these drugs are administered singly can be expected to a considerable extent.

A compound of formula I in which one of X and Y signifies O and the other signifies S, is prepared by reacting a compound of formula I in which X and Y both signify O with a sulphurizing agent. Conventional procedures can be used in carrying out the sulfurization, including the protection of substituents prior to sulfurization and deprotection after sulfurization, which would be known to those skilled in the art. The sulfurization is conveniently carried out using phosphorous pentasulfide, Lawessons reagent 2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,2-dithioxo-1,3,2,4-dithiaphosphetane: Bull. Soc. Chim. Belg. 87 (1978) 229-238 or Davy reagent 2,4-bis(methylthio)-1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane; Sulfur Lett. 1983, 1, 167. This reaction is expediently carried out in an inert organic solvent such as an aliphatic or cyclic ether (for example, dimethoxyethane) or an aromatic hydrocarbon which may be halogenated (for example, benzene, toluene or chlorobenzene) and at an elevated temperature, especially at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. A compound of formula I in which one of X and Y signifies O and the other signifies (H,OH), is prepared by reducing a compound of formula I in which X and Y both signify O with a complex metal hydride. The reduction can be carried out in a known manner including the protection of substituents on the indole ring prior to reduction and deprotection after reduction according to known methods. An alkali metal aluminum hydride such as lithium aluminum hydride is preferably used as the complex metal hydride, although other hydrides such as diisobutylaluminum hydride and sodium dihydro-bis(2-methoxy-ethoxy)aluminate can also be used. Suitable inert organic solvents in which this reduction can be carried out include aliphatic and cyclic ethers such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran (THF) and hydrocarbons such as hexane, benzene and toluene. Conveniently, this reduction is carried out at about room temperature. A compound of formula I in which one of X and Y signifies O and the other signifies (H,H), can be prepared by catalytically hydrogenating a compound of formula I in which one of X and Y signifies O and the other signifies (H,OH). Conventional procedures can be used in carrying out the catalytic hydrogenation including the protection and deprotection of substituents on the indole ring according to known procedures. Thus, the catalytic hydrogenation can be carried out in the presence of a noble metal catalyst such as a palladium or platinum catalyst, for example, palladium/carbon (Pd/C), and an inert organic solvent such as an alkanol (for example, methanol or ethanol). This catalytic hydrogenation is expediently carried out at about room temperature and under atmospheric pressure. If desired, an acidic compound of formula I can be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt with a base or a basic compound of formula I can be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt with an acid. The conversion of an acidic compound of formula I into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can be carried out by treatment with a suitable base in a known manner. Suitable salts are those derived not only from inorganic bases, for example, sodium, potassium or calcium salts, but also from organic bases such as ethylenediamine, monoethanolamine or diethanolamine. The conversion of a basic compound of formula I into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can be carried out by treatment with a suitable acid in a known manner. Suitable salts are those derived not only from inorganic acids, for example, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates or sulphates, but also from organic acids, for example, acetates, citrates, fumarates, tartrates, maleates, methanesulphonates or p-toluenesulphonates. The pyrroles of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts inhibit cellular processes, for example cell proliferation, and can be used in the treatment or control of inflammatory disorders such as arthritis, immune diseases, in conjunction with organ transplants and in oncology. The epithelial breast carcinoma cell line (MDAMB-435) was purchased from ATCC (American Type Cell Culture Collection) and was grown in culture in medium as recommended by ATCC. For analysis of the effect of various compounds on growth of these cells, the cells were plated at a concentration of 1500 cells/well in a 96 well tissue culture plate (test plate). The day after the cells were plated, the compounds to be analyzed were dissolved in 100% DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) to yield at 10 mM stock solution. Each compound was diluted in H 2 O to 1 mM and was added to triplicate wells in the first row of a 96 well master plate which contains medium to yield a final concentration of 40 M. The compounds were then serially diluted in medium in the master plate. The diluted compound(s) were then transferred to test plates containing cells. A row of vehicle control cells received DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO in each well was 0.1%. 5 days post drug addition, the plate was analyzed as follows: MTT (3-(4-5 methyl thiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; thiazolyl blue) was added to each well to yield a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The plate was then incubated at 37 C. for 2-3 hours. The MTT containing medium was then removed and 50 l of 100% ethanol was added to each well to dissolve the formazan. The absorbences were then read using an automated plate reader (Bio-tek microplate reader). IC 50 s were calculated using the Reed and Munsch equation, see Am. J. Hygiene Vol. 27 pgs. 493-497, 1938.

They can also be administered rectally, for example, in the form of suppositories or parenterally, for example, in the form of injection solutions. For the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations these compounds can be formulated with therapeutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers. Lactose, maize starch or derivatives thereof, talc, steric acid or its salts can be used as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatin capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatin capsules are vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid or liquid polyols. Depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, generally required in the case of soft gelatin capsules. Suitable carriers for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are, water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar and glucose. Suitable carriers for injection solutions are water, alcohols, polyols, glycerine and vegetable oils. Suitable carriers for suppositories are natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid polyols. The pharmaceutical preparations can also contain preserving agents, solubilizing agents, stabilizing agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, sweetening agents, coloring agents, flavoring agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, coating agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances. As mentioned above, the pyrroles of formula I and their aforementioned salts can be used in the treatment or control of oncological, inflammatory, immunological, bronchopulmonary and cardiovascular disorders. The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, or course, be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral or parenteral administration to adult humans, a daily dosage of about 5mg to 5000 mg should be appropriate, although the upper limit may be exceeded when this is found to be expedient. The daily dosage can be administered as a single dose or in divided doses, or for parenteral administration, it may be given as continuous infusion. The following Examples illustrate the present invention: EXAMPLE 1 3-(6-methoxy-1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-4-(1-methyl-6-nitro-1H-indol-3-yl)-pyrrole-2,5-dione a) A solution of known 6-nitro-1H-indole (5 g, 31 mm) in dimethylformamide (DMF) (50 mL) was cooled to 0 C. and treated with NaH (1 g, 37m). After stirring at 0 C. for two hours, CH 3 I (2.3 mL, 37 mm) was added, and the reaction was stirred overnight while allowing to warm to room temperature. After pouring into H 2 O (500 mL), the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (200 mL4). The combined organic fractions were dried over MgSO 4 , filtered and evaporated. Purification by flash column chromatography afforded the 1-methyl-6-nitro-1H-indole (5.34 g, 97%). b) A stirred solution of 1-methyl-6-nitro-1H-indole in diethyl ether (Et 2 O) (5 mL) was cooled to 0 C., and treated with oxalyl chloride (0.15 mL, 1.7 mm). After stirring at room temperature overnight, solids were collected, washed with ether and dried to afford (255 mg, 96%) (1-methyl-6-nitro-1H-indol-3-yl)-oxo-acetyl chloride. c) A mixture of DMF (7 mL, 90 mm) and POCl 3 (2.25 mL, 24.5 mmol) which had been cooled to 5 C., was treated with known 6-methoxy-1H-indole. After stirring at room temperature for 1 hour, the mixture was heated at 45 C. for 1 hour, then allowed to cool to room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was poured into ice (100 mL), and stirred for 30 minutes at which time a solution of KOH (9.6 g, 171 mm) in H 2 O (20 mL) was added dropwise. After stirring for 30 minutes, then heating for 1 hour at 60 C., the reaction was cooled to 30 C., and the pH adjusted to 7 with 1N HCl. The mixture was extracted with EtOAc(50 mL3), the organic fractions were combined, dried over MgSO 4 , filtered and evaporated. The residue was purified by crystallization from methanol to afford 6-methoxy-1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde (1.65 g, 69%). d) A solution of 6-methoxy-1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde (1.65, 9.4 mm) in DMF (10 mL) was cooled to 0 C., and treated with NaH(11.3 mm). After stirring at room temperature for 1 hour, the mixture was cooled to 0 C., treated with CH 3 I (0.7 mL, 11.3 mm), then allowed to warm to room temperature overnight. After pouring into H 2 O (200 mL), the mixture was acidified with HCl and extracted with EtOAc (100 mL2). The combined organic fractions were dried over MgSO 4 , filtered and evaporated to afford 6-methoxy-1-methyl-1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde (1.78 g, 99%). e) To a cooled (30 C.) suspension of potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu) (1.62 g, 14.4 mm) in dimethoxyethane (DME; 25 mL) was added a solution oftoluene-4-sulfonylmethyl isocyanide TosMIC (1.45 g, 7.4 mmol) in DME (15 mL). After cooling the mixture further to 60 C., a solution of 6-methoxy-1-methyl-1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde (800 mg, 4.23 mm) was slowly added, and the reaction mixture stirred for 1.5 hours. After treatment with methanol (11 mL), the mixture was heated to reflux temperature for 15 minutes, then the solvent evaporated. The residue was treated with H 2 O (15 mL) which contained acetic acid (HOAc) (55 mL), then extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 (50 mL3). The combined organic layers were washed with saturated NaHCO 3 solution (50 mL), dried over MgSO 4 , filtered and evaporated. Purification by flash column chromatography afforded (6-methoxy-1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)acetonitrile (0.6 g, 70%). f) HCl gas was bubbled into a suspension of (6-methoxy-1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)acetonitrile in isopropanol (25 mL) which was cooled to 0 C. After 3 hours, the solvent was evaporated and the residue evaporated from diethyl ether (Et 2 O) (50 mL2). The tan residue was further dried under high vacuum to afford 2-(6-methoxy-1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-acetimidic acid isopropyl ester hydrochloride (1.6 g, 82%). g) A suspension of (1-methyl-6-nitro-1H-indol-3-yl)-oxo-acetyl chloride (251 mg, 0.94 mm) and 2-(6-methoxy-1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-acetimidic acid isopropyl ester hydrochloride (280 mg, 0.94 mm) in CH 2 Cl 2 (25 mL) was cooled to 0 C., treated with Et 3 N (0.53 mL, 3.7 mm), and stirred at room temperature while allowing to warm to room temperature overnight. The mixture was then diluted with CH 2 Cl 2 (25 mL), washed with H 2 O (20 mL), and 0.5 N HCl (20 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO 4 , filtered and evaporated. The residue was then combined with toluene (4 mL), cooled to 0 C., treated with pTsOH (197 mg, 1 mm), and stirred for 3 hours. The red solids which precipitated were collected and partitioned between CH 2 Cl 2 (50 mL), and H 2 O (25 mL). The organic fraction was washed with saturated NaHCO 3 solution (25 mL), then dried over MgSO 4 , filtered and evaporated. Rinsing the residue with tetrahydrofuran (THF) afforded 3-(6-methoxy-1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-4-(1-methyl-6-nitro-1H-indol-3yl)-pyrrole-2,5-dione; mp308-310 C.; in 31% yield.

Field of the Invention This invention relates to the use of certain 1-aryl-3-(4-alkyl-1-piperizinyl)-; 1-aryl-3-(4-morpholinyl)-; and 1-aryl-3-(4-thiomorpholinyl)-1-propanones in the treatment of Alzheimers Disease. 2. Description of the Related Art Alzheimers Disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting 7% of the population over 65 years of age and characterized clinically by progressive loss of intellectual function. This impairment of function is caused by the presence of neuritic plaques in the neocortex and the loss of presynaptic markers of cholinergic neurons. Neuritic plaques are composed of degenerating axons and nerve terminals, often surrounding an amyloid core and usually containing reactive glial elements. Another characteristic pathologic feature of Alzheimers Disease is the neurofibrillary tangle, which is an intraneuronal mass which corresponds to an accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein polymerized into fibrillar structures termed paired helical filaments. In addition, the neurofibrillary tangle also contains highly phosphorylated neurofilament proteins. Even the earliest papers on Alzheimers Disease were clear that both senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles had to be present in abundance to allow a post-mortem diagnosis of the disease. Before any understanding of the molecular nature of these structures was obtained, efforts were being made to understand the relationship between the numbers of these lesions and the progression or severity of the dementia experienced by the patient. The limitations of silver staining were such that early workers in this field were unable to appreciate the complexity of these abnormal structures (Ball, M J, Neurobiol. of Aging, 8: 564-565, 1987). Although early attempts to correlate pathologic lesion counts with clinical symptoms generally yielded poor results, it was clear that the incidence of large numbers of both type lesions were invariably associated with dementia (Perry et al, J. Neural Transmission, 24: 131-136, 1987; Alafuzoff, I., Acta Neuropath, 74: 209-225, 1987; Whitehouse et al, Prog. Clin. Biol. Res., 317: 131-142. 1989; Tomlinson, Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol, 15: 491-512, 1989). More recent work has allowed a clearer definition of the nature of the lesions stained by silver salts. Senile plaques are actually two distinct types of structures, the classical plaques described by Alzheimer being composed of degenerating neuronal elements (neurites) surrounding a central core of amyloid, while the other so-called diffuse or primitive plaque is usually a deposit of amyloid without a halo of degenerating neurites (Tagliavini, , et al, Neurosci. Lett., 93, 191-196, 1988; Dickson, D W, et al, Am. J. Path., 132, 86-101, 1988). These structures are difficult to distinguish from each other with silver stains or with the widely used fluorescent dye, thioflavin S. Early attempts, using silver staining, at correlations between plaque number and extent of dementia, as well as some more recent studies using thioflavin S, were flawed by this inability to define what type of plaque was being counted Hansen, L A, et al, Neurology, 38, 48-54, 1988; Katzman, R, et al, Ann. Neurol., 23, 138-144, 1988). This becomes very obvious in recent studies, which have consistently reported that amyloid plaques can be found in large numbers in the brains of the majority of the very elderly (over 80 years), and are only rarely associated with dementia when present without evidence of degenerating neurites (Davies, L, et al, Neurology, 38, 1688-1693, 1988; Delaere, P, et al, Neurosci. Lett., 116, 87-93, 1990; Dickson, D W, et al, Neurobiol. Aging, 13, 179-189, 1991). The counting of neurofibrillary tangles also fails to give an accurate picture of the extent of neurofibrillary degeneration. Again, the presence of large numbers of tangles is invariably associated with a profound dementia, and some index of disease severity can be gained from tangle counts (Tomlinson, B E, Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol., 15, 491-512, 1989; Delaere, P, et al, Acta Neuropath., 77, 645-653, 1989). Electron microscopy first revealed that tangles were composed of masses of paired helical filaments (PHF) filling the cytoplasm of neurons (Terry, R D, et al, pages 145-155, In CIBA Foundation Symposium on Alzheimers Disease and Related Conditions. Ed. by Wolstenholme, G E W, OConner, M, J and A Churchill, London, 1970). These studies also clearly showed that degenerating neurites also contained PHF, a fact only widely appreciated much later, when the use of antibodies to PHF became common (Wolozin, B L. et al, Science, 232, 648-650, 1986). Thus, both the plaques and the tangles of Alzheimers Disease contain PHF. The use of antibodies to PHF also revealed the widespread presence of these paired helical filaments in neuronal processes (Brun, A, Prog. Clin. Biol. Res., 317, 285-293, 1989). Thus, the presence of PHF is much more widespread than was first suspected, and is today considered to be an indication of a widespread neuronal disease, of which the neuritic plaque and the neurofibrillary tangle are only the most obvious signs (McKee, A C, et al, Ann. Neurol., 30, 156-165, 1991). It has been estimated that as much as 90% of the PHF in the cortex of the average Alzheimer case is present in neuronal processes rather than in the plaque or tangle (Wolozin, B L, Ann. Neurol., 22, 521-526, 1987). Much of the early and indeed the present confusion with regard to diagnosis and severity of Alzheimers Disease comes from the failure to appreciate the complexity of the pathology in this disease, although the occurrence of significant amounts of PHF in the brain is always associated with severe dementia (Hyman, B T, Current Opinions in Neurology and Neurosurgery, 5, 88-93, 1992). These results suggest that good correlations can be obtained between the concentration of PHF proteins (sometimes referred to as Alzheimers Disease Associated Proteins or ADAP) in the cerebral cortex and the degree of dementia measured prior to the death of the patient (Ghanbari, H A, et al, JAMA, 263, 2907-2910, 1990). It is noted that the terminology used to describe the abnormal protein complexes composing the fibrillar pathology in Alzheimers Disease can be confusing. PHF is a morphological designation, describing abnormal filaments found in neurofibrillary tangles. An abnormal protein species migrating at 68 kDa, electrophoretically, and observed on immunoblots of tissue from AD brains was termed A68 (Wolozin, B, et al, Science, 232, 648-650, 1986). A protein complex shown to be specific for AD by immunochemical analyses was designated Alzheimers Disease Associated Protein or by the acronym, ADAP (Ghanbari, H A, et al, JAMA, 263, 2907-2910, 1990). It is now known that A68 and ADAP, when viewed by the electron microscope, are PHFs. These PHFs have been further shown to contain, primarily, the microtubule-associated protein, tau. Hence, the terms A68. ADAP, PHF and PHF-tau are often used interchangeably. Thus, they are meant to be interchangable herein. A series of important studies have suggested that the progression of Alzheimers Disease can be defined pathologically by careful neuroanatomic studies of large numbers of brains from elderly humans, (Braak, H, et al, Neurosci. Lett., 103, 24-28, 1989; Braak, H, et al, Neuropath. and Applied Neurobiol., 15, 13-26, 1989; Braak, H, et al, Acta Neuropath., 82, 239-259, 1991; Braak, H, et al, European Neurology, 33, 403-408, 1993). The Braaks focus is almost entirely on the development of neurofibrillary pathology, which begins in the entorhinal cortex perhaps years before the clinical signs of the disease are apparent. The progression of Alzheimers Disease is thought to be somewhat unusual, in the sense that the disease progresses by the involvement of more and more neurons in the formation of PHF, in an anatomic sequence which is to some extent predictable. In the initial stages, only those neurons of the entorhinal cortex contain PHF, in later stages, neurons of the CA1 and CA2 pyramidal layer of the hippocampus contain these structures, and still later, neurons of the association cortex begin to show evidence of PHF formation. Clearly, prevention of PHF formation even after the process is underway in the hippocampus could limit the disease to this brain region, at which point clinical problems are confined to some loss of short term memory. Patients first seek help at a stage when PHF pathology is largely limited to the hippocampus (Berg, L, et al, pages 9-25, in Alzheimers Disease, Eds., Terry, R D; Katzman, R; Bick, K L. Raven Press, New York, 1994). To prevent the progression of Alzheimers Disease at this point would clearly be a major benefit to the patient (Davies, P, pages 327-334, in Alzheimers Disease, Eds., Terry, R D; Katzman, R; Bick, K L. Raven Press, New York, 1994; Khachaturian Z S, et al, pages 445-454, in Alzheimers Disease, Eds., Terry, R D; Katzman, R; Bick, K L. Raven Press, New York, 1994). Attempts to determine the molecular nature of the PHF were hampered at first by an approach which attempted to purify PHF from isolated neurofibrillary tangles. Once incorporated into the macromolecular complex that is the tangle, PHFs become extremely difficult to solubilize for protein analysis. The microtubule-associated protein tau appears to be a major antigenic component of PHF. The repeat region of microtubule-associated protein tau forms part of the core of the paired helical filament of Alzheimers Disease (Goedert, M, et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 85, 4051-4055, 1988; Wischik, C M, et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 85, 4506-4510, 1988). The involvement of protein phosphorylation in the formation of PHF has been suggested by a variety of studies which have shown that tau in PHF is hyperphosphorylated (Kosik, K S, et al, Ann. Med., 21, 109-112, 1989; Goedert, M, Trends in Neurosciences, 16, 460-465, 1993; Iqbal, K, et al, Act Neurobiologiae Experimentalis, 53, 325-335, 1993). There is suggestive evidence that several other proteins, especially neurofilaments and other microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) are also hyperphosphorylated in the brains of patients with Alzheimers Disease (Lovestone, S, et al, Current Opinions in Neurology and Neurosurgery, 5, 883-888, 1992). In 1985, a monoclonal antibody ALZ50 was raised (produced by hybridoma cell line ATCC No. HB9205) that recognized a 68 kDa polypeptide (termed A68) in immunoblots of the vulnerable brain regions in AD, but not in control brains, (Wolozin, B, et al, Science, 232, 648-650, 1986). Immunohistochemical analysis with this antibody indicated an intense reaction with neurofibrillary tangles and, in later experiments, with the PHFs, as well. The discovery of A68 was the first report of a biochemically determined abnormal protein species associated with the fibrillar pathology in AD. In other laboratories in 1986, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies recognizing the microtubule-associated protein, tau, were shown to react with neurofibrillary tangles, and subsequently, with PHFs (Grundke-Iqbal, I, et al, Proc. Natl,. Acad. Sci., 83, 4913-4917, 1986; Kosik, K S, et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 83, 4044-4048, 1986). Furthermore, biochemical analyses of the protease-resistant core of the PHF demonstrated the presence of peptides containing the tau sequence, (Goedert, M, et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 85, 4051-4055, 1988; Wischik, C M, et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 85, 4506-4510, 1988). Additionally, monoclonal antibodies, whose epitopes spanned the tau molecule, all were shown to react with neurofibrillary tangles in AD brain (Kosik, K S, et al, Neuron, 1, 817-825, 1988). Much later, it was determined that the ALZ50 antibody reacts with the extreme amino terminus of the tau molecule, (Goedert, M, et al, Neuroscience Letters, 126, 149-154, 1991). In 1990, in an attempt to purify A68, a more readily soluble preparation of PHFs was isolated (Greenberg, S and Davies, P, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 87, 5827-5831, 1990). Immunoblots of these structures indicated that three closely migrating electrophoretic species, the slowest migrating of which was ca. 68 kDa in size, all reacted with ALZ50 and tau antibodies (Lee, V, et al, Science, 251, 675-678, 1991). This indicated that the A68 complex of proteins is, to a large extent, composed of the tau protein. This polymerized form of tau was shown over the years to be in a hyperphosphorylated state. Other monoclonal antibodies raised against human PHF preparations are the antibodies PHF-1 and TG3. While these antibodies display robust affinity for paired helical filament preparations, they only have trace reactivity towards normal adult tau. Further studies revealed that the monoclonal antibody PHF-1 has a reduced affinity for PHF which has been treated with alkaline phosphatase or hydrofluoric acid, thereby suggesting that this antibody recognized a phosphorylated epitope(s) in paired helical filaments. These phosphorylated epitopes (recognized by PHF-1) reside within the C-terminal fragment of the tau protein, at serine 396 and 404 (Trojanowski, J. Q., et al, Clin. Neurosci., 1, 184-191, 1993). The epitope(s) recognized by TG3 has not been mapped yet. To date, it has not been possible to consistently induce the formation of Alzheimer-like epitopes either in vivo or in vitro. Hence, there is a need for an assay for the determination of tau protein, paired helical filaments and mechanisms involved with Alzheimers Disease. There is further a need for an assay suitable for screening for drugs which may prevent or decrease Alzheimers Disease activity. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The compounds of this invention and an antipyschotic agent, chlorpromazine, are active in an assay indicative of the potential of certain drugs to inhibit a hallmark trait of Alzheimers Disease. Further, chlorpromazine is shown herein to be capable of treating and/or preventing Alzheimers Disease. Consequently, the compounds of this invention are useful for treating and/or preventing the disease. The human neuroblastoma MSN1a cell line expresses the proteins known to be involved in PHF formation (including tau, other MAPs and neurofilament proteins, and thus is a cell line in which Alzheimers Disease epitopes can be expressed. (Arias et al, J. Neurochem., 61: 673-682, 1993; Vincent et al, J. Neurochem., 62: 715-723, 1994). Immunohistochemical staining of brains from normal and Alzheimers Disease (AD) patients using the monoclonal antibodies PHF-1 and TG3 indicates that these monoclonal antibodies specifically stain elements of AD brain, but not normal brain (FIG. 1 ). Conditions were established which led to hyperphosphorylation of the proteins known to be involved in PHF formation. Using monoclonal antibodies PHF-1 and TG3 generated to human PHF preparations, the effects of a variety of manipulations of the phosphorylation state of these proteins were tested. These tests required that most of the abnormal epitopes recognized by these monoclonal antibodies in the human Alzheimer brain should be generated in the MSN1a cells. The treatment of MSN1a cells with okadaic acid and other selected inhibitors of protein phosphatases has been found to generate the epitopes associated with these Alzheimer brain specific monoclonal antibodies, thereby meeting the requirements described above. These epitopes are either absent or present at a very low level in untreated MSN1a cells. The AD specificity of the PHF-1 and TG3 antibodies was also demonstrated using an ELISA assay. Shown in FIG. 2A are bar graphs (percent of AD) of the ELISA immunoreactivity of brain preparations (AD or normal) to either PHF-1 or TG3. Shown in FIG. 2B are bar graphs (percent of MSN) of the ELISA immunoreactivity of MSN1a cell preparations (minus or plus okadaic acid) to either PHF-1 or TG3. The MSN1a cell preparations plus vs minus okadaic acid closely parallel the AD vs normal brain preparations. This clearly shows the relationship between disease pathology (i.e. AD brain) and what is recognized by the antibodies in the MSN1a in vitro cell culture assay. The cell culture system according to the invention in which epitopes characteristic of PHF can be readily generated and subsequently recognized by the specific Alzheimer brain specific antibodies provides an assay suitable for screening compounds for their ability to block the production of these phosphorylated epitopes. PHF tau protein has lower affinity for microtubules as compared to normal tau protein, which is likely the result of the abnormal phosphorylation (Lindwall et al, J. Biol. Chem., 259: 5301-5305, 1984). As a consequence, microtubule destabilization occurs which interferes with important neuronal processes such as rapid axonal transport and, subsequently, this process leads to the formation of PHF and the neurofibrillary tangles (Bancher, et al, Brain Res., 477, 90-99, 1989). Thus, inhibition of the production of the abnormal phosphorylated PHF epitopes will interfere with and/or prevent the formation of PHF. Since PHF formation is a major feature of Alzheimer pathology, the development of compounds that interfere with all or part of this process inhibit or prevent the progression of this disease. The invention provides compounds of formula 1: or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein X is selected from oxygen, sulfur and NR, wherein R is selected from hydrogen, loweralkyl and CH 2 CH 2 COAr 1 ; and Z is hydrogen, straight or branched chain alkyl having 1-6 carbon atoms, or Z and a substituent on the aryl group together represent CH 2 , CH 2 CH 2 , CH 2 O, or CH 2 S to form a five or six membered ring where the ring is optionally substituted with loweralkyl or phenyl; R 24 is hydrogen, loweralkyl, or optionally substituted phenyl; each R 10 is selected from hydrogen and loweralkyl; and Ar 1 represents an aryl group or optionally substituted phenyl. These compounds are useful for treating Alzheimers Disease. The compounds of this invention, by preventing or decreasing the production of abnormally phosphorylated paired helical filament epitopes associated with the production of the neurofibrillary tangles, a characteristic pathological feature of Alzheimers Disease, are useful in the treatment of this neurodegenerative disorder. The compounds of formula I inhibit and/or prevent the formation of abnormally phosphorylated epitopes on PHF tau. Through inhibitory interactions of the phosphorylation events associated with the formation of PHF tau, and other proteins involved in PHF formation, one can modulate the assembly of microtubules, thereby affecting neuronal processes such a rapid axonal transport, thus preventing the formation of PHF and the production of the neurofibrillary tangles. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are therapeutically useful in various neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers Disease. Thus, the invention provides methods of preventing and/or treating Alzheimers Disease in a patient comprising administering to the patient a compound of formula I in an amount effective to inhibit formation of abnormally phosphorylated paired helical filament epitopes.

These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservative, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin. If desired, and for more effective distribution, the compounds can be incorporated into slow release or targeted delivery systems such as polymer matrices, liposomes, and microspheres. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof.

The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. If desired, and for more effective distribution, the compounds can be incorporated into slow release or targeted delivery systems such as polymer matrices, liposomes, and microspheres. The active compounds can also be in microencapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-mentioned excipients. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof. Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound of this invention include powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound is mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required. Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Actual dosage levels of active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active compound(s) that is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, compositions, and mode of administration. The selected dosage level will depend upon the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the severity of the condition being treated, and the condition and prior medical history of the patient being treated. However, it is within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required for to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. Generally dosage levels of about 0.1 to about 200, more preferably of about 0.5 to about 150, and most preferably about 1 to about 125 mg of active compound per kilogram of body weight per day are administered orally to a mammalian patient suffering from Alzheimers Disease. If desired, the effective daily dose may be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration, e.g. two to four separate doses per day. All documents e.g., patents and journal articles, cited above or below are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. One skilled in the art will recognize that modifications may be made in the present invention without deviating from the spirit or scope of the invention. The invention is illustrated further by the following examples which are not to be construed as limiting the invention or scope of the specific procedures described herein. GENERAL PROCEDURE As is more fully explained in the following scheme and examples, the compounds of the invention may be prepared by adding an appropriate secondary amine (1 mole) to a solution of concentrated hydrochloric acid (2-5 moles) in sufficient isopropanol to achieve an amine concentration of about 0.1 M-0.4 M. To the solution of amine hydrochloride salt which has been formed in situ is added paraformaldehyde (1-2.2 moles) followed by the desired aryl or heteroarylketone (1.1-2 moles), and the resulting reaction mixture is then refluxed for about 12-72 hours. The reaction is cooled and the resulting solid is filtered and recrystallized from methanol or triturated with methanol or ethanol to afford the desired product. The compounds of the invention may be prepared according to the reactions set forth in the following reaction scheme. where Ar 1 , Z, X, and R 10 are as defined above for formula I. Using the above-described procedure, the compounds described in the following examples were prepared.

EXAMPLE 67 Effect of Chlorpromazine on Paired Helical Filament Levels in Human Brain Tissue The in vitro analyses described herein to investigate the activity of the compounds of this invention can also be used to determine the nature of abnormally phosphorylated paired helical filament epitopes involved in Alzheimers Disease, the regulatory mechanisms involved with Alzheimers Disease and modifications of the protein tau and other polypeptides associated with PHFs and involved in Alzheimers Disease. Certain phenothiazines, for example, chlorpromazine, can markedly inhibit the expression of PHF epitopes (as determined by loss of immunoreactivity with Alzheimers Disease specific antibodies) upon treatment of MSN1a cells with okadaic acid (cf. FIG. 3 ). These compounds are effective at micromolar concentrations, with increased potency being evident when cells are treated prior to the addition of okadaic acid. The effective concentrations appear to be in the range at which these drugs are present in the brain following chronic treatment of psychiatric patients (Svendsen, C N, Psychopharmacology, 90, 316-321, 1986). These results indicate that patients who were chronically treated with phenothiazines would be protected from the development of PHF, and thus would have a low probability of development of Alzheimers Disease. Frontal and cortical brain tissue specimens obtained at autopsy from patients chronically treated with chlorpromazine were analyzed using the ALZ-EIA method previously described (Ghanbari, H A, et al, JAMA, 263, 2907, 1990). The results are shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B frontal (Broadman area 10) and temporal (Broadman area 38) regions, respectively. The brain tissue (post-mortem) from approximately the same number of (age matched) normal controls and Alzheimers Disease patients were also analyzed and are presented in these figures as negative and positive controls (for normal and AD, respectively). As the data indicate, the samples from chlorpromazine treated patients (Rx) had low PHF epitope levels similar to normal controls, whereas the PHF epitope levels in the AD group were clearly much higher. Furthermore, these results were consistent with histopathological diagnosis of the brain specimens. Statistically, in the general population, about 20-30% of the individuals in the Rx age group would have developed AD and hence much higher PHF in the brain regions indicated (Katzman, R., Kawas, C. H., pages 105-122, in Alzheimers Disease, Eds., Terry, R D; Katzman, R; Bick, K L. Raven Press, New York, 1994). This evidence shows that chronic treatment of patients with chlorpromazine prevents PHF formation and AD. In a subsequent study, 51 additional patients were identified and the analysis was repeated as above using the TG3 antibody in an ELISA format. The results, summarized in Table 1, clearly reproduce and confirm the first retrospective study. Immunohistopathological studies carried out on several brain regions from these patients were consistent with these ELISA results. Taken together, these two studies provide evidence of the therapeutic benefit of chlorpromazine in AD and validate the use of the MSN1a model for the identification of therapeutically useful compounds for the treatment of AD. TABLE 1 SIGNAL* SEM N MEAN AGE SEM Frontal Temporal Normal (12) 79.50 3.33 0.12 0.12 0.00 0.00 AD (28) 82.54 1.94 16.54 2.59 17.55 2.82 Rx (51) 76.88 1.55 0.12 0.11 0.16 0.11 * Signal is calculated by summing the means of duplicate absorbance readings (direct ELISA using TG3 antibody) for 8 dilutions of all lysates prepared by one to two serial dilutions. Efforts to dissect the characteristic lesions of Alzheimers Disease, namely the neurofibrillary tangles and the neuritic plaques have indicted that aberrant protein phosphorylation is a hallmark of the cytoskeletal abnormalities in AD. Phosphorylated sites on the PHFs found in neurofibrillary tangles and abnormal neurites are detected by AD-specific antibodies, such as TG3 and PHF-1, in the brains of AD patients and not in normal or other neurodegenerative disease controls (cf. FIG. 1 , 2 A). In the MSN1a cell culture model (cf. FIG. 2B , 3 ), these aberranty phosphorylated PHF sites are also detected by these antibodies. Therefore, the therapeutic activity of the compounds of the invention was assessed by the ability of these agents to affect the production of abnormally phosphorylated epitopes pertinent to the production of PHFs of AD, utilizing a human neuroblastoma cell line (MSN1a) in the presence of the protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid (OKA). As described above, chlorpromazine, a clinically used antipyschotic, prevents production of the aberrantly phosphorylated PHF epitopes and, hence, the production of PHFs, thereby preventing AD. As shown in FIGS. 2B and 3 , and in Table 2, chlorpromazine is effective in inhibiting the production of these aberrant phosphorylated epitopes in the MSN1a cell culture model as determined by the prevention of the immunoreactivity associated with PHF antibodies such as TG3 which was utilized in the retrospective clinical analysis. To determine the effect of chlorpromazine on the paired helical filament epitopes associated with AD, MSN1a cells expressing paired helical filament epitopes were incubated with 100 mM chlorpromazine (CPZ) or a 0.2% DMSO vehicle control for 2 hours at 37 C. The cells were isolated by centrifugation, boiled for 10 minutes and 25 mg protein from the resulting heat stable supernatants were loaded per lane on an SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and then immunostained with PHF-1. As shown in FIG. 3 , CPZ greatly decreased the production of paired helical filament epitopes by the MSN1a cells. In contrast, the control shows that without the addition of CPZ, there was production of paired helical filament epitopes by the MSN1a cells. The use of the MSN1a cell culture model for screening of novel compounds for therapeutic activity in AD is, therefore, quite warranted. This assay can thus be used to determine whether a drug is capable of preventing or intervening in AD by attenuating the production of abnormally phosphorylated paired helical filament epitopes associated with AD. To determine whether a drug is capable of preventing or intervening in AD activity, the MSN1a cells containing tau and associated proteins are treated with OKA capable of greatly increasing immunoreactivity of the MSN1a cells with AD specific monoclonal antibodies. Then, either prior to or concomitantly with OKA treatment, a compound of the present invention is added to the culture. If the compound prevents the induction of the AD epitopes in the MSN1a cells treated with OKA, then it is said to have anti-AD activity. If the AD-specific antibodies are highly reactive with the neuroblastoma cells following OKA treatment in the presence of compound, then the compound is said to be ineffectual against AD. The MSN1a human neuroblastoma line was subcloned from a population of MSN cells obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Peter Davies (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, N.Y.). Cells were grown and maintained in flasks in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 U/ml Streptomycin, 0.5 ug/ml fungizone under 7.5% CO 2 at 37 C. Stock solutions of drugs were prepared by dissolving the anhydrous powders to final concentrations of either 10 or 20 mM in 50% aqueous or 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), respectively. Working solutions of drugs were prepared by dilution of the stock solutions with Krebs Ringer in Hepes buffer (KRH) (128 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl 2 1.2 mM MgSO 4 , 1 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 10 mM dextrose, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4). OKA is maintained as a 1 mM stock solution in DMSO prior to dilution to 4 M in KRH. MSN cells grown in 225 cm 2 flasks are removed from the incubator, their medium decanted and replaced with 50 ml pre-warmed KRH. The cells are harvested by scraping prior to sedimentation at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants are discarded and the cell pellets are resuspended, the cells counted and diluted to a density of 210 4 cells/50 ml. The cells are then plated in a 96 well plate at 50 l/well and 25 l of 4 AM OKA and 25 W of drug are then added to the appropriate wells; the entire 96 well plate is then incubated for 2 hrs at 37 C. Depending on the dilution of drug added, this yields individual wells containing 1 M OKA, 0-64 m drug and 210 4 cells in 0.26% DMSO in KRH. The incubation is terminated by the addition of 20 l of 6 extraction buffer and immediate freezing at 80 C. for at least one hr. The 6 extraction buffer contains: 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 24 mM 5-glycerol phosphate, 10 g/ml APMSF (4-amidinophenylmethane-sulfonyl flouride), and 2.5 g/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin. The plates are thawed in a 37 C. water bath and 20 l of cell lysate is added to a replica well in an ELISA plate that already contains 80 l of coating buffer (15 mM Na 2 CO 3 and 35 mM NaHCO 3 , pH 9.6). The plates are allowed to coat overnight at 4 C. The plates are washed four times with deionized water and then blocked for 30 min at 37 C. with 200 l/well pre-warmed 1% bovine serum albumin in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM NaN 3 (BSA-TBS). After the blocking solution is removed, 100 l/well of an appropriate dilution of pre-warmed primary antibody (eg., TG3 or PHF-1) in BSA-TBS is added and incubated at 37 C. for 30 min. Incubation is terminated by washing four times in deionized water at which time 100 l of an appropriate dilution of pre-warmed secondary antibody (conjugated to alkaline phosphatase) in BSA-TBS is added to each well in the ELISA plate. Incubation is performed for 30 min at 37 C. followed by washing 4 times with deionized water. 100 l/ml of prewarmed chromogenic substrate (1mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 10% diethanolamnine, 3 mM NaN 3 , 0.5 mM MgCl 2 , pH 9.8) is added and the plate incubated for 30 min at 37 C. Absorbance at 405 nm is then determined by reading the plate on a BioRad UV Microplate Reader. Results obtained from the MSN1a cell culture model studies utilizing the TG3 antibody are shown in Table 2 for a representative sample of compounds disclosed herein.

As shown, the compounds of the present invention are more potent than chlorpromazine, which was shown in the retrospective clinical study to both inhibit the production of the AD associated epitopes and prevent AD.

CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/104,588, which was converted from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/058,834, filed Apr. 13, 1998, pursuant to a petition filed under 37 C.F.R. 1.53(c)(2)(i) filed May 12, 1998. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a series of 4-amino-(ethylamino)-oxindoles having dopaminergic properties. The compounds of the present invention are useful in treating various conditions affected by dopamine agonists, such as Parkinsons disease, Tourettes syndrome, schizophrenia, and alcohol and drug addiction. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Efforts to induce antipsychotic activity with dopamine autoreceptor agonists have been successful (e.g., see Dorsini et al., Adv. Biochem. Psychopharmacol., 16:645-648 (1977); Tamminga et al., Science, 200:567-568 (1975); and Tamminga et al., Psychiatry 398-402 (1986). A method for determining intrinsic activity at the dopamine D 2 receptor was recently reported by Lahti et al., Mol. Pharm. 42:432-438 (1993). Intrinsic activity is predicted using the ratio of the low-affinity agonist (i.e., LowAg) state of the receptor and the high-affinity agonist (i.e., HighAg) state of the receptor, i.e. LowAg/HighAg. These ratios correlate with the agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist activities of a given compound. Such activities characterize the ability of a compound to elicit an antipsychotic effect. WO 9109849 broadly discloses a series of indole-amine compounds, such as, compounds A and B below, that are disclosed as being useful as reverse transcriptase inhibitors for the treatment of AIDS. However, there is no disclosure or suggestion in this reference that such compounds have D 2 receptor agonist activity or act to relieve the symptoms of Parkinsons disease, schizophrenia, or other conditions affected by dopamine. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The compounds of this invention are 4-amino-(ethylamino)-oxindoles represented by Formula I: wherein R 1 and R 2 are each, independently, hydrogen, C 1-10 alkyl, or (CH 2 ) m R 4 , wherein R 4 is phenyl or naphthyl which may be substituted by one or two substituents selected from the group consisting of C 1-6 alkyl, halogen, C 1-6 alkoxide and trifluoromethyl and m is 1 to 5; and R 3 is hydrogen or C 1-6 alkyl; or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of this invention are dopamine agonists having various degrees of intrinsic dopaminergic activity. Some of these compounds are selective autoreceptor agonists, (i.e., partial agonists which activate only autoreceptors versus postsynaptic D 2 dopamine receptors). As such, the present compounds provide functional modulation of the dopamine systems of the brain without causing an excessive blockade of the postsynaptic dopamine receptors. Such excessive blockades have been observed to be responsible for the serious side effects frequently exhibited by agents known to be clinically effective for the treatment of schizophrenia. Moreover, the compounds of this invention have a high degree of intrinsic activity and, therefore, they can behave as the natural neurotransmitter, i.e., as a full agonist. As such, they are useful in the treatment of diseases caused by abnormal concentrations of dopamine, such as Parkinsons disease. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Preferably, the compounds of the present invention are those of Formula I, wherein: R 1 and R 2 are each, independently, C 1-10 alkyl or (CH 2 ) m R 4 , wherein R 4 is phenyl and m is 1; and R 3 is hydrogen or C 1-6 alkyl; or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Most preferably, the compounds of the present invention may be selected from the group consisting of: 4-(2-Benzylamino-ethylamino)-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one dihydrochloride; and 4-2-(Benzyl-methylamino)-ethylamino-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one dihydrochloride. As used herein, the terms alkyl and alkoxy refer to either straight or branched chain alllyl and alkoxy groups, respectively. The term halogen refers to chlorine, bromine, fluorine and iodine. The compounds of the present invention may be used in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts having the utility of the free base. Such salts, preparable by methods well known to those skilled in the art, are formed with both inorganic or organic acids, for example: fumaric, maleic, benzoic, ascorbic, pamoic, succinic, bismethylenesalicylic, methanesulfonic, ethanedisulfonic, acetic, oxalic, propionic, tartaric, salicyclic, citric, gluconic, lactic, malic, mandelic, cinnamic, citraconic, aspartic, stearic, palmitic, itaconic, glycolic, p-aminobenzoic, glutamic, benzene-sulfonic, hydrochloric hydrobromic, sulfuric, cyclohexylsulfamic, phosphoric and nitric acids. The compounds of the present invention are dopamine autoreceptor agonists which modulate the synthesis and release of the neurotranmitter dopamine. They are thus useful for treatment of disorders of the dopaminergic system, such as schzophrenia, Parkinsons disease and Tourettes syndrome. The present compounds are also partial agonists at the postsynaptic dopamine D 2 receptor and are thus useful in the treatment of other conditions affected by such agonists, such as alcohol and drug addiction. The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by any suitable, conventional method which will be recognized by one skilled in the art. However, it is preferred that the present compounds be prepared by the overall sequences depicted in Schemes I and II. The present invention will now be illustrated by reference to the following specific, non-limiting examples.

Purification by chromatography (silica gel, 7% 2N ammonia in methanol-ethyl acetate) and crystallization from ethyl acetate gave the free base as a off white solid (0.48 g, 40.4 %), mp 122-124 C.; MS EI m/e 295 (M ). Elemental analysis for C 18 H 21 N 3 O.0.25 H 2 O Calcd: C, 72.09; H. 7.23; N, 14.01 Found: C, 72.11; H, 7.16; N, 14.05 The affinity for the dopamine autoreceptor was established by the standard experimental test procedure of Seemen and Schaus, European Journal of Pharmacology, 203:105-109 (1991). According to this procedure, homogenized rat striatal brain tissue was incubated with the appropriate concentrations of test compound, filtered and washed and counted in a Betaplate scintillation counter. High affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor was established by the standard experimental test procedure of Fields, et al., Brain Res., 136:578 (1977) and Yamamura et al., eds., Neurotransmitter Receptor Binding , Raven Press, N.Y. (1978). Homogenized limbic brain tissue was incubated with 3 H-spiroperidol (Spiper.) and the appropriate concentrations of test compound, filtered, washed and shaken with Hydrofluor scintillation cocktail (available from National Diagnostics) and counted in a Packard 460 CD scintillation counter. The results of the tests with compounds representative of this invention are set forth below. Example IC 50 (nM) IC 50 (nM) No. D 2 Quin. D 2 Spiper Ratio 1 13.2 892 67.7 Hence, it can be seen that the compounds of this invention effect the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine and are therefore dopamine antireceptor agonists. Such compounds are useful in the treatment of dopaminergic disorders such as schizophrenia, Parkinsons disease, Tourettes Syndrome, alcohol addiction, cocaine addiction, and addiction to analagous drugs. The compounds of this invention may be administered orally or parenterally, neat or in combination with conventional pharmaceutical carriers. Applicable solid carriers can include one or more substances which may also act as flavoring agents, lubricants, solubilizers, suspending agents, fillers, glidants, compression aids, binders or tablet-disintegrating agents or an encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in admixture with the finely divided active ingredient. In tablets, the active ingredient is mixed with a carrier having the necessary compression properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain up to 99% of the active ingredient. Any of the solid carriers known to those skilled in the art may be used with the compounds of this invention. Particularly suitable solid carriers include, for example, calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, low melting waxes and ion exchange resins. Liquid carriers may be used in preparing solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups and elixirs of the compounds of this invention. The compounds of this invention can be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as water, an organic solvent, a mixture of both or pharmaceutically acceptable oils or fat. The liquid carrier can contain other suitable pharmaceutical additives such as solubilizers, emulsifiers, buffers, preservatives, sweeteners, flavoring agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, colors, viscosity regulators, stabilizers or osmo-regulators. Suitable examples of liquid carriers for oral and parenteral administration include water (particularly containing additives as above, e.g., cellulose derivatives, preferably sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols, e.g., glycols) and their derivatives and oils (e.g., fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil). For parenteral administration, the carrier can also be an oily ester such as ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate. Sterile liquid carriers are used in sterile liquid form compositions for parenteral administration. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions which are sterile solutions or suspensions can be utilized by, for example, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection. Sterile solutions can also be administered intravenously. Compositions for oral administration may be either liquid or solid composition form. Preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds of this invention are in unit dosage form, e.g., tablets or capsules. In such form, the compositions may be subdivided in unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the present compounds. The unit dosage forms can be packaged compositions, for example, packeted powders, vials, ampoules, prefilled syringes or sachets containing liquids. Alternatively, the unit dosage form can be, for example, a capsule or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any such compositions in package form. The therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of this invention that is administered and the dosage regimen depends on a variety of factors, including the weight, age, sex, and medical condition of the subject, the severity of the disease, the route and frequency of administration, and the specific compound employed, and thus may vary widely. However, it is believed that the pharmaceutical compositions may contain the compounds of this invention in the range of about 0.1 to about 2000 mg, preferably in the range of about 0.5 to about 500 mg and more preferably between about 1 and about 100 mg. Projected daily dosages of active compound are about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg body weight. The daily dose can be conveniently administered two to four times per day.

This application is a 371 of PCT/JP98/01150, filed Mar. 18, 1998. TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to drug, food and beverage which are useful for therapy of allergic diseases. Prior Art In allergic diseases represented by asthma and atopic dermatitis, release of chemical mediators from mast cells plays a big role in the allergic reaction. This reaction is induced by binding the immunoglobulin E (IgE) to receptors on cell membranes followed by cross-linking and it is expected that an inhibitor of the IgE production plays an effect for therapy and prevention of allergic diseases. The reaction of the delayed type hypersensitivity is an inflammatory reaction depending upon cellular immune induced by T lymphocytes activated by antigen which is not removed by macrophage. Inflammatory cells are induced and activated by cytokine which is produced from activated T lymphocytes and release various inflammatory mediators to induce tissue disturbances. Allergic dermatitis by a reaction of the delayed type hypersensitivity occupies a high percentage of contact-type dermatitis and, in addition, it is a cause of onset of allergy where bacteria, virus or drugs are antigens. Thus, it is expected that an inhibitor of the delayed type hypersensitivity plays an effect for therapy and prevention of those allergic diseases. Problems to be Solved by the Invention An object of the present invention is to develop a compound which is effective for controlling the IgE production and for inhibiting the reaction of the delayed type hypersensitivity and to offer a drug which is useful for the therapy of allergic diseases containing said compound as an effective component, a method for the inhibition of allergy using said compound as an effective component and food and beverage containing said compound. Means to Solve the Problem In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, the present inventors have conducted an intensive investigation and found that 4,5-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one which is a compound represented by the formula I (hereinafter, just referred to as the cyclopentenone) has an inhibition activity of IgE production and an inhibition activity of delayed type hypersensitivity, and said compound is useful as an effective component of an antiallergic agent whereupon the present invention has been accomplished. Outline of the present invention is that the first feature of the present invention relates to an antiallergic agent which is characterized in containing at least one compound selected from a group consisting of 4,5-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one represented by the following formula I and an optically active substance and a salt thereof as an effective component. The second feature of the present invention relates to a method for inhibiting allergies which is characterized in using at least one compound selected from a group consisting of 4,5-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one represented by the above-mentioned formula I and an optically active substance and a salt thereof as an effective component. The third feature of the present invention relates to an antiallergic food or beverage which is characterized in containing at least one compound selected from a group consisting of 4,5-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one represented by the above-mentioned formula I and an optically active substance and a salt thereof as an effective component. BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows the an inhibition activity of the cyclopentenone to reaction of the delayed type hypersensitivity. FIG. 2 shows a CD of p-dimethylaminobenzoyl derivative of ()-cyclopentenone and a stereostructure of ()-cyclopentenone. FIG. 3 shows a CD of p-dimethylaminobenzoyl derivative of ()-cyclopentenone and a stereostructure of ()-cyclopentenone. EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The present invention will now be specifically illustrated as hereinafter. The cyclopentenone represented by the formula I used in the present invention covers both isomers where the configurations of hydroxyl groups at 4- and 5-positions are cis- and trans. In the present invention, any of cis-cyclopentenone, trans-cyclopentenone and a mixture of cis- and trans-cyclopentenone may be used. It is also possible to use optically active substances thereof. cis-Cyclopentenone may be prepared by a chemical synthesis Helvetica Chimica Acta, volume 55, pages 2838-2844 (1972). trans-Cyclopentenone may be prepared either by a chemical synthesis Carbohydrate Res., volume 247, pages 217-222 (1993) or by heating uronic acid such as glucuronic acid, uronic acid derivative such as glucuronolactone or a substance containing the same (refer to PCT/JP97/03052). In the present invention, it is also possible to use such a heated product or partially purified product or purified product thereof. For example, when D-glucuronic acid is used as a uronic acid and its 1% solution is heated at 121 C. for four hours, the cyclopentenone is produced in the heat-treated substance. The cyclopentenone in this heat-treated substance is extracted with a solvent and the extract is concentrated. Then, this concentrated extract is separated by means of a silica gel column chromatography, the eluted cyclopentenone fraction is concentrated, the cyclopentenone is extracted with chloroform from the concentrate and the extract of the concentrate is subjected to a normal phase column chromatography whereupon the cyclopentenone in the heat-treated substance is isolated. Physical property of the cyclopentenone will be given as hereunder. Incidentally, a mass spectrometric analysis of the cyclopentenone was conducted using a mass spectrometer DX302 (manufactured by Nippon Denshi). Further, measurement of an NMR using heavy chloroform as a solvent was conducted by JNM-A 500 (manufactured by Nippon Denshi). Specific rotation was measured by a DIP-370 polarimeter (manufactured by Nippon Bunko); ultraviolet absorption spectrum was measured by a UV-2500 spectrophotometer (manufactured by Shimadzu); and infrared absorption spectrum (IR) was measured by an FTIR-8000 infrared spectrophotometer (manufactured by Shimadzu). MS m/z 115 MH ; 1 H-NMR (CDCl 3 ): 4.20 (1H, d, J2.4 Hz, 5-H), 4.83 (1H,m, 4-H), 6.30 (1H, dd, J1.2, 6.1 Hz, 2-H), 7.48 (1H, dd, J2.1, 6.1 Hz, 3-H). Incidentally, the chemical shift value of the 1 H-NMR was given on a basis that the chemical shift value of CHCl 3 was 7.26 ppm. Optical rotation: D 20 0 (c 1.3, water); UV: max 215 nm (water); IR (KBr method): absorptions were noted at 3400, 1715, 1630, 1115, 1060, 1025 cm 1 . When the isolated cyclopentenone is subjected to an optical resolution, ()-4,5-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one and ()-4,5-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one are obtained. It goes without saying that the cyclopentenone obtained by a synthetic method can be subjected to an optical resolution as well. For example, the cyclopentenone is dissolved in ethanol. To this ethanolic solution is further added hexane/ethanol (94/6) to prepare a cyclopentenone solution. The cyclopentenone can be optically resolved when this sample solution is subjected to an HPLC using, for example, a Chiral Pack AS (manufactured by Daicel Chemical Industries) under such a condition that the column temperature was 40 C. and the mobile phase was hexane/ethanol (94/6). Optical rotation of the optically resolved ()-trans-4,5-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one hereinafter, referred to as ()-cyclopentenone is D 20 105 (c 0.30, ethanol) while that of the optically resolved ()-trans-4,5-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one hereinafter, referred to as ()-cyclopentenone is D 20 104 (c 0.53, ethanol). Incidentally, the optical rotation was measured by the above-mentioned polarimeter of the type DIP-370 (manufactured by Nippon Bunko). After that, each of ()-cyclopentenone and ()-cyclopentenone was subjected to structural analysis by means of mass analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), measurement of UV absorption spectrum and measurement of infrared absorption spectrum by the method mentioned already. As a result, both optically active substances showed the same result as that of the cyclopentenone before the optical resolution. Each of the optically resolved ()-cyclopentenone and ()-cyclopentenone was converted to a p-dimethylaminobenzoyl derivative, the circular dichroism spectrum (CD) was measured using a circular dichroism dispersimeter of type J-720 (manufactured by Nippon Bunko) and the result was applied to a dibenzoate chirality rule J. Am. Chem. Soc., volume 91, pages 3989-3991 (1969) to determine the configuration. CD of p-dimethylaminobenzoyl derivative of ()-cyclopentanone and stereostructure of () -cyclopentenone are shown in FIG. 2 . In the drawing, the ordinate indicates molar circular dichroism while the abscissa indicates wave length (nm). Incidentally, the above stereostructure is given hereunder as the formula II CD of p-dimethylaminobenzoyl derivative of ()-cyclopentanone and stereostructure of ()-cyclopentenone are shown in FIG. 3 . In the drawing, the ordinate indicates molar circular dichroism while the abscissa indicates wave length (nm). Incidentally, the above stereostructure is given hereunder as the formula III As shown in FIG. 2 , FIG. 3 , formula II and formula III, the ()-cyclopentenone is ()-(4R, 5S)-trans-4,5-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one while the ()-cyclopentenone is ()-(4S, 5R)-trans-4,5-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one. The above-mentioned cyclopentenones or an optically active substance thereof may be manufactured by any method, i.e. they may be manufactured by a method disclosed in this specification or by means of chemical synthesis; and trans- and cis-cyclopentenone or a mixture thereof and an optically active substance thereof may be used in the present invention as well. Examples of the salt of the cyclopentenone or optically active substance thereof are pharmaceutically acceptable salts and they may be prepared by known converting methods. The cyclopentenone reacts, for example, with an SH-containing compound (such as cysteine and glutathione) in vivo to produce a metabolic derivative which is useful as a drug. Therefore, it is believed that the pharmaceutical effect of the metabolic derivative is achieved even when the cyclopentenone is administered as well. The reaction product of the cyclopentenone with an SH-containing compound in vivo is presumed to be one of the metabolically effective substances. Thus, when exemplification is done for an SR-containing compound (R-SH), it reacts with the SH-containing compound to give a compound represented, for example, by the following formula IV or V. In addition, a compound represented by the formula V is converted to a compound represented by the formula IV. As such, the cyclopentenone is converted to each of the metabolic derivatives in the presence of an R-SH and such a metabolic derivative produced in vivo achieves an effect as a drug too. (R is a residual group where an SH group is removed from the SH-containing compound.) (R is a residual group where an SH group is removed from the SH-containing compound.) Accordingly, the use of the cyclopentenone, its optically active substance or salt thereof having an object of producticn of such a reaction product in vivo, i.e. a metabolic derivative, is covered by the present invention as well. When at least one compound selected from the cyclopentenone, its optically active substance or salt thereof having an inhibition activity of IgE production and an inhibition activity of delayed type hypersensitivity is used as an effective component and is made into a pharmaceutical preparation by combining with known pharmaceutical carriers, it is now possible to prepare anantiallergic agent. Generally, at least one of the compound selected from the cyclopentenone, its optically active substance or salt thereof is compounded with a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or solid carrier and, if necssary, solvent, dispersing agent, emulsifier, buffer, stabilizer, filler, binder, disintegrating agent, lubricant, etc. are added thereto to give said pharmaceutical preparation which may be in solid such as tablets, granules, diluted powders, powders, capsules, etc. or in liquid such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, etc. Further, this may be in a dry preparation which can be made into liquid by adding an appropriate carrier before use. The pharmaceutical carrier may be selected depending upon the above-mentioned mode of the administration and form of the preparation. In the case of oral preparations, starch, lactose, sugar, mannitol, carboxymethyl cellulose, corn starch, inorganic salts, etc. may be used. In the manufacture of oral preparations, binders, disintegrating agents, surface-active agents, lubricants, fluidity promoters, taste-correctives, coloring agents, flavors, etc. may be further compounded therewith. On the other hand, in the case of parenteral preparations, they may be prepared by common methods where at least one of the compound selected from the cyclopentenone, its optically active substance or salt thereof which is an effective component of the present invention is dissolved or suspended in a diluent such as distilled water for injection, physiological saline solution, aqueous solution of glucose, vegetable oil for injection, sesame oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, corn oil, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, etc. followed, if necessary, by adding bactericides, stabilizers, isotonic agents, analgesics, etc. thereto. The antiallergic agent of the present invention can be administered by an appropriate route depending upon the dosage form. There will be no particular limitation for the administering route and may be conducted by oral or external means or by injection. For example, tablets, pills, granules, diluted powder, liquid, suspension, syrup and capsules may be orally administered. Injection may be administered, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously or intracutaneously. Ointment, cream, etc. may be administered percutaneously. Suppositories may be administered per rectum. It is also possible to prepare aqueous or non-aqueous eye drops and examples of the eye drops to be administered to eye are ophthalmic ointment, painting liquid, sprinkling preparation and inserting preparation. For inhalation, a solution or a suspension of the effective component in common pharmaceutical vehicles is used and is applied, for example, as an aerosol spray for inhalation. It is also possible that dry and powdery effective component is administered using an inhaling device or the like so that the component can directly contact the lung. The dose as an antiallergic agent is not particularly specified but may be appropriately determined depending upon the dosage form, administration method, purpose of the use and age, body weight, conditions, etc. of the patient. Usually, however, the amount of at least one of the compound selected from the cyclopentenone, an optically active substance thereof or a salt thereof contained in the preparation for an adult is 10pg-50 mg/kg per day. As a matter of course, the dose may vary depending upon various factors and, therefore, the dose less than the above-mentioned one may be sufficient in some cases while, in other cases, the dose more than the above may be necessary. The agent of the present invention may be administered orally as it is and, further, the agent maybe taken daily after adding to common food and/or beverage as well. An inhibitor of the IgE production and an inhibitor of the delayed type hypersensitivity containing at least one compound selected from the cyclopentenone, an optically active substance thereof or a salt thereof as an effective component can be made into a pharmaceutical preparation by the same manner as in the case of the above-mentioned antiallergic agent and can be administered by the same manner as in the case of the antiallergic agent. Further, the cyclopentenone, an optically active substance thereof or a salt thereof may be used as a material for the antiallergic food or beverage. When the cyclopentenone, an optically active substance thereof or a salt thereof is taken, symptoms of the diseases caused by the IgE production and delayed type hypersensitivity can be significantly improved and, in addition, said compound has an excellent preventive activity to said diseases as well. There is no particular limitation for the method of manufacturing antiallergic food or beverage but cooking, processing and commonly-used manufacturing methods for food or beverage may be applied provided that at least one compound selected from the cyclopentenone, an optically active substance or a salt thereof having an inhibition activity of IgE production and an inhibition activity of delayed type hypersensitivity is contained in the resulting food or beverage as an effective component. There is no particular limitation for the shape of antiallergic food or beverage so far as at least one compound selected from the cyclopentenone, an optically active substance or a salt thereof having an antiallergic action is contained therein, added thereto and/or diluted therein as an effective component. Thus, the shape includes the ones which can be orally taken such as tablets, granules, capsules, gel and sol. A method for the inhibition of allergy offered by the use of the cyclopentenone or optically active substance or salt thereof as an effective component is useful in a study of onset mechanism of allergy and in a screening of antiallergic agents. Therefore, the drug, food or beverage inhibits the IgE, production and is very useful for improvement and/or therapy of the diseases which is mediated or worsened by the IgE production such as allergic diseases caused by the IgE including bronchial asthma, allergic rhitinis, atopic dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis, urticaria and anaphylactic shock. It also inhibits the delayed type hypersensitivity and is useful for therapy and prevention of the diseases accompanied by a delayed type hypersensitivity such as contact sensitivity, allergic contact dermatitis, bacterial allergy, fungal allergy, viral allergy, drug allergy, thyroiditis and allergic encephalitis. No toxicity was observed in the compound used in the present invention even when the dose which is effective to achieve those physiological activities is administered. In the case of oral administration for example, no dead case was observed in rats by a single oral administration of 100 mg/kg of any of the cyclopentenone, an optically active substance or a salt thereof. EXAMPLES The present invention will be further illustrated by way of the following examples although the present invention is never limited to those examples. Incidentally, % used in the examples stands for % by weight. Referential Example 1 D-Glucuroic acid (G 5269; manufactured by Sigma) (10 g) was dissolved in 1 liter of water, heated at 121 C. for four hours and concentrated in vacuo until about 10 ml. This was mixed with 40 ml of an upper layer of a 3:2:2 mixture of butyl acetate, acetic acid and water and centrifuged and the resulting supernatant liquid was concentrated in vacuo until about 10 ml. The above extract was applied to silica gel (BW-300SP,; 228 cm; manufactured by Fuji Silycia) for a column chromatography and separated using an upper layer of a 3:2:2 mixture of butyl acetate, acetic acid and water as an eluate at the flow rate of about 5 ml/minute under a pressure of 0.2 kg/cm 2 using a compressor. Fractionation was conducted to make a volume of one fraction 10 ml and a part of each fraction was analyzed by a thin layer chromatography whereupon cyclopentenone of a high purity was contained in 61st to 80th fractions. Those fractions were collected, concentrated in vacuo, extracted with 40 ml of chloroform and the extract was concentrated in vacuo to afford 100 mg of cyclopentenone. The fraction was separated by means of a normal phase HPLC using a Palpack type S column and, when a detection was conducted by an ultraviolet absorption of 215 nm, the purity was found to be 98%. The above cyclopentenone (113.9 mg) was dissolved in 2.85 ml of ethanol. To this ethanolic solution was added 3.85 ml of hexane/ethanol (94/6) to prepare a cyclopentenone solution (17 mg/ml). This solution was filtered through a filter of 0.5 m to prepare a sample solution for an optical resolution HPLC. This sample solution was applied to an optical resolution HPLC, each of the fractions of the ()-cyclopentenone in the earlier peak and the ()-cyclopentenone in the later peak was collected and evaporated to dryness in vacuo to give 43.2 mg of the ()-cyclopentenone and 43.0 mg of the ()-cyclopentenone. Conditions for Optical Resolution HPLC. Columns: Chiral Pack AS (manufactured by Daicel) 2.0 cm25.0 cm Column temperature: 40 C. Mobile phase: hexane/ethanol (94/6) Flow rate: 14.0 ml/minute Detection: UV 210 nm Amount of the charged sample: 150 l (2.55 mg). Each of the ()-cyclopentenone and ()-cyclopentenone obtained herein contains about 1% of enantiomer and, therefore, they were subjected to an optical resolution under the above-mentioned conditions again. As a result, 19.7 mg of the ()-cyclopentenone containing no enantiomer was obtained from 30.0 mg of the ()-cyclopentenone of the earlier peak while, from 37.4 mg of the ()-cyclopentenone of the later peak, 27.7 mg of the ()-cyclopentenone containing no enantiomer was obtained. Incidentally, the eluting times in optical resolution HPLC of the ()-cyclopentenone and ()-cyclopentenone were 33 minutes and 40 minutes, respectively. Example 1 (1) BALB/c male mice (Nippon Clare) (five weeks age; five mice per group) were sensitized by intraperitoneal administration of 100 l of 0.01% physiological saline solution of egg white albumin (Sigma) and 100 l of alum (trade name: Imject Alum; Pearce) and, 11 days thereafter, peripheral blood was collected from vein of eyeground. The collected blood was centrifuged (2,000 rpm for five minutes), plasma was separated and the total IgE amount in the plasma was measured by means of ELISA (IgE Mouse EIA Kit; Seikagaku Corporation). In the group to which the cyclopentenone was administered, 10 mg/kg was compulsorily administered per os once daily from the date of antigen sensitization until the day before the blood collection. In the control group, distilled water was orally administered by the same manner as above and the non-sensitized group was named as a non-treated group. The result is given in Table 1. An increase in total IgE. amount in plasma by sensitization with egg white albumin was suppressed by administration of the cyclopentenone. TABLE 1 Total IgE Amount in Plasma (ng/ml) Average SEM Non-Treated Group 0 Control Group 742.6 366.0 Cyclopentenone-Given Group 355.8 127.5 (2) Male rats of Wistar strain of five weeks age (one group consisting of five rats) (Nippon SLC) were sensitized by an intraperitoneal injection of 100 l of 0.01% solution of egg white albumin (Sigma) in an aqueous physiological saline solution and 100 l of Alum (trade name: Imject Alum; Pierce) and, after 14 days, blood was collected from abdominal artery. The collected blood was centrifuged (at 2000 rpm for five minutes), plasma was separated and the amount of antigen-specific IgE was measured by a 48-hour rat passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction. Thus, serum was diluted with a physiological saline solution in a successively doubling manner ranging from to {fraction (1/64)} and each 0.1 ml thereof was subcutaneously injected to hair-clipped back of male rats of Wistar strain of seven weeks age. After 48 hours from the subcutaneous injection, 1 ml of a mixture of 0.05% egg white albumin and 0.5% Evans Blue (manufactured by Nacalai Tesque) was injected from tail vein. After 30 minutes from the injection from the tail vein, rats were subjected to decapitation and to exanguinated death, blue spots appeared on the back were observed, the spots with a diameter of 5 mm or more were judged to be positive and the highest dilution was adopted as an IgE titer. In the cyclopentenone-administered groups, 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of cyclopentenone was intraperitoneally administered once daily for three days from the antigen-sensitized day while, in the control group, distilled water was intraperitoneally administered by the same manner. TABLE 2 IgE Titer Control Group 64 Cyclopentenone-administered groups 1 mg/kg/day 16 10 mg/kg/day 4 An increase in the antigen-specific IgE amount by sensitization with egg white albumin was inhibited by administration of cyclopentenone in a dose-dependent manner. As such, the IgE production was inhibited by the cyclopentenone. Similar inhibition activity of IgE production was noted in ()-cyclopentenone and ()-cyclopentenone. Example 2 C57BL/6 mice (female, five weeks age, weighed about 20 g) were purchased from Nippon SLC and used for the experiment: after a preliminary breeding for one week at our end. Ovine erythrocyte (manufactured by Shimizu Jikken Zairyo) which is an antigen provoking the reaction of the delayed type hypersensitivity was washed three times with a physiological saline solution (manufactured by Otsuka Pharmaceutical) to make 110 9 cells/ml and 200 l of it was intraperitoneally injected to mice to subject to an antigen sensitization. After five days from the sensitization, 40 l of antigen which was prepared by the same manner was injected to right paw to induce an antigen whereby pedal edema was provoked. From the antigen-sensitized date, cyclopentenone was intraperitoneally administered to mice (one group consisting of five mice) once daily at the dose of 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg for three days. After two days from the antigen induction, volume of right paw of the mice was measured by a measuring device for pedal edema (manufactured by Ugo Basile) and used as an index for DTH. The measured value was given by calculating the increasing rate from the right paw volume of the mice measured before the antigen induction. The result is shown in FIG. 1 . Thus, FIG. 1 shows the an inhibition activity of the cyclopentenone to reaction of the delayed type hypersensitivity where the ordinate indicates an increasing rate (%) while the abscissa indicates a dose of the cyclopentenone (mg/kg). Incidentally, ** in the drawing means that it is significant to the control in p0.01. Administration of 1 mg/kg of the cyclopentenone suppressed the reaction of the delayed type hypersensitivity and administration of 10 mg/kg showed a significant inhibition activity to reaction of the delayed type hypersensitivity. Incidentally, ()-cyclopentenone and ()-cyclopentenone showed similar effects as well. Example 3 Injection Preparations. (1) Cyclopentenone was added to a physiological saline solution (as listed in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia) in a concentration of 1% to prepare an injection preparation. (2) ()-Cyclopentenone and glycyrrhizic acid were added to a physiological saline solution (the same as above) in concentrations of 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively, to prepare an injection preparation. Example 4 Tablets. (1) A tablet containing 100 mg of cyclopentenone and an appropriate amount of microcrystalline cellulose was prepared and coated with sugar to manufacture a tablet preparation. (2) A tablet containing 0.1 mg of ()-cyclopentenone, 10 mg of dipotassium glycyrrhizinate and an appropriate amount of microcrystalline cellulose was prepared and coated with sugar to manufacture a tablet preparation. MERIT OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, an antiallergic agent containing at least one compound selected from the cyclopentenone or optically active substances thereof or salts thereof having an inhibition activity of IgE production and an inhibition activity of delayed type hypersensitivity as an effective component is offered. Because of the inhibition activity of IgE production and the inhibition activity of delayed type hypersensitivity of the cyclopentenone or optically active substance or salt thereof, when food or beverage containing such a compound is taken, the IgE production is inhibited and reaction of the delayed type hypersensitivity is inhibited whereupon such a food or beverage is an antiallergic food or antiallergic beverage which is quite useful for improvement of symptoms of the diseases mediated by the IgE production and worsened by production of said factor such as bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, allergic conjunctivitis, urticaria, anaphylactic shock, contact hypersensitivity, etc. and for prevention of said diseases as well. It is also useful for the therapy and prevention of the diseases accompanied by the delayed type hypersensitivity such as contact hypersensitivity, allergic contact dermatitis, bacterial allergy, fungal allergy, viral allergy, drug allergy, thyroiditis, allergic encephalitis, etc. Furthermore, the method of the present invention is highly useful for the inhibition of allergy such as controlling the amount of IgE production.

This application is the national stage of PCT/JP98/03560, filed Sep. 11/1998, now WO99/08987. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a cyclohexenone long-chain alcohol having excellent neurite growth stimulating effects which is useful as preventive and/or therapeutic for cerebral diseases typified by dementia, and also as a medicament containing the same. BACKGROUND ART OF THE INVENTION Nerve growth factors (which will hereinafter be abbreviated as NGFs), many of which exist primarily in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, are neurotrophic factors which stimulate differentiation or growth of neurocytes and are therefore essential for maintenance of function and survival. They act on catecholamine activating neurons in the peripheral nervous system, as well as on cholinergic neurons in the brain. Alzheimers disease is thought to have, as its main lesion, degeneration and defluxion of cholinergic neurons. Therefore there has been an attempt to administer NGFs into the brain for the treatment of Alzheimers disease. NGFs, however, cannot pass through the blood-brain barrier because they are proteins having molecular weights as high as 12,000. Therefore such treatment has not proven practical as a therepeutic method for humans. If there existed a low-molecular-weight compound which exhibited NGF-like effects and could pass through the blood-brain barrier or a compound capable of enhancing NGF synthesis in the brain, such a compound would likely be therapeutically useful for treating Alzheimers disease. Based on this idea, substances exhibiting NGF-like effects have been sought. As a result, it has been shown that long-chain alcohols such as n-hexacosanol induce in vitro production of NGFs in gliacytes, thereby promoting neurite growth. In addition they can pass through the blood-brain barrier in vivo (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. HEI 4-502167). Effects of n-hexacosanol, however, have not been satisfactory yet. An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a medicament comprising a compound which can be orally administered, which readily transfers into the brain, and which permits neurite growth in the brain even at low concentrations compared with those of the above-described long-chain alcohols such as n-hexacosanol. DISCLOSURE OF THE PRESENT INVENTION Focusing on the skeletal structure of cyclohexenone, the present inventors synthesized a number of cyclohexane derivatives. As a result, it has been found that a cyclohexenone long-chain alcohol represented by the below-described formula (1) is useful as a medicament for the prevention and treatment of cerebral diseases such as dementia because it has excellent neurite growth promoting effects even at lower concentrations compared with those of n-hexacosanol and has the effect of acting directly on the neurite, thereby stimulating neurite growth without inducing NGF production in gliacytes, leading to the completion of the present invention. In one aspect of the present invention, there is thus provided a cyclohexenone long-chain alcohol represented by the following formula (1): wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 each independently represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group and X represents a C 10-18 alkylene or alkenylene group. In another aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a medicament comprising as an effective ingredient the compound represented by the formula (1). In a further aspect of the present invention, there is also provided a neurite growth stimulating agent comprising the compound represented by the formula (1) as an effective ingredient. In a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound represented by the formula (1) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided use of the compound represented by the formula (1) as a medicament. In a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for the treatment of dementia comprising administering to a patient an effective amount of the compound represented by the formula (1). BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION In the formula (1), among the C 10-18 alkylene and alkenylene groups represented by X, preferred are C 10-18 alkylene groups, with C 10-16 alkylene groups being more preferred. For the alkylene or alkenylene group, either linear or branched one can be employed, with the linear one being more preferred. R 1 , R 2 and R 3 each independently represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, with the case where at least one of them represents a methyl group being more preferred. The compound of the present invention may exist in the form of a hydrate. The compound of the present invention has various isomers and these isomers are also embraced by the present invention. The compound (1) of the present invention can be prepared, for example, in accordance with the following reaction processes A or B. Process A wherein R 1a , R 2a and R 3a each independently represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, with the proviso that at least one of them represents a methyl group, Ph represents a phenyl group and R1, R2 and R3 have the same meanings as defined above. Described specifically, the invention compound (1) can be obtained by reacting cyclohexenone (2) or methyl-substituted-2-cyclohexen-1-one (3) with a benzenesulfinic acid salt in the presence of an acid to obtain Compound (4), reacting the resulting Compound (4) with ethylene glycol to obtain its ketal derivative (5), reacting the resulting derivative (5) with a -halogenoalkanol or -halogenoalkenol to obtain Compound (6), followed by subjecting Compound (6) to an acid treatment to eliminate the protective group. The methyl-substituted-2-cyclohexen-1-one (3) used here as a raw material is available by reacting methyl-substituted cyclohexanone with a trialkylsilyl halide in the presence of butyl lithium, followed by oxidation in the presence of a palladium catalyst. In the above reaction, the reaction between cyclohexanone (2) or methyl-substituted-2-cyclohexen-1-one (3) and a benzenesulfinic acid salt, for example, benzenesulfinic acid sodium is preferably effected in the presence of an acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid at 0 to 100 C. for 5 to 40 hours. The reaction between Compound (4) and ethylene glycol is preferably carried out in the presence of a condensing agent such as paratoluenesulfonic anhydride at 50 to 120 C. for 1 to 10 hours. As a -halogenoalkanol to be reacted with the ketal derivative (5), a -bromoalkanol is preferred. It is desirable that the reaction between the ketal derivative (5) and a -bromoalkanol be carried out in the presence of a metal compound such as butyl lithium under low-temperature conditions. The elimination of the phenylsulfonyl and ketal-protective groups from Compound (6) is preferably effected by reacting Compound (6) with an acid such as paratoluenesulfonic acid. Process B wherein X1 represents C 9-17 alkylene group or C 9-17 alkenylene group, Ac represents an acyl group, R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and Ph have the same meanings as defined above. Described specifically, compound (7) (obtained, for instance, through the method described in Synthesis, 1996, November) is reacted with -bromoalcohol to obtain compound (9), subsequently the phenylsulphonyl group of the resulting compound being eliminated to give compound (10), followed by protection of the hydroxy group of compound (10) to yield compound (11). The resulting compound is subsequently oxidized to obtain compound (12), and the hydroxy-protective group of the resulting compound is then eliminated to obtain compound (12). The reaction between compound (7) and compound (8) is preferably carried out at low temperatures in the presence of a metal compound such as butyl lithium. The elimination of the phenylsulphonyl group from compound (9) may be conducted by reacting the compound and a phosphate in the presence of sodium amalgam. As a hydroxy-protective group of compound (10), the acetyl group is preferred, the protection reaction being preferably performed, for example, by reacting compound (10) and acetic anhydride. The oxidation reaction of compound (11) may preferably be performed by reacting the compound and an alkyl hydroperoxide such as t-butyl hydroperoxide in the presence of a metal compound such as ruthenium trichloride. The elimination reaction of the protective group of compound (12) is preferably performed by hydrolyzing the compound in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate. Since the invention compound (1) so obtained has excellent neurite growth stimulating effects and is capable of passing through the blood-brain barrier owing to its low molecular weight, it is useful as a preventive and/or therapeutic for diseases caused by neural degeneration and defluxion, for example, dementia typified by Alzheimers disease.

The compounds are useful for treating uPA- or uPAR-mediated disorders, e.g., tumor metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, restenosis, chronic inflammation, or corneal angiogenesis. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to compounds that inhibit the interaction of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) with urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and methods for using such compounds to treat uPA or uPAR mediated disorders, e.g., cancer. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Urokinase-tpe plasminogen activator (uPA) is a multidomain serine protease, having a catalytic B chain (amino acids 144-411), and an amino-terminal fragment (ATF, aa 1-143) consisting of a growth factor-like domain (4-43) and a kringle (aa 47-135). The uPA kringle appears to bind heparin, but not fibrin, lysine, or aminohexanoic acid. The growth factor-like domain bears some similarity to the structure of epidermal growth factor (EGF), and is thus also referred to as an EGF-like domain. The single chain pro-uPA is activated by plasmin or other proteases, cleaving the chain into the two-chain active form, which is linked together by a disulfide bond. uPA binds to its specific cell surface receptor (uPAR). The binding interaction is apparently mediated by the EGF-like domain (S. A. Rabbani et al., J Biol Chem (1992) 267:14151-56). Cleavage of pro-uPA into active uPA is accelerated when pro-uPA and plasminogen are receptor-bound. Thus, plasmin activates pro-uPA, which in turn activates more plasmin by cleaving plasminogen. This positive feedback cycle is apparently limited to the receptor-based proteolysis on the cell surface, since a large excess of protease inhibitors is found in plasma, including 2 antiplasmin, and PAI-1. Plasmin can activate or degrade extracellular proteins such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, and zymogens, particularly of the matrix metalloproteinases. Plasminogen activators thus can regulate extracellular proteolysis, fibrin clot lysis, tissue remodeling, developmental cell migration, inflammation, and metastasis. Accordingly, there is great interest in developing uPA inhibitors and uPA receptor antagonists. E. Appella et al., J Biol Chem (1987) 262:4437-40, determined that receptor binding activity is localized in the EGF-like domain, and that residues 12-32 appear to be critical for binding. The critical domain alone (uPA, 12-32 ) bound uPAR with an affinity of 40 nM (about 100 fold less than intact ATF). Recent studies have shown that the invasiveness of human tumor cell lines in vitro correlates with surface bound urokinase, and that urokinase production itself is an independent prognostic indicator in human breast cancer (W. Schlechte et al., Cancer Comm ( 1990) 2:173-79; H. Kobayashi et al., Br J Cancer ( 1993) 67:537-44; J. A. Foekens et al., Cancer Res (1992) 52:6101-05). It has also been shown in both breast and colon cancer that urokinase is often made by stromal cells (fibroblasts and macrophages), whereas the urokinase receptor is found on tumor cells (C. Pyke et al., Cancer Res (1993) 53:1911-15; C. Pyke et al., Am J Path (1991) 138:1059-67). uPAR has independently been identified as a monocyte activation antigen, Mo3, whose expression is induced in these inflammatory cells upon activation (H. Y. Min et al., J Immunol (1992) 148:3636-42), as well as an activation antigen on human T lymphocytes (A. Nykjaer et al., J Immunol (1994) 152:505-16). Urokinase plasminogen activator knockout mice (in which the uPA gene is inactivated or deleted throughout the body) have been developed, and their macrophages are deficient in extracellular matrix degradation in vitro (P. Carmeliet et al., Fibrinolysis (1993) 7 Suppl. 1:27-28). In addition, these mice show greatly reduced smooth muscle cell migration/proliferation after arterial wounding, suggesting a possible role for uPA/uPAR in post-angioplasty restenosis. The induction of urokinase and its receptor by agents known to be angiogenic in vivo, such as bFGF, vEGF, and TNF, suggests a role for cell surface urokinase in angiogenesis (P. Mignatti et al., J Cell Biol (1991) 113:1193-202; L. E. Odekon et al., J Cell Physiol (1992) 150:258-63; M. J. Niedbala et al., Blood (1992) 79:678-87). Although many factors are likely to be angiogenic in pathological conditions, degradation of extracellular matrix by capillary endothelial cells and release of matrix-bound pro-angiogenic factors by cell surface plasmin is likely a common step in these processes (D. Weinstat-Saslo et al., FASEB J (1994) 8:401-07). This is further supported by the observation that several known anti-angiogenic substances reduce uPA expression (S. Tankano et al., Cancer Res (1994) 54:2654-60). In vivo studies have shown that prevention of urokinase-receptor binding, by urokinase antibodies or competition with inactive urokinase mutants, dramatically reduces or eliminates the metastatic potential of human prostate tumor cells in nude mice (C. W. Crowley et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (1993) 90:5021-25; L. Ossowski et al., Cell (1983) 35:611-19; L. Ossowski, J Cell Biol (1988) 107:2437-45). It has recently been shown in both in vitro and syngeneic in vivo models that the protein uPAR antagonists are anti-angiogenic (Min et al., Cancer Res (1996) 56:2428). Although a primary role of uPAR is in the focusing of uPA dependent plasmninogen activation to the cell surface, it also has other functions. For instance, uPAR is involved in cell adhesion, functioning as a uPA dependent vitronectin receptor (Wei et al., J Biol Chem (1994) 269:32380-88). More recently, it has been shown that uPAR interacts with integrins and is likely involved in cell shape changes and cell migration (Kindzelskii et al., J Immunol (1996) 156:297). Two small molecules have been described which inhibit the uPA:uPAR interaction (suramin: N. Behrendt et al., J Biol Chem (1993) 68:5985-89; and 8-anilinonaphthalene sulfonic acid: M. Ploug et al., Biochemistry (1994) 33:8991-97). Other compounds for inhibiting the uPA:uPAR interaction are described in International Publication No. WO 96/40747, published Dec. 19, 1996. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have invented novel compounds having a high affinity for uPAR, thereby inhibiting the uPA:uPAR interaction, making them useful for treating disorders or diseases mediated by uPA and/or uPAR. The compounds of our invention have the formula wherein n is 0 or 1; R is NH 2 or wherein R 1 and R 2 are independently selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl, aralkyl, heteroaralkyl, carboxy, carboxyalkyl, and carbamoyl; wherein R 5 is selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl, aral:yl, heteroaralkyl, and carbamoylalkyl, and R 3 and R 4 are selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl, alkoxy, arylalkoxy, aralkyl, heteroaralkyl, and carbamoylalkyl; the Q-NH(CH 2 ) n and the C(O)R substituents of the compound of formula I are independently positioned ortho, meta, or para relative to the carbon atoms that form the bond between the two phenyl groups to which said substituents are bound, with the proviso that said substituents are not both positioned ortho; and the Q-NH(CH 2 ) n and the C(O)R substituents of the compound of formula II are positioned meta or para to each other; or a biolabile ester thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

As used herein, the depiction of a bond on the right side of one of the abbreviations for the foregoing amino acids represents a bond to the carboxyl-terminal carbonyl atom of the amino acid and a bond on the left side of one of the abbreviations for the foregoing amino acids represents a bond to the nitrogen atom of the amino-terminal portion of the amino acid. For example, Fmoc refers to 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl. The term biolablile ester means a pharmaceutically acceptable, biologically degradable ester derivative of a compound of formula (I) or (II), that is a prodrug which, upon administration to a animal or human being, is converted in the body to a compound of formula (I) or (II). The term uPA -or uPARmediated disorder refers to a disease state or malady which is caused or exacerbated by a biological activity of uPA or uPAR. The primary biological activity exhibited is plasminogen activation. Disorders mediated by plasminogen activation include, without limitation, inappropriate angiogenesis (e.g., diabetic retinopathy, corneal angiogenesis, Kaposis sarcoma, and the like), metastasis and invasion by tumor cells, and chronic inflammation (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, and the like). Fucosylated ATF is also mnitogenic for some tumor cells (e.g., SaOS-2 osterosarcoma cells), which sometimes self-activate in an autocrine mechanism. Accordingly, the uPAR antagonist of the invention is effective in inhibiting the proliferation of uPAactivated tumor cells. The term effective amount refers to an amount of uPAR antagonist compound sufficient to exhibit a detectable therapeutic effect. The therapeutic effect may include, for example, without limitation, inhibiting the growth of undesired tissue or malignant cells, inhibiting inappropriate angiogenesis, limiting tissue damage caused by chronic inflammation, and the like. The precise effective amount for a subject will depend upon the subjects size and health, the nature and severity of the condition to be treated, and the like. The effective amount for a given situation can be determined by routine experimentation based on the information provided herein. The following abbreviations are used for the solvents and reagents discussed herein: ethanol (EtOH); methanol (MeOH); acetic acid (AcOH); ethyl acetate (EtOAc); 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU); 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt); bromo-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBroP); N,N-dimethylformarmide (DMF); trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI); and diisopropylamine (DIPEA). In addition, Ph represents a phenyl group; tBu represents a C(CH 3 ) 3 group; and OtBu represents an OC(CH 3 ) 3 group. The compounds of the invention have asymmetric carbon atoms, and therefore, al. isomers, including enantiomers and diastereomers are within the scope of this invention. The invention includes d and l isomers in both pure form and in admixture, including racemic mixtures. Isomers can be prepared using conventional techniques, either by reacting chiral starting materials, or by separating isomers of compounds of formula (I) or (II). Certain compounds of the present invention will be acidic in nature (e.g., those which have a carboxyl or phenolic hydroxyl group). These compounds form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with inorganic and organic bases. The salt may be prepared by treating a solution of the compound with the appropriate base. Non-limitative examples of such salts are sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, gold and silver salts, and salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable amines such as ammonia, alkyl amines, hydroxyalkylamines, N-methylglucamine and the like. It may be desirable when providing the compounds of the invention for oral administration to use the compounds of formula (I) or (II) in the form of a biolabile ester. The suitability of any particular ester-forming group can be assessed by conventional in vivo animal or in vitro enzyme hydrolysis studies. Thus, desirably, for optimum effect, the ester should only be hydrolysed after absorption is complete. Accordingly, the ester should be resistant to premature hydrolysis by digestive enzymes before absorption, but should be productively hydrolysed by, for example, gutwall, plasma or liver enzymes. In this way, the active acid is released into the bloodstream following oral absorption of the prodrug. Suitable biolabile esters may include alkyl, alkanoyloxyalkyl, cycloalkanoyloxyalkyl, aroyloxyalkyl and alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl esters, including cycloalkyl and aryl substituted derivatives thereof, aryl esters and cycloalkyl esters, wherein said alkyl, alkanoyl or alkoxy groups may contain from 1 to 8 carbon atoms and be branched-chain or straight-chain, said cycloalkyl groups may contain from 3-7 carbon atoms and said cycloalkanoyl groups from 4-8 carbon atoms wherein both are optionally benzo-fused, and said aryl and aroyl groups include substituted phenyl, naphthyl or indanyl ring systems. Preferably, the biolabile esters of the invention are C 1 -C 4 alkyl esters. More preferably, they are methyl, ethyl and t-butyl esters. Biolabile esters may be obtained from the acids of formula (I) or (II) by standard reactions well known to persons skilled in the art. For example, aryl and alkyl esters can be synthesized via activation of a carboxylic acid group of (I) in a variety of ways, such as by forming the acyl chloride, followed by reaction with the required phenol or alcohol. Alternatively, alkyl esters are obtainable by alkylation of a suitable alkali, or alkaline earth, metal carboxylate salt of a compound of formula (I) or (II). The compounds of formula (I) may be prepared according to the following reaction scheme (Scheme I): In Scheme I, which depicts a solid phase preparation, compound 3, wherein n is 0 or 1, is reacted with compound 4 and a coupling agent, e.g., HBTU/HOBt or PyBroP to form the amide compound 5. This reaction may be carried out in a suitable organic solvent, e.g., CH 2 Cl 2 or DMF at temperatures of 0 to 80 C., with ambient temperature preferred. Resin 4 is a material having a ligand portion, wherein R 2 is as previously defined for formula (I) above, bound to a resin, preferably a cross-linked polystyrene or a polyethylene glycol/polystyrene copolymer, through a cleavable linker, L, preferably an acid labile linker such as those used in SASRIN resin or in Wang resin. Other resins which may be used include, e.g., chlorotrityl resin and Rink Amide MBHA resin (where R 1 is carbamoyl). The aminoacid portion of 4 is attached to the linker by methods well known in the art, depending on the specific linker used. Generally, the amino group is protected in Fmoc form. The Fmoc-group of amide compound 5 is then removed by conventional means, e.g., by treating with piperdine in DMF at 0 to 80 C., followed by acylation with Fmoc-NHCHR 5 COOH wherein R 5 is as previously defined for formula (I) above, to produce amide compound 6. The acylation is carried out employing the coupling reagents and reaction conditions described above. The FmocNHCHR 5 COOH compounds used in the acylation are either commercially available or preparable by known methods. The Fmoc-group of amide compound 6 is removed, followed by acylation with R 4 COOH, wherein R 4 is as previously defined for formula (I) above, to produce compound 7, using the same Fmoc-removal and acylation methods used to make compound 6. Alternatively, equivalent reagents R 4 COCl and R 4 CO 2 O may be employed instead of R 4 COOH, with the reaction conducted in CH 2 Cl 2 or DMF at 0 to 80 C., in the presence of a tertiary amine, e.g., DIPEA. Compound 8 is formed by cleavage from the linker and the resin portion of compound 7 by conventional means, e.g., by treating with dilute TFA in CH 2 Cl 2 at ambient temperature for 10 to 60 minutes. When it is desired to make compounds of formula (I) wherein Q is R 3 C(O), the Fmoc-group of amide compound 5 can be removed, followed by acylation with R 3 COOH under the same conditions described above, and the resulting compound may be cleaved from the resin under the same conditions described above to produce the desired compound. Scheme II depicts preparation of compounds wherein R is NH2 or R 1 and R 2 are H, alkyl, or aralkyl. In1 this scheme, attachment of 3 to the resin and linker provides resin 9. Subsequent steps as in Scheme I provide 11. When Rink amide linker is employed, cleavage of 11, typically with dilute TFA, affords amide 12. When a non-amide linker is present in 11, cleavage from the resin furnishes acid 13. Acid 13 may be converted to amide 12 by treatment with ammonia in the presence of an activating agent such as ethyl chloroformate. Alternatively, 13 may he converted to substituted amides 14 by treatment with a primary or secondary amine and a coupling agent such as EDCI. Starting compound 3 may be prepared according to several different methods, which are shown below (as reaction schemes for preparation of starting compounds 3a, 3b, and 3c ). For the preparation of starting compound 3a, nitration of compound 20 with fuming nitric acid at 0 C. produces compound 21, which upon catalytic hydrogenation with PtO 2 in aqueous methanolic NaOH yields compound 22. The Fmoc group is introduced typically with Fmoc-chloride or Fmoc-hydroxysuccinimide ester in basic semi-aqueous medium, preferably in aqueous dioxane at 0 to 25 C. Where desired, a transient silyl ester may be employed for this step. In a second method, shown below, Pd-mediated coupling between 23 and 24 yields biphenyl ester 25. Preferably, this reaction is carried out with a Pd(P(Ph) 3 ) 4 catalyst in a toluene/aqueous Na 2 CO 3 system at reflux. Saponification of compound 25, preferably with, alkali in aqueous methanol at 0 to 50 C., and reduction, preferably with Pd/C in aqueous. alkali, yield amino-acid 26, which may be converted as above to yield compound 3b. When n1, compound 3c may be prepared by the following method, shown below. Compounds 27 and 28 are coupled in a Pd-mediated reaction as above to yield compound 29. Compound 29 is reacted with N-bromosuccinimide in CCl 4 at reflux to yield bromide 30, which is converted to ester 31 by reaction with NaN 3 in DMF at ambient temperature, followed by hydrogenation with Pd/C in ethanol. Conversion of the ester 31 to Fmoc-acid 3c is cared out as described above. As an alternative to Scheme I, compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by a solution synthesis as shown in Scheme III, below: In Scheme III, compound 3, wherein n is 0 or 1 is reacted with compound 32 (wherein R 2 is as previously defined above, and R 7 is a removable protective group, e.g., t-butyl) and a coupling agent as described in Scheme I to form amide compound 33. Amide compound 33 is subjected to the same Fmoc removal/acylation steps as described in Scheme I above to produce compound 35. The protective group R 7 is then removed by conventional means to yield the desired compound 36. For example, t-butyl may be removed by TFA or by HCl/dioxane. The compounds of the invention having formula (II) can be made according to Schemes I, II and III above by using the following compounds in place of compound 3 in Schemes I, II and III: wherein n is 0 or 1. These starting compounds are known materials. Those skilled in the art will recognize that reactive groups in the foregoing reaction schemes (e.g., carboxyl, amino, hydroxy) may be protected if desired or necessary with conventional protecting groups that can be subsequently removed by standard procedures. See, e.g., McOmie, Protecting groups In Organic Chemistry, Plenum Press, New York, 1973, and Greene and Wuts, Protecting Groups In Organic Synthesis, 2nd Ed., John Wiley Sons, New York 1991. For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. The powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 70 percent active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are known in the art, e.g. magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed homogeneously therein as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby solidify. Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection. Liquid form preparations may also include solutions for intranasal administration. Opthalmic preparations may be formulated using commercially available vehicles such as Sorbi-care (Allergan) or Neodecadron (Merck, Sharp Dohme). Aerosol preparations suitable for inhalation may include solutions and solids in powder form, which may be in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as an inert compressed gas. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. The compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal compositions can take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose. Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose. The quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from 0.01 mg to 1000 mg, more preferably from 0.1 mg to 200 mg, most preferably from 5 mg to 100 mg, according to the particular application. The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. The amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of the invention will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the symptoms being treated. A typical recommended dosage regimen is oral administration of from 0.02 mg to 4,000 mg/day, preferably 0.2 mg to 800 mg/day, most preferably 10 mg to 400 mg/day in two to four divided doses to block tumor growth. The following examples illustrate the foregoing invention, although such examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. Alternative mechanistic pathways and analagous structures within the scope of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

The following assay procedure, which is a cell-based, competition radioligand binding assay, was carried out to determine the activity of the foregoing compounds as uPAR antagonists. Radioligand Preparation. The minimal receptor-binding sequence of uPA was determined by Apella et al., J. Biol. Chem. 262:4437-4440 (1987), utilizing non-radioactive peptides as competition for a larger uPA radioligand. Our assay was developed and characterized using an iodinated version of the minimal receptor binding sequence of human uPA (residues 12-32, Ala 19 ). The 21-amino acid peptide (cyclized), referred to herein as c-ATFp, was synthesized and iodinated as follows: 10 ug of c-ATFp was iodinated with 1 mCi Na 125 I, using the Chloramine-T method (Iodo-Beads, Pierce Chemical Co.); iodinated peptide was separated from unincorporated iodine with Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Millipore), and the C18-bound peptide was eluted with acetonitrile. This procedure routinely yielded a radioiodinated c-ATFp (c- 125 I-Tyr 24 -ATFp) with specific activity of 105 Ci/mmol: Determination of Radioligand Binding. DU-145, a human prostate cancer cell line, was selected for radioligand binding assays because these cells express high levels of unoccupied uPA receptors (approximately 500,000 receptors/cell). Subconfluent, 2 day cultures of DU-145 cells were prepared for radioligand binding assays by harvesting monolayers with trypsin/EDTA. The cells were washed one time with serum-free Dulbeccos Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), and suspended at a cell density of 250,000 cells/ml in ice-cold DME containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Test compounds were solubilized in DMSO at 2 mg/ml and subsequently diluted in phosphate buffered saline to prepare stock concentrations of 200 ug/ml, 20 ug/ml, 2 ug/ml, 0.2 ug/ml, and 0.02 ug/ml. The binding reactions were initiated by addition of 1.0 ml cell suspension to microcentrifuge tubes containing 10 ul of: the indicated test compound solutions, or appropriately diluted DMSO controls, and c- 25 -Tyr 24 -ATFp, such that the final concentration of radioligand was 3 nM (1.5 Kd). To control for specific binding, parallel reaction tubes were prepared containing 1,000-fold excess unlabeled c-ATFp. Reaction tubes were incubated with rocking at 4 C. for 90 min. Binding was terminated by 4 C. centrifugation at 800 g for 1 min in a refrigerated microcentrifuge. Unbound radioligand was removed by aspirating the reaction medium, adding fresh, ice-cold DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin to the pelleted cells, and then quickly re-centrifuging and aspirating the wash from the cell pellet. The washing steps were completed in 2-4 minutes by this method, depending on the number of tubes in each experiment. Tips of microcentrifuge tubes containing the cell pellets were snipped and transferred to counting tubes. Radioactivity bound to the cells was determined in a gamma counter. Specific binding of the radioligand was calculated as the difference between the amount of c- 125 I-Tyr 24 -ATFp bound in the absence (total binding) and presence (non-specific binding) of the unlabeled c-ATFp. The efficacy of test compounds for inhibiting specific binding of c- 125 I-Tyr 24 -ATFp was determined by plotting a graph of specific binding (y-axis) as a function of test compound concentration (x-axis). The concentration of test compound required to inhibit 50% of the specific binding (lC 50 ) was determined from the plot. The IC 50 may be directly converted mathematically to Ki, which is a measure of the receptor binding affinity of the compounds under the defined assay conditions. Test compounds were evaluated in duplicate tubes, in 2-3 independent binding experiments. The uPAr IC 50 values determined by the foregoing assay for the compounds identified in the preceding examples are summarized in the table below.

The present invention relates to a solid phase reaction component, and to a process for the use of such a component in the synthesis of individual hydroxamic acid derivatives or a combinatorial library of such compounds. In particular, the solid phase reaction component may be used for the synthesis of hydroxamic acids that are inhibitors of zinc metalloproteinase enzymes. Such enzymes are involved in tissue degradation and the release of tumour necrosis factor from cells. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION Solid Phase Synthesis Solid phase synthesis is an established and effective method for the preparation of peptides, and offers advantages over conventional solution phase chemistry in terms of purification and simplicity (Atherton E, Sheppard R C, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach; IRL Press at Oxford University Press: Oxford, 1989). Solid phase synthesis may also be used for the preparation of non-peptide molecules (Leznoff C C, Acc. Chem. Res., 1978, 11, 327-333) and recently there has been considerable interest in the application of this methodology to the synthesis of combinatorial libraries for biologically active lead compound optimisation and discovery (Moos W H et al., Annu. Rep. Med. Chem., 1993, 28, 315-324). Solid phase synthesis requires an appropriate solid substrate which carries a plurality of functional groups to which the first reactive entity in the proposed synthesis may be covalently coupled, and from which the desired molecule may be cleaved after assembly. The solid substrate should be compatible with the solvents and reaction conditions that are to be used in the peptide or non-peptide synthesis. The final step in solid phase synthesis is the cleavage of the covalent bond between the desired peptide or non-peptide molecule and the linker. It is desirable that the conditions for the cleavage are orthogonal to those used during the reactions employed for the synthesis of the peptide or non-peptide on the solid support such that inadvertent cleavage does not occur during the synthesis. Furthermore, the conditions for cleavage should be relatively mild such that they do not result in degradation of the desired peptide or non-peptide. Solid substrates which present hydroxyl groups as the points of attachment for the first stage of the synthesis are commonly used, for example substrates which present hydroxyl groups as derivatives of benzyl alcohol, the peptide or non-peptide being attached as a benzyl ester and cleaved by hydrolysis, transesterification or aminolysis to release the peptide or non-peptide as a carboxylic acid, carboxylate ester or as a carboxamide. Also used are substrates which present amino groups, for example as derivatives of diphenylmethylamine, the peptide or non-peptide being attached as a carboxamide and cleaved by hydrolysis to release the peptide or non-peptide as a carboxamide. Substitution of such linkers by a nitro group can enable the photolytic cleavage of the peptides or non-peptides from the residue of the solid substrate. Hydroxamic Acid Derivatives Certain hydroxamic acid derivatives possess useful biological activities. Examples of such hydroxamic acids include compounds that inhibit urease (Odake S et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 1992, 40, 2764-2768), trypanosome glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase (Grady et al.. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol., 1986, 19, 231-240), dehydropeptidase-1 (EP-B-276,947), ribonucleotide reductase (Farr R A et al., J. Med. Chem., 1989, 32. 1879-1885), 5-lipoxygenase (Kerdesky F A J et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1985, 26, 2134-2146; U.S. Pat. No. 4,731,382), substance P degradation (Laufer R et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 1985, 150, 135-140), cardiovascular metalloproteinase enzymes (Turbanti L et al., J. Med. Chem., 1993. 36, 699-707; WO-9428012) and matrix metalloproteinase enzymes (Schwartz M A. Van Wart H E, Prog. Med. Chem., 1992, 29, 271-334). Compounds which have the property of inhibiting the action of metalloproteinases involved in connective tissue breakdown such as collagenase, stromelysin and gelatinase (known as matrix metalloproteinases, and herein referred to as MMPs) are thought to be potentially useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of conditions involving such tissue breakdown, for example rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteopenias such as osteoporosis, periodontitis, gingivitis, corneal, epidermal or gastric ulceration, and tumour metastasis, invasion and growth. It has been found that hydroxamic acid MMP inhibitors can also inhibit the production of the cytokine tumour necrosis factor (herein referred to as TNF) (Mohler et al., Nature, 1994, 370, 218-220; Gearing A J H et al., Nature 1994, 370. 555-557; McGeehan G M et al., Nature 1994, 370, 558-561). Compounds which inhibit the production or action of TNF are thought to be potentially useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of many inflammatory, infectious, immunological or malignant diseases. These include, but are not restricted to, septic shock, haemodynamic shock and sepsis syndrome, post ischaemic reperfusion injury, malaria, Crohns disease, mycobacterial infection, meningitis, psoriasis, congestive heart failure, fibrotic disease, cachexia, graft rejection, cancer, autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, radiation damage, toxicity following administration of immunosuppressive monoclonal antibodies such as OKT3 or CAMPATH-1 and hyperoxic alveolar injury. Since excessive TNF production has been noted in several diseases or conditions also characterised by MMP-mediated tissue degradation, compounds which inhibit both MMPs and TNF production may have particular advantages in the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases or conditions in which both mechanisms are involved. Classes of MMP Inhibitors The known hydroxamic acid MMP inhibitors may be grouped into three classes; i) peptidyl hydroxamates, ii) succinyl hydroxamates and iii) arylsulfonamido hydroxamates. i) The following patent publication discloses peptidyl hydroxamic acid-based MMP inhibitors: EP-A-345359 (Fuji) The tri- and tetra-peptidyl hydroxamic acid derivatives disclosed in the above publication and described elsewhere (Odake S et al., Chem.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A key step in the synthesis of many hydroxamic acid derivatives is the reaction of a carboxylic acid group with hydroxylamine or a protected hydroxylamine by first activating the carboxylic acid or by conducting the reaction in the presence of an activating agent. In a recent patent application the possibility that peptidyl hydroxamic acids might be prepared using solid phase synthesis was recognised (WO 94/28012). However, the proposed protocol involved first synthesis of the peptide on a solid support followed by cleavage from the support and subsequent conversion of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group to a hydroxamic acid by a method analogous to that indicated above. It was the hypothesis of the present inventors that hydroxamic acid derivatives might be prepared by the reaction of a solid substrate presenting hydroxylamine groups as the point of attachment for the first reactive entity of the synthesis, then reacting the resultant solid phase intermediate with the further reactive entities required for the desired synthesis, followed by a cleavage step to release the final hydroxamic acid derivative. Such a hydroxylamine-presenting solid phase reaction component could simplify the synthesis and purification of biologically active hydroxamic acid derivatives, for example MMP inhibitors of the three classes referred to above, and could be applicable to the automation of such syntheses. In addition it would enable the solid phase synthesis of combinatorial libraries of hydroxamic acids. Thus, this invention makes available such hydroxylamine-presenting solid phase reaction components, and provides a process for their use in solid phase synthesis of hydroxamic acid derivatives. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides, in one of its aspects, a solid phase reaction component comprising a solid substrate, substantially insoluble in aqueous or organic reaction media, carrying a plurality of covalently bound hydroxylamine or protected hydroxylamine groups of formula (A) or (B) wherein P 1 is hydrogen or an amino protecting group and P 2 is hydrogen or a hydroxyl protecting group, and the bond designated (a) is one which covalently links the group (A) or (B) to the residue of the solid substrate and is cleavable under acid conditions or by photolysis. The bond designated (a) covalently links the group (A) or (B) to the residue of the solid substrate. The residue of the solid substrate will usually comprise a base substrate carrying suitable linker groups which indirectly link the hydroxylamine group (A) or (B) to the base substrate. Suitable base substrates include those known in the art of solid phase peptide synthesis (see for example those described in Stewart J M and Young J D, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 2nd Ed: Pierce Chemical Company: Rockford, Ill., 1984). They include inorganic substrates, for example kieselguhr, silica gel and controlled pore glass, and polymeric organic substrates, for example polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene glycol, polyacrylamide, cellulose, as well as composite inorganic/polymeric substrates such as polyacrylamide supported within a matrix of kieselguhr particles. Such known base substrates include amino and hydroxy functionalised solid substrates. ie those which are chemically modified by introduction of amino or hydroxyl groups, to serve as convenient points for further chemical manipulation. Examples of particular amino or hydroxy functionalised base substrates are: hydroxymethyl copoly(styrene-1 or 2% divinylbenzene), which can be represented as wherein P represents the polymer backbone; benzhydrylamine copoly(styrene1 or 2% divinylbenzene) (BHA Resin) or methyl benzhydrylamine copoly(styrene-1 or 2% divinylbenzene) (MBHA Resin), which can be represented as wherein P represents the polymer backbone and R is hydrogen or methyl respectively; polyethylene glycol polystyrene (PEG-PS); poly(dimethylacrylamide)polystyrene composite (Polyhipe); polyacrylamide Kieselguhr composite (Macrosorb); or functionalised controlled pore glass. Thus, in the case of peptide synthesis, hydroxyl- or amino-carrying linker groups can be introduced onto such amino and hydroxy functionalised base substrates. In case of a hydroxyl-carrying linker group, the first amino acid of the peptide to be constructed may be attached as an ester formed between the linker-presented hydroxyl group and the carboxyl group of the amino acid. In the case of amino-carrying linker groups, the first amino acid of the peptide to be constructed may be attached as a carboxamide formed between the linker-presented amino group and the carboxyl group of the amino acid. In an analogous fashion, the solid phase reaction components of the present invention may comprise a base substrate, for example of the kind referred to above, and a linker group which presents the hydroxylamine group (A) or (B) for reaction with the first reactive entity in the proposed synthesis. A preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention is a solid phase reaction component, comprising a solid substrate, substantially insoluble in aqueous or organic reaction media, carrying a plurality of groups of formula (IV): wherein R 10 represents hydrogen or (phenyl)CH 2 , optionally substituted in the phenyl ring by one or more substituents selected from C 1 -C 6 alkyl, C 1 -C 6 alkoxy, halogen, nitrile or NO 2 ; R 11 represents hydrogen, C 1 -C 6 alkyl, or phenyl optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected from C 1 -C 6 alkyl, C 1 -C 6 alkoxy, halogen, nitrile or NO 2 ; R 12 and R 12A independently represent hydrogen, C 1 -C 6 alkyl, C 1 -C 6 alkoxy, halogen, nitrile or NO 2 ; R 13 represents a group (X 1 ) q Y wherein q is 0 or 1, X 1 represents C(O), CH 2 , CH 2 C(O), O(CH 2 ) n C(O), O(CH 2 ) n C(O)(A 1 ) m , or O(CH 2 ) n C(O)(A 1 ) m B 1 , wherein n is an integer from 1 to 6, m is 0 or 1, A 1 represents OCH(R 1 )NH wherein R 1 is the side chain of a natural or unnatural alpha amino acid, B 1 represents a spacer group NH(CH 2 ) p wherein p is 0 or an integer from 1 to 6, and Y represents O or NH. In this embodiment, the group (IV) is linked to the solid substrate via Y, defined as O or NH. It will be apparent that these Y groups may be incorporated during synthesis of the solid phase reaction component of the invention, by starting with an amino or hydroxy functionalised base substrate, for example hydroxymethylpolystyrene, hydroxymethyl copoly(styrene-1% divinylbenzene), benzhydrylaminepolystyrene, benzhydrylamine copoly(styrene-1% divinylbenzene (BHA Resin), methyl benzhydrylaminepolystyrene, methyl benzhydrylamine copoly(styrene-1% divinylbenzene, (MBHA Resin); polyethylene glycol polystyrene (PEG-PS); poly(dimethylacrylamide)polystyrene composite (Polyhipe); polyacrylamide Kieselguhr composite (Macrosorb); or functionalised controlled pore glass.

As used herein the term C 1 -C 6 alkyl means a straight or branched chain alkyl moiety having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, including for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, pentyl and hexyl, C 1 -C 6 alkoxy means an alkoxy group wherein the alkyl part is C 1 -C 6 alkyl. In the preferred solid phase reaction component of the invention carrying a plurality of groups of formula (IV), referred to above: R 10 may for example be hydrogen, 4-methoxybenzyl or 2,4dimethoxybenzyl. Presently preferred are compounds in which R 10 is hydrogen. R 11 may for example be hydrogen, methyl, phenyl, 4-methylphenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl or 2,4-dimethoxyphenyl. Presently preferred are compounds in which R 11 is hydrogen. R 12 may for example be hydrogen or methoxy. Presently preferred are compounds in which R 12 is hydrogen. R 13 together with the base substrate to which it is attached may for example be oxymethyl-copoly(styrene-1 divinylbenzene)resin, oxymethyl-copoly(styrene2% divinylbenzene)resin, oxyacetomidomethylpolyethyleneglycol-copoly(styrene-1% divinylbenzene)resin or oxyacetomidomethylpolyethyleneglycol-copoly(styrene-2% divinylbenzene)resin. Presently preferred are compounds in which R 13 together with the base substrate to which it is attached is oxymethyl-copoly(styrene-1% divinylbenzene)resin.

A specific preferred solid phase reaction component of the invention carrying a plurality of groups of formula (IVA), is: O-Hydroxylamine-2-chlorotrityl-copoly(styrene-1%-divinylbenzene)-resin (200-400 mesh) Solid phase reaction components of the invention may be prepared by standard synthetic techniques from solid substrates which are in general commercially available or readily derivable from commercially available materials. For example, the preferred solid phase reaction component of the invention carrying a plurality of groups of formula (IV), referred to above may be prepared by treating a solid substrate, substantially insoluble in aqueous or organic reaction media, carrying a plurality of benzyl alcohol groups of general formula (V) wherein R 11 -R 13 are as defined for general formula (IV) with a compound of formula (VI) R 10 NHOH(VI) wherein R 10 is as defined for general formula (IV) but is other than hydrogen under Mitsunobu reaction conditions using triphenylphosphine and diethylazo-dicarboxylate or similar reagents. The preferred solid phase reaction component of the invention carrying a plurality of groups of formula (IV); referred to above, wherein R 10 is hydrogen may be prepared by treating a solid substrate, substantially insoluble in aqueous or organic reaction media, carrying a plurality of groups of general formula (VII) wherein R 11 -R 13 are as defined for general formula (IV) with hydrazine. A solid substrate, substantially insoluble in aqueous or organic reaction media, carrying a plurality of groups of general formula (VII) can be prepared by coupling a phthalimide derivative of formula (VII) with a solid substrate, substantially insoluble in aqueous or organic reaction media, carrying a plurality of benzyl alcohol groups of general formula (V) defined above wherein R 11 -R 13 are as defined in general formula (IV) under Mitsunobu reaction conditions using triphenylphosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate or similar reagents. Solid substrates, substantially insoluble in aqueous or organic reaction media, carrying a plurality of groups of general formula (V), and compounds of formulae (VI) and (VIII), are known in the art or may be prepared by procedures known to those skilled in the art. In an analogous manner, the preferred solid phase reaction components of formula (IVA) above may be prepared. Alternativley, the hydroxylamine group may be introduced by displacement of a leaving group present in the base substrate, eg a halogen group such as chloro, using a suitably protected hydroxylamine derivative, eg a compound of formula (Viii) above. The choice of solvent for syntheses based on a solid phase reaction component of the invention will of course depend on the nature of the reagents to be reacted with such component, but will also be influenced by the nature of that component. For example many of the polymer reaction components of the invention may swell to a greater or lesser extent in certain solvents, and generally such swelling will be desirable for the efficience of the reaction with other reagents in the desired synthesis. Solid phase reaction components of the invention presenting groups of type (B) abovewill generally be accessable (i) by displacement of a leaving group (eg a triflate, mesylate or halogen group) from the desired base substrate carrying such leaving groups, using hydroxylamine or O-protected hydroxylamine, or (ii) by reacting the desired base substrate carrying carbonyl groups with hydroxylamine or O-protected hydroxylamine to form oxime groups, and then reducing the oxime double bond, eg using a metal hydride. In another of its aspects, the present invention comprises a process for the preparation of a desired synthetic product whose structure is characterised by the presence of a covalently bonded hydroxamic acid group CONHOH, which process comprises the steps of: (i) forming a mixture of a liquid reaction medium and a solid phase reaction component which is substantially insoluble in the said liquid reaction medium and carries a plurality of covalently bound moieties of formula (A1) or (B1) in which formulae X represents the residual, non-hydroxamate, partial structure of the desired product, P 1 represents hydrogen or an amino-protecting group, P 2 represents hydrogen or a hydroxyl protecting group, and the bond designated (a) is one which covalently links the moieties (A1) or (B1) to the residue of the solid substrate and is cleavable under acid conditions or by photolysis: and (ii) in the resultant mixture, cleaving the said bond designated (a) and, if P 1 or P 2 as the case may be is not hydrogen, removing that protecting group P 1 or P 2 before, after or during cleavage of bond (a); and (iii) separating the resultant liquid reaction phase from the resultant reaction solids and recovering the desired product from the separated liquid reaction phase. Trifluoroacetic acid will generally be suitable for the acid hydrolysis of the bond (a). Depending on the structure of the linker group, solutions of trifluoroacetic acid ranging from 95% v/v to 1% v/v may be used. In Example 5 below, the linker group is photolytically cleavable, and in the remaining Examples it is cleavable by acid hydrolysis. In step (i) of the above process the solid phase reaction component which carries a plurality of moieties of formula (A1) or (B1) may be derived by appropriate chemical modification from the solid phase reaction component of the invention, described above, carrying a plurality of hydroxylamine or protected hydroxylamine groups of formula (A) or (B). In the process of the invention, the solid phase reaction component may be in the form of a finely divided solid, or a web, membrane or open pore matrix. For example, the liquid reaction medium may be mixed with the solid phase reaction product by passing the former through a liquid permeable bed or column of the latter, or by contacting the former with a discrete quantity of the latter in finely divided form in a reaction vessel. The solid phase reaction component and process of the present invention are applicable in syntheses of the following general types. Schemes 1 and 2: In schemes 1 and 2, the vertical wavy line represents the base solid substrate, L represents a linker group, P 1 and P 2 are as defined above, and B 1 . . . B n are the reaction building blocks for the synthesis of the desired product. In both cases, the desired product is released from the solid phase support by acid hydrolysis or photolysis of the bond designated (a) in formula (A) or (B), and the protecting group P 1 or P 2 may be removed in the same or a separate step depending on its identity. If desired, the intermediate solid phase reaction product can by isolated and physically partitioned into a plurality of portions after the addition of each building block B 1 . . . B n . Each resultant portion may then be reacted with a different next building block. This process facilitates the parallel synthesis of a multiplicity of different hydroxamate end products. Alternatively, the solid phase reaction component can be physically partitioned into a plurality of portions and each resultant portion may then be reacted with a different first building block B 1 . The separate portions may then be mixed to form a single portion which is then split into a plurality of portions. Each resultant portion may then be reacted with a different second building block. The separate portions may then be mixed to form a single portion which is then split into a plurality of portions for the coupling of the different second building blocks B 2 . This process may be repeated a number of times until the final building block B n has been added. This process facilitates the combinatorial synthesis of a mixture of a multiplicity of different hydroxamate end products. Specific applications of the process of the invention are the preparation of hydroxamic acids of the three classes referred to above, namely peptidyl, succinyl and arylsulphonamido hydroxamates. For the synthesis of peptidyl hydroxamates (formula (I) above) by, for example, Scheme 1, the building blocks B 1 . . . B n represent the amino acids for sequential coupling. The first amino acid is coupled to the groups A carried by solid phase reaction component of the invention, for example one of the preferred solid phase reaction components of the invention carrying a plurality of groups of formula (IV) or (IVA). In the latter case, the amino group of the amino acid component may be protected as a 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) derivative and the coupling of the amino acid carboxyl group to the nitrogen of the group A carried by the solid phase reaction component of the invention may be facilitated by the use of a coupling agent such as is commonly used in peptide synthesis, for example a carbodiimide (e.g. diisopropylcarbodiimide), a phosphonium salt (e.g. benzotrazol-1-yl-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate) or a uronium salt (e.g. 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1.3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate), with the optional addition of an additive such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Alternatively, the coupling reaction may be conducted by preforming an active ester derivative (e.g. pentafluorophenyl ester) of the carboxylic acid component and optionally conducting the reaction in the presence of an additive such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. The Fmoc amino protecting group may then be removed by treatment of the reaction product with a basic amine such as piperidine. During the coupling reaction any groups in the amino acid which are potentially reactive under the coupling conditions may be protected from such reaction as is usual in peptide synthesis. Addition of the second and any subsequent amino acids proceeds in a similar manner until the desired peptidyl hydroxamate is finally cleaved from the solid substrate, eg by acid hydrolysis of the bond designated (a), and any protecting groups present in the molecule may be removed before during or after such cleavage, depending on the nature of the protecting groups in question. For the synthesis of succinyl hydroxamates (formula (II) above) by, for example, Scheme 1, an appropriate choice of building blocks B 1 . . . B n to effect the synthesis is made. The first building block will generally be a carboxylic acid (also containing a site suitable for coupling the next building block) which is coupled to the groups A carried by solid phase reaction component of the invention, for example one of the preferred solid phase reaction components of the invention carrying a plurality of groups of formula (IV)or (IVA). Again the coupling of the carboxyl group of the first building block to the nitrogen of the group A carried by the solid phase reaction component of the invention may be facilitated by the use of a coupling agent such as is commonly used in peptide synthesis, for example a carbodiimide (e.g. diisopropylcarbodiimide), a phosphonium salt (e.g. benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate) or a uronium salt (e.g. 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate), with the optional addition of an additive such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Alternatively, an activated ester, for example a pentafluorophenyl ester, of the first carboxylic acid building block may be coupled to the group A carried by the solid phase reaction component of the invention in the presence of dimethylaminopyridine. A particular first carboxylic acid building block may be one of formula (IX) wherein R 2 and R 3 are groups dictated by the desired succinyl hydroxamate final product and R 14 is a carboxyl protecting group which is compatible with solid phase synthesis such as an allyl group. Where the compound (IX) is coupled to the solid phase reaction components of the invention in this way, the R 14 carboxyl protecting group in the resultant product may be converted to a carboxylic acid group by deprotection. In the case where R 14 is an allyl group deprotection may be acheived by palladium catalysis. Suitable reagents for this step are Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 or Pd(OAc) 2 /triphenylphosphine, and the reaction is usually conducted in the presence of an allyl acceptor such as morpholine. The carboxylic acid group thus generated may then be used as the point of attachment for the second building block, which will generally be an amine of formula (X) wherein R 4 -R 6 are again groups dictated by the desired succinyl hydroxamate final product. The methods described above and common in peptide synthesis are used to effect the coupling of the amine group of (X) with the carboxylic acid group of the first building block now carried on the solid phase reaction component. During the coupling reactions of the foregoing assembly process, any groups in the first and second building blocks which are potentially reactive under the coupling conditions may be protected from such reaction as is usual in peptide synthesis. After assembly of the desired succinyl hydroxamate, the product may be cleaved from the solid substrate, eg by acid hydrolysis of the bond designated (a), and any protecting groups present in the molecule may be removed before, during or after such cleavage, depending on the nature of the protecting groups in question. For the synthesis of arylsulphonamide hydroxamates (formula (III) above) by the method of, for example, Scheme 1, an appropriate choice of building blocks B 1 . . . B n to effect the synthesis is made. The first building block will either be an alpha amino acid in which the alpha amino group is protected (for example as a 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) or allyloxycarbonyl (Aloc) derivative), and the substituents on the alpha C atom (corresponding to R 7 and R 8 in formula (III)) are dictated by the desired arylsulphonamide hydroxamate final product or an alpha halo acid of formula (XI) wherein R 7 and R 8 are dictated by the desired arylsulphonamide hydroxamate final product and Hal is a halogen such as bromo. This first building block (protected alpha amino acid or alpha halo acid) is coupled to the groups A carried by solid phase reaction component of the invention, for example one of the preferred solid phase reaction components of the invention carrying a plurality of groups of formula (IV) or (IVA). In the latter case, the coupling of the protected alpha-amino acid or alpha-halo acid carboxyl group to the nitrogen of the group A carried by the solid phase reaction component of the invention may be facilitated by the use of a coupling agent such as is commonly used in peptide synthesis, for example a carbodiimide (e.g. diisopropylcarbodiimide), a phosphonium salt (e.g. benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate) or a uronium salt (e.g. 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate), with the optional addition of an additive such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Alternatively this first building block may be coupled to the group A carried by the solid phase reaction component of the invention as an activated ester, for example a pentafluorophenyl ester, in the presence of dimethylaminopyridine. In the case where the first building block is a protected alpha-amino acid the N-protecting group (eg Fmoc or Aloc) may be removed by treatment of the reaction product with a basic amine such as piperidine in the case of base labile protecting groups (e.g. Fmoc) or treatment with a suitable palladium catalyst in the case of palladium labile protecting groups (e.g. Aloc). The free amino group then serves as the site for formation of the appropriate arylsulphonamide and alkylation of the sulphonamide nitrogen to complete the synthesis of the desired arylsulphonamide hydroxamate, which can then be cleaved from the solid substrate, eg by acid hydrolysis of the bond designated (a). In the case where the first building block is an alpha-halo acid the halogen may be displaced by reaction with an amine to form a secondary amine which serves as the site for formation of the sulphonamide to complete the synthesis of the desired arylsulphonamide hydroxamate, which can then be cleaved from the solid substrate, eg by acid hydrolysis of the bond designated (a).

Elemental microanalyses were performed by Medac Ltd (Department of Chemistry, Brunel University, Uxbridge, Middlesex UB8 3PH). EXAMPLE 1 4-(O-Methylhydroxylamine)phenoxymethyl-copoly(styrene-1% divinylbenzene)-resin (100-200 mesh) 4-(Hydroxymethyl)phenoxymethyl-copoly(styrene-1% divinylbenzene)-resin (100-200 mesh) (Wang resin) (1.83 g, 0.7 mmol/g loading, 1.28 mmol) was suspended in dry THF (20 cm 3 ) and gently agitated for 30 minutes under a blanket of argon. N-Hydroxyphthalimide (624 mg, 3.82 mmol) and triphenylphosphine (1.005 g, 3.82 mmol) were added and the mixture was agitated until these reagents dissolved. Diethylazodicarboxylate (721 mg, 3.28 mmol) was added by cannula to give a bright red solution and the mixture was shaken. Most of the colour dissipated from the reaction mixture after 45 minutes. After 18 h the resin was collected by filtration, washed successively with THF, DMF, dichloromethane, methanol and finally thoroughly with dichloromethane and then dried in vacuo; max (KBr) 1726(vs), 1687, 1593 cm 1 . The resin from above was suspended in DMF (10 cm 3 ) and hydrazine (100%)(1.5 cm 3 ) was added. The pale yellow solution was heated at 50 C. for 2 h and then gently agitated overnight.

Elemental analysis of the resin confirmed the presence of nitrogen and suggested a loading of 0.68 mmol/g: C 89.17, H 7.70, N 0.95%. Note: The loading obtained varied for different batches of the resin due to variability in the loading of the starting Wang resin, but in each case elemental analysis suggested that quantative conversion was achieved.

The resin was filtered, washed with DMF and then suspended and agitated in a 20% solution of piperidine in DMF for 40 minutes. The solution was drained from the resin which was washed with DMF, dichloromethane, methanol, dichloromethane and finally resuspended in DMF (6 cm 3 ). Following the same protocols described above Fmoc-leucine and benzyloxycarbonylproline were then successively coupled to the resin. On completion the resin was washed thoroughly and dried in vacuo overnight. The resin was treated with 95% aqueous TFA (10 Cm 3 ) for 75 minutes. The TFA solution was collected by filtration, the resin washed with more TFA (2 cm 3 ) and the combined filtrates evaporated to leave a gum which was triturated with ether to give a white solid. TLC of the white solid indicated a single compound which gave a positive ferric chloride test indicative of a hydroxamic acid. The solid was collected and dried to give the desired benzoxycarbonyl-L-prolyl-L-leucyl-L-alanyl-hydroxamic acid (54 mg, 90%) 1 H NMR (CDCl 3 ) 7.35 (5H, m, aromatic), 5.15 (1H, J7 Hz, CH a H b O), 5.13 (1H, d, J7 Hz, CH a H b O), 4.48 (1H, m), 4.33 (1H, m), 4.23 (1H, m), 3.52 (2H, m, pro), 1.9-2.2 (3H, m, pro), 1.48-1.78 (2H, m), 1.48 (3H, d, J8.2 Hz, ala), 1.25 (2H, m, CH 2 leu), 0.86 (6H, m, CH 3 -leu); 13 C NMR (CDCl 3 ) 173.5, 172.2, 169.3, 156.4, 136.0, 128.6, 128.4, 127.9, 67.8, 61.5, 53.2, 47.4, 47.3, 39.7, 29.6, 25.1, 24.7, 22.6, 21.4, 17.0. EXAMPLE B Use of the resin from Example 1 in the preparation of a library of left hand side inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases ZAA 3 AA 2 AA 1 NHOH 1g of the resin (4-(O-methylhydroxylamine)phenoxymethyl-copoly(styrene-1% divinylbenzene)-resin (100-200 mesh)) of Example 1 was placed in each of 10 sealable polypropylene tubes (BioRad) and swelled in DMF (1 cm 3 ). 2.5 mmol (4 equivalents) of one of the Fmoc-amino acids, alanine, D-alanine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine, D-leucine, norleucine, methionine, valine, norvaline, was placed in a tube followed by HOBt (3.85 cm 3 of a 0.65 M solution in DMF). Diisopropylcarbodiimide (0.4 cm 3 ) was added to each tube which were then sealed and gently agitated for 18 h when they were drained of solvent and washed thoroughly with DMF. A solution of 30% piperidine in DMF (6 cm 3 ) was added to each tube, the resin was mixed by shaking and then allowed to stand in the solution for 40 minutes, the solvent was drained and the resin washed successively with DMF, methanol and dichloromethane as described above in Example 1 and dried. The resin from each individual tube was then portioned into 10 tubes (100 mg/tube) and a 1% solution of bromophenol blue in DMF (1 cm 3 ) added to swell and stain the resin. 0.25 mmol of one of the Fmoc-amino acids alanine, D-alanine, arginine (N G -Pmc), aspartic acid-b-tert-butyl ester, leucine, proline, norleucine, glutamine-y-trityl, thioproline, -Boc-lysine was added to one of the tubes derived from the sub-division of the resin from the original ten tubes. HOBt (0.38 cm 3 of a 0.65 M solution in DMF) was added to every tube followed by diisopropylcarbodiimide (39 mm 3 ). The tubes were then sealed and agitated overnight. At this time the colour had discharged from almost every tube. A further 0.05 mmol portion each of the Fmoc-amino acid and diisopropylcarbodiimide was added to those tubes which still showed a blue-green colouring; this was discharged within 30 minutes of the addition of the extra reagent. The resin from these tubes was then pooled back into the tube from where it had originated, washed with DMF and then treated with 30% piperidine in DMF for 40 minutes and washed thoroughly as above. The resin from each of these ten tubes was then redivided into 5 tubes (200 mg/tube) and allowed to swell in a 1% solution of bromophenol blue in DMF (1 cm 3 ). 5 mmol of one of the Z-amino acids, alanine, phenylalanine, proline, leucine, aspartic acid--tert-butyl ester, was added to one tube from each sub-division followed by HOBt (5 cm 3 of a 1.0 M solution in DMF) and by diisopropylcarbodiimide (0.78 cm 3 ). The tubes were gently agitated for 5 h by when the blue colour had been discharged in all tubes. The resin was then repooled into the original tubes as above and thoroughly washed with DMF, dichloromethane and methanol as described previously. The resin, maintained in the 10 tubes, was then dried in vacuo overnight. 5 cm 3 of a solution of 5% phenol, 5% water, 2% triisopropylsilane in TFA was added to the resin in each tube and periodically shaken over 60 minutes. The TFA solution was collected by filtration and the resin washed with a further 2 cm 3 of TFA. The washings and filtrate from each individual tube were combined and the solvent evaporated to leave a residue which was triturated with cold diisopropylether/hexane to give white solid precipitates. After removal of most of the organic solvent by decanting the precipitates were then lyophilised from 50% aqueous acetontrile to give the desired 10 mixtures of 50 tripeptide hydroxamic acids. Each of the ten mixtures of peptidyl hydroxamic acids was assayed for activity as inhibitors of metalloproteinase enzymes. Those pools showing the greatest inhibitory activity were then subjected to an iterative deconvolution procedure to identify individual active inhibitors. EXAMPLE C Use of the resin from Example 1 in the preparation of a sulfonamide hydroxamate derivative: 2-(N-Decyl-2-acetamido-4-methylthiazol-5-ylsulfonamido)-acetohydroxamic acid Bromoacetic acid (167 mg, 1.2 mmol) and diisopropylcarbodiimide (94 mm 3 , 0.6 mmol) were added to a suspension of the resin (4-(O-methylhydroxylamine)phenoxymethyl-copoly(styrene-1% divinylbenzene)-resin (100-200 mesh)) prepared according to Example 1 (250 mg, 0.1 mmol) in DMF (6 cm 3 ). The mixture was agitated for 90 minutes and then the solution was drained from the resin which was washed and dried as described above in Example 1 The resin was soaked in DMSO (2 cm 3 ) and a solution of n-decylamine in DMSO (5 cm 3 of a 2M solution, 10 mmol) was added and the mixture shaken for 4 h before the resin was drained and washed thoroughly as before. The resin was then suspended in DMF and 2-acetamido-4-methyl-5-thiazolesulfonylchloride (102 mg, 0.4 mmol) was added. The mixture was heated at 60 for 8 h and then the resin was drained, washed and dried as described previously. Cleavage from the resin as in Example A gave a white solid which was purified by column chromatography (10% methanol-dichloromethane; silica) to give the desired 2-(N-decyl-2-acetamido-4-methylthiazol-5-ylsulfonamido)-acetohydroxamic acid (23 mg, 51%) as a white solid; 1 H NMR (CDCl 3 ) 3.83 (2H, m), 3.05 (2H, m), 2.52 (3H, s, Me), 2.35 (3H, s, NHCOMe), 1.69 (2H, m), 1.15-1.25 (14H, m, alkyl), 0.87 (3H, t, J7.2Hz, CH 3 -alkyl). EXAMPLE D Use of the resin from Example 1 in the preparation of an array of sulfonamide hydroxamate inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases Sulfonamide hydroxamic acid derivatives were prepared as a combinatorial array of individual compounds in purity sufficient for fast throughput assays. The resin (4-(O)-methylhydroxylamine)phenoxymethyl-copoly(styrene-1% divinylbenzene)-resin (100-200 mesh)) was loaded with bromoacetic acid as described in Example C. Elemental analysis of this different batch of resin confirmed that coupling had taken place: C 83.34, H 7.04, N 0.86, Br 5.40% and suggested a loading of 0.65 mmol. 1 g of this resin was placed in each of 36 plastic Econopac tubes (BioRad) and swelled in DMF (5 cm 3 ). The excess DMF was drained off and the tubes grouped into nine groups of four tubes. A solution (5 cm 3 of a 2M solution in either DMF or DMSO) of one of the amines, benzylamine, 4-methylbenzylamine, 4-methoxybenzylamine, 4-fluorobenzyiamine, 4-chlorobenzylamine, pyridin-3-ylmethylamine, thien-2-ylmethylamine, furan-2-ylmethylamine and 3,4-dioxymethylenebenzylamine was each added to each of four tubes (within one of the nine groups) which were then sealed and mixed thoroughly for 2 h. The solvent was removed, the resin washed as in Example C and reswelled in DMF. The tubes were regrouped into four groups each of nine tubes. Following a protocol analogous to that used in Example C, a DMF solution of 10 equivalents of one of the sulfonyl chlorides, 3-chloropropylsulfonyl chloride, hexylsulfonyl chloride, octylsulfonyl chloride and decylsulfonyl chloride was added to each of the nine tubes (within one of the four groups) so that all 36 combinations of sulfonamides were prepared. After removal of the sovent by filtration, thorough washing with DMF, methanol and dichloromethane as above, and drying under vacuum for several hours the products were cleaved from the resin as in Example C directly into plastic centrifuge tubes. The TFA was removed by centrifugal evaporation and the resulting hydroxamic acids lyophilised from aqueous acetonitrile.

Diisopropylcarbodiimide (0.3 cm 3 ) was added to a solution of bromoacetic acid (670 mg) in DMF (3 cm 3 ) and after 3 minutes the resulting solution was added to the resin suspension and gently mixed together for 2 h. The resin was collected by filtration and washed thoroughly with DMF, methanol, methanol-dichloromethane, dichloromethane and ether. It was then dried in vacuo at 45 C. for 18 h. Elemental analysis of the resin suggested a loading of 0.66 mmol/g: C;, 79.11; H, 6.78; N, 2.08; Br, 5.25%. The resin from above swelled in DMF (3 ml) was treated with (0.33 cm 3 , 3 mmol) benzylamine and gently agitated at room temperature overnight. The solvent was removed by filtration and the resin washed as described above in Example 1 and dried. The resin was swelled in DMF (3 ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride (0.8 g, 4 mmol) was added and the mixture was gently agitated for 2 h at room temperature. The resin was filtered and washed as described above in Example 1 and dried. A solution of 1% TFA in DCM (3 ml) was added to the resin at room temperature and the mixture gently agitated for 1 h. The resin was filtered and washed with DCM, methanol and DCM, the filtrates combined and evaporated under reduced pressure to give crude 2-(N-benzyl-benzylsulfonamido)-acetohydroxamic acid (0.39 g): TLC ferric chloride positive spot R f 0.15 10% methanol in DCM/silica. EXAMPLE G Use of the resin from Example 4 in the preparation of a sulfonamide hydroxamate derivative: 2-(N-Benzyl-benzylsulfonamido)-acetohydroxamic acid This resin of Example 4 (4-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl-O-methylhydroxylamine)-phenoxymethyl-copoly(styrene-1%-divinylbenzene)-resin (100-200 mesh)) (0.25 g) was suspended in DMF (3 cm 3 ). Diisopropylcarbodiimide (0.24 cm 3 ) was added to a solution of bromoacetic acid (420 mg) in DMF (3 cm 3 ) and after 3 minutes the resulting solution was added to the resin suspension and gently mixed together for 2 h. The resin was collected by filtration and washed thoroughly with DMF, methanol, methanol-dichloromethane, dichloromethane and ether. It was then dried in vacuo at 45 C. for 18 h. Elemental analysis of the resin suggested a loading of 0.58 mmol/g: C; 84.31; H, 7.28; N, 0.82: Br, 4.65%. Following the procedure of Example F the above resin was treated in turn with benzylamine and phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride. A solution of 10% acetic acid in DCM (3 ml) was added to the resin at room temperature and the mixture gently agitated for 2 h. The resin was filtered and washed with DCM, methanol and DCM, the filtrates combined and evaporated under reduced pressure to give crude 2-(N-benzyl-benzylsulfonamido)-acetohydroxamic acid (0.22 g). EXAMPLE H Use of the resin from Example 5 in the preparation of a peptide hydroxamate derivative: Benzyloxycarbonyl-L-prolyl-L-leucyl-L-alanylhydroxamic acid Using procedures analogous to those described in Example A, the tripeptide Z-L-prolyl-L-leucyl-L-alanyl was synthesised attached to the resin of Example 5 (4-4-(1-aminooxyethyl)-2-methoxy-5-nitrophenoxy-(N-4-methylbenzhydryl)-butyramide-copoly(styrene-1%-divinylbenzene)-resin (100-200 mesh)). Following drying, the elaborated resin (50 mg) in acetonitrile (1.5 cm 3 ) was blanketed with argon in a stoppered reaction vial. The vial was placed 5 cm away from a 365 nm light source and irradiated for 15 h.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides amine functional cellulose ester compounds and compositions containing such amine functional cellulose ester compounds. The invention also provides a method of making an amine functional cellulose ester compound, a method of dispersing a pigment, and a method of obtaining an improved appearance in a cured pigmented coating. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Coatings applied to surfaces typically serve decorative and/or protective functions. This is particularly so for automotive finishes, which must provide an esthetically appealing appearance while simultaneously meeting and maintaining rigorous performance and durability requirements. As used herein, automotive coating or finish encompasses both original equipment (OEM) coatings and refinish coatings, but especially to refinish coatings, the later term referring to coatings which are applied after the car has left the manufacturer, usually for repair purposes. It will be appreciated that refinish coatings often have different application and performance parameters. Pigments are used in coatings to provide decorative and/or protective functions. As used herein, pigment refers to a fine, insoluble white, black, or colored material, typically suspended in a vehicle for use in a paint or ink. The term pigment may also include effect pigments such as micas, metallic pigments such as aluminum, opalescent pigments, and the like. Dry pigments comprise a mixture of primary particles, aggregates, and agglomerates that must be wetted and de-aggregated before dispersion forces can take full effect and enable the production of a stable, pigmentary dispersion in the medium of choice. Aggregates, or primary pigment particles joined face-to-face, must be reduced to their fundamental primary particle. An ideal dispersion consists of a homogeneous suspension of primary particles. See Organic Pigments, Federation Series on Coatings Technology, 2 nd Edition, Lewis, P. October 1988, Revised March 1995, pgs. 39-41, hereby incorporated by reference. Although pigments are acknowledged as a required component in many coatings, their presence may be a possible contributing factor to a variety of problems in liquid coatings and/or dry paint films. Examples of coatings/paint film defects thought to be attributable to pigments include: undesirable gloss due to aggregates, blooming, pigment fading, pigment flocculation and/or settlement, separation of pigment mixtures, pigment shock in millbases, instability in pigment suspensions, brittleness, moisture susceptibility, fungal growth susceptibility, and/or thermal instability. See Physical-Chemical Aspects of Pigment Applications, Surface Coating Reviews, Guthrie, James T., and Lin, Long, Oil Colour Chemists Association, 1994, Sections 4.3.1-4.3.2, hereby incorporated by reference. It has been recognized that the level of dispersion in a particular pigment containing coating composition affects the application properties of the wet composition as well as the optical properties of the cured film. Improvements in dispersion have been shown to result in improvements in gloss, color strength, brightness, and gloss retention. Dispersionthe neglected parameter. JOCCA, W. Carr, 65, 373 (1982). The prior art has long sought improved pigment dispersions for use in coating compositions, particularly with respect to pigments that are difficult to disperse such as carbon black and transparent oxides. The use of cellulose esters in organic solvent borne coatings has been known to impart desired properties such as improved pigment dispersions, improved metallic flake orientation, improved solvent release, and higher gloss coatings. They are also known to function as rheology control agents in solvent borne coating formulations. U.S. Pat. No. 3,959,193 discloses a combination of an aryl sulfonamide-formaldehyde resin and film forming material, such as cellulose acetate butyrate, which may further include a surfactant, such as a non-ionic surfactant including, for example, an alkylarylpolyether, as a universal dispersant for resin additives, such as pigment materials. The composition generally includes 40 to 90 weight percent of any of various types of additives, including pigments. U.S. Pat. No. 5,521,304 provides water soluble or water dispersible cellulose acetoacetate esters prepared by contacting a cellulose material with diketene, an alkyl acetoacetate, 2,2,6-trimethyl-4H-1,3-dioxin-4-one or a mixture thereof and a carboxylic anhydride in a solvent system comprising lithium chloride plus a carboxamide. Compositions containing the cellulose acetoacetate esters are disclosed to be useful for coating applications. Amine-containing cellulose esters, eg, the acetate N,N-diethylaminoacetate and propionate morpholinobutyrate have been suggested for use in controlled-release, rumen-protected feed supplements for ruminants. Such esters are prepared by the addition of the appropriate amine to the cellulose acylate crotonate ester or by replacement of the chlorine on cellulose acylate chloroacetate esters with amines. However, such amine containing cellulosic materials are not taught to be useful in coating compositions nor do they suggest the particular compositions of the invention. They lack an enamine structure, hydroxyl groups and the use of mixed acetate/butyrate esters. Eastman Chemical Products, Incs Publication No. X-263A, December, 1986, pgs. 2-3, discusses the possible reactions of acetoacetylated polymers. The carbonyl group of the acetoacetylated polymers is said to chelate with metals such as zinc, tin, lead, aluminum, copper and zirconium. Polyvalent cations are taught to useful for crosslinking purposes. In addition, the preparation of enamines by the reaction of amines with carbonyl groups is taught. Diamines are shown to crosslink acetoacetylated polymers. Despite these prior art attempts, there still exists a need for improved pigment dispersion, especially with respect to the dispersion of certain pigments intended for use in topcoat finishes. Topcoat finishes require a high quality of color depth and richness, especially with pigments such as carbon black and the like. Such high quality of color depth and richness, known as jetness with respect to carbon black, has been difficult to obtain in an efficient and cost effective manner with prior art dispersants and dispersion processes. Jetness as used herein refers to a clean looking color with blue undertones. Accordingly, it is desirable to obtain an improved dispersion with respect to pigmented coating compositions. It is further desirable to obtain such improved dispersion with an agent that is economical and easily obtained. More particularly, it is desirable to obtain a dispersant for use with pigments, especially hard to disperse pigments such as carbon black, which would provide coatings having an improved appearance, especially as to color and/or jetness, when pigments dispersed with such a dispersant are incorporated into the coating. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has surprisingly been found that these and other objects are obtained with the use of the present invention which provides a composition comprising an amine functional cellulose ester resin, the amine functional cellulose ester resin comprising at least one repeat unit of the structure: wherein R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 are selected independently from the group consisting of hydrogen, R 4 CO, and wherein at least one of R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 is hydrogen, at least one of R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 is R 4 CO, and at least one of R 1 , R 2 , or R 3 groups have the structure preferably 0.5% to 10% by weight of the total weight of the amine functional cellulose ester being of R 1 , R 2 , or R 3 groups having the structure R 4 is selected from the group consisting of C 1 -C 20 alkyl groups, C 1 -C 20 phenyl groups, C 1 -C 20 napthyl groups, and C 1 -C 20 alkenyl groups, L is a divalent linking group and R 6 is selected from the group consisting of H and compounds having at least one secondary amine group, tertiary amine group and mixtures thereof. The invention further provides a method of making the amine functional cellulose ester of the invention wherein a cellulose acetoacetate ester resin is provided, the resin comprising one or more repeat units of the structure wherein R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 are selected independently from the group consisting of hydrogen, acetoacetyl, and R 4 CO, R 4 is selected from the group consisting of C 1 -C 20 alkyl groups, C 1 -C 20 phenyl groups, C 1 -C 20 napthyl groups, and C 1 -C 20 alkenyl groups, at least one of R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 is R 4 CO, at least 0.5 percent of the total weight of the cellulose ester resin is of R 1 , R 2 , or R 3 groups which are acetoacetyl and at least one or more of R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 is H. This cellulose ester resin is then reacted with an amine functional compound comprising at least one primary amine group to provide an amine functional cellulose ester resin. The invention also provides a method of dispersing a pigment in a resin, wherein one or more pigments are ground, i.e., are subject to a means for reducing and maintaining the average particle size of the pigment, in the presence of the amine functional cellulose ester resin of the invention. Finally, the invention discloses a method of providing a cured pigmented coating having an improved appearance. The method requires the application and curing of a coating composition comprising a least one pigment that has been dispersed in the presence of the amine functional cellulose ester resin of the invention. The resulting cured pigmented coating has an appearance with respect to color (jetness in the case of black pigments) which is improved relative to a similar coating which contains pigment which has not been dispersed in the presence of the amine functional cellulose ester resin of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The instant invention(s) requires the use of a particular amine functional cellulose ester resin. This amine functional cellulose ester resin is the reaction product of a cellulose ester comprising at least one acetoacetyl group and an amine functional compound comprising at least one primary amine. As used herein, the term acetoacetyl group refers to The terms acetoacetonate and acetoacylate are intended to be equivalent to and interchangeable with acetoacetyl. The acetoacetyl group may be obtained via the direct acetoacylation of raw cellulose as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,292,877, 5,420,267, 5,521,304, and 5,595,591 all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. These patents disclose water soluble or water dispersible cellulose acetoacetate esters prepared by contacting a cellulose material with diketene, an alkyl acetoacetate, 2,2,6-triemethyl-4H-1,3-dioxin-4-one or a mixture thereof and a carboxylic anhydride in a solvent system comprising lithium chloride plus a carboxamide. Alternatively, the required cellulose acetoacetate ester may be obtained via the acetoacylation of previously esterified cellulose material. Cellulose esters are known in the art and are commercially available from Eastman Kodak of Kingsport, Tenn. and Bayer of Pittsburg, Pa. Suitable cellulose esters for use in the instant invention are those resulting from the reaction of cellulose with organic acids, anhydrides, and acid chlorides. Methods for making cellulose esters are discussed in Cellulose Esters, Organic, Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, Vol. 3, pgs, 158-181. Suitable cellulose esters for use in the instant invention are those having the following structure: wherein R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 are selected independently from the group consisting of hydrogen and R 4 CO; R 4 is selected from the group consisting of C 1 -C 20 alkyl groups, C 1 -C 20 phenyl groups, C 1 -C 20 napthyl groups, and C 1 -C 20 alkenyl groups; and at least one of R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 is H. Preferably, the remaining R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 that are not H are different. Preferred for use as R 4 are the C 1 -C 20 alkyl groups, especially the C 1 -C 10 alkyl groups, and most preferably the C 1 -C 6 alkyl groups. Most preferred cellulose esters are mixed cellulose esters such as cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) and cellulose acetate propionate (CAP). Cellulose esters suitable for use in the instant invention may also be characterized by particular physical and/or performance parameters such as the number of acyl groups per repeating unit, acyl chain unit length, and the degree of polymerization or molecular weight (number average). In general, suitable performance and/or physical parameters are a viscosity of from 0.01 to 20 sec, (per ASTM D817 (Formula A) and D 1343) a % Acetyl of from 0.6 to 20, more preferably from 2 to 14, (per ASTM D817), a % butyryl of from 17 to 53, more preferably from 35 to 53, (per ASTM D817), a % hydroxyl of from 0.8 to 5.0, more preferably from 1.0 to 2.0, a T g of from 50 to 200 degrees C., more prefereably from 80 to 135 degrees C., and a number average molecular weight value of from 10,000 to 70,000, more preferably from 15,000 to 40,000, based on a polystyrene equivalent molecular weight determined using size exclusion chromatography. Suitable cellulose esters include those commercially available from Eastman Chemicals, i.e., CAB 551-0.01, CAB 531-1, CAB-381-0.5 and CAB-381-2. The necessary acetoacetate group may be placed on a suitable cellulose ester such as described above via reaction with a compound containing an acetoacetate group. Examples of such compounds are alkyl acetoacetates having alkyl groups with from 1 to 20 carbons, preferably 1 to 10 carbons and most preferably from 1 to 6 carbons. Examples of suitable alkylacetoacetates are tert-butyl acetoacetate, methyl acetoacetate, ethyl acetoacetate and the like. Preferred acetoacetate group-containing compounds are tert-butyl acetoacetate. The desired cellulose ester resin is modified with from 0.5% to 10% alkyl acetoacetate, based on the total weight of the cellulose ester resin. More preferably from 0.5 to 5.0%, and most preferably from 0.5 to 2.0% of alkyl acetoacetate is used, based on the total weight of the cellulose ester resin. It will thus be appreciated that some repeating units of the total cellulose ester resin may not comprise any R1 or R2 or R3 groups which have been modified with the acetoacetate group. However, from 0.5 to 10%, more preferably from 0.5 to 5% and most preferably from 0.5 to 2.0% of the total weight of the cellulose ester resin will have sites wherein a hydroxyl group has been replaced with an acetoacetate group. Methods of incorporating the acetoacetate group into the cellulose ester include transesterification as described below and direct reaction of a hydroxyl group with a diketene. A preferred method of incorporating the acetoacetate group into a suitable cellulose ester requires incorporation of a commercially available cellulose ester and a high boiling point, good cutting solvent such as ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate (EEP), PM acetate, EXXATE solvents and the like. Most preferably, ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate is used. After removal of water, an alkyl acetoacetate is added along with additional EEP. The resultant acetoacetylated cellulose ester is collected along with removal of the alkyl alcohol. The acetoacetate group-containing cellulose ester is reacted with at least one amine functional compound to provide the amine functional cellulose ester resin of the invention. Suitable amine functional compounds will comprise at least one primary amine group. More preferably, the amine functional compounds will comprise at least one or more additional amine groups selected from the group consisting of secondary amine groups and tertiary amine groups, and mixtures thereof. Amines containing both a primary amine group and a tertiary amine group, as well as those containing a primary amine group, a secondary amine group and a tertiary amine group are most preferred. Examples of suitable amine functional compounds for use herein include N-methylethylenediamine; N-ethylethylenediamine; N,N-diethylethylenediamine; N,N-dibutylethylenediamine; N-methyl,1,3-propanediamine; N-propyl, 1,3-propanediamine; N-isopropyl, 1,3-propanediamine; 3-dimethylaminopropylamine; 3-diethylaminopropylamine; 3-dibutylaminopropylamine; N,N,2,2-tetramethyl-1,3-propanediamine; N-cyclohexyl-1,3-propanediamine; 2-(2-aminoethylamino)ethanol; 2-(2-aminoethyl)-1-methylpyrrolidine; 1-(2-aminoethyl)pyrrolidine; 1-(2-aminoethyl)piperidine; 1-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine; 4-(2-aminoethyl)morpholine, and mixtures thereof. Preferred amine functional compounds are 1-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine and 4-(2-aminoethyl)morpholine. A most preferred amine functional compound is 1-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine. The amine functional compound will be used in the reaction with the acetoacetate functional cellulose ester in an amount such that all of the acetoacetate groups will be amine functionalized. At least 95% by weight of the acetoacetate groups will be modified with the amine functional group, preferably at least 98%, and most preferably 100%, based on the total weight of the acetoacetate groups present in the cellulose ester resin. Thus, from 0.5 to 10% by weight of amine functional compound should be used, based on the total weight of acetoacetylated cellulose ester. More preferably, from 0.5 to 5.0% by weight should be used and most preferably from 0.5 to 2.0% by weight, based on the total weight of acetoacetylated cellulose ester. Accordingly, the amine functional cellulose ester resin of the invention is characterized by a structure having at least one repeat unit: wherein R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 are selected independently from the group consisting of hydrogen, R 4 CO, and At least one of R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 is hydrogen. At least one of R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 is R 4 CO, and preferably at least two of R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 is R 4 CO. At least one repeat unit in the instant resin will have at least one of R 1 , R 2 , or R 3 groups being Most preferably, at least 0.5% by weight of the total weight of the amine functional cellulose ester will be of R 1 , R 2 , or R 3 groups having the structure: It will thus be appreciated that some individual repeating units of the total resin may not comprise any R 1 , R 2 , or R 3 groups having the structure However, the invention requires only that from 0.5 to 10% by weight of the total polymer, more preferably 0.5 to 5.0% and most preferably 0.5 to 2.0% be comprised of R 1 , R 2 , or R 3 groups having the structure based on the total weight of the polymer. In the above formula, R 4 is selected from the group consisting of C 1 -C 20 alkyl groups, C 1 -C 20 phenyl groups, C 1 -C 20 napthyl groups, and C 1 -C 20 alkenyl groups. Preferably R 4 is selected from the group consisting of C 1 -C 20 alkyl groups, and most preferably is selected from the group consisting of C 1 -C 6 alkyl groups. R 6 is selected from the group consisting of H and compounds having at least one amine group selected from the group consisting of secondary amine groups, tertiary amine groups and mixtures thereof. Preferably R 6 will be selected from the group of compounds having at least one amine group selected from the group consisting of secondary amine groups, tertiary amine groups and mixtures thereof. Most preferably, R 6 will be a secondary or tertiary amine group. L is a divalent linking group having from 1 to 20 carbons atoms and from 0 to 10 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen, and mixtures thereof. Illustrative examples of suitable L groups are aliphatic or cycloaliphatic linking groups of from 1 to 20 carbons, aromatic linking groups of from 1 to 10 carbons, and mixtures thereof. Preferred L groups include aliphatic or cycloaliphatic groups of from 2 to 10 carbons having from 0 to 5 heteroatoms. The amine functional cellulose esters of the invention may be used in coating compositions containing one or more pigments, pigment pastes, and mixtures thereof. Pigment pastes may be defined as compositions containing at least 0.2% by weight of pigment, based on the total weight of the composition. When used in pigment pastes, the amine functional cellulose esters of the invention will typically be used in an amount of from 2 to 15, preferably from 5 to 10, and most preferably from 7 to 8% by weight, based on the total weight of the pigment paste. The amine functional cellulose esters of the invention may be used in coating compositions containing one or more pigments, pigment pastes, and mixtures thereof. Typically, the pigment desired to be dispersed is subject to an action which decreases the average particle size of the pigment, in the presence of the amine functional cellulose ester of the invention. Such actions may be referred to as grinding or dispersion. Pigments are generally ground to a certain fineness of grind. Fineness of grind is often measured by the absence of seeds on a grind gauge, tint strength, or absence of pigment flocculation upon application. Encapsulation of the ground pigment particle is believed to prevent reagglomeration. After grinding or the like, additional resins, solvents and additives may be added to the pigment paste. Examples of coating compositions in which the instant cellulose esters may used include coating compositions include primers, basecoats, and/or clearcoats which are one component, two component or multicomponent systems and may include OEM coatings and refinish coatings. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that such coatings may used over variety of substrates such as metal, plastic, previously painted substrates, and mixtures thereof, and may be subjected to variety of curing schemes including ambient cure, elevated temperature cures, and/or radiation. This invention can be further illustrated by the following examples of preferred embodiments thereof, although it will be understood that these examples are included merely for purposes of illustration and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention unless otherwise specifically indicated. The starting materials are commercially available unless otherwise noted. All percentages are by weight unless otherwise noted. EXAMPLES Example I A 5-liter, 3-necked round-bottom flask was fitted with an agitator, thermocouple probe, inert gas inlet, reflux condenser, Dean-Stark distillation receiver and heating mantle. The flask was charged with a mixture of 950 g of Eastman Chemical Co.s cellulose acetobutyrate (CAB) 531.01 and 645 g. ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate (EEP). An additional 25 g of EEP was placed in the distillation receiver. The water content in the CAB was removed by heating the mixture slowly with stirring under an inert nitrogen atmosphere to a temperature of 158 C. About 5 g of water was collected in the distillation receiver and drained off. The temperature of the solution was then lowered to 120 C. with continued stirring, and a mixture of 8.95 g. tert-butyl acetoacetate (TBAAEastman Chemical Co.) and 30.0 g. EEP was added slowly from a dropping funnel over a period of 30 minutes. Reaction mixture temperature was then increased to about 150 C. and about 3 g of byproduct tert-butanol was collected in the distillation receiver. Some of the t-butanol crystallized in long needles. A mixture of 269 g. xylene and 288 g. butyl acetate was added to the acetoacetate-functional polymer and the temperature reduced to 60 C. with continued stirring. A solution of 7.2 g. aminoethylpiperazine dissolved in 13.8 g butyl acetate was added slowly from a dropping funnel, while maintaining stirring of the reaction mixture and a temperature of 60-67 C. After heating the reaction mixture for one hour at 60 C., 1822 g methyl isobutyl ketone was added with stirring. The flask was then cooled to 25 C. The product with mixed hydroxy and amino functionality was a viscous amber colored solution with a measured viscosity of 150 Stokes and a measured solids content of 23.25%. Example 2 A 5-liter flask fitted as in Example I was charged with 944.5 g of Eastman Chemicals CAB 551.01 and 404.8 g of ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate (EEP), with an additional 25 g of EEP in the distillation receiver. Water was removed by heating and stirring under nitrogen to a temperature of 158 C. and draining off about 9.3 ml water from the distillation receiver. After heating to 167 C. to refill the distillation receiver with EEP, the temperature was lowered to about 140 C. and a mixture of 18.9 tert-butyl acetoacetate and 5.0 g. EEP added over 30 minutes. About 8 ml tert-butanol distilled into the receiver. The temperature was raised to 150 C. and a total amount of about 12.0 g of a combination of liquid and crystallized tert-butanol was collected. A mixture of 405 g xylene and 390 g butyl acetate was added to the flask and the temperature reduced to 60 C. before dropping in 15.1 g of aminoethylpiperazine. The temperature was held at 60 C. for an additional three hours, then 1336 g of methyl isobutyl ketone was added before cooling. The product was an amber liquid (color: Gardner 6) with a measured solids level of 30.05% and Gardner/Holdt viscosity of 132.5 centistokes. Examples 3, 4, 5 A variety of different cellulose acetobutyrates were treated as described in Example 2. The following table lists the amino-functional materials produced: Raw Mati.

Example 6 A mixture of 252 G of Eastman Chemicals CAB 551.01 and EEP was reduced in water content, treated with t-butylacetoacetate and diluted with xylene and butyl acetate as described in Example 2. The resulting solution containing acetoacetate-functional polymer was held at 31 C., then to it was added 1.4 g of dimethylaminopropyl amine dissolved in 15.0 g of butyl acetate. The mixture was heated to 117 C. and cooled while 144.2 g methyl isobutyl ketone was added in steps. The product was a dark amber liquid with solids level of 29.4% and viscosity of 140 centistokes. Example 7 A charge of 950 g of Eastman Chemicals CAB 531.1 and 644 g EEP (with an additional 30 g EEP) in the distillation receiver) was heated to 160 C. About 2 g water was collected in the distillation receiver. The reaction mixture was cooled to about 140 C. then to it was added 30 g t-butylacetoacetate and 15 g cyclohexane. The temperature was raised to 160 C. over a two-hour period. About 2 g 1-butanol was collected in the distillation receiver. The solution was then diluted with a mixture of 410 g butyl acetate and 390 g xylene and cooled to 60 C. A solution of 14.8 g aminoethylmorpholine and 15.0 g butyl acetate was dropped in over about 15 minutes and the temperature maintained at 60-67 C. for an additional three hours before 1625 g methyl isobutyl ketone was added. The product was an amber liquid with measured solids content of 23.4% and viscosity of 27 Stokes.

Also disclosed are starting and intermediary compounds, up to furanosides (D) having an analogous structure, processes for preparing said furanosides and their precursors, and their use. The anti-viral and anti-carcinogenic action of many nucleosides, which are used as pharmaceutical products, is of extremely great interest in medical circles. In recent years, fluorine-containing nucleosides in particular have become increasingly important. Compared with hydroxyl groups, fluorine atoms bond strongly to carbon atoms; they are for the most part chemically inert and have hydrophobic properties. On the other hand, the size of their atoms is similar to the size of hydroxyl groups. If, therefore, hydroxyl groups of a nucleoside are substituted by fluorine atoms, one can expect to obtain an excellent metabolic-antagonistic effect. Many fluorine-containing nucleosides have already been studied to determine their anti-viral properties and their cytotoxicity. The unusual properties of pyrimidine nucleosides having the formula (T0) defined later herein, and of purine derivatives having the formula (U0), suggest that these substances can be used as therapeutic agents to treat viral, and in particular retroviral infections, such as AIDS, etc. It is, however, a difficult matter to prepare these target substances. Conventional methods of preparation on a laboratory scale are technically complex, operate with toxic chemicals, and provide low overall yields, which in particular for reasons of costs cannot be improved upon.

H, halogen, NH 2 , NR 2 , N 3 In principle, two modifications must be carried out on the carbohydrate part of the nucleoside: the deoxygenation of the 3-position, as well as the introduction of fluorine into the 2-position. To perform these modifications of the functionality on the natural nucleoside is a difficult and protracted procedure. For example, Shiragami et al., J. Carbohydrates, Nucleosides Nucleotides, 11 (2-4), 391-400 (1982) at first produce cordycepin by regioselective bromination, followed by hydrogenolysis, and the cordycepin is then converted by fluorination with diethylaminosulphur trifluoride (DAST fluorination), with a low yield, into 9-(2,3-dideoxy-2-fluoro--D-threo-pentofuranosyl-adenine (2-Fdda). Therefore, in most of the synthesis strategies used so far, first the fluorinated nucleoside was prepared, starting from 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-arabinofuranose derivatives and then the 3-position was deoxygenated. However, the Barton deoxygenation process used, or modifications thereof, cannot be considered as a sensible production strategy for the reasons just given (Marquez et al., J.Med.Chem., (1990), 33, 978-985; Vemishetti et al., EP 428.109; Barchi et al., J.Med.Chem., (1991), 34, 1647-1655; Machin et al., EP 292.023). It therefore appeared advisable to carry out both manipulations of the carbohydrate part before the nucleoside synthesis. In EP 463.470, Okabe et al. accordingly propose a complicated, low-yield, 11-stage synthesis of 2,3-dideoxy-2-fluoro-5-0-trityl--D-threopentofuranosyl chloride, see formula (C), as the precursor stage of the nucleoside. An intermediate stage used in this process is obtained by Siddiqui et al., Tetr. Lett. (1994), 35, 3263-3266 from diacetone mannitol. The hitherto most interesting method of preparing the modified carbohydrate part appears in WO 92/01700. Here, 2 Fdda is produced in a 9-stage synthesis starting from 1,3,5, tri-O-benzoyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro--D-arabinofuranose. However, for synthesizing the decisive intermediate product, 5-0-benzoyl-2,3-dideoxy-2-fluoro--D-threopentofuranosyl bromide (see formula (Z)), it is also necessary to use the Barton deoxygenation method. A new, efficient way has been found of producing a similar but, when used, superior intermediate product: In particular, the present invention relates to an astonishingly short and efficient method of synthesizing an -furanoside having the general formula (D), described in detail later herein, in which the 5-position is protected by an ethereal protective group. This furanoside can easily be converted into a halogenose having the general formula (Z), which is dealt with in detail later herein, in which the 5-position is protected by an ethereal protective group. Among other things, the subject of the invention is the important compound (D1) according to claim 2 , which is also defined further below. It should be mentioned here that two, at first sight similar, compoundsmethyl-5-0-benzoyl-2,3-dideoxy-2-fluoro--D-threopentofuranoside and methyl-5-0-(tertbutyl-diphenylsilyl)-2,3-dideoxy-2-fluoro--D-threopentofuranosidewere synthesized according to WO 92/01700 as the starting material for a halogenose having the general formula (Z); the compounds (D0), which will also be defined in more detail below, and in particular the important compounds (D1), are far superior to the aforementioned compounds, not only because of their stability in the course of the subsequent reactions, but also because of their better handling characteristics in the necessary purification operations (through suitable substitution, it is possible in each case to emphasize specifically desired properties). While the first-mentioned compound known from WO 92/01700 differs entirely from the new compounds (D0) and (D1) because of its own protective group, which is not of the ether but of the ester type, the second of the above-mentioned compounds also possesses a serious disadvantage because of its -position of the aglycone and because of the protective group, which contains in particular Si; protective groups of the type R 0 1 , R 1 1 , according to claims 1 , 2 of this invention are significantly superior to the silicon protective groups as regards stability in the subsequent reactions. These new, important compounds having the general formula (D) are obtained in the present invention by fluorination from alkyl-5-0-R 1 -3-deoxy--D-xylofuranoside (a compound described later on and having the general formula (E)). According to Su et al. (JOC, (1981), 46, 1790-1792) fluorination of the corresponding -material did not appear to be promising. Methyl-5-0-benzoyl-3-deoxy--D-xylofuranoside (Jones et al., Tetr.Lett. (1991), 32, 247-250; Nair et al., JACS (1992), 114, 7951-7953) and methyl-3-deoxy-3-deutero-5-0-(4-methoxytrityl)--D-xylofuranoside (Pathak et al., Tetr.Lett. (1986), 42-5427-5441) have already been described as by-products in each case. The present invention relates to a group of closely related pentofuranoside derivates which can easily be converted into each other, and which are important intermediate stages along the path to synthesizing the key compound referred to above; the invention also describes in detail advantageous methods of producing the said compounds and also the use of these compounds. The following general diagram 1 provides an overviewby no means completeof the possible range of conversions, starting from the key compound (D) or (D 0 ) or (D 1 ) and leading to various valuable pharmaceutical active substances. Diagram 1: The following compounds are the subjects of the invention and together they form a unified group. In detail, these compounds are the compounds (D0) according to claim 1 . Within the framework of the invention, compound (D1) according to claim 2 is in particular preferred. This is an important, central starting product for the uncomplicated, direct conversion into the protected nucleosides having the formula T and U. The essential advantage of these compounds (D1) is that, as was discovered, following suitable substitution of the ethereal protective group at the 5-position, it is possible to achieve high stability of the protective group, which is advantageous to the process, and much easier cleavage of the protective group; also, because the physical properties are modified by the substitution, by-products can be separated out in a technically advantageous manner in the individual stages of the process. Compound (F) according to claim 3 is another subject of the invention. This compound is a starting product which can be easily converted for the purpose of ultimately obtaining compound (D) or (D0) or (D1) and (Z). Another subject of the invention is compound (H) according to claim 4 . This compound is an immediate starting compound for compound (F). Furthermore, in particular the two stereoisomeric compounds (I) and (J) according to claim 5 are also subjects of the invention. They form the essential base compounds for a sequence of process steps, which in all cases contains a relatively small number of stages, with in each case high yields, which ultimately lead to the compounds having the formulae (D) or (D0) or (D1)) and (Z). As a precaution, it should be mentioned here that (C 6 -C 20 )aryl denotes, for example, phenyl, naphthyl, 2-phenantryl or 2-triphenylenyl. The above-mentioned subjects of the invention are members of a group of important new intermediate compounds used in the preparation of the above-mentioned pharmaceutical active substances which are needed, to a rapidly increasing extent, for the effective control of virus-induced diseases and cancer. A further essential object of the invention is a new, uncomplicated and high-yield process for producing compounds of the type described, for example, in claim 6 . A further advantageous process method is based on the new compound (F) and is described in claim 7 . The process described in claim 8 is essentially carried out in three stages and, starting from the new compound (H), it leads, also with good yields, to the above-mentioned compound (D)or (D0) or (D1) and finally (Z). Claim 9 covers a preferred high-yield process, made up of several individual stages, for obtaining (D) with a sequence of reaction steps, starting from -configured -pentofuranosides which can be obtained without difficulty from pentoses. The subject of claim 10 is a less complicated but, as was found, effective variant of the above-mentioned process according to claim 9 . Despite the fact that they comprise multiple stages, both these last-mentioned variants of the process are characterized by simple, uncomplicated process control and surprisingly high yields. In order to clarify and illustrate the individual reactions and reaction stages of the processes according to the invention so far described, which are employed to obtain (D) as well as the selected compounds (D0) or (D1)) covered by the formula (D), according to claims 6 to 10 , attention is drawn in particular to Diagram 2, which is presented later herein; this diagram illustrates in a clear manner the preparation relationships between the various compounds and intermediate compounds according to, or obtainable according to, the invention. The new, selective multi-stage synthesis of the target compounds (D), and also (D0) or (D1)), according to the invention, proceeds from the last-mentioned multi-stage process, from compounds having the formulae (I) and/or (J). Under the basic conditions of the reaction, OR 3 is eliminated and a compound having the formula (H) is formed, whose enolic ester is saponified and the compound (G) is formed, which is rearranged into a compound having the formula (F). In order to avoid almost totally any condensations similar to the aldol type, it is especially favourable to make the hydride donor available right from the start; this donor stereoselectively reduces the 2-ulose (F), formed by saponification and rearrangement, to a compound having the formula (D) or (D0) or (D1)). Since the stereochemical information of the 2 and 3-positions is lost at the enolic ester stage, any -configured pentofuranoside whose 5-OH group is appropriately protected, can be used as the starting material. Especially preferred -configured pentofuranosides having the general formula (I), in which R denotes methyl, R 1 denotes substituted benzyl and R 2 and R 3 denote mesyl, can be obtained without difficulty by mesylation of compounds having the general formula (K), in which R denotes methyl and R 1 denotes substituted benzyl. Several methods are known for producing the above-mentioned compound (K), but must be rejected by an industrial chemist. For example, as early as in 1981 methyl-5-0-benzyl--D-xylofuranoside (Kawana et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., (1981), 54, 1492-1504) was synthesized in a 6-stage, low-yield process, with only a 30% yield being attained in the last stage. An interesting approach, namely opening the benzylidene ring of methyl-3-5-0-benzylidene--D-xylofuranoside (Liptak et al., Tetrahedron (1981) 37, 2379-2382), possesses some serious disadvantages. For example, the use of LiALH 4 makes it impossible for safety reasons to use this reaction on a large scale; in addition, quite considerable quantities of by-products, such as (3-0-benzyl ether) are formed, and separating these from the desired main product, 5-0-benzyl ether, causes very serious problems. Surprisingly, opening this benzylidene ring using the reagent NaCNBH 3 /HCl leads, regioselectively to high yields of the desired compound (K1). While it is true that NaCNBH 3 /HCl has already been described as a ring-opening reagent (Johansson et al., JCS Perkin Trans 1, (1984), 2371-2374, Garegg et al., Carb. Res. (1982), 108, 97-101), it was only applied to pyranosides. A further aspect of the present invention relates to an extremely efficient process for producing compounds having the general formula (O) according to claim 19 . All hitherto known methods for synthesizing xylofuranoside have the problem that they produce pyranosides as by-products. This situation can be improved by using trifluoroacetic acid as the catalyst (Dhawan et al. Carb. Res. (1988), 183, 47-57), but this cannot be employed on an industrial scale because the large amount of catalyst used (given in vol. % of the solvent) would greatly complicate the processing and also generate high procurement and disposal costs. Astonishingly, the use of iodine (I 2 ) as the catalyst in catalytic quantities gives rise to almost pure / mixtures of furanosides. For example, by reacting D-xylose in an alcohol, excellent yields can be obtained using catalytic amounts of I 2 at reflux temperature. This is all the more astonishing since at reflux temperature the traditional methods produce pyranosideswhich are not wanted hereas the main products. Fischer glycosidation (reaction of D-xylose with an alcohol) takes place preferably in the presence of iodine (I 2 ) as the catalyst. The catalyst is used in concentrations of 0.1 to 20 mol %, relative to the amount of sugar used. The reaction temperature may be between room temperature andpreferablyreflux temperature, and the reaction times are between 1 and 48 hours, depending on the reaction conditions. The reaction with non-substituted or substituted benzaldehyde dimethyl acetals is carried out in a customary, recognized manner employed without any problems by organic chemistsnamely reacetalization in the presence of an acid catalyst. The opening reaction of the non-substituted or substituted benzylidene ring of the -anomer also does not pose the experimenter with any problems, if the reaction conditions are exactly maintained. The benzylidene ring and NaCNBH 3 are presented in an inert solvent and a solution containing an inorganic acid or Lewis acid is slowly added drop by drop in a way that either maintains a constant pH value and/or prevents gas from developing. The reaction temperatures may lie between 50 and 50 C. Alcohols or ethers are used as the preferred inert solvents. The subsequent introduction of sulfonic acid ester groups at the 2 and 3 positions occurs in the presence of at least an equimolar amount of baserelative to sulfonyl halide. Organic bases such as tertiary amines, e.g. pyridine, may be used as bases; they may also be used as solvents. The deoxygenation step takes place preferably in a solvent or in mixtures thereof, when mixtures are used, preferably one of them may be inert and also practically hydrophobic under the reaction conditions used. The solvents or mixtures thereof should in any case partially dissolve the reagents and starting compounds used. The solvents are advantageously selected from the group of aqueous, water-miscible, alcoholic, polyol or ether-like solvents, such as in particular alcohols, polyols and ethers, e.g. methanol/toluene, or dioxane/water mixtures, methanol, isopropanol, 2,3-butanediol, THF and/or ethylene glycol. The bases may be inorganic bases such as KOH, NaOH, Na 2 CO 3 or organic bases, such as in particular Na-oxalate, tetrabutylammonium oxalate and tetrabutylammonium fluoride. Favourable reaction temperatures occur in the range from 10 to 150 C., preferably from 40 to 80 C. Typical hydride sources such as, in particular, sodium borohydride, lithium aluminium hydride, tertrabutylammonium borohydride, hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, sodium hydride and diisobutylaluminium hydride may be considered as hydride donors. Diagram 2: Elimination/deoxygenation reactions of a similar type to those found in the present invention (starting from (I) or (J) after (H) or (F) or (E)) are known, but they relate either to nucleosides (JOC, (1973), 38, 598-; (1973) 38, 1283-; J. Carbohydrates, Nucleosides, Nucleotides, (1975), 2, 47; Chem. Pharm. Bull., (1995) 23, 1411-), non-sugars (Tetr. Lett., 1980), 21, 2453) or sugars which possess neither the -position of the aglycone required for the process, nor a suitable sugar configuration and also no inert protective group at the 5-position (Chem. Ind. (1970), 94, Carbohydrate Res. (1970), 14, 315). The conversion of a compound having the formula (E) into a compound having the formula (D) according to the above diagram 2 may take place directly by reaction with DAST or through nucleophilic substitution of a suitable leaving group, such as the trifluoromethanesulfonyl group or the imidazolesulfonyl group. By way of example, the p-bromobenzenesulfonyl group should be mentioned as another suitable leaving group. In order to introduce the leaving group, a compound having the formula (E) is presented in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, e.g. chlorinated hydrocarbons, ethers, and at least an equimolar amount of base is added. Organic bases such as pyridine, triethylamine and/or imidazole may be considered as the bases, and each base may be used alone as a diluent. Next, a halide or anhydride of sulfonic acid or of carboxylic acid, such as trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride or anhydride is added in an equimolar amount or in excess, while stirring. If the leaving group is the imidazolesulfonyl group, sulfuryl chloride is added in an equimolar amount or in slight excess, advantageously in the presence of an excess of imidazole. Purification may possibly be carried out through crystallization, column chromatographic separation or similar. The fluorination is advantageously accomplished by adding at least an equimolar amount of a fluoride donor, such as potassium fluoride, sodium fluoride, cesium fluoride, tetraalkylammonium fluoride, in which methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl groups are suitable as the alkyl groups, but the butyl groups are preferred, also polyhydrogen fluorides.e.g. pyridinium polyhydrogen fluoride, KHF 2 , tetraalkylammonium bifluoride in a solvent which is inert under the selected reaction conditions, e.g. in particular chlorinated hydrocarbons, e.g. methylene chloride, ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran, nitrites, e.g. acetonitrile, alcohols and polyols, e.g. butanol, ethylene glycol or mixtures of such solvents. Depending on the way in which the reaction is controlled, the nucleophilic substitution of the leaving group by fluorine may also take place in the presence of an acid, such as HF or methanesulfonic acid. Depending on the method used, the reaction temperatures vary; however they lie within the range of 50 to 200 C.; under basic conditions 50 to 30 C. and under acid conditions 30 to 150 C. are preferred. At this point it should especially be pointed out that the present invention is based in particular on the discovery that when ether protective groups are present in the 5 position in the compounds under discussion here, especially when compared to the hitherto normally used compounds possessing ester protective groups in that position, certain advantages, namely better stability in the preparation and subsequent reactions, easy and selective cleavage, also technically and economically advantageous processing possibilities, are obtained when preparing the various above-mentioned compounds, i.e. intermediate and target compounds, and also when further processing them into valuable active ingredients for pharmaceuticals. A further subject of the invention is a preferred process, as outlined in claim 11 , for further processing the target compound (D) into a compound (Z), which is an intermediate compound in the preparation of fluorine-containing nucleosides, which are important for the control of viral diseases and cancer, and also, but not necessarily, after condensation with a derivative of a nucleobase and subsequent cleavage of the protective group, pharmaceutically effective, final nucleosides from diagram 1 itself, especially for example the nucleosides (T) and (U) or (TO) and (UO) may be prepared. Especially advantageous results may be obtained in the present case by employing the method described in claims 12 and 13 . Another important aspect is also the preparation of the various intermediates (E), (I), (H) accumulating or occurring at the end of the respective reaction stages in the process of obtaining (D), according to claims 14 and 15 . In order to obtain a high degree of economy in the various preparation phases and thus also to secure the multi-stage processes according to the invention, it is particularly advantageous to employ a method according to claim 16 to prepare the starting materials for one of the core zones of the invention. Claim 17 demonstrates a preferred route according to the invention for obtaining high yields of the particularly useful compounds (I),or (J). A preferred method for the preparation of the compounds (I) and (J) from readily commercially available starting materials is described in claim 18 . If it is intended, within the framework of the invention, to produce a starting substance (K), which is referred to in claim 17 and this is a particularly preferred and also particularly advantageous substance both in terms of yield and puritythen preference should be given to the new and special synthesis route described in claim 19 ; it was found that special variants of individual stages of this synthesis, which are described in claims 20 and 21 , are particularly advantageous both as regards yield and as regards the lack of disruptive side reactions. Compounds (K) obtained in the course of the aforementioned advantageous reactions may be conveniently used to prepare compounds (I), as is provided for in claim 22 . In addition, in order to obtain high yields, special preference should be given to maintaining the process conditions, which have already been partially described, relating to solvents, reactands, acid binders (bases), catalysts and temperatures, as per one of the claims 23 and 24 . Special attention should also be drawn to the fact that all the processes, individual process steps and results described so far can be used with special advantage to prepare the furanoside derivatives having the above-mentioned formulae (DO) and (D1)), as described in claim 25 . The essential advantages of the invention and of the individual subjects of the invention may be described as follows: They make available a group of similar compounds or of intermediate compounds which permit, for the first time, chemically relatively uncomplicated and therefore economically very advantageous ways to be found for preparing the pharmaceutical active substances described at the beginning, which are rapidly gaining in importance for their high anti-viral effectiveness coupled with minimum cytotoxicity. The special advantages lie in particular in the fact that essentially only cheap or, if need be, cheaply prepared starting substances and reagents are required, the amount of apparatus and manipulation required is very modest, and each of the sections of the preparation processes or each of the preparation processes themselves, as claimed and as described in more detail above, is capable of providing surprisingly good yields of target products which are easy to separate from impurities. Thus, compared with the state of the art, which so far was only able to provide processes requiring a large numbersee the opening remarksof extremely complicated stages, and only difficult-to-produce and expensive chemicals, and cumbersome reactions, it is now possible, and this is highly advantageous, for the first time to use multi-stage processes having economically very acceptable overall yield quotas in this field of furanoside derivatives. For the first time, a method has been shown which will help ensure that nothing now stands in the way of the wide-scale preparation and use of medications for controlling the diseases mentioned at the beginning. It should furthermore be mentioned that, as has been shown, the arrangement of an ether protective groupwhich also comprises cyclic ether groups such as tetrahydropyranylin the 5 position of the new pentofuranoside derivatives, offers some very significant advantages for the preparation process, namely: The compounds and intermediates used and obtained according to the invention possess astonishingly high stability towards the reagents and process conditions used. Ultimately, this has a very advantageous effect on the separation, isolation and purification of each desired compound and thus, to a large extent, also on its yield. Finally, it should not go unmentioned that the comprehensive use of the new compounds and intermediates prepared according to the invention, for the purposes set forth here in the description, and in particular in claims 26 and 27 , together with the provisions contained therein, are essential aspects of the invention. The present invention will now be described in more detail on the basis of the following examples, which describe typical compounds or intermediates and their preparation.

Such compounds are useful for treating diseases whose symptoms and/or damage are related to the binding of VCAM-1 to cells expressing VLA-4. This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/056,718, filed Aug. 22, 1997 and 60/094,592, filed Jul. 29, 1998. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) supergene family, is expressed on activated, but not resting, endothelium. The integrin VLA-4 (a 4 b 1 ), which is expressed on many cell types including circulating lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes, but not neutrophils, is the principal receptor for VCAM-1. Antibodies to VCAM-1 or VLA-4 can block the adhesion of these mononuclear leukocytes, as well as melanoma cells, to activated endothelium in vitro. Antibodies to either protein have been effective at inhibiting leukocyte infiltration and preventing tissue damage in several animal models of inflammation. Anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to block T-cell emigration in adjuvant-induced arthritis, prevent eosinophil accumulation and bronchoconstriction in models of asthma, and reduce paralysis and inhibit monocyte and lymphocyte infiltration in experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Anti-VCAM-1 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to prolong the surival time of cardiac allografts. Recent studies have demonstrated that anti-VLA-4 mAbs can prevent insulitis and diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice, and significantly attenuate inflammation in the cotton-top tamarin model of colitis. Thus, compounds which inhibit the interaction between 4 -containing integrins and VCAM-1 will be useful as therapeutic agents for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as RA, multiple sclerosis (MS), asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has been discovered that compounds of the formula: and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof wherein X, X, Y and Z are as defined below, inhibit the binding of VCAM-1 to VLA-4 and so would be useful in treating inflammatory diseases in which such binding contributes to the disease process.

The compounds of the invention inhibit the binding of VCAM-1 and fibronectin to VLA-4 on circulating lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes (VLA-4-expressing cells). The binding of VCAM-1 and fibronectin to VLA-4 on such cells is known to be implicated in certain disease states, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and particularly in the binding of eosinophils to pulmonary endothelium which contributes to the cause of the pulmonary inflammation which occurs in asthma. Thus, the compounds of the present invention would be useful for the treatment of asthma. On the basis of their capability of inhibiting binding of VCAM-1 and fibronectin to VLA-4 on circulating lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes, the compounds of the invention can be used as medicament for the treatment of disorders which are known to be associated with such binding. Examples of such disorders are rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease. The compounds of the invention are preferably used in the treatment of diseases which involve pulmonary inflammation, such as asthma. The pulmonary inflammation which occurs in asthma is related to eosinophil infiltration into the lungs wherein the eosinophils bind to endothelium which has been activated by some asthma-triggering event or substance. Furthermore, compounds of the invention also inhibit the binding of VCAM-1 and MadCAM to the cellular receptor alpha4-beta7, also known as LPAM, which is expressed on lymphocytes, eosinophiles and T-cells. While the precise role of alpha4-beta7 interaction with various ligands in inflammatory conditions such as asthma is not completely understood, compounds of the invention which inhibit both alpha4-beta1 and alpha4-beta7 receptor binding are particularly effective in animal models of asthma. Furthermore work with monoclonal antibodies to alpha4-beta7 indicate that compounds which inhibit alpha4-beta7 binding to MadCAM or VCAM are useful for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. They would also be useful in the treatment of other diseases in which such binding is implicated as a cause of disease damage or symptoms. The compounds of the invention can be administered orally, rectally, or parentally. e.g., intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intrathecally or transdermally; or sublingually, or as opthalmalogical preparations, or as an aerosol in the case of pulmonary inflammation. Capsules, tablets, suspensions or solutions for oral administration, suppositories, injection solutions, eye drops, salves or spray solutions are examples of administration forms. Intravenous, intramuscular, oral or inhalation administration is a preferred form of use. The dosages in which the compounds of the invention are administered in effective amounts depending on the nature of the specific active ingredient, the age and the requirements of the patient and the mode of administration. Dosages may be determined by any conventional means, e.g., by dose-limiting clinical trials. Thus, the invention further comprises a method of treating a host suffering from a disease in which VCAM-1 of fibronectin binding to VLA-4-expressing cells is a causative factor in the disease symptoms or damage by administering an amount of a compound of the invention sufficient to inhibit VCAM-1 or fibronectin binding to VLA-4-expressing cells so that said symptoms or said damage is reduced. In general, dosages of about 0.1-100 mg/kg body weight per day are preferred, with dosages of 1-25 mg/kg per day being particularly preferred, and dosages of 1-10 mg/kg body weight per day being especially preferred. The invention further comprises pharmaceutical compositions which contain a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such compositions may be formulated by any conventional means. Tablets or granulates can contain a series of binders, fillers, carriers or diluents. Liquid compositions can be, for example, in the form of a sterile water-miscible solution. Capsules can contain a filler or thickener in addition to the active ingredient. Furthermore, flavour-improving additives as well as substances usually used as preserving, stabilizing, moisture-retaining and emulsifying agents as well as salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers and other additives can also be present. The previously mentioned carrier materials and diluents can comprise any conventional pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic substances, e.g., water, gelatine, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, talc, gum arabic, polyalkylene glycols and the like. Oral unit dosage forms, such as tablets and capsules, preferably contain from 25 mg to 1000 mg of a compound of the invention. The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by any conventional means. In reaction Scheme 1, a compound of formula 1 in which R 1 is H or lower alkyl, and which is a known compound or can be prepared by standard methodology, is treated with a reducing agent capable of selectively reducing a nitro group in the presence of a benzylic alcohol. This procedure is advantageously carried out in the presence of a derivatizing agent of the formula R 2 OCOX wherein X is a leaving group and R 2 is tert-alkyl, benzyl or the like so as to form a readily cleavable protecting group, thus leading directly to a compound of formula 2. For example, this procedure can be conveniently carried out by catalytic hydrogenation of 1 over Pd in ethyl acetate in the presence of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate to give a derivative of 2 in which R 2 is tert-butyl. Conversion to an aldehyde of formula 3 can be carried out using any one of a variety of oxidizing agents capable of oxidizing a benzylic alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde, for example activated manganese dioxide in a suitable solvent, for example dichloromethane. Reaction of 3 to give a dehydroamino acid of formula 5 can be effected by treatment with a Wittig reagent of formula 4 in which R 3 is lower alkyl and R 4 is an alkoxy group, for example benzyloxy- or tert-butoxy- or represents a portion of one of the acyl groups of the compounds of the invention, for example substituted lower aryl. For example treatment of 3 with ()-N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)--phosphonoglycine trimethyl ester in the presence of a suitable base for example tetramethyl guanidine leads directly to a dehydroamino acid of formula 5, R 3 methyl and R 4 benzyloxy. Enantioselective reduction of 5 to the L-amino acid 6 can be effected by use of a number of reducing agents suitable for the purpose, for example, the recently described ethyl-DuPHOS rhodium reagent (Burk, M. J., Feaster, J. E.; Nugent, W. A.; Harlow, R. L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 10125) using essentially the literature procedure. One process for the conversion of compounds of structure 6 into compounds of the invention is shown in Reaction Scheme 2. The protecting group incorporating R 2 can be removed under conditions dependent on the particular choice of R 2 as well as R 3 and R 4 . The choice of these groups will be dependent on the particular target compound. A variety of common protecting groups and their use are described in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2 nd edition, Wiley Interscience, New York, 1991. For example when R 2 is a tert-butyl group and R 3 is lower alkyl and R 4 is either a benzyloxy group or represents a portion of one of the acyl groups of the compounds of the invention, for example ortho-substituted aryl, treatment with trifluoroacetic acid either neat or in dichloromethane solution in the presence of suitable scavengers, for example, triethylsilane or anisol leads to a compound of formula 7. This compound can be coupled with a carboxylic acid of formula 8 using standard peptide coupling conditions, for example HBTU in the presence of DIPEA in a polar, aprotic solvent such as DMF at a temperature between 0 C. and room temperature to give a compound of formula 9. In the carboxylic acid of formula 8, R 5 may represent a substituted alkyl group, a substituted aromatic ring, or a substituted heteroaromatic ring. R 5 may also incorporate suitably protected reactive functionalities to permit final conversion into compounds of the invention. The choice and use of such groups will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Depending on the choice of R 4 and whether an ester or acid is the final goal of the synthesis, compound 9 may be a compound of the invention or in the case that R 4 is a protecting group, for example, a benzyloxy group, it may be removed under appropriate conditions, for example by catalytic hydrogenation over Pd in a suitable solvent such as a lower alcohol to give a compound of formula 10. This intermediate can be coupled with a carboxylic acid of formula 11 using standard peptide coupling conditions, for example HBTU in the presence of DIPEA in a polar, aprotic solvent such as DMF at a temperature between 0 C. and room temperature to give a compound of formula 12. In the carboxylic acid of formula 11, R 6 may represent a portion of a compound of the invention, for example ortho-substituted aryl or hetereoaryl. These compounds are known compounds or can be prepared by known methods. R 6 may also incorporate suitably protected reactive functionalities to permit final conversion into compounds of the invention. The choice and use of such groups will be apparent to those skilled in the art. If the acid 13 is the target compound, conversion of a compound of formula 12 can be effected using standard hydrolysis conditions appropriate for the particular choice of R 3 and any functional groups present as part of R 5 and R 6 . In the case where R 3 is lower alkyl, treatment with an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium hydroxide in aqueous THF is generally effective. In reaction Scheme 3, a compound of formula 14 in which R 7 is a lower alkyl group which may serve as a protecting group or a group suitable for use in a prodrug for example methyl, ethyl, tert-butyl or the like or represents a connection to a solid phase resin, for example a Wang resin, is coupled with a carboxylic acid of formula 11 using standard peptide coupling conditions, for example HBTU in the presence of DIPEA in a polar, aprotic solvent such as DMF at a temperature between 0 C. and room temperature to give a compound of formula 15. Reduction of the nitro group of 15 can be effected by catalytic hydrogenation for example using Pd as a catalyst or by treatment with a standard reducing agent, for example SnCl 2 . The resulting compound of structure 16 is useful as a key intermediate for several series of compounds. In the instance highlighted in Scheme 3, it can be coupled with an acid of formula 8 using standard peptide coupling conditions, for example HBTU in the presence of DIPEA in a polar, aprotic solvent such as DMF at a temperature between 0 C. and room temperature to give a compound of formula 17. Compound 17 may be a compound of the invention depending on the nature of R 7 or may be converted to a compound of the invention by an appropriate hydrolysis procedure, for example in the case where R 7 is lower alkyl, by hydrolysis by treatment with excess alkali metal hydroxide, such as lithium hydroxide in aqueous alcohol. When R 7 represents a resin suitable for solid phase synthesis, appropriate hydrolysis conditions will depend on the choice of resin. In the case of Wang resin, treatment with trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of appropriate scavengers will lead to an acid of formula 18. In a method particularly well suited for solid phase synthesis, an N-Alloc-amino-N -Fmoc protected phenylalanine derivative of formula 19 can be coupled to a resin suitable for solid phase synthesis, for example, a Wang resin using standard coupling procedures, for example, by forming a mixed anhydride with 2,6-dichlorobenzoyl chloride and carrying out the coupling reaction in a polar, aprotic solvent such as N-methyl pyrrolidinone to give a compound of structure 20 in which R 7 represents the resin. The Alloc group may be removed by standard methods, for example by treatment with a reducing agent such as nBu 3 SnH in the presence of a catalyst which is a source of Pd 0 , for instance, Pd(Ph 3 P) 2 Cl 2 to give an amine derivative of structure 21. This compound can be coupled with a carboxylic acid of formula 8 using standard peptide coupling conditions, for example HBTU in the presence of DIPEA in a polar, aprotic solvent such as DMF at a temperature between 0 C. and room temperature to give a compound of formula 22. The Fmoc protecting group may be removed from 22 using standard base treatment well known to those practicing peptide chemistry, for example with piperidine in DMF, to afford an amine of formula 23. The resulting compound 23 can be coupled with a carboxylic acid of formula 11 using standard peptide coupling conditions, for example HBTU in the presence of DIPEA in a polar, aprotic solvent such as DMF at a temperature between 0 C. and room temperature to give a compound of formula 24. Finally the compound of structure 24 can be cleaved from the resin under conditions dependent on the particular choice of resin. For example, in the case of a Wang resin, acid treatment with trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethae in the presence of scavengers as necessary will afford a compound of formula 18. Depending on the particular synthetic target, the order of removal of the protecting groups from 19 may be altered so that the Fmoc group is first removed, coupling of the resulting amine with an acid of formula 11 is carried out followed by removal of the Alloc group and coupling of the product with an acid of formula 8 and cleavage from the resin. Also the choice of protecting groups can be modified to reflect the reactivities of the resin or choice of R 7 and the nature of any functional groups incorporated into R 5 and R 6 . Compounds derived from 3- or 4-(alkylamino)phenylalanine derivatives can be prepared as outlined in Reaction Scheme 5. A compound of formula 16 or 7 may be treated with diazomethane in a suitable solvent, for example, ethyl ether to give products of formulas 25 and 26 respectively in which R 8 is methyl. Alternatively, the compound of structure 16 or 7 may be treated with an lower alkyl aldehyde or ketone, for example acetone, to give an intermediate Schiffs base which is in turn subjected to catalytic hydrogenation or reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride in the presence of an organic acid, for example acetic acid to give a compound of formula 25 or 26 in which R 8 is lower alkyl other than methyl. Conversion of compounds 25 or 26 to prodrug esters 27 or 28 or to the corresponding acids 29 or 30 respectively can be carried out as described above in Reaction Schemes 2 and 3. For the preparation of 3- or 4-sulfonylamnino phenylalanine derivatives, compounds of formula 7, 16, 25 or 26 may be reacted with a sulfonyl chloride of formula 31, in which R 9 is a substituted aryl or heteroaryl moiety, in an inert solvent, for example dichloromethane in the presence of a non-nucleophilic base, for example triethylamine or pyridine at about 0 C. to room temperature to give compounds of structure 32 or 33 respectively as illustrated in Reaction Scheme 6 for compounds 7 and 26. These can be further converted to compounds of formulas 34 and 35 if desired using the general methods described above in Reaction Schemes 2 and 3. For the preparation of compounds derived from 3- or 4-aminomethylphenylalanine, the procedure shown in Reaction Scheme 7 may be employed. A 3- or 4-hydroxymethyl benzoate of formula 36 in which R 10 is lower alkyl, which are known compounds, or can be prepared by known methods, is treated with a silylating agent in which R 11 -R 13 are lower alkyl or phenyl, for example tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride in an inert solvent, for example dimethylformamide in the presence of imidazole at about 0 C. to give a silyl protected compound of formula 37. Reduction of 37 may be carried out using a variety of suitable reducing agents, for example, lithium aluminum hydride in an inert solvent such as ether or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of about 0 C. followed by an aqueous workup to give an intermediate alcohol which can be oxidized by any of several oxidizing agents suitable for oxidizing benzyl alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes, for example activated manganese dioxide, to give an aldehyde of formula 38. Monosilyl protected diols are alternatively available from 3- or 4-hydroxymethylbenzylalcohols by monosilylation and separation of the side products. Alternatively, an ester of formula 37 may be reduced directly to an aldehyde of formula 38 using diisobutylaluminum hydride at low temperature, for example at 78 C. Reaction of 38 to give a dehydroamino acid of formula 39 can be effected by treatment with a Wittig reagent of formula 4 in which R 3 is lower alkyl and R 4 is an alkoxy group, for example benzyloxy- or tert-butoxy- or represents a portion of one of the acyl groups of the compounds of the invention, for example ortho-substituted aryl or hetereoaryl. For example treatment of 38 with ()-N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)--phosphonoglycine trimethyl ester in the presence of a suitable base for example tetramethyl guanidine leads directly to a dehydroamino acid of formula 39. R 3 methyl and R 4 benzyloxy. Enantioselective reduction of 39 to the L-amino acid 40 can be effected by use of one of a number of reducing agents suitable for the purpose, for example, the recently described ethyl-DuPHOS rhodium reagent. It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the optimal procedure for the further conversion of 40 into compounds of the invention will depend on the choices of R 4 and R 3 . For the case wherein R 3 is lower alkyl and R 4 is benzyloxy, conversion to an amine of formula 41 can be conveniently effected by catalytic transfer hydrogenation of 40 over Pd in a suitable solvent, for example, methanol in the presence of ammonium formate as the reducing agent. Acylation of 41 with a carboxylic acid of formula 11 can be carried as described above in Reaction Scheme 2 to give a compound of formula 42. Conditions for removal of the silyl protecting group will depend on the particular choice of R 11 -R 13 . In the case of R 11 , R 12 methyl and R 13 tert-butyl, this group is readily removed by treatment with a strong acid, for example hydrochloric acid in an appropriate solvent for the choice of R 3 , for example where R 3 is methyl, methanol. The resulting benzylic alcohol of formula 43 can be converted to an amine of formula 45 using procedures well established for similar transformations. For example, the alcohol of formula 43 can be converted to a leaving group, for example a mesylate by treatment with methane sulfonyl chloride in the presence of a proton acceptor, for example pyridine, followed by displacement with an alkali metal azide, for example sodium azide in a polar aprotic solvent such as dimethylformamide. Alternatively, the transformation from 43 to an azide of formula 44 can be carried out directly by treatment with diphenyl phosphorazidate as described in: Thompson, A. S.; Humphrey, G R.; DeMarco, A. M.; Mathre, D. J.; Grabowski, E. J. J. J. Org. Chem. 1993, 58, 5886-5888. Reduction of the azide 44 to an amine of formula 45 can be carried out by a number of means suitable for the conversion of azides to amines, for example by treatment with a phosphine, for example triphenyl phosphine in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane or THF followed by an aqueous workup or by catalytic hydrogenation over an appropriate catalyst, for example Pd in a solvent suitable for catalytic hydrogenations such as a lower alkanol or tetrahydrofuran. The resulting amine of formula 45 can be converted into the corresponding compounds of the invention using the procedures applicable to free amines described in the other reaction schemes. For example, coupling of 45 with a carboxylic acid of formula 8 under the conditions described in Reaction Scheme 2 leads to an amide of formula 46 which may be further converted to an acid of formula 47 if desired by base catalyzed hydrolysis as described in Reaction Scheme 2. For the synthesis of urea derivatives, a compound of formula 26 can be treated with an isocyanate of formula 49, wherein R 14 is substituted aryl, substituted heteroaryl or substituted lower alkyl with potentially reactive substituents protected as appropriate using conventional protecting group strategies, in a suitable inert solvent, for example dichloromethane, to give a urea of formula 50. More generally, a compound of formula 26 can be treated with a phosgene equivalent, for example, triphosgene in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane in the presence of a non-nucleophilic proton acceptor, for example diisopropylethylamine, to give an intermediate of formula 48. Subsequent treatment of a compound of formula 48 with an amine of formula 51 in which R 15 and R 16 are independently hydrogen, substituted lower alkyl, substituted aryl, substituted heteroaryl or taken together form a substituted 5, 6 or 7 membered ring leads to a compound of formula 52. Further conversion, if necessary, of 50 or 51 to compounds of the invention can be carried out as described in Reaction Scheme 5. For the synthesis of imides, an aminophenylalanine derivative of structure 53 in which R 1 is H or lower alkyl, R 6 is as previously defined and R 7 is H or a readily cleavable group such as substituted benzyl, tert-butyl, allyl, or the like, or in the event that a prodrug ester is desired as the final product, is that ester group, for example ethyl, is employed. Compounds of formula 53 can be readily obtained from intermediates described above in Reaction Scheme 2. Reaction of a compound of formula 53 with a cyclic anhydride of formula 54 in an inert solvent, for example dichloromethane leads to a ring opened intermediate of formula 55. The structure implied by 54 includes bicyclic molecules which may incorporate fused aromatic or heteroaromatic rings. In place of 54, it is also possible to use dicarboxylate acids which are capable of forming cyclic imides. In the latter case, a condensing agent must be employed in the first step, for example carbonyl dimidazole. Treatment of the compound of formula 55 with a reagent such as carbonyl diimidazole capable of effecting cyclodehydration leads to an imide of formula 56. Further manipulation of functional groups which were present on the an hydride of formula 54 and modification of R 7 may be carried out on compound 56 as desired to obtain further analogs using standard chemistry which is compatible with the presence of the imide functionality. For the synthesis of compounds of the invention in which R 1 is halogen, preferably chloro, the appropriate halogen atom can be inserted at various points during the course of the synthesis depending on the nature of the additional functionality in the molecule. For example a compound of formula 6 in which R 1 is hydrogen can be treated with a mild chlorinating agent, for example, N-chlorosuccinimide in the presence of a proton acceptor, for example, sodium acetate to give the corresponding compound of formula 6 in which R 1 is chloro. In the case where 6 is derived from 3-amino-L-phenylalanine, a mixture of regioisomers may ensue which may be separated at a convenient point in the overall synthesis. Other intermediates described in the above schemes may be more suitable starting materials for halogenation for a particular target molecule. The particular merits of individual candidate starting materials will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For the synthesis of the thiazolidinones of formula 62 described in reaction scheme 10, an aminophenylalanine derivative of structure 16, in which R 6 and R 7 are as previously defined may be employed. Reaction of 16 with an -mercapto carboxylic acid of formula 59 in which R 20 can be hydrogen, lower alkyl or aryl, for example -mercapto acetic acid, and an aldehyde of formula 60 in which R 21 can be alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or a substituted aryl group, for example benzaldehyde, in an appropriate solvent such as benzene, THF or a lower alcohol, for example methanol, in the presence of a water scavenger such as 4 molecular sieves at 60 to 80 C. provides compound of formula 61. Compound 61 may be a compound of the invention depending on the nature of R 7 or may be converted to a compound of the invention by an appropriate hydrolysis procedure, for example in the case where R 7 is lower alkyl, by treatment with excess alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide in aqueous alcohol. When R 7 represents a resin suitable for solid phase synthesis, the appropriate hydrolysis conditions will depend on the choice of resin. In the case of Wang resin, treatment with trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of appropriate scavengers will lead to an acid of formula 62. The sequence may be initiated with related anilines, for example a compound of formula 7 in which R 1 is lower alkyl or halogen to give the corresponding thiazolidinones. For the synthesis of imidazolidinones of formula 67 shown in reaction scheme 11, an aminophenylalanine derivative of structure 16 in which R 6 and R 7 are as previously defined may be employed. Compound 16 can be readily obtained through the synthesis described in reaction scheme 3. This compound can be coupled with a N-protected -amino acid of formula 63, in which R 22 can be a lower alkyl or an aryl group, R 23 can be a natural or unnatural D- or L--amino acid side chain or R 22 and R 23 together can form a ring, for example a proline or pipicolinic acid ring and R 24 may be a standard amine protecting group suitable for the particular selection of R 6 , R 7 , R 22 , and R 23 for example tert-butoxycarbonyl. The coupling reaction can be effected using standard peptide coupling conditions, for example HBTU in the presence of DIPEA in a polar, aprotic solvent such as DMF at a temperature between 0 C. and room temperature to give a compound of formula 64. Depending on the nature of protecting group R 24 , an appropriate deprotection method is employed to give a compound of formula 65. In the event that the protecting group R 24 is a Boc group, the deprotection can be carried out by the reaction of 64 with HCl in dioxane at room temperature. Reaction of compound 65 with an aldehyde of formula 60, in which the R 21 is as defined above, in the presence of a water scavenger such as 4 molecular sieves at 60 to 80 C. in an appropriate solvent, for example THF, provides a compound of formula 66. Compound 66 may be a compound of the invention depending on the nature of R 7 or may be converted to a compound of the invention by an appropriate hydrolysis procedure, for example in the case where R 7 is lower alkyl, by hydrolysis by treatment with an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide in aqueous alcohol to give a carboxylic acid of formula 67. For the synthesis of imidazolidinones of formula 68 described in reaction scheme 12, an aminophenylalanine derivative of structure 16 in which R 6 and R 7 are as previously defined is employed. Compound 16 can be readily obtained through the synthesis described in reaction scheme 3 in the case of R 7 is lower alkyl. This compound can be coupled with a N-protected -amino acid of formula 69, in which R 25 can be a natural or unnatural. D- or L--amino acid side chain and R 26 is a nitrogen protecting group of the type conventionally used in peptide chemistry for example, a Fmoc group, using standard peptide coupling conditions, for example HBTU in the presence of DIPEA in a polar, aprotic solvent such as DMF at a temperature between 0 C. and room temperature to give a compound of formula 70. Depending on the nature of protecting group R 26 , an appropriate deprotection method is employed to give compound of formula 71. In the case of the protecting group R 26 is Fmoc group, it may be removed from 70 using standard base treatment well known to those practicing peptide chemistry, for example with piperidine in DMF, to afford an amine of formula 71. The compound 71 can then react with an aldehyde 60, in which R 21 is as previously defined, in the presence of a water scavenger such as 4 molecular sieves in an appropriate solvent such as dichloromethane or THF at 25-60 C. to give an imine of formula 72. The imine 72 may then be treated with an acylating agent such as the acyl chloride of formula 74 in which R 27 can be an alkyl or aryl group in the presence of a base such DIPEA or DBU in an appropriate solvent such as dichloromethane or THF at 25-60 C. to give an acyl imidazolidinone of formula 73. Alternatively, other reactive acylating group such as acid anhydrides or mixed anhydrides may be employed in this reaction. Compound 73 may be a compound of the invention, or depending on the nature of R 7 may be converted to a compound of the invention by an appropriate hydrolysis procedure, for example in the case where R 7 is lower alkyl, by hydrolysis by treatment with an alkali metal hydroxide, for example sodium hydroxide in aqueous alcohol to give, after acidification, a carboxylic acid of formula 68. The sequence may be initiated with related anilines, for example a compound of formula 7 in which R 1 is lower alkyl or halogen to give the corresponding 3-acyl imidazolidinones. Ortho-substituted benzoic acid derivatives which are not commercially available can be prepared by conventional means. For example ortho-substituted aryl iodides or triflates may be carbonylated in the presence of carbon monoxide and a suitable palladium catalyst. The preparation of such iodide or triflate intermediates is dependent on the particular substitution pattern desired and they may be obtained by direct iodination or diazotization of an aniline followed by treatment with a source of iodide for example, potassium iodide. Triflates may be derived from the corresponding phenols by conventional means such as treatment with trifluoromethane sulfonic anhydride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine in an inert solvent. Other means of obtaining ortho-substituted benzoic acids involves treatment of an 2-methoxyphenyloxazoline derivative such as 75 with an alkyl Grignard reagent followed by hydrolysis of the oxazoline ring following the general procedure described by Meyers, A. I., Gabel, R., Mihelick, E. D, J. Org. Chem. 1978, 43, 1372-1379., to give an acid of formula 76. 2- or 2,6-Disubstituted benzonitriles also serve as convenient precursors to the corresponsing benzoic acids. In the case of highly hindered nitrites, for example 2-chloro-6-methylbenzonitrile, conventional hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions is difficult and better results are obtained by DIBAL reduction to the corresponding benzaldehyde followed by oxidation using a chromium oxidizing reagent.

A stirred suspension of 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (10.2 g; 67 mmol) in acetic anhydride (100 mL; 1.06 mol) under anhydrous conditions was treated with pyridine (0.5 mL). In the mildly exothermic reaction, the solids dissolved within several minutes and the mixture was maintained at 40 C. for five hours. The reaction was concentrated in vacuo to about half volume, then water (30 g) in the form of ice chips was added at such a rate that the temperature remained 45 C. When the exotherm had subsided, a second portion of water (200 mL) was added slowly and the mixture was stirred for another 30 minutes. The precipitated solid was filtered, washed with water and dried to constant weight in vacuo over P 2 O 5 to give 3-acetoxyphenylacetic acid (11.7 g) which was used without further purification. In an inert atmosphere, a solution of the above 3-acetoxyphenylacetic acid (1.942 g; 10 mmol), diphenylphosphoryl azide (2.8 g; 10.17 mmol) and DIPEA (1.92 mL; 11 mmol) in benzene (25 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 1 hr, then the reaction temperature was slowly raised to 70 C. Evolution of gas began to be evident as the reaction temperature reached approximately 55 C. and became much more vigorous as the reaction temperature approached 70 C. Within 30 minutes at that temperature gas evolution had stopped and the reaction solution containing the formed 3-acetoxybenzylisocyanate was cooled to 40 C. Another portion of DIPEA (3.84 mL; 22 mmol) was added, followed by 4-amino-2-chlorobenzoic acid methyl ester hydrochloride salt (2.95 g; 13.3 mmol) and the brownish purple solution was stirred and heated at reflux under argon overnight. The reaction mixture was cooled, diluted with benzene (50 mL) and washed in turn with 1N HCl (50 mL) and dilute brine. The aqueous layers were re-extracted with benzene, then the combined, dried (MgSO 4 ) organic extracts were evaporated and the crude residue was purified by HPLC (silica gel; ethyl acetate-hexane-2:3). Evaporation of the appropriate fractions provided 3.24 g of the solid urea which was then crystallized from dichloromethane-ethyl acetate to give 4-3-(3-acetoxybenzyl)ureido-2-chlorobenzoic acid methyl ester (2.71 g) as a colorless solid. mp 113-114 C.

Examination of the reaction mixture by TLC suggested the presence of considerable starting material, so additional amounts of triphenylphosphine (0.842 g; 3.21 mmol), diethyl azodicarboxylate (0.565 g; 3.21 mmol) and trimethylsilyl azide (0.43 mL; 3.21 mmol) were added. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for an additional 40 hr. After the solvents were removed under reduced pressure, the residue was taken up in dichloromethane (100 mL) and washed with water (250 mL). The aqueous extracts were backwashed in turn with dichloromethane (50 mL) and the combined, dried (MgSO 4 ) extracts were evaporated in vacuo. From a previous experiment it had been established that the reaction yielded a complex, difficultly separable, mixture of several products, some deacetylated and/or de-esterified. Accordingly, in this experiment, the residue was dissolved in a mixture of methanol (30 mL) and 1N lithium hydroxide (15 mL) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hr to complete the hydrolyses of both the ester and phenolic acetate groups. Most of the volatiles were removed under reduced pressure then the basic solution was diluted with water (20 mL) and washed with dichloromethane (230 mL). The aqueous layer was then acidified with 1N HCl (16 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (250 mL).

Example 179 VLA-4/VCAM-1 Screening Assay VLA-4 antagonist activity, defined as ability to compete for binding to immobilized VCAM-1, was quantitated using a solid-phase, dual antibody ELISA. VLA-4 (41 integrin) bound to VCAM-1 is detected by a complex of anti-integrin 1 antibody: HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG: chromogenic substrate (K-Blue). Initially, this entailed coating 96 well plates (Nunc Maxisorp) with recombinant human VCAM-1 (0.4 g in 100 l PBS), sealing each plate and then allowing the plates to stand at 4 C. for 18 hr. The VCAM-coated plates were subsequently blocked with 250 l of 1% BSA/0.02% NaN 3 to reduce non-specific binding. On the day of assay, all plates are washed twice with VCAM Assay Buffer (200 l/well of 50 mM Tris-HCl. 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MnCl 2 ), 0.05% Tween 20; pH 7.4). Test compounds are dissolved in 100% DMSO and then diluted 1:20 in VCAM Assay Buffer supplemented with 1 mg/mL BSA (i.e., final DMSO5%). A series of 1:4 dilutions are performed to achieve a concentration range of 0.005 nM-1.563 M for each test compound. 100 l per well of each dilution is added to the VCAM-coated plates, followed by 10 l of Ramos cell-derived VLA-4. These plates are sequentially mixed on a platform shaker for 1 min, incubated for 2 hr at 37 C., and then washed four times with 200 l/well VCAM Assay Buffer. 100 l of mouse anti-human integrin 1 antibody is added to each well (0.6 g/mL in VCAM Assay Buffer1 mg/mL BSA) and allowed to incubate for 1 hr at 37 C. At the conclusion of this incubation period, all plates are washed four times with VCAM Assay Buffer (200 l/well). A corresponding second antibody, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (100 l per well 1:800 dilution in VCAM Assay Buffer1 mg/mL BSA), is then added to each well, followed by a 1 hr incubation at room temperature and concluded by three washes (200 l/well) with VCAM Assay Buffer. Color development is initiated by addition of 100 l K-Blue per well (15 min incubation, room temp) and terminated by addition of 100 l Red Stop Buffer per well. All plates are then read in a UV/Vis spectrophotometer at 650 nM. Results are calculated as % inhibition of total binding (i.e. VLA-4VCAM-1 in the absence of test compound).

Calcein-AM was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. Methods VLA-4 (41 integrin) antagonist activity, defined as ability to compete with cell-surface VLA-4 for binding to immobilized VCAM-1, was quantitated using a Ramos-VCAM-1 cell adhesion assay. Ramos cells bearing cell-surface VLA-4, were labeled with a fluorescent dye (Calcein-AM) and allowed to bind VCAM-1 in the presence or absence of test compounds. A reduction in fluorescence intensity associated with adherent cells (% inhibition) reflected competitive inhibition of VLA-4 mediated cell adhesion by the test compound. Initially, this entailed coating 96 well plates (Nunc Maxisorp) with recombinant human VCAM-1 (100 ng in 100 l PBS), sealing each plate and allowing the plates to stand at 4 C. for 18 hr. The VCAM-coated plates were subsequently washed twice with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, and then blocked for 1 hr (room temperature) with 200 l of Blocking Buffer (1% BSA/0.02% thimerosal) to reduce non-specific binding. Following the incubation with Blocking Buffer, plates were inverted, blotted and the remaining buffer aspirated. Each plate was then washed with 300 l PBS, inverted and the remaining PBS aspirated. Test compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO and then diluted 1:25 in VCAM Cell Adhesion Assay Buffer (4 mM CaCl 2 , 4 mM MgCl 2 in 50 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 7.5) (final DMSO4%). A series of eight 1:4 dilutions were performed for each compound (general concentration range of 1 nM-12.500 nM). 100 l/well of each dilution was added to the VCAM-coated plates, followed by 100 l of Ramos cells (200,000 cells/well in 1% BSA/PBS). Plates containing test compounds and Ramos cells were allowed to incubate for 45 min at room temperature, after which 165 l/well PBS was added. Plates were inverted to remove non-adherent cells, blotted and 300 l/well PBS added. Plates were again inverted, blotted and the remaining buffer gently aspirated. 100 l Lysis Buffer (0.1% SDS in 50 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.5) was added to each well and agitated for 2 min on a rotary shaking platform. The plates were then read for fluorescence intensity on a Cytofluor 2300 (Millipore) fluorecence measurement system (excitation485 nm, emission530 nm).

The triazines of the present invention can be selected for the EL devices of copending application U.S. Ser. No. 09/164,753. COPENDING APPLICATIONS Illustrated in copending applications U.S. Ser. No. 09/489,144, and U.S. Ser. No. 09/489,754, disclosures of which are totally incorporated herein by reference, are triazines and electroluminescent devices containing triazines. The appropriate components and processes of the above copending applications may be selected for the present invention in embodiments thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to organic electronic materials, and more specifically, to organic electron transport materials or luminescent materials comprised of novel triazine compounds, and which compounds can be selected for organic electroluminescent (EL) devices, and other optoelectronic devices including photoconductive devices and the like. PRIOR ART Organic electron transport materials or n-type organic semiconductors are useful for a number of device applications. For example, they can be selected for electron transport materials or luminescent materials in organic EL devices. An organic EL device with a multilayer structure can be formed as a dual layer structure comprising one organic layer adjacent to the anode supporting hole transport, and another organic layer adjacent to the cathode supporting electron transport and acting as the organic luminescent zone of the device. Another alternate device configuration for an EL device is comprised of three separate layers, a hole transport layer, a luminescent layer, and an electron transport layer, which layers are laminated in sequence and are sandwiched between an anode and a cathode. Optionally, a fluorescent dopant material can be added to the emission zone or layer whereby the recombination of charges results in the excitation of the fluorescent. Typically, organic EL devices with multi-layered configurations comprise an anode, a hole transport layer, and an electron transport layer in contact with a cathode. This electron transport layer is intended to assist injection of electrons from the cathode. A known class of electron transport materials, which may also function as an luminescent layer, are the metal complexes of 8-hydroxyquinoline, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,539,507, 4,720,432, and 5,151,629. A another known class of electron transport materials for EL devices are 1,3,5-oxidiazole compounds, such as those disclosed in Japanese Journal of Applied Physics , Part 2, vol. 34, L824 (1995), and 1,3,5-triazine a hole blocking layer in organic EL devices, reference Fink et al. in Macromolecular Symposia , vol. 125, 151 (1997). While recent progress in organic EL research has elevated the potential of organic EL devices for widespread applications, the performance levels of current available devices may still be below certain expectations. Further, for visual display applications, organic luminescent materials should provide a satisfactory color in the visible spectrum, normally an emission maxima at about 460, 550 and 630 nanometers for blue, green and red. The metal complexes of 8-hydroxyquinoline, such as tris(8-hydroxyquinolinate) aluminum, generally fluoresce in green or a longer wavelength region, and which materials are suitable for use in EL devices with light emission in green or longer wavelength region. Although, a number of known electron transport materials may fluoresce in blue region, the performance characteristics of the EL devices may possess many disadvantages such as poor operation stability. Thus, there continues to be a need for electron transport materials for organic EL devices, which are suitable for the design of EL devices with satisfactory emission in the visible spectrum of, for example, from about 400 nanometers to about 700 nanometers. There is also a need for electron transport materials, which can enhance the EL charge transporting characteristics, thus desirably lowering device driving voltages; electron transport materials for EL devices comprised of a cathode comprised of a less active metal such as aluminum and which device can maintain desirable performance characteristics such as low driving voltage, and acceptable operation stability. Further, there is a need for electron transport materials, which are vacuum evaporable and can form thin films with excellent thermal stability. These and other needs and advantages can be achievable with the present invention in embodiments thereof.

Technical Field of the Invention The invention relates to a process for the preparation of (5--(dialkylamino)alkylamino-8-hydroxyimidazo4,5,1-deacridin-6-ones of general formula (I), wherein R 1 and R 2 represent alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms which may be the same or different and n is 2 to 5. These compounds show anti-neoplastic activity, in particular against leukaemia, melanomas or colon adenocarcinomas, as more fully set forth in Z. Mazerska et al., Anti-Cancer Drug Design 11, 73-88 (1996). The invention further relates to certain new 1--(dialkylamino)alkylamino-4-substituted-7-hydroxyacridin-9(10H)-ones, useful as intermediates in the process of the invention and also having anti-neoplastic activity. 2. Description of the Related Art Methods of preparation of the imidazoacridinones of general formula I are known from PCT Application WO-A-92/15583 and W. Cholody et al. J. Med. Chem 35, 378-382 (1992), and depend on cyclisation of amines of general formula (II). The amines (II) can be prepared by a multi step process, as described in the above patent application and shown in Scheme 1: It was a problem that the 7-hydroxy-4-amino-1--(dialkylamino)alkylaminoacridin-9(10H)-one compounds of formula II are unstable. See particularly W. Cholody et al. J. Med. Chem. 35, 378-382 (1992), at page 379, right-hand column. This problem might be overcome by running the reduction and cyclisation as a single step in a one pot reaction, by heating the nitro compounds of formula III with Raney nickel and formic acid. This reaction was carried out in the context of synthesising some imidazo4,5,1-de1,4-diazepino5,6,7-mnacridines, see W. Cholody et al., J. Heterocyclic Chem. 29, 1749-1752 (1992). This procedure does not require isolation of the unstable amine (II). Unfortunately, however, another problem arose. The purification of the preferred compound 5-2-(diethylamino)ethylamino-8-hydroxyimidazo4,5,1-deacridin-6-one, of formula I, wherein R 1 and R 2 are ethyl and n is 2, free of nickel ions is difficult because both the compound and nickel ions are soluble in acidic solution, but precipitated by adding alkali. This is a serious problem, expected to arise to a greater or less degree with all the compounds of formula I, especially as they are intended for pharmaceutical use. When, to avoid contamination by nickel ions, the reduction-cyclisation mixture composed of Raney nickel and formic acid was replaced by formic acid and palladium, the product compounds of formula (I) decomposed slowly during the reaction. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that the last-mentioned problem can be solved if the reduction is carried out in formic acid at room temperature or slightly above, in the presence of palladium catalyst and either (a) a hydrogen-provider such as hydrogen gas or (b) formate ions, substantially all the palladium catalyst is removed and the substantially palladium-free solution is heated to effect cyclisation. Further, this method provided an unexpected, additional benefit. Namely, the order of the operations of deprotecting the hydroxy groups and reacting the 4-chloro compound with the amine could be reversed and the deprotection could then be carried out in the same one-step reaction as the reduction and cyclisation. By this means three reactions can be carried out in one step, thus reducing the overall number of steps from four to two. The reduction reaction produces an N-formyl compound as intermediate. This N-formyl compound is then cyclised. The overall Scheme is shown below as Scheme 2: Accordingly, the present invention provides a process of preparing a compound of formula (I): wherein R 1 and R 2 are alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and n is from 2 to 5, which comprises reacting a 1-chloro-7-(protected hydroxy)-4-nitroacridin-9(10H)-one of Formula (IV-P): wherein A is a hydroxy-protecting group removable by reduction, with an -(dialkylamino)alkylamine of formula NH 2 (CH 2 ) n NR 1 R 2 in which n, R 1 and R 2 are as defined above, to produce a 7-(protected hydroxy)-4-nitro-1--(dialkylamino)alkylaminoacridin-9(10H)-one of formula (III-P): in which A, n, R 1 and R 2 are as defined above, reducing the compound of formula (III-P) at a temperature of from 15 to 50 C. with a reducing agent stronger than formic acid, such as hydrogen gas or formate anions, in the presence of a palladium catalyst and formic acid, removing substantially all the residual palladium and heating the remaining reaction mixture, typically at a temperature above 50 C., to effect cyclisation to the corresponding compound of formula (I). The compound of formula (I), if produced as an addition salt, may be converted to the free base and vice versa. Any known procedures for these purposes may be used. The invention further includes the N-formyl compounds (II-For) of formula shown in Scheme 2 per se, their preparation by isolation from the above-described filtrate from which substantially all the palladium has been removed, and their conversion to the corresponding compound of formula I comprising heating to effect cyclisation. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The process of the invention requires as starting material a 4-nitro-1-chloro compound of formula (IV-P) in which the hydroxy group is protected. These compounds IV-P can be prepared by preliminary steps shown in Scheme 3 below: The hydroxy-protecting group, A, may be any which prevents the OH from reacting with the carboxylic acid function of the benzoic acid derivative in Scheme 3 and may be removed by reduction, preferably benzyl (PhCH 2 ). Other such usable protecting groups include allyl, 4-(dimethylaminocarbonyl)benzyl or arylbenzyl carbonate. An example of a preparation in accordance with Scheme 3 can be found in Example 2 of European Patent EP-B-0145226 (Warner-Lambert Co.), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Turning now to the process of the invention shown in Scheme 2, the amination step may be carried out in any of the ways described in PCT Application WO-A-92/15583 or in European Patent EP-B-0145226, the disclosures of which in relation thereto are herein incorporated by reference. Preferably amination is by heating at moderately elevated temperature, e.g. 40 to 80 C., in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide. The preferred classes of compounds of formula (I) are those in which n is 2 or 3; also those in which R 1 and R 2 are the same, especially both methyl or both ethyl, so the same preferences (separately or together) apply to the amine reactant. The reduction can be carried out by using hydrogen gas. While this reaction is best carried out at room temperature, say 15-30 C., the benefits of the invention are diminished, but not extinguished, at higher temperatures up to 50 C., especially up to 40 C. Alternatively the reduction can be carried out by using a salt of formic acid, for example ammonium formate, instead of hydrogen, and raising the temperature to between 30 and 50 C. In either case, formic acid, preferably at 80-98% w/v in water, is used. Preferably the formic acid is at 90-97% strength. The palladium catalyst may be present in any amount conventional in this reaction. It is removed from the reaction after reduction is judged to be complete, which is usually within the range 5 to 30 hours, typically 20 hours, at room temperature, depending on the amount of catalyst and stirring rate, and a correspondingly shorter time at slightly elevated temperature. Conveniently it is removed by filtration. The resultant reaction mixture, substantially free of palladium, is then heated to effect cyclisation, preferably to a temperature of above 50 C. and preferably from 80 C. up to reflux. No additional solvent is necessary, formic acid serving this purpose. The cyclisation reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a strong acid (a term which excludes formic acid, which is considered a weak acid), most preferably one which will form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt such as hydrochloric or methanesulphonic acid. Sulphuric acid is less preferred. Use of hydrochloric acid has been found to shorten the reaction time from 48 to 10 hours. The compound of formula (I), obtained as the acid addition salt in the preferred method or by acidifying the free base, may be purified by crystallisation. The preferred compound (n2, R 1 R 2 C 2 H 5 ) may be crystallised from water or ethanol-water. Conveniently it is dissolved in hot 50% v/v aqueous ethanol, additional ethanol is optionally added and the solution allowed to crystallise. The novel process avoids deprotection of 7-hydroxy group in a separate step, and thus avoids operation with the possibly mutagenic hydroxy intermediate. The new intermediate (III-P) can be prepared from chloro derivative (IV-P) with very good yields and is easy to purify. The process avoids operations involving free, very unstable amine (II), and does not involve isolation of the amine even as a salt. Further, it avoids the problem of contamination of the potential pharmaceutical product by metal ions derived from Raney nickel. Alternatively, the reaction mixture, substantially free of palladium, is treated to work up the N-formyl compound (II-For), at a temperature below 40 C. This compound can then be crystallised and cyclised by heating in a solvent, to give the corresponding compound I. The compounds II-For show an anti-neoplastic, especially anti-leukaemia, effect and are thus useful in their own right as well as intermediates in the preparation of compounds I. The present invention will now be described further by way of illustration only by reference to the following non-limiting Examples. Further embodiments of the invention will occur to those skilled in the art in the light of these. EXAMPLES Example 1 1. Preparation of 1-2-(diethylamino)ethylamino-7-benzyloxy-4-nitroacridin-9(10H)-one (III-P) A mixture of 7-benzyloxy-1-chloro-4-nitroacridin-9(10H)-one (IV-P) (9.52 g, 25 mmol), 2-diethylaminoethylamine (4.3 ml, 30 mmol) and triethylamine (3.5 ml, 25 mmol) in dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulphoxide (150 ml) was stirred and heated at 60 C. for 1 hour. Next water (500 ml) and a concentrated solution of sodium carbonate (40 ml) were added and the precipitate was filtered, washed with water and dried to give 10.8 g (94%) of crude product. Crystallisation from dimethylformamide (100 ml) gave analytically pure product, yield 10 g (87%). 2.

Next the catalyst was filtered off, and the filtrate was heated at 90 C. for 48 hr. (Alternatively, concentrated hydrochloric acid (5 ml) was added and the reaction time reduced to 10-15 hr). The solvent was evaporated under vacuum, the residue treated with 150 ml of hot 50/50 solution of concentrated hydrochloric acid and methanol, cooled and filtered to give the crude product (7 g, 79%). The crude product was refluxed in 50% ethanol (30 ml) with charcoal (1.5 g) for 5 min. The hot solution was filtered, 95% ethanol (100 ml) was added and the solution was left for crystallisation for 20 hours. The product was filtered and washed with ethanol to give yellow crystals of the product (6.4 g, 72%). Example 2 1. Preparation of 5-2-(diethylamino)ethylamino-8-hydroxy-imidazo4,5,1-de-acridin-6-one Dihydrochloride (I) A mixture of 1-2-(diethylamino)ethylamino-7-benzyloxy-4-nitroacridin-9(10H)-one (III-P) (2.3 g, 5 mmol), ammonium formate (2.5 g) and 10% palladium on charcoal (0.25 g) in 96% formic acid (25 ml) was stirred at 40 C. until completion of the reaction as judged by TLC, typically 20 hours. Next the catalyst was filtered off, and the filtrate was heated at 90 C. for 48 hr. (Alternatively, concentrated hydrochloric acid (1 ml) was added and the reaction time reduced to 10-15 hours). The solvent was evaporated under vacuum, the residue treated with 150 ml of hot 50/50 solution of concentrated hydrochloric acid and methanol, cooled and filtered to give the crude product (71. g, 77%).

The present invention was made under grant number CA-17625 from the National Cancer Institute and grant number CHE-9412095 from the National Science Counsel. The United States government has rights in the instant invention. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to new compounds within the general class of 2-aryl-1,8-naphthyridin-4-ones. The present invention also relates to methods of inhibiting cellular mitosis and/or tumor growth. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The microtubule system of eukaryotic cells is an attractive target for the development of compounds useful in anticancer chemotherapeutics. Microtubules show highly dynamic instability and play an important role in cellular mitosis. Chemicals that attack microtubules through their major structural component, tubulin, disrupt or suppress both microtubule structure and normal functions by inhibition or promotion of microtubule assembly. Inihibition or arrest of cellular mitosis is the result. One example of conventional antimitotic agents includes the vinca alkaloids, which inhibit microtubule polymerization. Another example of conventional antimitotic agents includes the taxoids, which promote microtubule assembly. Colchicine is another conventional antimitotic agent. Although colchicine has limited medicinal application due to its high toxicity, it has played a fundamental role in elucidation of the properties and fictions of tubulin and microtubules. Many natural products, such as comigerine, podophyllotoxin, steganacin, and combretastatins, bind to the colchicine site of tubulin. Structurally, the compounds binding to this site are much simpler than those binding to vinca alkaloid or taxol domains. These compounds generally possess a biaryl system connected by a hydrocarbon bridge of variable length. In the course of this groups search for novel plant-derived potent cytotoxic agents that are active against slow-growing solid tumors, we have isolated several flavonols as antitumor principles from a phytochemically and biologically heretofore uninvestigated plant, Polanisia dodecandra . Among these flavonols, 5,3-dihydroxy-3,6,7,8,4-pentamethoxyflavone showed remarkable cytotoxicity in vitro against panels of central nervous system, lung, ovarian, colon, and renal cancers and against melanoma and leukemia cell lines with GI 50 values in the low micromolar to nanomolar concentration range. Flavonoids also possess the biaryl structural pattern of compounds binding to the colchicine site. We found that this compound is a strong inhibitor of tubulin polymerization with an IC 50 value of 0.830.2 M and to be a potent inhibitor of radiolabeled colchicine binding to tubulin, showing 59% inhibition when present in an equimolar concentration with colchicine. Paralleled with our studies of plant antitumor agents, we synthesized a large series of 2-aryl-1,8-naphthyridiones, which are the amino analogs of cytotoxic antimitotic flavonoids, and found that many of these compounds were cytotoxic and possess activitity against tubulin polymerization and colchicine binding; There remains a need in the art for cytotoxic agents for use in cancer therapy. There remains a need in the art for agents capable of inhibiting cellular mitosis for use in cancer therapy. Further there remains a need in the art for methods of treating cancer and methods of providing cancer therapy.

More specifically, A is an aromatic moeity selected from the group consisting of six-member aromatic hydrocarbon rings, five-member aromatic heterocyclic rings containing 1 or 2 heteroatoms, and six-member aromatic heterocyclic rings containing 1, 2, or 3 heteroatoms, where any of these rings may include from 0 to 4 substiuents for five-member rings, or 0-5 substituents for six-member rings, which substituents are defined by variables R 4 -R 8 . Specific examples of suitable aromatic moeities within the scope of the definition of A of the Formula I of the present invention include, but are not limited to phenyl, pyridinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrrole, imidazole, furan, thiophene, oxazole, thiazole, where any of those aromatic moeities may be substituted as represented by R 4 -R 8 defined hereinabove. The substituents R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 , R 7 , and R 8 may be any of the species identified above, or two adjacent R groups (i.e., two R groups which are next to each other) may form a bridging group. More specifically, R 1 and R 2 may be a bridging group such that R 1 and R 2 together with the atoms to which they are attached may form a five- or six-member aromatic ring; R 2 and R 3 may be a bridging group such that R 2 and R 3 together with the atoms to which they are attached may form a five- or six-member aromatic ring; R 4 and R 5 may be a bridging group such that R 4 and R 5 together with the atoms to which they are attached may form a five- or six-member aromatic ring; R 5 and R 6 may be a bridging group such that R and R together with the atoms to which they are attached may form a five- or six-member aromatic ring; R 7 and R 8 may be a bridging group such that R 6 and R 7 together with the atoms to which they are attached may form a five- or six-member aromatic ring; R 7 and R 8 may be a bridging group such that R 7 and R 8 together with the atoms to which they are attached may form a five- or six-member aromatic ring. For example, the five or six-member rings which may be formed when adjacent R groups are defined as a bridging group include six-member aromatic hydrocarbon rings; which are defined when adjacent R groups are alkydienyl; five-member aromatic heterocyclic rings, which are defined when adjacent R groups are alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneimine, and alkylenediimine; and six-member aromatic heterocyclic rings, which are defined when adjacent R groups are alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneimine, and alkylenediimine. As is evident from the general Formula I and the definition of the aromatic moeity A, the compounds of Formula I may be substituted from 1 to 8 times. More specifically, the compounds of Formula I may be substituted from 1 to 3 times in the A ring (i.e., the first ring of the structure) and from 1 to 5 times in the C ring (i.e., the aromatic moeity defined by the variable A). The compounds of Formula I include compounds having substitutions in only the A or only the C ring or in both rings. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, when the C ring is a six-member heterocyclic moeity, the R group substituent attached at the position of the heteroatom on the ring is absent in order to accomodate the valence requirements of the heteroatoms. Similarly, when the C ring is a five-member heterocyclic moeity containing an O or S, the R group substituent attached at the position of the O or S is absent in order to accomodate the valence requirements of that heteroatom. Thus, if A is a five-member heterocycle of the formula: wherein X 4 is O or S, the dashed line connected to X 4 (i.e., between positions 4 and 5) is a single bond, the dashed line between positions 1 and 2 is a double bond, and R 7 is absent. In the embodiment wherein X 4 is N, the dashed line connected to X 4 (i.e., between positions 4 and 5) may be either a single bond or a double bond, the dashed line between positions 1 and 2 is a double bond, and if the dashed line connected to X 4 is a double bond, R 7 is absent. In the embodiment wherein X 5 is O or S, all dashed-lines are double bonds and R 5 is absent. Similarly, when A is a heterocycle of the formula: wherein X 3 is N and all dashed lines are double bonds, R 4 is absent. The other heterocyclic rings encompassed by the instant invention are similarly determined. One skilled in the art will readily appreciate the valence requirements of the different heteroatoms and will interpret the definitions of the variables in the present invention in a manner consistent with those requirements. The compounds of Formula I wherein A is any of a six-member aromatic hydrocarbon ring, a five-member aromatic heterocycle, or a six-member aromatic heterocycle may be produced according to the following Scheme I. wherein A and R 1 -R 8 are as defined hereinabove. The compounds of Formula IV above are commercially available and may be produced according to techniques known in the art. According to this method, the compounds of Formula II are reacted with the compounds of Formula IV in an organic solvent to yield the Schiff base intermediate of Formula VI. Typically, the reaction is carried out under heat, and preferably at the reflux temperature of the solvent. Suitable solvents will be known to those skilled in the art, and include, for example, benzene, toluene, and m-xylene. The reaction is carried out until about 90-95% of the theoretical amount of water is recovered. The intermediates of Formula VI can be recovered by evaporating the organic solvent and distilling the residue. The compounds of Formula VI are then cyclized to the intermediate compounds of Formula V by reaction with a triethylamine and anhydrous chloroacetyl chloride. Typically the cyclization of the compounds of Formula VI to produce the compounds of Formula V is carried out in an appropriate organic solvent. Examples of suitable organic solvents include but are not limited to ethylether, methylene chloride, and tetrahydrofuran. Ethylether is currently the preferred organic solvent for the cyclization reaction. The compound of Formula V (i.e., the pyridopyrimidinone intermediate) can be recovered using conventional recovery techniques including extraction with an organic solvent. Preferably, the compounds of Formula V are recovered by allowing the condensation reaction mixture, including the compounds of Formula V, to cool to room temperature, neutralizing the mixture with a base such as sodium hydroxide, extracting the compounds of Formula V with an appropriate organic solvent, such as methylene chloride, and passing the extract through a silica gel column. The compounds of Formula V may then be thermally converted to the compounds of Formula I. The thermal conversion of the compounds of Formula V involves a rearrangment which forms the compounds of Formula I. The thermal conversion of the compounds of Formula V may be accomplished by adding the compound of Formula V to mineral oil, such as liquid paraffin, at a temperature of between about 300 C. and about 400, preferably about 350 C. After the reaction is complete, the compounds of Formula I may be recovered using silica gel chromatography and eluting with a mixture of methylene chloride and ethylacetate. Alternatively, the compounds of Formula I wherein A is a six-member hydrocarbon ring can also be produced according to the following Scheme II. wherein R 1 -R 8 are as defined above. The starting substituted ethyl benzoylacetates of Formula III can be prepared according to techniques described in A. Krapcho, et al., Organic Synthesis 5:198 (1973), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The substituted 2-aminopyridine of Formula I are commercially available. A compound of Formula II is combined with a compound of Formula III and polyphosphoric acid and heated to a temperature above about 100 C., preferably above about 110 C., and most preferably about 125 C. at atmospheric pressure. Preferably, the condensation reaction is carried out while stirring the mixture. If desired, the progression of the condensation reaction can be monitered by thin layer chromatography using techniques known to those skilled in the art. The product of the condensation reaction is the pyridopyrimidine intermediate compound of Formula V-A. The compound of Formula V-A may be recovered and subsequently thermally converted to the compounds of Formula I wherein A is a six-member aromatic hydrocarbon ring (i.e., compounds of Formula I-A), according to the techniques described hereinabove for converting compounds of Formula V to compounds of Formula I. The compounds of Formula V and VI are useful intermediates for the preparation of compounds of Formula I. In one embodiment, preferred compounds of Formula I which are produced according to the methods of the present invention include compounds of Formula I wherein A is X 1 , X 2 , and X 3 are each C (i.e., A is a a six-member aromatic hydrocarbon), all dashed lines are double bonds, and R, is alkyl.

The compounds of Formula I are useful as pharmaceutically active agents. The compounds of Formula I may be formulated for administration for the treatment of a variety of conditions. In the manufacture of a pharmacuetical formulation according to the invention, the compounds of Formula I and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof, or the acid derivatives of either thereof (hereinafter referred to as the active compound) are typically admixed with, inter alia, an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with any other ingredients in the formulation and must not be deleterious to the patient The carrier may be a solid or a liquid, or both, and is preferably formulated with the compound as a unit-dose formulation, for example, a tablet, which may contain from 0.5% to 95% by weight of the active compound. One or more active compounds may be incorporated in the formulations of the invention, which may be prepared by any of the well known techniques of pharmacy consisting essentially of admixing the components, optionally including one or more accessory ingredients. The formulations of the invention include those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, buccal (e.g., sub-lingual), parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, or intravenous) and transdermal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated and on the nature of the particular active compound which is being used. Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented in discrete units, such as capsules, cachets, lozenges, or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. Such formulations may be prepared by any suitable method of pharmacy which includes the step of bringing into association the active compound and a suitable carrier (which may contain one or more accessory ingredients as noted above). In general, the formulations of the invention are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active compound with a liquid or finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the resulting mixture. For example, a tablet may be prepared by compressing or molding a powder or granules containing the active compound, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the compound in a free-flowing form, such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, and/or surface active/dispersing agent(s). Molded tablets may be made by molding, in a suitable machine, the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid binder. Formulations suitable for buccal (sub-lingual) administration include lozenges comprising the active compound in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth,; and pastilles comprising the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia. Formulations of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise sterile aqueous preparations of the active compound, which preparations are preferably isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations may be administered by means of subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intradermal injection. Such preparations may conveniently be prepared by admixing the compound with water or a glycine buffer and rendering the resulting solution sterile and isotonic with the blood. Formulations suitable for rectal administration are preferably presented as unit dose suppositories. These may be prepared by admixing the active compound with one or more conventional solid carriers, for example, cocoa butter, and then shaping the resulting mixture. Formulations suitable for topical application to the skin preferably take the form of an ointment, cream, lotion, paste, gel, spray, aerosol, or oil. Carriers which may be used include vaseline, lanoline, polyethylene glycols, alcohols, transdermal enhancers, and combinations of two or more thereof. Formulations suitable for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches adapted to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. Formulations suitable for transdermal administration may also be delivered by iontophoresis (see, for example, Pharmaceutical Research 3 (6):318 (1986)) and typically take the form of an optionally buffered aqueous solution of the active compound. Suitable formulations comprise citrate or bistris buffer (pH 6) or ethanol/water and contain from 0.1 to 0.2M active ingredient The compounds of Formula I inhibit tubulin polymerization and have antimitotic activity. Such compounds are useful for the treatment of conditions including psoriasis, gout, papiloma, warts, and various tumors including but not limited to non-small cell lung cancer, colon cancer, central nervous system cancers, melanoma, overian cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer. Data regarding the activity of compounds of Formula I is provided in the Examples which follow. Subjects to be treated by the methods of the present invention are typically human subjects although the methods of the present invention may be useful with any suitable subjects known to those skilled in the art, and particularly mammalian subjects including, in addition to humans, horses, cows, dogs, rabbits, fowl, sheep, and the like. As noted above, the present invention provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising the compounds of Formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for oral, rectal, topical, buccal, parenteral, intramuscular, intradermal or intravenous, and transdermal administration. Obviously, the therapeutically effective dosage of any specific compound, the use of which is in the scope of present invention, will vary somewhat from compound to compound, patient to patient, and will depend upon the condition of the patient and the route of delivery. As a general proposition, a dosage from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg will have therapeutic efficacy, with still higher dosages potentially being employed for oral and/or aerosol administration. Toxicity concerns at the higher level may restrict intravenous dosages to a lower level such as up to about 10 mg/kg, all weights being calculated based upon the weight of the active base, including the cases where a salt is employed. Typically a dosage from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg will be employed for intravenous or intramuscular administration. A dosage from about 10 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg may be employed for oral administration. The following Examples are provided to further illustrate the present invention, and should not be construed as limiting thereof. The present invention is defined by the claims which follow. Melting points were determined on a Fisher-John melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Elemental analyses were performed on a Carlo Erba EA 1108 elemental analyzer. Proton Nulear Magnetic Resonance ( 1 H NMR) spectra were measured on a Bruker AC-300 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Chemical shifts are reported in (ppm). Mass spectra (MS) were obtained on a TRIO 1000 mass spectrometer. Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel (mesh 25-150 m) using a mixture of CH 2 Cl 2 amd EtOAc as eluant. Precoated silica gel plates (Kieselgel 60 F 254 0.25 mm, Merck) was used for thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis. In these examples, g means grams, mg means milligrams, mL means milliliters, min. means minute(s), C. means degress Centigrade. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of Substituted Ethyl Benzoylacetates The substituted ethyl benzolylacetates were prepared according to procedures described in Krapcho et al., Organic Synthesis 5:198 (1973). To a vigorously stirring suspension of NaH and CO(OEt) 2 in toluene was added dropwise a solution of substituted acetophenone in toluene under reflux. The mixture was allowed to reflux and was stirred for 20 min after the addition was complete. When cooled to room temperature, the mixture was acidified with glacial AcOH. After ice-cold water was added, the mixture wasa extracted with toluene. The extract was then dried over MgSO 4 . After the toluene was evaporated at atmospheric pressure, the residue was distilled in vacuo to give the corresponding substituted ethyl benzoylacetates. EXAMPLE 2 General Procedures for the Preparation of 2-Aryl-pyrido1,2-apyrimidin-4-ones and 2-Aryl-1,8-naphthyridin-4-ones Method 1. A mixture of substituted 2-aminopyridine (1), substituted ethyl benzoylacetate (2), and PPA was heated at 125 C. with stirring. The reaction was monitored by TLC. After the reaction was completed, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and neutralized with 4M NaOH. After extraction with Ch 2 Cl 2 , the exact was passed through a silica gel column to give 2-phenyl-pyrido1,2-pyrimidin-4-ones. The 2-phenyl-pyrido1-2,pyrimidin-4-one was then added to liquid paraffin at 350 C. for 2 hr after the addition was complete. The cooled mixture was subjected to silica gel column chromatography. Elution with CH 2 Cl 2 -EtOAc gave the corresponding 2-phenyl-1,8-naphthyridin-4-ones. Method 2. The substituted 2-aminopyridine and substituted aldehyde in equimolar concentration were heated in refluxing m-xylene until 90-95% of the theoretical amount of H 2 O was collected in a Dean-Stark trap. After the m-xylene was evaporated at atmospheric pressure, the residue was distilled in vacuo to afford 2-arylideneaminopyridine. The 2-arylideneaminopyridine and Et 3 N were dissolved in anhydrous Et 2 OP; a solution of chloroacetyl chloride in anhydrous Et 3 O was then added dropwise with sing at 15 to 10 C. After the addition was complete, the mixture wa stirred for 1 hour. The precipitated triethylamine chloride was filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was chromatographed on silica gel with CH 2 Cl 2 -EtOAc as eluant to give 2-phenyl-pyrido 1,2-apyrimidin-4one, which was converted to the corresponding 2-phenyl-1,8-naphthyridin-4-one according to the procedures described in Method EXAMPLE 3 Data Regarding Specific 2-Phenyl-pyridol,2,apyrimidin-4-ones (Compounds 7-38) 2-(2-Methoxyphenyl)-pyrido1,2-apyrimidin-4-one (7) is obtained from ethyl 2-methoxybenzoylacetate and 2-aminopyridine.

EXAMPLE 5 Cytotoxicity Assays of Compounds 39-70 Compounds 8-40 were assayed for in vitro cytotoxicity with a panel of human and murine tumor cell lines at the School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill according to procedures described in K. H. Lee, Planta Medica 54:308 (1988). The cell lines include human epidermoid carcinoma of the nasopharynx (KB), lung carcinoma (A-549), ileocecal carcinoma (HCT-8), melanoma (PRMI-7951), and medulloblastoma (TE-671), as well as one murine leukemia cell line (P-388). Compounds 41-51 and 53-68 were submitted to NCI and assayed in the NCIs in vitro disease-oriented antitumor screen, which involves determination of a test compounds effects on the growth of approximately 60 human tumor cell lines. See, M. R. Boyd, et al. In Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology Updates ; De Vita, V. T., Hellman, S., Rosenberg, S. A., Eds; J. B. Lippincoft: Philadelphia, pp 1-12 (1989); and A. Monks, et al. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 83:757 (1991). These lines include leukemia, non-small cell lung, colon, central nervous system (CNS), melanoma, ovarian, renal, prostate, and breast cancers. The cytotoxic effects of each compound were obtained as GI 50 or TGI values, which represent the molar drug concentrations required to cause 50% inhibition or total growth inhibition, respectively. The results of the cytotoxicity studies of Compounds 8-40 indicated that essentially all 2-phenyl-pyrido1,2-pyrimidin-4-ones were inactive (EC 50 4 g/ml); only a few compounds showed marginal activity.

Among the compounds tested, 44-49 showed the strongest inhibitory effects against a variety of tumor cell lines, including leukemia, colon, CNS, melanoma, ovarian, renal, prostate, breast, and small cell lung cancer cell lines, with values in the low micromolar to nanomolar concentration range. It is notable that compounds 44, 46, 47, and 49 show highly selective effects on several cell lines from the leukemia, breast, and non-small lung cancer panels at the TGI level. The log TGI values for these four compounds are 7.19 to 7.40 in the H-60 cell line, 6.16 to 7.12 in the NCI-H226 cell line, and 7.40 to 7.67 in MDA-MB-435 and MDA-N cell lines. Growth of cells from more sensitive cell lines was arrested at a concentration approximately log 2.5-3.7 concentration lower than less sensitive cell lines. In terms of average cytotoxicity, compounds substituted at the 4-position were substantially less active than those substituted at the 3-position, while compounds with a methoxy group at the 2-position were the least active. Among the tested compounds with a 4-substituent, only minor differences in cytotoxicity were obtained, suggestive of a potency order of chloro methoxyfluoro. The effects of substitutions at the 5, 6, and/or 7 positions in ring A depend on the substitution in ring C. All 3-substituted compounds with different substituents in ring A showed potent cytotoxicity, indicating that the substitution(s) can be present at different position(s) in ring A without substantially affecting cytotoxicity. For 2- and 4-substituted compounds, substitution at the 5 or 6 position generated slightly greater activity than no substitution or substitution at the 7 or the 5 and 7 positions in ring A. Even the less active compounds showed moderate cytotoxicity on two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-N. EXAMPLE 6 Materials for Tubulin Bioassays of Compounds 39-70 Electrophoretically homogeneous bovine brain tubulin was purified as described in E. Hamel, et al. Biochemistry 23:4173 (1984). Combretastatin A-4 was a generous gift of Dr. G. R Pettit, Arizona State University. 3 HColchicine was obtained from Dupont, nonradiolabeled colchicine from Sigma, podophyllotoxin from Aldrich, and monosodium glutamate from USB. Tubulin Polymerization Assay The tubulin polymerization assay was performed as described in S. Kuo, et al. J. Med. Chem. 36:1146 (1993); L. Li, et al. J. Med. Chem. 37:1126 (1994); and L. Li J. Med. Chem. 37:3400 (1994). In brief, tubulin at 1.2 mg/ml (12 M) was preincubated for 15 min at 26 C. in a 0.24-ml volume of 0.8 M monosodium glutamate (pH 6.6 with NaOH in a 2 M stock solution) with varying drug concentrations. The drug stock solutions were in DMSO, and the final solvent concentration was 4 % (v/v). All concentrations are in terms of the final reaction volume (0.25 ml). The reaction mixtures were chilled on ice, and 10 l of 10 mM GTP was added to each reaction mixture. Samples were transferred to cuvettes held at 0 C. by an electronic temperature controller in Gilford spectrophotometers. Baselines were established at 350 nm, and polymerization initiated by a temperature jump to 26 C. The jump took about 50 sec to complete. After 20 min, turbidity readings were recorded, and the temperature controller was set to 0C. When depolymerization was complete, turbidity readings were again recorded. Generally, turbidity readings were about 90% cold-reversible, and the cold-reversible turbidity was taken to represent the extent of assembly for each reaction mixture. IC 50 values were obtained graphically from inhibition of polymerization by different drug concentrations. Four spectrophotometers were used for each experimental sequence, with two control reactions (no drug) in each set Generally, the control reactions were within 5% of their average, and IC 50 values obtained with this polymerization assay are usually highly reproducible. Generally, standard deviations were within 20% of the mean values, but in some cases, the standard deviations were 30-35% of the mean. Therefore, we can conservatively estimate that a 50% difference in IC 50 values represents a difference in the relative activity of two agents. The results are summarized in Table 1, with a comparison to previously obtained data with the potent antimitotic natural products colchicine, podophyllotoxin, and combretastatin A-4. With the most active compounds (44-49) there was excellent correlation between cytotoxicity and inhibition of tubulin polymerization. These six strongly cytotoxic agents were the most potent inhibitors of assembly in the series. All had IC 50 values below 1.0 M, as did the three natural products. These six agents were also examined for inhibitory effects on the binding of 3 Hcolchicine to tubulin (1.0 M tubulin), with inhibitor and drug at equimolar concentrations (5.0 M). Significant and similar inhibition was observed with all six compounds, although they were substantially less potent than podophyllotoxin or combretastatin A-4 (See Table 1). Compounds 50, 52, 53, 63, 64, and 67-70 showed reduced inhibitory effects on tubulin polymerization, with IC 50 values ranging from 1.5 to 9.8 M. Slight inhibition was observed with compounds 40, 41, 57, 58, 61, 62, 65, and 66 (IC 50 values ranging from 11 to 32 M), while the remaining compounds (39, 42, 43, 51, 54-56, 59, and 60) were inactive, with IC 50 values greater than 40 M. Although it is not dramatic among these less active compounds, those with greater antitubulin activity (IC 50 values 10 M) tend to be more cytotoxic than those with little or no antitubulin activity. From the tubulin data, the 3 -substitution of a methoxy group was well-tolerated, while the 4- and 2-methoxy substituents resulted in large, progressive losses of activity or total loss of activity. On the other hand, the series of 4-substituents indicate that the methyl and chloride groups are better tolerated than the methoxy group and that the fluoride group is equivalent to the methoxy substituent at position 4. This suggests that a strong electron-withdrawing or a large electron-donating group at the 4-position may be unfavorable for the drug-tubulin interaction. The tubulin assay also yielded data of interest regarding A ring substituents. No clear pattern was observed in the potent 3-methoxy-substituted subseries (compounds 44-50), for a variety of substituents at different position(s) of ring A were well-tolerated. These substituents include both an electron-donating group (CH 3 ) and electron-withdrawing groups (Cl and Br). The size of the substituents (as small as hydrogen, compound 44, and as large as two methyl groups, compound 48) and their positions (no substitution or different positions of both mono- and disubstitution) did not greatly affect relative compound activities. However, a consistent pattern for A ring substitution emerged in the other five subseries (2-methoxy, 4-methoxy, 4-fluoride, 4-chloride, 4-methyl). In all cases C-5 and C-6 substituents (generally methyl groups) enhanced activity relative to the unsubstituted derivative and to those bearing a C-7 substituent or two substituent groups. EXAMPLE 7 Colchicine Binding Assay of Compounds 39-70 The binding of radiolabeled colchicine to tubulin was measured by the DEAE-cellulose filter technique, as described in S. Kuo, et al. J. Med. Chem. 36:1146(1993). In brief, each 0.1-ml reaction mixture contained 0.1 mg(1.0 M) of tubulin, 1.0 M commercial monosodium glutamate (pH 6.6 with HCl), 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mM GTP, 5.0 M 3 Hcolchicine, 5% (v/v) DMSO, and 5.0 M inhibitor. Incubation was for 20 min at 37 C. Each reaction mixture was filtered under reduced vacuum through a stack of two DEAE-cellulose paper filters, washed with water, and radioactivity quantitated in a liquid scintillation counter. The most active 2-phenyl-1,8-naphthyridin-4-ones approach colchicine in their potency as inhibitors of tubulin polymerization. While these compounds appear to interact at the colchicine binding site of tubulin, they only weakly inhibit the binding of radiolabeled colchicine to tubulin. This apparent discrepancy probably arises from a relatively slow binding and/or rapid dissociation-reaction of these agents with tubulin relative to the binding and dissociation reactions of colchicine with the protein. These properties are similar to those of a structurally related class of antimitotic agents, the 2-phenyl-4-quinolones, which were developed in our laboratory. The 2-phenyl-1,8-naphthyridin-4-ones and 2-phenyl-4-quinolones together with other natural products, such as podophyllotoxin and combretastatin, fall into a group of colchicine site compounds that have two aryl ring systems connected by a hydrocarbon bridge of variable length. In both classes of compounds, derivatives with a methoxy at the 3-position were the most active compounds within their series and were much more active than isomers with the same substituent at the 2- or 4-position. However, unlike the 2-phenyl-4-quinolones, in which a 4-methoxy group reduced activity more than a 2-methoxy substituent, in the 2-phenyl-1,8-naphthyridin-4-ones, a 2-methoxy group reduced activity more than did a 4-methoxy substituent. Moreover, in the 2-phenyl-4-quinolone series, A ring substituents were optimal at positions 6 and 7, whereas in the 2-phenyl-1,8-naphthyridin-4-one series, it appears that A ring substituents are optimal at positions 5 and 6. The COMPARE computer program uses the patterns of cellular responsiveness in the NCI 60 cell line screen to calculate Pearson correlation coefficients between data for seed compounds and those for past agents in the database. The significance of these computations is that the observed correlation coefficients are greatest in pairs of compounds sharing common intracellular targets. COMPARE computations for the six most potent compounds (44-49) against several known tubulin/microtubule binding agents are shown in Table 3 at both the GI 50 and TGI levels.

EXAMPLE 10 Cytotoxicity assays of Compounds 5-51 Compounds 5-28 were assayed for in vitro cytotoxicity in a panel of human and murine tumor cell lines using the same techniques as in Example 5. The cell lines include human epidermoid carcinoma of the nasopharynx (KB), lung carcinoma (A-549), ileocecal carcinoma (HCT-8), melanoma (PRMI-7951), and medulloblastoma (TE-671), as well one murine leukemia cell line (P-388). The results demonstrated that essentially all 2-phenyl-pyrido1,2--pyrimidin-4-ones (5-28) were inactive (EC 50 4 g/ml); only a few compounds showed marginal activity. Compounds 29-51 were submitted to NCI and assayed in the NCIs in vitro disease-oriented antitumor screen, using the techniques described in Example 5. This assay involves determinations of a test agents effect on growth parameters against a panel of approximately 60 human tumor cell lines, derived largely from solid tumors, including non-small cell lung, colon, central nervous system, renal, ovarian, prostate, and breast cancers, plus a few leukemia cell lines. The cytotoxic effects of each compound are obtained as GI 50 or TGH values, which represent the molar drug concentrations required to cause half growth inhibition and total growth inhibition, respectively. The results are expressed for each cell line as average log GI 50 values in Table 4, as log GI 50 values in Table 5, and as log TGI values and average log TGI values in Table 6.

All compounds had cytotoxic activity (log GI 50 4.00) against all cell lines tested. Among the three subseries of 2-phenyl-1,8-naphthyridin-4-ones, only compound 41 had limited activity, for compounds 29-40 were inhibitory toward most cell lines in the submicromolar (log GI 50 s of 7 to 6) to nanomolar (log GI 50 s of 8 to 7) range. Ignoring compound 41, and considering only the average log GI 50 values, which takes into account all the cell lines tested (not just those shown in Table 5), the agents with 3-fluoride and methyl groups were slightly more cytotoxic than those with a 3-chloride group. The 3-fluoride compounds, in particular, have cytotoxicity comparable to that reported earlier for agents bearing a 3-methoxy substituent. A fairly dramatic difference was observed between the 2-(-naphthyl) compounds (42-46) and the 2-(-naphthyl) compounds (47-52) derivatives. In the former group, except for compound 46, low nanomolar GI 50 values (log8) were observed with many cell lines. In the latter group, in contrast, submicromolar GI 50 values were rarely obtained with any agent except compound 49. Note, moreover, that 2-(-naphthyl) compound 49 was at least 50-fold less active than its 2-(-naphthyl) congener compound 44. As in Example 5 above substituents in the C ring altered substituent effects in the A ring. With a 3-halogen cytotoxicity was apparently unaffected by A ring substituents, within the limited range of available compounds. With a 3-methyl group and with both 2-naphthyl series, cytotoxicity was unfavorably affected by methyl groups at both position 5 and position 7. With a 3-methyl group, a methyl group at position 6 was less favorable than either no substituent or a methyl group at positions 5 or 7. In the -naphthyl series, a methyl substituent at position 5, 6, or 7 was equivalent, and cytotoxicity differed little from that of the unsubstituted compound. In the -naphthyl series, greater activity was observed in the compounds with methyl groups at positions 5 or 6 than in the unsubstituted agent or that bearing a methyl group at position 7. Interestingly, all 3- halogenated compounds showed different selectivity in the tested tumor panels at the total growth inhibition (TGI) levels. Growth of cells from more sensitive panels was arrested at a concentration approximately 1-2 log concentrations lower than was growth of less sensitive panels. As summarized in Table 6, all 3-halogenated compounds, except for compound 34, exhibited a highly selective effect at the TGI level on the breast cancer panel. In the 3-fluoro analogs, the compound with a methyl group at position 6 (29) showed high selectivity for the colon, prostate, and breast panels; the analog with a methyl group at position 7 (3) demonstrated high selectivity for the colon and breast panels and moderate selectivity for the prostate panel; and the compound with methyl groups at positions 5 and 7 (31) exhibited highly selective effects on the colon and breast panels. In the 3-chloro compounds, substitution of a methyl group at position 5 (32) or no substitution (33) in ring A produced high selectivity for the prostate and breast panels; a methyl at position 6 (34) conferred high selectivity for the CNS panel and moderate selectivity for the colon, ovarian, and breast panels; a methyl substituent at position 7 (35) gave highly selective effects on the colon, CNS, and breast panels; and methyl groups at positions 5 and 7 (36) produced high selectivity for the CNS, prostate, and breast panels. EXAMPLE 11 Antimicrotubule Assay of Compounds 29-5 Electrophoretically, homogeneous bovine brain tubulin was purified as described in Example 6. Combretastatin A-4 was a generous gift of Dr. G. R. Pettit, Arizona State University. The tubulin polymerization assay was performed as described in Example 6. Data presented in Table 4 demonstrate that the new agents described here, both the new 2-phenyl-1,8-naphthyridin-4-ones and (the 2-naphthyl derivatives, also interact with tubulin, with good correlation between their cytotoxic properties and their relative activity as inhibitors of tubulin assembly. Among the compounds examined here, only one compound was inactive (51, IC 50 value40 M), one weakly active (47; IC 50 value, 14 M), and one moderately active (50; IC 50 value, 5.1 M). These three compounds were among the least cytotoxic agents, in terms of the average log GI 50 values. At the opposite extreme, eleven compounds (29-31, 33-36, and 43-46) were highly potent inhibitors of tubulin polymerization, with IC 50 values of 1.0 M or less. This is the group that has activity comparable to that observed with the natural products colchicine, podophyllotoxin, and Combretastatin A-4. Six of these agents had average log GI 50 values below 7, and the remainder fell between 7 and 6. The remaining ten compounds (32, 37-42, 48, 49, and 52) inhibited tubulin assembly with IC 50 values of 1.1 to 3.3 M. Four of these compounds (37, 38, 40, and 42) were among the most cytotoxic agents (log GI 50 values of 7 or less), three (32, 39, and 49) were moderately cytotoxic with log GI 50 values between 7 and 6, and three (41, 48, and 52) had little cytotoxicity (log GI 50 values 6). Considering structure-activity aspects solely from the point of view of inhibition of tubulin polymerization, the 3-fluoride and 3-chloride substituents appeared to be equivalent, differed little in their activity from the previously described 3-methoxy series, and were more active than the analogous derivatives with the 3-methyl substituent. With the 3-halogen series and the 3-methyl series, derivatives with different methyl substituents in the A ring all had nearly equivalent activity. In the chloride and methyl series the data suggest that the derivatives that are unsubstituted in the A ring (compounds 32 and 37) were less active than those bearing methyl substituent(s). The 2-(-naphthyl) compounds (42-46) were comparable in activity to the 3-halogen derivatives. In this series, too, substituents in the A ring had little effect on inhibitory activity. It was only in the less active 2-(-naphthyl) compounds (47-52) that A ring substitution affected the apparent interaction with tubulin. A methyl substituent at either position 5 (48) or 6 (49) decreased the IC 50 value 7-fold relative to the value obtained with the unsubstituted compound 47, while a methyl substituent at position 7 decreased the IC 50 value 3-fold. In contrast, two methyl groups at positions 5 and 7 abolished activity. In the 2-(-naphthyl) compounds, we found no significant difference between methyl and chloride substituents at position 6. EXAMPLE 12 Colchicine Binding Assay of Compounds 29-51 The binding of radiolabeled colchicine to tubulin was measured by the DEAE-cellulose filter technique, as described in Example 7. All compounds that inhibited tubulin assembly with IC 50 values of 1.0 M or less were compared with podophyllotoxin and combretastatin A-4 for inhibitory effects on the binding of 3 colchicine to tubulin (data summarized in Table 4). In these experiments inhibitor and colchicine were equimolar and in 5-fold molar excess over tubulin. All agents, except possibly compound 46, significantly inhibited colchicine binding to tubulin, but none was as potent as either podophyllotoxin or combretastatin A-4. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, we suspect that the quantitative differences between the assembly assay and the 3 Hcolchicine assay result from differences in relative rates of drug binding and dissociation from tubulin and from the stoichiometric character of the 3 Hcolchicine assay versus the cooperative character of the assembly assay. However, the 3 Hcolchicine binding assay does detect reduced activity in the 5,7-dimethyl derivatives that was not apparent in either the cytotoxicity or polymerization assays (cf. results with 31 vs. 29 and 30; with 36 vs. 33-35, and with 46 vs. 43-45).

structure, an N-succinimidyl cinnamate structure expressed by the following formula 1: Another reagent for preparation of a caged compound in accordance with the present invention is a compound having, as a basic structure, a p-nitrophenyl cinnamate structure expressed by the following formula 3: BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to new reagents for preparation of caged compounds, and new caging methods using the same. 2. Related Background Art For investigating the mechanism of action of a substance in an organism, it is necessary to quantitatively measure the rise and fall of this substance within a biological system in a short period of time. Further, it is important to observe various changes following the substance introduced into the system. On the other hand, biological reactions are mostly very fast, and a plurality of reactions usually progress at the same time while complicatedly relating to each other. Therefore, when the above-mentioned substance is added from the outside, the process of its diffusing within the system rather becomes the rate-determining step, thereby often making it hard to clearly grasp the subsequent reaction to be determined in practice. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION For overcoming such a problem, various methods have been proposed as to a method of rapidly adding a target substance. As one of such methods, a method using a technique based on irradiation with light, i.e., so-called caged reagent, has been reported. In general, this method comprises the steps of introducing into a biological system a caged compound (which refers to a compound in which a so-called caging group is introduced or a compound labeled with a caging group) in which a specific protective group protects an active part of a physiologically active substance to be traced; verifying that this substance has sufficiently diffused to a point of application; and liberating the protective group (caging group) upon irradiation with light, so as to release the target substance, thereby making it possible to trace the reaction caused by the substance. This protective group is characterized in that it can attain deprotection (release of the protective group) upon irradiation with light alone, it can achieve deprotection very fast, and it allows the light irradiation to be narrowed to only a specific part as necessary. The present invention provides new reagents capable of preparing caged compounds having such a function with a new structure by a simple reaction. Also, the present invention provides methods of yielding caged compounds by introducing a caging group into a target physiologically active substance by using these new reagents. As a result of diligent studies, the inventor has succeeded in finding new reagents which can prepare caged compounds having such an excellent function by a simple reaction. Also, the inventor has succeeded in establishing methods of caging various compounds by using these new reagents, thereby accomplishing the present invention. Namely, a new reagent for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention is a compound having, as a basic structure, an N-succinimidyl aminocinnamate structure expressed by the following formula 1: where X and Y may be identical or different, each representing one kind selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, an alkyloxy group having a carbon number from I to 4, a benzo group, and an alkylamino group having a carbon number from 1 to 4; R 1 represents one kind selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, and a group expressed by the following formula 2: where R 6 represents one kind selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, a phenyl group, and an alkylsilyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, and n represents an integer from 0 to 2; R 2 and R 3 may be identical or different, each representing one kind selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen and an alkyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4; and Z represents one kind selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom and SO 3 M, where M represents one kind selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, an alkali metal, and an alkaline-earth metal. As preferable examples of the new reagent for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention, those having the respective structures shown in the following formulae 4 to 17 can be noted specifically: Another new reagent for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention is a compound having, as a basic structure, a nitrophenyl ester structure expressed by the following formula 3: where X and Y may be identical or different, each representing one kind selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, an alkyloxy group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, a benzo group, and an alkylamino group having a carbon number from 1 to 4; R 1 represents one kind selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having a carbon number from l to 4, and a group expressed by the following formula 2: where R 6 represents one kind selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, a phenyl group, and an alkylsilyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, and n represents an integer from 0 to 2; and R 2 and R 3 may be identical or different, each representing one kind selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen and an alkyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4. As preferable examples of the new reagent for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention, those having the respective structures shown in the following formulae 18 to 23 can be noted specifically: On the other hand, the methods in accordance with the present invention are caging methods in which the above-mentioned reagents for preparation of caged compounds are reacted with compounds having various functional groups (physiologically active substances such as amino acids) , so as to prepare caged compounds. FIGS. 1A and 1B show caging methods of compounds having various functional groups, in which the reagents for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention are used. FIG. 2 shows a photolysis reaction of a caged compound obtained. As shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B , N-succinimidyl group and p-nitrophenyl group easily react with various functional groups under mild reaction conditions. Preferable examples of the above-mentioned functional groups include amino group, hydroxide group, phenol group, thiol group, carboxylic acid group, and the like. The caged compounds obtained by the methods of the present invention are stable in the dark since the double bond of cinnamate group is kept in a trans (E) form.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In the following, the present invention will be explained further in detail. Synthesizing Method The method of synthesizing reagents for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention is not restricted in particular, and known organic chemistry reactions are favorably usable in general. Specifically, reagents for preparation of caged compounds having various substituents in accordance with the present invention can easily be synthesized with a favorable yield and a high purity according to the synthesizing route shown in FIGS. 3A to 3 E in the case of compounds having an N-succinimidyl aminocinnamate structure as their basic structure, and according to the synthesizing route shown in FIGS. 4A to 4 E in the case of compounds having a p-nitrophenyl aminocinnamate structure as their basic structure. The synthesis of compounds having an N-succinimidyl aminocinnamate structure as a basic structure shown in FIGS. 3A to 3 E includes a step of forming a cinnamate skeleton upon a reaction between a 2-nitrobenzaldehyde derivative (including a phenylketone derivative) having a favorable substituent and Wittig reagent (including Wadsworth-Emmons reagent) for introducing the favorable substituent (FIG. 3 A). For the 2-nitrobenzaldehyde derivative (including a phenylketone derivative) and Wittig reagent (including Wadsworth-Emmons reagent), which are necessary starting materials, commercially available products can be used. Also, they can be synthesized by conventionally known organic synthesizing methods (Organic Synthesis, col. vol. 3, 641; Organic Synthesis, col. vol. 4,735; Organic Synthesis, col. vol. 5,825; Kienzle et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 63 (8), 2364-2369 (1980); and Wani et al., J. Med. Chem. 1980, 23, 554-560). The reaction condition of Wittig reaction is not restricted in particular, and known conditions are usable in general (e.g., Organic Reaction, vol. 14, p. 270-423 (1965); and Organic Reaction, vol. 25, 73 (1977)). It is easy for those skilled in the art to select and optimize a favorable reaction condition in view of such literatures and the like. Here, the resulting cinnamate derivative may be any of cis form and trans form with respect to the double bond, and may be a mixture thereof. Means for verifying its structure is not restricted in particular, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specifically, such means as infrared absorption spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, mass spectrum, and the like can easily verify the existence of double bond, ester group, and nitro group. Also, various known or commercially available liquid chromatographs, gas chromatographs, and the like can be used for determining the yield and purity of the product. Further, the synthesis shown in FIGS. 3A to 3 E includes a reaction of hydrolyzing an ester group into a carboxylic acid (FIG. 3 B). The method of reaction for hydrolyzing such an ester (which is a methyl or ethyl ester in general) is not restricted in particular either, and known methods (Greene et al., Protective Group in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed., p. 224-251, John Wiley Sons (1991)) can favorably be used in general. A specific example thereof is a reaction under an acidic or alkaline condition. The reaction condition of such a hydrolyzing reaction is not restricted in particular, and known conditions are usable in general. It is easy for those skilled in the art to select and optimize a favorable reaction condition in view of such a literature. Here, the resulting acid derivative may be any of cis form and trans form with respect to the double bond, and may be a mixture thereof. Means for verifying its structure is not restricted in particular, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specifically, such means as infrared absorption spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, mass spectrum, and the like can easily verify the existence of double bond, carboxylic acid, and nitro group. Also, various known or commercially available liquid chromatographs, gas chromatographs, and the like can be used for determining the yield and purity of the product. Further, the synthesis shown in FIGS. 3A to 3 E includes a reaction by which the resulting acid derivative and N-hydroxysuccinimide (including its derivatives having sulfonic acid group) are dehydrated and condensed so as to form N-succinimidyl cinnamate (FIG. 3 C). Here, the method of this dehydration and condensation reaction is not restricted in particular, and known methods (Anderson et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 85, 3039 (1963)) can favorably be used. Preferably, various dehydrators are used in a polar nonaqueous solvent (e.g., dimethylformaldehyde (DMF), 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), or dichloromethane). Specific examples of dehydrators include dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC), and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC-HCl). The reaction condition of such dehydration and condensation is not restricted in particular, and known conditions are usable in general. It is easy for those skilled in the art to select and optimize a favorable reaction condition in view of such a literature or the like. The acid derivative having an N-succinimidyl ester group introduced therein obtained here may be any of cis form and trans form with respect to the double bond, and may be a mixture thereof. Means for verifying its structure is not restricted in particular, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specifically, such means as infrared absorption spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, mass spectrum, and the like can easily verify the existence of double bond, N-succinimidyl ester group, and nitro group. Also, various known or commercially available liquid chromatographs, gas chromatographs, and the like can be used for determining the yield and purity of the product. Further, the synthesis shown in FIGS. 3A to 3 E includes a reaction by which the nitro group substituted at the aromatic ring of the N-succinimidyl cinnamate derivative is reduced to an amino group, so as to yield the final product (FIG. 3 D). Here, the method of reducing the nitro group to the amino group is not restricted in particular, and various known methods (Articoa et al., Synthesis Comm., 22 (10), 1433-1439 (1992); Sato et al., Heterocycles, 33 (2), 589-595 (1992); Mack et al., J. Org. Chem., 58, 6158-6162 (1993); and Martin et al., Helvetica Chemica Acta, 17, 111-120 (1994)) can favorably be used. A specific example thereof is a reduction reaction with various metals under an acidic condition. A more specific example is a method using iron (including iron powder) under an acidic condition of acetic acid. The condition of such an acetic acid/iron reduction reaction is not restricted in particular, and known conditions are usable in general. It is easy for those skilled in the art to select and optimize a favorable reaction condition in view of such literatures or the like. The amino derivative obtained here is the final product, which becomes a reagent for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention. This amino derivative is in a trans form with respect to the double bond. It is because of the fact that, while a cis product is also generated upon the above-mentioned reduction reaction, a nitrogen-substituted coumarin derivative (carbostyril derivative) is easily formed according to a mechanism similar to the photoreaction shown in FIG. 2 .

Bull., 45 (6), 987-995 (1997); Padmanabhan et al., Synth. Commun., 1997, 27 (4), 691-699; Zhao et al., Synth. Commun., 1997, 27 (12), 2103-2110; and Ramrao et al., Synth. Commun., 21 (1991) 10-11, 1129-1135) can favorably be used in general. Specific examples include reactions with alkyl halides, alkyl sulfonates, and alkyl tosylates. A more specific example includes a method using an alkyl iodide. The reaction condition of such alkylation is not restricted in particular, and various known methods can favorably be used.

Also, various known or commercially available liquid chromatographs, gas chromatographs, and the like can be used for determining the yield and purity of the product. The synthesis of compounds having a p-nitrophenyl aminocinnamate structure as a basic structure shown in FIGS. 4A to 4 E includes a step of forming a cinnamate skeleton upon a reaction between a 2-nitrobenzaldehyde derivative (including a phenylketone derivative) having a favorable substituent and Wittig reagent (including Wadsworth-Emmons reagent) for introducing the favorable substituent (FIG. 4 A). For the 2-nitrobenzaldehyde derivative (including a phenylketone derivative) and Wittig reagent (including Wadsworth-Emmons reagent), which are necessary starting materials, commercially available products can be used. Also, they can be synthesized by conventionally known organic synthesizing methods. The reaction condition of Wittig reaction is not restricted in particular, and known conditions are usable in general.

Further, the synthesis shown in FIGS. 4A to 4 E includes a reaction of reducing an aromatic nitro group to an amino group (FIG. 4 B). Here, the method of reducing the nitro group to the amino group is not restricted in particular, and various known methods mentioned in the foregoing explanation of FIG. 3D can favorably be used in general. A specific example thereof is a reduction reaction with metals under an acidic condition of acetic acid. A more specific example is a method using iron (including iron powder) under an acidic condition of acetic acid. The condition of such an acetic acid/iron reduction reaction is not restricted in particular, and known conditions are usable in general. It is easy for those skilled in the art to select and optimize a favorable reaction condition in view of literatures.

Further, the synthesis shown in FIGS. 4A to 4 E includes a reaction by which the above-mentioned carboxylic acid derivative and p-nitrophenol are dehydrated and condensed, so as to yield p-nitropheyl aminocinnamate (FIG. 4 D). The method of such a dehydration and condensation reaction is not restricted in particular, and known methods (Billington et al., Tetrahedron 47 (1991) 28, 5231-5236; Huang et al., J. Org. Chem. 56 (1991) 21, 6007-6018; Pfeiffer et al., J. Org. Chem. 58 (1993) 3, 735-740; and Cabaret et al., Synthesis (1994) 5, 480-482) can favorably be used in general. Preferably, various dehydrators are used in a polar nonaqueous solvent (e.g., dimethylformaldehyde, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, or dichloromethane). Specific examples of dehydrators include dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC), and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC-HCl). The reaction condition of such dehydration and condensation is not restricted in particular, and known conditions are usable in general. It is easy for those skilled in the art to select and optimize a favorable reaction condition in view of such literatures. Means for verifying the structure is not restricted in particular, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specifically, such means as infrared absorption spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, mass spectrum, and the like can verify the existence of trans double bond, ester group, aromatic amino group, and aromatic nitro group. Also, various known or commercially available liquid chromatographs, gas chromatographs, and the like can be used for determining the yield and purity of the product. As mentioned above, reagents for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention can be obtained by the synthesizing routes shown in FIGS. 3A to 3 E and 4 A to 4 E, and the target caged compounds can be obtained with a high yield and high selectivity by use of these reagents. Further, when a group expressed by the following formula 2: (where R 6 represents one kind selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, a phenyl group, and an alkylsilyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, and n represents an integer from 0 to 2) is introduced to an aromatic amino group of the reagent for preparation of caged compounds, side reactions are suppressed, so that the target caged compounds can be obtained with a higher yield and higher selectivity. FIGS. 5A and 5B show an example of the method of introducing the protective group to the amino group, which does not limit the method of synthesizing the reagents for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention at all. The synthesizing route shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B includes a reaction of introducing the protective group expressed by formula 2 to the aromatic amino group of the amino derivative obtained as an intermediate product (FIG. 5 A). The method of reaction for introducing the protective group is not restricted in particular, and known methods can favorably be used in general. Specific examples include reactions with alkylsilylalkoxycarbonyl chloride and benzylcarboxy chloride. The reaction condition for introducing the protective group is not restricted in particular, and known conditions can be used in general to carry out the reaction (Greene et al., Protective Group in organic Synthesis, 2nd ed., p. 315-345, John Wiley Sons (1991)). It is easy for those skilled in the art to select and optimize a favorable reaction condition in view of such a literature. Means for verifying the structure of the amino derivative having the protective group introduced therein obtained here is not restricted in particular, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specifically, such means as infrared absorption spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, mass spectrum, and the like can easily verify the existence of double bond, ester group, aromatic amino group, and aromatic amino group. Also, various known or commercially available liquid chromatographs, gas chromatographs, and the like can be used for determining the yield and purity of the product. The synthesizing route shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B includes a reaction by which the amino derivative having the protective group introduced therein and N-succinimide or p-nitrophenol are dehydrated and condensed, so as to yield a reagent for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention (FIG. 5 B). The reaction method and condition for the dehydration and condensation are not restricted in particular, and known methods and conditions are usable in general. Specifically, the methods and conditions similar to those in the reactions shown in FIGS. 3C and 4D can be mentioned. Also, means for verifying the structure of obtained compounds is not restricted in particular, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specific examples thereof include analyzing means similar to those used for verifying the structures of compounds obtained by the reactions of FIGS. 3C and 4D . The reagents for preparation of caged compounds to which the protective group expressed by formula 2 has been introduced are particularly effective when the target substance to be caged is an amino group having a secondary amino group (NHR group). Here, the protective group expressed by formula 2 can easily be liberated in a post-processing step of the coupling (caging) reaction with the target substance. Specifically, in the case of trimethylsilylethyloxycarbonyl group, it can easily be liberated by use of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Reaction of Reagents for Preparation of Caged Compounds Since the above-mentioned reagents for preparation of caged compounds have an active ester group such as N-succinimide ester group or p-nitrophenyl group, they can easily react with various compounds having a functional group such as amino group under a mild condition (FIGS. 1 A and 1 B). In this reaction, water, an inorganic solvent, or their mixed solvents can be used as a reaction solvent. The reaction rapidly progresses at a reaction temperature from about 0 C. to about 100 C. The concentration required for the reaction of the above-mentioned reagents for preparation of caged compounds is not restricted in particular, and they can also be used by an amount equivalent to the amount of the target substance to be caged or more. In the case where the target substance to be caged has a plurality of functional groups, a plurality of functional groups can be caged when the concentration of the reagents for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention is adjusted. In the case where the compound has a plurality of A functional groups different from each other (e.g., amino group and carboxyl acid group), only a specific functional group may be caged according to the difference in reactivity of the reagents for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention between the functional groups. FIGS. 6 and 7 show various applied examples of reaction of reagents for preparation of caged compounds. In the following, the present invention will be explained in further detail with reference to Examples, which do not limit the present invention at all.

Compounds of said formula I, wherein Y is (C 1 -C 6 )alkyl, can be saponified to the free acid (i.e. Y is hydrogen) using a base such as sodium hydroxide in a protic solvent such as ethanol, methanol or water or a mixture such as water and ethanol, water and toluene, or water and THF. The preferred solvent system is water and toluene. The reaction is conducted for a period of 30 minutes to 24 hours, preferably about 2 hours. Compounds of the formula V, wherein R 1 is optionally substituted benzyl can be prepared according to methods known in the art. The alkylsulfonamides that can be prepared by the methods of the present invention and the starting materials of formula V are also described in the literature. PCT Publications WO 96/27583 and WO 98/07697, published Mar. 7, 1996 and Feb. 26, 1998, respectively, refer to arylsulfonyl hydroxamic acids. Each of the above referenced publications is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Compounds of the formula V wherein R 2 and R 3 are tetrahydropyran-4-yl or a bicyclo ring of the formula wherein the asterisk indicates the carbon atom common to R 2 and R 3 can be prepared according to methods analogous to those of Examples 2 and 3. The compounds of the formula I which are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate a compound of the formula I from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent, and subsequently convert the free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is obtained. The acids which are used to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are those which form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate or bisulfate, phosphate or acid phosphate, acetate, lactate, citrate or acid citrate, tartrate or bitartrate, succinate, maleate, fumarate, gluconate, saccharate, benzoate, methanesulfonate and pamoate ie, 1,1-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate) salts. Those compounds of the formula I which are also acidic in nature, are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. These salts are all prepared by conventional techniques. The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of this invention are those which form non-toxic base salts with the herein described acidic compounds of formula I. These non-toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, etc. These salts can easily be prepared by treating the corresponding acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired pharmacologically acceptable cations, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum product yields. The ability of the compounds of formula I or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts (hereinafter also referred to as the active compounds) to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases or ADAMs (such as inhibiting the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)) and, consequently, demonstrate their effectiveness for treating diseases characterized by matrix metalloproteinase or ADAM (such as the production of tumor necrosis factor) can be determined according to in vitro assay tests well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. One example of an assay recognized as demonstrating that the final products produced by the methods of the invention is the following Inhibition of Human Collagenase Assay. BIOLOGICAL ASSAY Inhibition of Human Collagenase (MMP-1) Human recombinant collagenase is activated with trypsin using the following ratio: 10 g trypsin per 100 g of collagenase. The trypsin and collagenase are incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes then a five fold excess (50 g/10 g trypsin) of soybean trypsin inhibitor is added. 10 mM stock solutions of inhibitors are made up in dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted using the following Scheme: 10 mM120 M12 M1.2 M0.12 M Twenty-five microliters of each concentration is then added in triplicate to appropriate wells of a 96 well microfluor plate. The final concentration of inhibitor will be a 1:4 dilution after addition of enzyme and substrate. Positive controls (enzyme, no inhibitor) are set up in wells D1-D6 and blanks (no enzyme, no inhibitors) are set in wells D7-D12. Collagenase is diluted to 400 ng/ml and 25 l is then added to appropriate wells of the microfluor plate. Final concentration of collagenase in the assay is 100 ng/ml. Substrate (DNP-Pro-Cha-Gly-Cys(Me)-His-Ala-Lys(NMA)-NH 2 ) is made as a 5 mM stock in dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted to 20 mM in assay buffer. The assay is initiated by the addition of 50 l substrate per well of the microfluor plate to give a final concentration of 10 M. Fluorescence readings (360 nM excitation, 460 nm emission) were taken at time 0 and then at 20 minute intervals. The assay is conducted at room temperature with a typical assay time of 3 hours. Fluorescence vs time is then plotted for both the blank and collagenase containing samples (data from triplicate determinations is averaged). A time point that provides a good signal (the blank) and that is on a linear part of the curve (usually around 120 minutes) is chosen to determine IC 50 values. The zero time is used as a blank for each compound at each concentration and these values are subtracted from the 120 minute data. Data is plotted as inhibitor concentration vs % control (inhibitor fluorescence divided by fluorescence of collagenase alone100). IC 50 s are determined from the concentration of inhibitor that gives a signal that is 50% of the control. If IC 50 s are reported to be 0.03 M then the inhibitors are assayed at concentrations of 0.3 M, 0.03 M, 0.03 M and 0.003 M. The following Examples illustrate the preparation of the compounds of the present invention. Melting points are uncorrected. NMR data are reported in parts per million (6) and are referenced to the deuterium lock signal from the sample solvent (deuteriochloroform unless otherwise specified).

This is a Divisional of application Ser. No. 09/262,184, filed on Mar. 4, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,111,000, which claims the benefit of Provisional No. 06/077,602 filed Mar. 10, 1998. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a borate compound which is useful in rubber compositions and the processing of a rubber composition containing borate compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION U.S. Pat. No. 4,057,529 discloses a rubber composition containing a carboxylated cobalt oxy metal complex. Representative metals include boron. These complex carboxylated cobalt oxy metal compounds may be prepared by reacting a cobalt salt of a carboxylic acid with an alkoxide of boron as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,296,242. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to borate compounds wherein R 1 and R 2 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms; R 3 is selected from the group consisting of alkylene groups having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms and arylene and alkyl substituted arylene groups having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms; X is selected from the group consisting of SH, SCN, and NH 2 ; and Y is selected from the group consisting of S x and Se x where x is an integer of from 1 to 8. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION There is also disclosed a method for processing a silica-filled rubber composition which comprises mixing (i) 100 parts by weight of at least one elastomer containing olefinic unsaturation selected from conjugated diene homopolymers and copolymers and from copolymers of at least one conjugated diene and aromatic vinyl compound; and (ii) 0.05 to 10 phr of a compound of the formulae wherein R 1 and R 2 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms; R 3 is selected from the group consisting of alkylene groups having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms and arylene and alkyl substituted arylene groups having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms; X is selected from the group consisting of SH, SCN, and NH 2 ; and Y is selected from the group consisting of S x and Se x where x is an integer of from 1 to 8. There is also disclosed a rubber composition comprising an elastomer containing olefinic unsaturation and a compound of the formulae wherein R 1 and R 2 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms; R 3 is selected from the group consisting of alkylene groups having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms and arylene and alkyl substituted arylene groups having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms; X is selected from the group consisting of SH, SCN, and NH 2 ; and Y is selected from the group consisting of S x and Se x where x is an integer of from 1 to 8. The present invention may be used to process rubbers or elastomers containing olefinic unsaturation. The phrase rubber or elastomer containing olefinic unsaturation is intended to include both natural rubber and its various raw and reclaim forms as well as various synthetic rubbers. In the description of this invention, the terms rubber and elastomer may be used interchangeably, unless otherwise prescribed. The terms rubber composition, compounded rubber and rubber compound are used interchangeably to refer to rubber which has been blended or mixed with various ingredients and materials and such terms are well known to those having skill in the rubber mixing or rubber compounding art. Representative synthetic polymers are the homopolymerization products of butadiene and its homologues and derivatives, for example, methylbutadiene, dimethylbutadiene and pentadiene as well as copolymers such as those formed from butadiene or its homologues or derivatives with other unsaturated monomers. Among the latter are acetylenes, for example, vinyl acetylene; olefins, for example, isobutylene, which copolymerizes with isoprene to form butyl rubber; vinyl compounds, for example, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile (which polymerize with butadiene to form NBR), methacrylic acid and styrene, the latter compound polymerizing with butadiene to form SBR, as well as vinyl esters and various unsaturated aldehydes, ketones and ethers, e.g., acrolein, methyl isopropenyl ketone and vinylethyl ether. Specific examples of synthetic rubbers include neoprene (polychloroprene), polybutadiene (including cis-1,4-polybutadiene), polyisoprene (including cis-1,4-polyisoprene), butyl rubber, styrene/isoprene/butadiene rubber, copolymers of 1,3-butadiene or isoprene with monomers such as styrene, acrylonitrile and methyl methacrylate, as well as ethylene/propylene terpolymers, also known as ethylene/propylene/diene monomer (EPDM), and in particular, ethylene/propylene/dicyclopentadiene terpolymers. The preferred rubber or elastomers are polybutadiene and SBR. In one aspect the rubber is preferably of at least two of diene based rubbers. For example, a combination of two or more rubbers is preferred such as cis 1,4-polyisoprene rubber (natural or synthetic, although natural is preferred), 3,4-polyisoprene rubber, styrene/isoprene/butadiene rubber, emulsion and solution polymerization derived styrene/butadiene rubbers, cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubbers and emulsion polymerization prepared butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers. In one aspect of this invention, an emulsion polymerization derived styrene/butadiene (E-SBR) might be used having a relatively conventional styrene content of about 20 to about 28 percent bound styrene or, for some applications, an E-SBR having a medium to relatively high bound styrene content, namely, a bound styrene content of about 30 to about 45 percent. The relatively high styrene content of about 30 to about 45 for the E-SBR can be considered beneficial for a purpose of enhancing traction, or skid resistance, of the tire tread. The presence of the E-SBR itself is considered beneficial for a purpose of enhancing processability of the uncured elastomer composition mixture, especially in comparison to a utilization of a solution polymerization prepared SBR (S-SBR). By emulsion polymerization prepared E-SBR, it is meant that styrene and 1,3-butadiene are copolymerized as an aqueous emulsion. Such are well known to those skilled in such art. The bound styrene content can vary, for example, from about 5 to about 50 percent. In one aspect, the E-SBR may also contain acrylonitrile to form a terpolymer rubber, as E-SBAR, in amounts, for example, of about 2 to about 30 weight percent bound acrylonitrile in the terpolymer. Emulsion polymerization prepared styrene/butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymer rubbers containing about 2 to about 40 weight percent bound acrylonitrile in the copolymer are also contemplated as diene based rubbers for use in this invention. The solution polymerization prepared SBR (S-SBR) typically has a bound styrene content in a range of about 5 to about 50, preferably about 9 to about 36, percent. The S-SBR can be conveniently prepared, for example, by organo lithium catalyzation in the presence of an organic hydrocarbon solvent. A purpose of using S-SBR is for improved tire rolling resistance as a result of lower hysteresis when it is used in a tire tread composition. The 3,4-polyisoprene rubber (3,4-PI) is considered beneficial for a purpose of enhancing the tires traction when it is used in a tire tread composition. The 3,4-PI and use thereof is more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,087,668 which is incorporated herein by reference. The Tg refers to the glass transition temperature which can conveniently be determined by a differential scanning calorimeter at a heating rate of 10 C. per minute. The cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber (BR) is considered to be beneficial for a purpose of enhancing the tire treads wear, or treadwear. Such BR can be prepared, for example, by organic solution polymerization of 1,3-butadiene. The BR may be conveniently characterized, for example, by having at least a 90 percent cis 1,4-content. The cis 1,4-polyisoprene and cis 1,4-polyisoprene natural rubber are well known to those having skill in the rubber art. The term phr as used herein, and according to conventional practice, refers to parts by weight of a respective material per 100 parts by weight of rubber, or elastomer. The borate compounds of the present invention are of the formula wherein R 1 and R 2 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms; R 3 is selected from the group consisting of alkylene groups having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms and arylene and alkyl substituted arylene groups having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms; X is selected from the group consisting of SH, SCN, and NH 2 ; and Y is selected from the group consisting of S x and Se x where x is an integer of from 1 to 8. Preferably, each R 1 and R 2 are alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, R 3 is an alkylene group having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, X is S x and Y is SH. The borate compounds may comprise a high purity product or mixture of products conforming to the above formula. The borate compound of Formula I where X is SH may be prepared according to the reaction scheme listed below. The borate compound of Formula I where X is SCN may be prepared according to the reaction scheme listed below. The borate compound of Formula I where X is an epoxide group may be prepared according to the reaction scheme listed below. The borate compound of Formula I where X is an episulfide may be prepared according to the reaction scheme listed below. The borate compound of Formula I where X is an amine may be prepared according to the reaction scheme listed below. The borate compound of Formula II where Y is S x may be prepared according to the reaction scheme listed below. The borate compound of Formula II where Y is Se x may be prepared according to the reaction scheme listed below. The above reactions are generally conducted in the presence of a suitable solvent. The primary criteria is to use a solvent which does not react with the starting materials or end product. Representative organic solvents include chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, xylene, benzene, toluene, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic alcohols. Preferably, water is avoided to prevent reaction with the siloxy groups of the compounds. The borate compounds used in the present invention may be added to the rubber by any conventional technique such as on a mill or in a Banbury. The amount of the borate compound may vary widely depending on the type of rubber and other compounds present in the rubber composition. Generally, the amount of the borate compound is used in a range of from about 0.05 to about 10.0 phr with a range of 0.1 to about 5.0 phr being preferred. The borate compound is preferably added in the nonproductive stage. For ease in handling, the borate compound may be used per se or may be deposited on suitable carriers. Examples of carriers which may be used in the present invention include silica, carbon black, alumina, alumina silicates, clay, kieselguhr, cellulose, silica gel and calcium silicate. The rubber composition may contain a sufficient amount of filler (such as silica, alumina, aluminosilicate and/or carbon black) to contribute a reasonably high modulus and high resistance to tear. The filler may be added in amounts ranging from 10 to 250 phr. More specifically, silica is generally present in an amount ranging from 15 to 80 phr. If carbon black is also present, the amount of carbon black, if used, may vary. Generally speaking, the amount of carbon black will vary from 0 to 80 phr. Preferably, the amount of carbon black will range from 0 to 40 phr. It is to be appreciated that the silica coupler may be used in conjunction with a carbon black, namely pre-mixed with a carbon black prior to addition to the rubber composition, and such carbon black is to be included in the aforesaid amount of carbon black for the rubber composition formulation. Where the rubber composition contains both silica and carbon black, the weight ratio of silica to carbon black may vary. For example, the weight ratio may be as low as 1:5 to a silica to carbon black weight ratio of 30:1. Preferably, the weight ratio of silica to carbon black ranges from 1:3 to 5:1. The combined weight of the silica and carbon black, as herein referenced, may be as low as about 30 phr, but is preferably from about 45 to about 90 phr. The commonly employed siliceous pigments used in rubber compounding applications can be used as the silica in this invention, including pyrogenic and precipitated siliceous pigments (silica) and aluminosilicates, although precipitate silicas are preferred. The siliceous pigments preferably employed in this invention are precipitated silicas such as, for example, those obtained by the acidification of a soluble silicate, e.g., sodium silicate. Such silicas might be characterized, for example, by having a BET surface area, as measured using nitrogen gas, preferably in the range of about 40 to about 600, and more usually in a range of about 50 to about 300 square meters per gram. The BET method of measuring surface area is described in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Volume 60, page 304 (1930). The silica may also be typically characterized by having a dibutylphthalate (DBP) absorption value in a range of about 100 to about 400, and more usually about 150 to about 300. Further, the silica, as well as the aforesaid alumina and aluminosilicate may be expected to have a CTAB surface area in a range of about 100 to about 220. The CTAB surface area is the external surface area as evaluated by cetyl trimethylammonium bromide with a pH of 9. The method is described in ASTM D 3849 for set up and evaluation. The CTAB surface area is a well known means for characterization of silica. Mercury surface area/porosity is the specific surface area determined by Mercury porosimetry. For such technique, mercury is penetrated into the pores of the sample after a thermal treatment to remove volatiles. Set-up conditions may be suitably described as using a 100 mg sample; removing volatiles during 2 hours at 105 C. and ambient atmospheric pressure; ambient to 2000 bars pressure measuring range. Such evaluation may be performed according to the method described in Winslow, Shapiro in ASTM bulletin, p.39 (1959) or according to DIN 66133. For such an evaluation, a CARLO-ERBA Porosimeter 2000 might be used. The average mercury porosity specific surface area for the silica should be in a range of about 100 to 300 m 2 /g. A suitable pore-size distribution for the silica, alumina and aluminosilicate according to such mercury porosity evaluation is considered herein to be five percent or less of its pores have a diameter of less than about 10 nm; 60 to 90 percent of its pores have a diameter of about 10 to about 100 nm; 10 to 30 percent of its pores have a diameter of about 100 to about 1000 nm; and 5 to 20 percent of its pores have a diameter of greater than about 1000 nm. The silica might be expected to have an average ultimate particle size, for example, in the range of 0.01 to 0.05 micron as determined by the electron microscope, although the silica particles may be even smaller, or possibly larger, in size. Various commercially available silicas may be considered for use in this invention such as, only for example herein, and without limitation, silicas commercially available from PPG Industries under the Hi-Sil trademark with designations 210, 243, etc; silicas available from Rhone-Poulenc, with, for example, designations of Z1165MP and Z165GR and silicas available from Degussa AG with, for example, designations VN2, VN3, BV3380GR, etc, and silicas available from Huber, for example Huber Sil 8745. Optionally, conventional sulfur containing organosilicon compounds can be present in the rubber composition. Examples of suitable sulfur containing organosilicon compounds are of the formula: Z-Alk-S n -Alk-ZIII in which Z is selected from the group consisting of where R 4 is an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, cyclohexyl or phenyl; R 5 is alkoxy of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or cycloalkoxy of 5 to 8 carbon atoms; Alk is a divalent hydrocarbon of 1 to 18 carbon atoms and n is an integer of 2 to 8.

The amount of the above sulfur containing organosilicon compound in a rubber composition may range from 0.1 to 40 phr. Preferably, the level of sulfur containing organosilicon compound may range from 5 to 15 phr. When a filler is used, the level of sulfur containing organosilicon compound may vary depending on the level of filler that is used. Generally speaking, the amount of the compound of formula III will range from 0 to 1.0 parts by weight per part by weight of the filler. Preferably, the amount will range from 0 to 0.4 parts by weight per part by weight of the filler. In accordance with one aspect of this invention, a rubber composition is prepared by a process which comprises the sequential steps of: (A) thermomechanically mixing in at least one preparatory mixing step to a temperature of about 140 C. to about 190 C., for a total mixing time of about 2 to about 20 minutes (i) 100 parts by weight of at least one elastomer containing olefinic unsaturation selected from conjugated diene homopolymers and copolymers and copolymers of at least one conjugated diene and aromatic vinyl compound; (ii) about 10 to about 250 phr of particulate filler selected from the group consisting of precipitated silica, alumina, aluminosilicate, carbon black and mixtures thereof; (iii) about 0.05 to about 10 phr of at least one borate compound of the formula I or II; (B) subsequently blending therewith, in a final thermomechanical mixing step at a temperature to about 100 C. to about 130 C. for a time of about 1 to about 3 minutes, about 0.1 to about 5 phr of elemental sulfur. It is readily understood by those having skill in the art that the rubber composition would be compounded by methods generally known in the rubber compounding art, such as mixing the various sulfur-vulcanizable constituent rubbers with various commonly used additive materials such as, for example, sulfur donors, curing aids, such as activators and retarders and processing additives, such as oils, resins including tackifying resins and plasticizers, fillers, pigments, fatty acid, zinc oxide, waxes, antioxidants and antiozonants and peptizing agents. As known to those skilled in the art, depending on the intended use of the sulfur vulcanizable and sulfur vulcanized material (rubbers), the additives mentioned above are selected and commonly used in conventional amounts. Typical amounts of reinforcing type carbon blacks(s), for this invention, if used, are herein set forth. Representative examples of sulfur donors include elemental sulfur (free sulfur), an amine disulfide, polymeric polysulfide and sulfur olefin adducts. Preferably, the sulfur vulcanizing agent is elemental sulfur. The sulfur vulcanizing agent may be used in an amount ranging from 0.5 to 8 phr, with a range of from 1.5 to 6 phr being preferred. Typical amounts of tackifier resins, if used, comprise about 0.5 to about 10 phr, usually about 1 to about 5 phr. Typical amounts of processing aids comprise about 1 to about 50 phr. Such processing aids can include, for example, aromatic, naphthenic, and/or paraffinic processing oils. Typical amounts of antioxidants comprise about 1 to about 5 phr. Representative antioxidants may be, for example, diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine and others, such as, for example, those disclosed in the Vanderbilt Rubber Handbook (1978), pages 344-346. Typical amounts of antiozonants comprise about 1 to 5 phr. Typical amounts of fatty acids, if used, which can include stearic acid comprise about 0.5 to about 3 phr. Typical amounts of zinc oxide comprise about 2 to about 5 phr. Typical amounts of waxes comprise about 1 to about 5 phr. Often microcrystalline waxes are used. Typical amounts of peptizers comprise about 0.1 to about 1 phr. Typical peptizers may be, for example, pentachlorothiophenol and dibenzamidodiphenyl disulfide. In one aspect-of the present invention, the sulfur vulcanizable rubber composition is then sulfur-cured or vulcanized. Accelerators are used to control the time and/or temperature required for vulcanization and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. In one embodiment, a single accelerator system may be used, i.e., primary accelerator. The primary accelerator(s) may be used in total amounts ranging from about 0.5 to about 4, preferably about 0.8 to about 1.5, phr. In another embodiment, combinations of a primary and a secondary accelerator might be used with the secondary accelerator being used in smaller amounts, such as from about 0.05 to about 3 phr, in order to activate and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. Combinations of these accelerators might be expected to produce a synergistic effect on the final properties and are somewhat better than those produced by use of either accelerator alone. In addition, delayed action accelerators may be used which are not affected by normal processing temperatures but produce a satisfactory cure at ordinary vulcanization temperatures. Vulcanization retarders might also be used. Suitable types of accelerators that may be used in the present invention are amines, disulfides, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams, sulfenamides, dithiocarbamates and xanthates. Preferably, the primary accelerator is a sulfenamide. If a second accelerator is used, the secondary accelerator is preferably a guanidine, dithiocarbamate or thiuram compound. The mixing of the rubber composition can be accomplished by methods known to those having skill in the rubber mixing art. For example the ingredients are typically mixed in at least two stages, namely at least one non-productive stage followed by a productive mix stage. The final curatives including sulfur vulcanizing agents are typically mixed in the final stage which is conventionally called the productive mix stage in which the mixing typically occurs at a temperature, or ultimate temperature, lower than the mix temperature(s) than the preceding non-productive mix stage(s). The terms non-productive and productive mix stages are well known to those having skill in the rubber mixing art. In further accordance with the invention, the process comprises the additional step of vulcanizing the prepared rubber composition at a temperature in a range of about 140 C. to about 190 C. Accordingly, the invention also thereby contemplates a vulcanized rubber composition prepared by such process. In additional accordance with the invention, the process comprises the additional steps of preparing an assembly of a tire or sulfur-vulcanizable rubber with a tread comprised of the said rubber composition prepared according to the process of this invention and vulcanizing the assembly at a temperature in a range of about 140 C. to about 190 C. Accordingly, the invention also thereby contemplates a vulcanized tire prepared by such process. Vulcanization of the rubber composition of the present invention is generally carried out at conventional temperatures ranging from about 100 C. to 200 C. Preferably, the vulcanization is conducted at temperatures ranging from about 110 C. to 180 C. Any of the usual vulcanization processes may be used such as heating in a press or mold, heating with superheated steam or hot air or in a salt bath. Upon vulcanization of the sulfur vulcanized composition, the rubber composition of this invention can be used for various purposes. For example, the sulfur vulcanized rubber composition may be in the form of a tire, belt or hose. In case of a tire, it can be used for various tire components. Such tires can be built, shaped, molded and cured by various methods which are known and will be readily apparent to those having skill in such art. Preferably, the rubber composition is used in the tread of a tire. As can be appreciated, the tire may be a passenger tire, aircraft tire, truck tire and the like. Preferably, the tire is a passenger tire. The tire may also be a radial or bias, with a radial tire being preferred. While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating the invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.

This is a division of application Ser. No. 09/035,811 filed Mar. 6, 1998 now abandoned. The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of enantiomerically pure 3-hydroxyoctanedioic acid diesters of the general formula I, where R 1 and R 2 are identical or different and are a C 1 -C 20 -alkyl group, C 3 -C 12 -cycloalkyl group, C 7 -C 12 -aralkyl group or a mono- or binuclear aryl group. The compounds (R)-I are novel, whereas the compounds (S)-I are known. Both are used mainly as intermediates for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure -lipoic acid of the formula II and its derivatives. -Lipoic acid is 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid (thioctic acid). The (R)-enantiomer of -lipoic acid (R)-()-II is a natural substance which occurs in low concentrations in virtually all animal and plant cells. As a coenzyme in the oxidative decarboxylation of -ketocarboxylic acids (e.g. pyruvic acid), -lipoic acid is of essential importance. -Lipoic acid is pharmacologically active and has anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive (analgesic) and cytoprotective properties. An important medical indication is the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy. According to recent results (A. Baur et al., Klin. Wochenschr. 1991, 69, 722; J. P. Merin et al., FEBS Lett. 1996, 394, 9), -lipoic acid may possibly gain importance in the control of diseases caused by HIV-1 and HTLV IIIB viruses. In the case of the pure optical isomers of -lipoic acid (R- and S-form, i.e. (R)--lipoic acid and (S)--lipoic acid), unlike the racemate, the (R)-enantiomer mainly has anti-inflammatory activity and the (S)-enantiomer mainly antinociceptive activity (EP 0427247, 08.11.90). Different pharmacokinetic properties of the two enantiomers have likewise been found (R. Hermann et al., Eur. J. Pharmaceut. Sci. 1996, 4, 167). The synthesis of the pure enantiomers is therefore of great importance. Known preparation processes for the enantiomerically pure -lipoic acids include the resolution of the racemates of -lipoic acid or its precursors, asymmetric syntheses using chiral auxiliaries, chiral pool syntheses using naturally occurring optically active starting compounds and microbial syntheses (review article: J. S. Yadav et al., J. Sci. Ind. Res. 1990, 49, 400; and also: E. Walton et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955, 77, 5144; D. S. Acker and W. J. Wayne, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957, 79, 6483; L. G. Chebotareva and A. M. Yurkevich, Khim.-Farm. Zh. 1980, 14, 92; A. S. Gopalan et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1989, 5705; A. G. Tolstikov et al., Bioorg. Khim. 1990, 16, 1670; L. Dasaradhi et al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. 1990, 729; A. S. Gopalan et al., J. Chem. Perkin Trans. 1 1990, 1897; EP 0487986 A2, 14.11.91; B. Adger et al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. 1995, 1563; Y. R. Santosh Laxmi and D. S. Iyengar, Synthesis, 1996, 594). Of these, the resolution of the racemate via the formation of diastereomeric salts of -lipoic acid with optically active a-methylbenzylamine (DE-A 4137773.7, 16.11.91 and DE-A 4427079.8, 30.07.94) represents the most economical variant up to now. Since the racemate separation only takes place in the last stage of the synthesis sequence, however, high yields cannot be attained. The only known chemocatalytic asymmetric process for the preparation of enantiomerically pure -lipoic acid (DE-A 3629116.1, 27.08.86) is based on the Sharpless epoxidation of allyl alcohols, but is uneconomical because of the high costs of the starting compounds. Among the biocatalytic synthesis routes described, the asymmetric reduction of 3-oxooctanedioic acid diesters III with bakers yeast is to be emphasized (EP 0487986 A2, 14.11.91). The disadvantages of this process, however, are that the space-time yield is extremely low, a high enantiomeric excess can only be achieved when using the isobutyl ester (R 1 iBu) and always only the (S)-enantiomer (S)-I is formed. The object of the invention is therefore alternatively to make both enantiomers of -lipoic acid available in high chemical and optical space-time yield when using inexpensive starting substances. According to the invention, this is achieved by asymmetric chemocatalytic hydrogenation of 3-oxooctanedioic acid diesters of the formula III, in which R 1 and R 2 in each case independently of one another are a C 1 -C 20 -alkyl group, C 3 -C 12 -cycloalkyl group, C 7 -C 12 -aralkyl group or a mono- or binuclear aryl group, in the presence of complexes of ruthenium and optically active phosphines or of Raney nickel and optically active tartaric acid as catalysts. In this case, independently of the nature of the ester groups (R 1 , R 2 ), constant high optical and chemical yields of 3-hydroxyoctanedioic acid diesters I are attained. Unlike the biocatalytic variants, the reaction can be carried out at very high substrate concentrations. The compounds III are known and obtainable especially by acylation of Meldrums acid with monoalkyl adipoyl chloride and subsequent alcoholysis (H. Thoma and G. Spiteller, Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1983, 1237; EP 0487986 A2, 14.11.91). Under certain reaction conditions, according to the invention preferably also the alkyl 6-(2,2-dimethyl-4,6-dioxo-1,3-dioxan-5-ylidene) 6-hydroxyhexanoates of the formula IV (R 1 C 1 -C 20 -alkyl, C 3 -C 12 -cycloalkyl, C 7 -C 12 -aralkyl and/or mono- or binuclear aryl) which are intermediately formed and can be isolated can be used for the asymmetric hydrogenation. They can be prepared as described (H. W. Schmidt and M. Klade, Org. Prep. Proced. Int. 1988, 20, 184) or prepared in an analogous manner. Of particular interest as catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation are ruthenium-diphosphine complexes. As typical examples but not as a restriction, the ruthenium complexes of the following formulae V to XI may be mentioned: RuHal 2 D 1,2 (L) x V RuHalAD Y VI RuD n OOCR 3 OOCR 4 VII RuH x D n m Y m VIII RuHal(PR 5 2 R 6 )D 2 Hal 2 IX RUHHalD 2 X DRu(acac) 2 XI in which: acac is acetylacetonate, D is a diphosphine of the general formula XII, Hal is halogen, in particular iodine, chlorine or bromine, R 3 and R 4 are identical or different and are alkyl having up to 9 C atoms, preferably up to 4 C atoms, which is optionally substituted by halogen, in particular fluorine, chlorine or bromine or are phenyl which is optionally substituted by alkyl having 1 to 4 C atoms or are -aminoalkanoic acid preferably having up to 4 C atoms, or jointly form an alkylidene group having up to 4 C atoms, R 5 and R 6 in each case are identical or different and are optionally substituted phenyl, preferably substituted by alkyl having 1 to 4 C atoms or halogen, Y is Cl, Br, I, ClO 4 , BF 4 or PF 4 , A is an unsubstituted or substituted benzene ring such as p-cymene, L is a neutral ligand such as acetone, a tertiary amine or dimethylformamide, n and m in each case are 1 or 2, x is 0 or 1, where in formula VIII n is 1 and m is 2 if x0, and n is 2 and m is 1 if x1. The complexes of the formulae V to XI can be prepared by methods known per se (V and X: EP 174057 and J. P.Genet et al., Tetrahedron Asymmetry 1994, 5, 675; VI: EP 366390; VII: EP 245959 and EP 272787; VIII: EP 256634; IX: EP 470756; XI: P. Stahly et al., Organometallics 1993, 1467). Optically active diphosphine ligands which can be used are compounds of the general formula XII: in which: Q is a group bridging the two P atoms having 2 to 24 carbon atoms and optionally 1 to 4 heteroatoms, preferably O, S, N and Si, the bridge being formed by at least 2 of the carbon atoms and optionally 1 to 4 of the heteroatoms, R 7 -R 10 in each case are identical or different and are alkyl groups having 1 to 18 C atoms, cycloalkyl groups having 5 to 7 C atoms or aryl groups having 6 to 12 C atoms. As particularly preferred chiral diphosphines which can be used in enantiomerically pure form, the following ligands can be mentioned as examples: The ligands mentioned above as racemic structures for the sake of simplicity are known compounds in their enantiomerically pure forms (BINAP: R. Noyori et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980, 102, 7932; BIMOP, FUPMOP, BIFUP: M. Murata et al., Synlett 1991, 827; BIBHEMP: R. Schmid et al., Helv. Chim. Acta 1988, 71, 697; MeO-BIPHEP: R. Schmid et al., Helv. Chim. Acta 1991, 74, 370; BICHEP: A. Miyashita et al., Chem. Lett. 1989, 1849; DuPHOS: M. Burk et al., Organometallics 1990, 9, 2653; BPE: M. Burk et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 4423; BIBFUP: EP 643065; CHIRAPHOS: B. Bosnich et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977, 99, 6262; XIII: WO 96/01831). The asymmetric hydrogenation of the compounds of the formula III in the presence of the optically active ruthenium-diphosphine complexes of the formulae V to XI described above can be carried out in suitable organic solvents which are inert under the reaction conditions. Those which can be mentioned in particular are alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride or dichloroethane, cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, esters such as, for example, ethyl acetate, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene or toluene, or alternatively mixtures thereof and the like. To suppress possible ketal formation when working in alcohols as solvents, up to 10% by volume of water can be added. The substrate concentrations are preferably 5 to 50% by volume, in particular 20 to 40% by volume. The reactions can preferably be carried out at temperatures from approximately 10 C. to 120 C., in particular from approximately 20 C. to 70 C. and under a hydrogen pressure from approximately 1 to 100 bar, in particular from 4 to 50 bar. In general, the reaction times are 2 to 48 hours, usually 6 to 24 hours. The molar ratio between ruthenium in the complexes V to XI and the compounds III to be hydrogenated is expediently between approximately 0.001 and approximately 5 mol %, preferably between approximately 0.005 and approximately 0.2 mol %. Under the abovementioned conditions, according to the invention compounds of the formula IV can also be asymmetrically hydrogenated in the presence of the optically active ruthenium-diphosphine complexes of the formulae V to XI, the reaction preferably being carried out in alcohols or mixtures of the abovementioned organic solvents and at least 1, preferably 4 to 10, mol of alcohol, based on the compound IV to be hydrogenated, and at temperatures from approximately 40 C. to 120 C., in particular from approximately 50 C. to 100 C. In the reaction products I, the radical R 2 is then defined by the corresponding alcohol employed. In the reaction, the desired enantiomer of the formula I can be obtained by selection of the optically active diphosphine ligands of the formula XII with the appropriate configuration. Thus, for example, the use of (R)-()-BINAP leads to products of the formula (R)-I, the use of (S)-()-BINAP to products of the formula (S)-I. According to the invention, chirally modified Raney nickel complexes can also be used as catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation. These complexes can be prepared by methods known per se (T. Harada et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1994, 67, 2473; A. Tai et al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. 1991, 795; H. Brunner et al., Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1990, 1, 159; T. Harada et al., Chem. Lett. 1980, 1125; T. Harada and Y. Izumi, Chem. Lett. 1978, 1195). In this case, Raney nickel complexes treated with enantiomerically pure tartaric acid with addition of sodium bromide prove to be particularly suitable, ultrasonically treated Raney nickel being preferably employed for the formation of the catalyst complex. The asymmetric hydrogenation of the compounds of the formula III in the presence of the optically active nickel-tartaric acid complexes described above can be carried out in suitable organic solvents which are inert under the reaction conditions. Those which can be mentioned in particular are alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride or dichloroethane, cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, esters such as, for example, ethyl acetate or propionic acid esters, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene or toluene, or alternatively mixtures thereof and the like. The solvent or solvent mixture used can contain up to 10% by volume, preferably 0.05 to 2% by volume, of a carboxylic acid, in particular acetic acid. The substrate concentrations are preferably 5 to 60% by volume, in particular 30 to 50% by volume. The reactions can preferably be carried out at temperatures from approximately 20 C. to 140 C., in particular from approximately 70 C. to 100 C. and under a hydrogen pressure from approximately 1 to 100 bar, in particular from 20 to 80 bar. In general, the reaction times are 2 to 48 hours, usually 6 to 36 hours. The molar ratio between nickel in the complexes and the compounds III to be hydrogenated is expediently between approximately 0.01 and approximately 50 mol %, preferably between approximately 1 and approximately 20 mol %. Under the abovementioned conditions, according to the invention compounds of the formula IV can also be asymmetrically hydrogenated in the presence of the optically active nickel-tartaric acid complexes, the reaction preferably being carried out in alcohols or mixtures of abovementioned organic solvents and at least 1, preferably 4 to 10, mol of alcohol, based on the compound to be hydrogenated. In the reaction products I, the radical R 2 is then defined by the corresponding alcohol employed. In the reaction, the desired enantiomer of the formula I can be obtained by selection of the optically active tartaric acid with the appropriate configuration in the preparation of the catalyst complex. Thus the use of (R,R)-()-tartaric acid leads to products of the formula (R)-I, the use of (S,S)-()-tartaric acid to products of the formula (S)-I. The compounds I are used for the preparation of the enantiomerically pure -lipoic acids of the formula II, by reducing them in a known manner (EP 0487986 A2, 14.11.91) to the compounds XIV, where R 1 is a C 1 -C 20 -alkyl group, C 3 -C 12 -cycloalkyl group, C 7 -C 12 -aralkyl group or a mono- or binuclear aryl group and these a) are converted into the bis-sulphonic acid ester of XIV in organic solution using a sulphonyl chloride and a tertiary nitrogen base, b) this compound is reacted in a polar solvent with sulphur and an alkali metal sulphide to give the -lipoic acid ester and c) this ester is converted, if desired, into the respective pure enantiomer of -lipoic acid. In this case, starting from the compounds (R)-I (S)-()--lipoic acid and, starting from the compounds (S)-I, (R)-()--lipoic acid is obtained. The compounds (R)-I and (S)-I and also (R)-()-II and (S)-()-II prepared by the processes according to the invention as a rule have a high enantiomeric excess, corresponding to an optical yield of 70 to 99%. The enantiomer ratios are measured directly by means of chiral HPLC on optically active columns. The present invention enables the enantiomerically pure 3-hydroxyoctanedioic acid diesters of the general formula I (R 1 , R 2 C 1 -C 20 -alkyl, C 3 -C 12 -cycloalkyl, C 7 -C 12 -aralkyl and/or mono- or binuclear aryl) to be made available in an economical manner in high chemical and optical yields as intermediates for the preparation of the enantiomerically pure -lipoic acids of the formula II. The following examples illustrate the invention without restricting it.

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a process for producing a hydroxyadamantanone derivative which is useful as a monomer or a material thereof for use in photosensitive resins and other functional polymers. BACKGROUND ART Alicyclic compounds each having a ring combined with a hydroxyl group are used, for example, as monomers or materials thereof for use in photosensitive resins and other functional polymers, and as intermediates of pharmaceuticals. Likewise, 5-hydroxy-2-adamantanone having an adamantane ring combined with a hydroxyl group is expected to be used as a monomer or a material thereof for use in resist resins, taking advantage of its unique cyclic structure. Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 9-327626 discloses a process for oxidizing adamantane with molecular oxygen by catalysis of a specific imide compound or of the imide compound and a metallic compound (refer to examples). However, the yield of 5-hydroxy-2-adamantanone having a hydroxyl group and an oxo group on an adamantane ring is very low according to this process, although adamantanol and adamantanepolyols can be obtained in good yields. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a process for obtaining 5-hydroxy-2-adamantanone in a good yield. After intensive investigations to achieve the above object, the present inventors found that a corresponding 5-hydroxy-2-adamantanone derivative can be produced in a good yield by oxidizing a 2-adamantanone derivative with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst including a combination of an imide compound having a specific structure and specific two metallic compounds. The present invention has been accomplished based on these findings. Specifically, the present invention provides a process for producing a hydroxyadamantanone derivative. This process includes the step of allowing a 2-adamantanone derivative represented by the following formula (1): wherein each of R a , R b , and R c is, identical to or different from one another, a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group, a hydroxyl group which may be protected by a protective group, a hydroxymethyl group which may be protected by a protective group, an amino group which may be protected by a protective group, a carboxyl group which may be protected by a protective group, or a nitro group, and of carbon atoms constituting an adamantane skeleton, the other carbon atoms than carbon atoms at bridgehead positions and at a bonding position of an oxo group may have a substituent, to react with oxygen in the presence of an imide compound represented by the following formula (2): wherein each of R 1 and R 2 is, identical to or different from each other, a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group, an aryl group, a cycloalkyl group, a hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group, a carboxyl group, an alkoxycarbonyl group, or an acyl group, where R 1 and R 2 may be combined to form a double bond or an aromatic or non-aromatic ring; X is an oxygen atom or a hydroxyl group; and one or two of N-substituted cyclic imido group indicated in the formula (2) may be further formed on the R 1 , R 2 , or on the double bond or aromatic or non-aromatic ring formed together by R 1 and R 2 , a vanadium compound, and a manganese compound to yield a 5-hydroxy-2-adamantanone derivative represented by the following formula (3): wherein R a , R b , and R c have the same meanings as defined above. In this connection, the term group protected by a protective group used in the present description means a group which can be derived from a group to be protected (a free functional group) and contains the major component of the group to be protected. The compound represented by the formula (1) may be referred to as substrate.

Imide Compound An important feature of the present invention is the combination use of the imide compound represented by the formula (2), a vanadium compound, and a manganese compound as a catalyst. If the imide compound is used alone or if the imide compound and a manganese compound are used in combination, a reaction rate is low and a target compound 5-hydroxy-2-adamantanone derivative cannot be significantly obtained in a good yield. If a catalyst including the imide compound in combination with a vanadium compound is employed, side reactions such as a ring-opening reaction excessively occur, and the target compound cannot be significantly obtained in a good yield.

The aryl group includes phenyl and naphthyl groups, for example. Illustrative cycloalkyl groups include cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl groups. Illustrative alkoxy groups are methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, isobutoxy, t-butoxy, pentyloxy, and hexyloxy groups, and other alkoxy groups each having about 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and preferably having about 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Among them, lower alkoxy groups each having about 1 to 4 carbon atoms are especially preferred. Examples of the alkoxycarbonyl group include methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, propoxycarbonyl, isopropoxycarbonyl, butoxycarbonyl, isobutoxycarbonyl, t-butoxycarbonyl, pentyloxycarbonyl, hexyloxycarbonyl, and other alkoxycarbonyl groups each having about 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkoxy moiety. Preferred alkoxycarbonyl groups are alkoxycarbonyl groups each having about 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkoxy moiety, of which lower alkoxycarbonyl groups each having about 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkoxy moiety are particularly preferred. Illustrative acyl groups include, for example, formyl, acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, isobutyryl, valeryl, isovaleryl, and pivaloyl groups, and other acyl groups each having about 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The substituents R 1 and R 2 may be identical to or different from each other. The substituents R 1 and R 2 in the formula (2) may be combined to form a double bond, or an aromatic or non-aromatic ring. The preferred aromatic or non-aromatic ring has about 5 to 12 members, and particularly about 6 to 10 members. The ring may be a heterocyclic ring or condensed heterocyclic ring, but it is often a hydrocarbon ring. Such rings include, for example, non-aromatic alicyclic rings (e.g., cyclohexane ring, and other cycloalkane rings which may have a substituent, cyclohexene ring, and other cycloalkene rings which may have a substituent), non-aromatic bridged rings (e.g., 5-norbornene ring, and other bridged hydrocarbon rings which may have a substituent), benzene ring, naphthalene ring, and other aromatic rings (including condensed rings) which may have a substituent. The ring is composed of an aromatic ring in many cases. The ring may have a substituent.

Oxygen As the oxygen, either of molecular oxygen and nascent oxygen can be used. Such molecular oxygen includes, but is not limited to, pure oxygen, and oxygen diluted with an inert gas such as nitrogen, helium, argon or carbon dioxide. Air is preferably used as the oxygen from the viewpoints of, for example, operating property and safety, as well as cost efficiency.
