No. 6,066,722, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/949,388, filed Oct. 14, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,848, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD The invention relates to certain nucleoside analogues, the use of these compounds as pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds and processes for preparing the compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) catalyses the phosphorolytic cleavage of ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides, for example, those of guanine and hypoxanthine to give the corresponding sugar-1-phosphate and guanine, hypoxanthine, or other purine bases. Humans deficient in purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) suffer a specific T-cell immunodeficiency due to an accumulation of dGTP and its toxicity to stimulated T lymphocytes. Because of this, inhibitors against PNP are immunosuppressive, and are active against T-cell malignancies. Clinical trials are now in progress using 9-(3-pyridylmethyl)-9-deazaguanine in topical form-against soriasis and in oral form for T-cell lymphoma and immunosuppression (BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc). The compound has an IC 50 of 35 nM for the enzyme. In animal studies, a 50 mg/kg oral dose is required for activity in a contact sensitivity ear swelling assay in mice. For human doses, this would mean approximately 3.5 grams for a 70 kg human. With this inhibitor, PNP is difficult to inhibit due to the relatively high activity of the enzyme in blood and mammalian tissues. Nucleoside and deoxynucleoside hydrolases catalyse the hydrolysis of nucleosides and deoxynucleosides. These enzymes are not found in mammals but are required for nucleoside salvage in some protozoan parasites. Purine phosphoribosyltransferases (PPRT) catalyze the transfer of purine bases to 5-phospho--D-ribose-1-pyrophosphate to form purine nucleotide 5-phosphates. Protozoan and other parasites contain PPRT which are involved in essential purine salvage pathways. Malignant tissues also contain PPRT. Some protozoan parasites contain purine nucleoside phosphorylases which also function in purine salvage pathways. Inhibitors of nucleoside hydrolases, purine nucleoside phosphorylases and PPRT can be expected to interfere with the metabolism of parasites and therefore be usefully employed against protozoan parasites. Inhibitors of PNP and PPRT can be expected to interfere with purine metabolism in malignant tissues and therefore be usefully employed against malignant tissues. It is an object of the invention to provide pharmaceuticals which are very effective inhibitors-of PNP, PPRT and/or nucleoside hydrolases.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In one aspect the invention provides compounds having the formula: wherein A is CH or N; B is chosen from OH, NH 2 , NHR, H or halogen; D is chosen from OH, NH 2 , NHR, H, halogen or SCH 3 ; R is an optionally substituted alkyl, aralkyl or aryl group; and X and Y are independently selected from H, OH or halogen except that when one of X and Y is hydroxy or halogen, the other is hydrogen; and Z is OH or, when X is hydroxy, Z is selected from hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, SQ or OQ, Q is an optionally substituted alkyl, aralkyl or aryl group; or a tautomer thereof; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; or an ester thereof; or a prodrug thereof. Preferably when either of B and/or D is NHR, then R is C 1 -C 4 alkyl. Preferably when one or more halogens are present they are chosen from chlorine and fluorine. Preferably when Z is SQ or OQ, Q is C 1 -C 5 alkyl or phenyl. Preferably D is H, or when D is other than H, B is OH. More preferably, B is OH, D is H, OH or NH 2 , X is OH or H, Y is H, most preferably with Z as OH, H or methylthio, especially OH. It will be appreciated that the representation of a compound of formula (I) wherein B and/or D is a hydroxy group used herein is of the enol-type tautomeric form of a corresponding amide, and this will largely exist in the amide form. The use of the enol-type tautomeric representation is simply to allow fewer structural formulae to represent the compounds of the invention. The present invention also provides compounds having the formula: wherein A, X, Y, Z and R are defined for compounds of formula (I) where first shown above; E is chosen from CO 2 H or a corresponding salt form, CO 2 R, CN, CONH 2 , CONHR or CONR 2 ; and G is chosen from NH 2 , NHCOR, NHCONHR or NHCSNHR; or a tautomer thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or an ester thereof, or a prodrug thereof. Preferably E is CONH 2 and G is NH 2 . More preferably, E is CONH 2 , G is NH 2 , X is OH or H, Y is H, most preferable with Z as OH, H or methylthio, especially OH.

The biological availability of a compound of formula (I) or formula (Ia) can be enhanced by conversion into a pro-drug form. Such a pro-drug can have improved lipophilicity relative to the compound of formula (I) or formula (Ia), and this can result in enhanced membrane permeability. One particularly useful form of a pro-drug is an ester derivative. Its utility relies upon the action of one or more of the ubiquitous intracellular lipases to catalyse the hydrolysis of these ester group(s), to release the compound of formula (I) and formula (Ia) at or near its site of action. In one form of a prodrug, one or more of the hydroxy groups in a compound of formula (I) or formula (Ia) can be O-acylated, to make, for example a 5-O-butyrate or a 2,3-di-O-butyrate derivative. Prodrug forms of 5-phosphate ester derivative of a compounds of formula (I) or formula (Ia) can also be made and may be particularly useful, since the anionic nature of the 5-phosphate may limit its ability to cross cellular membranes. Conveniently, such a 5-phosphate derivative can be converted to an uncharged bis(acyloxymethyl) ester derivative. The utility of such a pro-drug relies upon the action of one or more of the ubiquitous intracellular lipases to catalyse the hydrolysis of these ester group(s), releasing a molecule of formaldehyde and the compound of formula (I) or formula (Ia) at or near its site of action. Specific examples of the utility of, and general methods for making, such acyloxymethyl ester pro-drug forms of phosphorylated carbohydrate derivatives have been described, e.g. Kang et al., Nucleosides Nucleotides 17 (1998) 1089; Jiang et al., J. Biol. Chem ., 273 (1998) 11017; Li et al., Tetrahedron 53 (1997) 12017; and Kruppa et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett ., 7 (1997) 945.

A compound of formula (II) wherein Z is a halogen atom, can be prepared from a compound of formula (II) wherein Z is a hydroxy group, by selective N-alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonylation (typically with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, benzyl chloroformate, or methyl chloroformate and a base) or N-acylation (typically with trifluoroacetic anhydride and a base) to give a compound of formula (VII): wherein R is an alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonyl group or an optionally substituted alkyl- or aryl-carbonyl group and Z is a hydroxy group which is then either: (i) 5-O-sulfonylated (typically with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride, methanesulfonyl chloride or trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride and a base) to give a compound of formula (VII) wherein R is an alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonyl group or an optionally substituted alkyl- or aryl-carbonyl group and Z is an optionally substituted alkyl- or aryl-sulfonyloxy group, then subjected to a sulfonate displacement reaction with a reagent capable of providing a nucleophilic source of halide ion (typically sodium, lithium or a tetraalkylammonium fluoride, chloride, bromide, or iodide); or (ii) subjected to a reagent system capable of directly replacing a primary hydroxy group with a halogen atom, for example as in the Mitsunobu reaction (e.g. using triphenylphosphine, diethyl azodicarboxylate and a nucleophilic source of halide ion as above), by reaction with diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST), or by reaction with methyltriphenoxyphosphonium iodide in dimethylformamide see e.g. Stoeckler et al, Cancer Res., 46 (1986) 1774 or by reaction with thionyl chloride or bromide in a polar solvent such as hexamethylphosphoramide Kitagawa and Ichino, Tetrahedron Lett., (1971) 87 to give a compound of formula (VII) wherein R is an alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonyl group or an optionally substituted alkyl- or aryl-carbonyl group and Z is a halogen atom, which is then selectively N-deprotected by acid- or alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis or catalytic hydrogenolysis as required for the N-protecting group in use. A compound of formula (VII) wherein R is an alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonyl group or an optionally substituted alkyl- or aryl-carbonyl group and Z is a hydroxy group can also be prepared from a compound of formula (II) wherein Z is a trialkylsilyloxy, alkyldiarylsilyloxy or optionally substituted triarylmethoxy group, by N-alkyl- or aralkyl-carboxylation or N-acylation as above, then selective 5-O-deprotection by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis, catalytic hydrogenolysis, or treatment with a source of fluoride ion (eg tetrabutylammonium fluoride) as required for the 5-O-protecting group in use. The compound of formula (II) wherein Z is a hydrogen atom can be prepared from either: (i) a 5-hydroxy compound of formula (VII) wherein R is an alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonyl group or an optionally substituted alkyl- or aryl-carbonyl group and Z is a hydroxy group, by formation and radical deoxygenation of a 5-O-thioacyl derivative; or (ii) a 5-deoxy-5-halogeno-compound of formula (VII) wherein Z is a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom by reduction, either using a hydride reagent such as tributyltin hydride under free radical conditions, or by catalytic hydrogenolysis, typically with hydrogen over a palladium catalyst; followed by selective N-deprotection by acid- or alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis or catalytic hydrogenolysis as required for the N-protecting group in use. A compound of formula (II) wherein Z is an optionally substituted alkylthio, aralkylthio or arylthio group can be prepared by reaction of a 5-deoxy-5-halogeno or a 5-O-sulfonate derivative of formula (VII) wherein R is an alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonyl group or an optionally substituted alkyl- or aryl-carbonyl group and Z is a halogen atom or an optionally substituted alkyl- or aryl-sulfonyloxy group mentioned above, with an alkali metal or tetraalkylammonium salt of the corresponding optionally substituted alkylthiol, aralkylthiol or arylthiol followed by selective N-deprotection by acid- or alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis or catalytic hydrogenolysis as required for the N-protecting group in use see e.g. Montgomery et al., J.

It will be appreciated that the conversions above are conventional reactions employed in carbohydrate chemistry. Many alternative reagents and reaction conditions can be employed that will effect these conversions, and references to many of these can be found in the Specialist Periodical Reports Carbohydrate Chemistry, Volumes 1-28, published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, particularly in the chapters on Halogeno-sugars, Amino-sugars, Thio-sugars, Esters, Deoxy-sugars, and Nucleosides.

It will be appreciated that a compound of formula (I) has a nitrogen atom in its pyrrole or pyrazole ring capable of undergoing alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonylation or acylation during step (i), or thioacylation during step (ii), depending upon the reaction conditions employed. Should such derivatives be formed, the pyrrole or pyrazole N-substituents in the resulting derivatives are either sufficiently labile that they can be removed by mild acid- or alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis, or do not interfere with the subsequent chemistry in the imino-ribitol moiety, and can be removed during the final deprotection step(s).

Methods suitable for preparing such N-protected compounds can be found in Ciszewski et al., Nucleosides Nucleotides 12 (1993) 487; and Kambhampati et al., Nucleosides and Nucleotides 5 (1986) 539, as can methods to effect their 2-deoxygenation, and conditions suitable for N-deprotection.

It will be appreciated that such a compound of formula (I) or formula (XVII) has a nitrogen atom in its pyrrole or pyrazole ring capable of undergoing sulfonylation, thioacylation, acylation or aralkyl-oxycarbonylation, depending upon the reaction conditions employed. Should such derivatives be formed, the pyrrole or pyrazole N-substituents in the resulting derivatives are either sufficiently labile that they can be removed by mild acid- or alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis, or do not interfere with the subsequent chemistry in the iminoribitol moiety, and can be removed during the final deprotection step(s). Method (L): (2- and 4-aminopyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidine and 5- and 7-aminopyrazolo4,3-dpyrimidine analogues) chlorinating a compound of formula (XVIII) wherein R 1 is an alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonyl group or an optionally substituted alkyl- or aryl-carbonyl group, R 2 is an alkylcarbonyl or optionally substituted arylcarbonyl group, X and Y are independently chosen from a hydrogen or halogen atom, or a group of formula R 2 O, except that when one of X or Y is a halogen atom or a group of formula R 2 O, the other is a hydrogen atom, Z is a group of formula R 2 O or, when X is a group of formula R 2 O, Z is a hydrogen or halogen atom, a group of formula R 2 O or of formula OQ or SQ wherein Q is an optionally substituted alkyl, aralkyl or an aryl group, A is a nitrogen atom or a methine group, and one of B or D is a hydroxy group, and the other is a chlorine, bromine or hydrogen atom with a chlorinating reagent, and then displacing the chlorine atom with a nitrogen nucleophile by one of the following methods: (i) ammoniolysis, typically using liquid ammonia, concentrated aqueous ammonia, or a solution of ammonia in an alcohol such as methanol; or (ii) conversion first to a triazole derivative, by addition of 4-chlorophenyl phosphorodichloridate to a solution of the chloride and 1,2,4-triazole in pyridine, and alkaline hydrolysis of both the tetrazole moiety and the ester protecting groups with ammonium hydroxide; (iii) reaction with a source of azide ion, e.g. an alkali metal azide or tetraalkylammonium azide, and reduction of the resulting product, typically by catalytic hydrogenation; or (iv) reaction with an alkylamine or aralkylamine, such as methylamine or benzylamine in methanol. These conditions are sufficiently basic that O-ester groups will generally be cleaved but any residual O- or N-protecting groups can then be removed by acid- or alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis or catalytic hydrogenolysis as required for the protecting groups in use. Suitable chlorinating agents are thionyl chloride-dimethylformamide complex Ikehara and Uno, Chem. Pharm.

Suitable conditions for reaction with azide ion followed by reduction can be found in Marumoto et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 23 (1975) 759. Such a compound of formula (XVIII) can be prepared from a compound of formula (I) by selective N-alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonylation (typically with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, benzyl chloroformate, or methyl chloroformate and a base) or N-acylation of the 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-iminoribitol moiety and then O-acylation (typically with acetic anhydride or benzoyl chloride in pyridine). It will be appreciated that such a compound of formula (I) has a nitrogen atom in its pyrrole or pyrazole ring capable of undergoing alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonylation or acylation depending upon the reaction conditions employed. Should such derivatives be formed, the pyrrole or pyrazole N-substituents in the resulting derivatives are either sufficiently labile that they can be removed by mild acid- or alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis, or do not interfere with the subsequent chemistry, and can be removed during the final deprotection step(s).

This can then be converted to the corresponding compound of formula (XVIII) required for step (ii) above by O-acylation (typically with acetic anhydride or benzoyl chloride in pyridine). It will be appreciated that such a compound of formula (I) has a nitrogen atom in its pyrrole or pyrazole ring capable of undergoing alkyl- or aralkyl-oxycarbonylation or acylation depending upon the reaction conditions employed. Should such derivatives be formed, the pyrrole or pyrazole N-substituents in the resulting derivatives are either sufficiently labile that they can be removed by mild acid- or alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis, or do not interfere with the subsequent chemistry, and can be removed during the final deprotection step(s). Method (N): (4-amino-2-chloropyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidine and 7-amino-5-chloropyrazolo4,3-dpyrimidine analogues) chlorinating a compound of formula (XVIII) wherein B and D are hydroxy groups and R 1 , R 2 , X, Y, Z and A are as defined for formula (XVIII) where first shown above to give a corresponding dichloro-derivative of formula (XVIII) wherein B and D are chlorine atoms, typically with neat phosphorous oxychloride, and then displacing the more reactive chloro-substituent selectively by ammoniolysis, typically using anhydrous liquid ammonia in a pressure bomb or methanolic ammonia, which simultaneously cleaves the O-ester protecting groups. The residual N-protecting group is then removed by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis or catalytic hydrogenolysis as required for the protecting groups in use, to give a compound of formula (I) wherein B is an amino-group and D is a chlorine atom. The above dichloro-derivative of formula (XVIII) can be converted into a compound of formula (I) wherein B and D are chlorine atoms by removal of the O- and N-protecting groups by acid- or alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis as required for the protecting groups in use. It will be appreciated that one of the chlorine atoms in the aforementioned compound of formula (XVIII) or of formula (I) is quite reactive and that conditions chosen for deprotection must be mild enough that they limit unwanted reactions involving this atom.

Method (AF): (N-mono- and N,N-di-substituted 3-amino-pyrrole-2-carboxamide and 4-amino-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxamideanalogues) condensing a compound of formula (V) as defined where first shown, or an intermediate ethyl 4-amino-3-substituted-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxylate produced by step (vi) in Method (F), with a primary or secondary amine and fully deprotecting the resulting product by acid- or alkali-catalyzed hydrolysis or alcoholysis or catalytic hydrogenolysis as required for the O- and N-protecting groups in use. It will be appreciated that the approaches outlined in Methods (H), (I), (J), (K) and (W) are equally applicable to the synthesis of compounds of formula (Ia) to give analogous variations in the 1,4-imino-pentitol moiety. Method (AG): (Acyloxymethyl ester prodrugs) reacting a 5-phosphate ester of a compound of formula (I) or formula (Ia) with benzylchloroformate in the presence of a base, conveniently aqueous sodium bicarbonate, to form an N-benzyloxycarbonyl derivative, reacting this derivative with an acyloxymethyl halide of formula RCO 2 CH 2 X where R is an alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or tert-butyl and X is chloride, bromide or iodide, in the presence of a base, to form the 5-phosphate bis(acyloxymethyl) ester. Suitable conditions for the formation of the acetoxymethyl esters, using acetoxymethyl bromide and diisopropylethylamine in dimethylformamide, can be found in Kruppa et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett ., 7 (1997) 945. When desired, e.g. as when the aforementioned N-benzyloxycarbonyl derivative is not sufficiently soluble in the reaction solvent, this derivative may first be converted into the corresponding stannyl intermediates, e.g. the bis(tributylstannyl) phosphate derivative by reaction with tributyltin methoxide in methanol, prior to reaction with the acyloxymethyl halide in the presence of tetrabutylammonium bromide, following the method described by Kang et al., Nucleosides Nucleotides 17 (1998) 1089. It will be appreciated that the conversion of such a 5-phosphate group to the corresponding bis(acyloxymethyl) ester can be accomplished hy utilizing O- and or N-protected derivatives of compounds of formula (I) or formula (Ia) if desired, so long as the protecting groups can subsequently be removed without the use of strongly acidic or strongly basic conditions. Typically this requires the use of hydrogenolysis conditions for deprotection, so that O- and N-benzyl, -benzyloxymethyl or -benzyloxycarbonyl groups are favoured. FURTHER METHODS Compounds of the invention may also be prepared by other methods as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. FURTHER ASPECTS The compounds of the invention are useful both in free base form and in the form of salts. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts is intended to apply to non-toxic salts derived from inorganic or organic acids including for example salts derived from the following acidshydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, lactic, fumaric, succinic, tartaric, gluconic, citric, methanesulphonic and p-toluenesulphonic acids. The compounds of the invention are potent inhibitors of purine nucleoside phosphorylases, nucleoside hydrolases and/or phosphoribosyltransferases. For example, the IC 50 values for the compounds of formula (Ib) and formula (Ic) are less than 0.1 nM for both calf spleen PNP and human red blood cell PNP. The examples below provide further detail of the effectiveness of this inhibitor. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitory activity can be determined by the coupled xanthine oxidase method using inosine as the purine substrate (H. M. Kalckar, J.) Biol. Chem. 167 (1947) 429-443. Purine phosphoribosyltransferase activity is detected in the same assay using inosine 5-phosphate as the substrate. Slow onset inhibitor binding can be determined using methods such as those described by Merkler et al., Biochemistry 29 (1990) 8358-64. Parasite nucleoside hydrolase activity may be measured inter alia by methods disclosed in published PCT international patent application WO97/31008 and the references cited therein. The potency of the inhibitors of the invention provides important advantages over the prior art because of the relatively high activity of PNP in blood and mammalian tissue. As mentioned above the required dosage of 9-(3-pyridylmethyl)-9-deazaguanine may be of the order of 3.5 grams per dose for a human adult. The present invention provides the advantage that considerably lower quantities of the compounds are required. This allows cost saving and may also reduce unwanted side effects. The amount of active ingredient to be administered can vary widely according to the nature of the patients and the nature and extent of the disorder being treated. Typically the dosage for an adult human will be in the range less than 1 to 1000 milligrams, preferably 0.1 to 100 milligrams. The active compound can be administered with a conventional pharmaceutical carrier and may be administered orally, by injection or topically. The preferred route of administration is oral administration. For administration by this route the compounds can be formulated into solid or liquid preparations, eg tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions and dispersions. Such preparations are well known in the art as are other oral dosage forms not listed here. In a preferred embodiment the compounds of the invention are tableted with conventional tablet bases such as lactose, sucrose and corn starch together with a binder, a disintegration agent and a lubricant. These exipients are well known in the art. The binder may be for example corn starch or gelatin, the disintegrating agent may be potato starch or alginic acid and the lubricant may be magnesium stearate. Other components such as colouring agents and flavouring agents may be included. Liquid forms for use in the invention include carriers such as water and ethanol, with or without other agents such as a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant or suspending agent. The compounds of the invention may also be administered by injection in a physiologically acceptable diluent such as water or saline. The diluent may comprise one or more of other ingredients such as ethanol, propylene glycol, an oil or a pharmaceutically acceptably surfactant. Compounds of the invention may be applied to skin or mucous membranes. They may be present as ingredients in creams, preferably including a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent to assist passage through the skin or mucous membranes. Suitable cream bases are well known to those skilled in the art.

Example 1 Preparation of (1S)-1,4-dideoxy-1-C-(4-hydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-1,4-imino-D-ribitol Example 1.1. A solution of 5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (Furneaux et al, Tetrahedron 53 (1997) 2915 and references therein) (2.0 g) in pentane (40 ml) was stirred with N-chlorosuccinimide (1.2 g) for 1 h. The solids and solvent were removed and the residue was dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (40 ml) and cooled to 78 C. A solution of lithium tetramethylpiperidide (25 ml, 0.4 M in tetrahydrofuran) was added slowly dropwise. The resulting solution was then added via cannula to a solution of lithiated acetonitrile prepared by the dropwise addition of acetonitrile (2.08 ml, 40 mmol) to a solution of butyl lithium (29.8 ml, 41.8 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (50 ml) at 78 C., followed by stirring for 45 min and then addition of tetramethylpiperidine (0.67 ml, 4 mmol) at 78 C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 15 min then quenched with water and partitioned between water and chloroform. The organic phase was dried and concentrated, and then chromatography afforded (1S)-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1-C-cyanomethyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (1) (0.83 g). Example 1.2 A solution of the product from Example 1.1 (0.80 g) in dichloromethane (20 ml) containing di-tert-butyldicarbonate (0.59 g) was stirred at room temperature for 16 h. The solution was concentrated and then chromatography afforded (1S)-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1-C-cyanomethyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (2) (0.89 g). Example 1.3 To a solution of the product from Example 1.2 (0.88 g) in N,N-dimethylformamide (5 ml) was added tert-butoxy bis(dimethylamine)methane (1.5 ml) and the solution was heated at 65-70 C. for 1 h. Toluene (20 ml) was added and the solution was washed (3) with water, dried and concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran/acetic acid/water (1:1:1 v/v/v, 40 ml) at room temperature. After 1.5 h chloroform (50 ml) was added and the mixture was washed with water (2), aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and then dried and evaporated to dryness. Chromatography of the residue gave (1S)-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1-C-(1-cyano-2-hydroxyethenyl)-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (3) (0.68 g). Example 1.4 Glycine hydrochloride ethyl ester (0.76 g) and sodium acetate (0.9 g) were added to a stirred solution of the product from Example 1.3 (0.51 g) in methanol (10 ml). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 h and then concentrated to dryness. Chromatography of the residue gave the (1S)-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1-C-1-cyano-2-(ethoxycarbonylmethylamino)ethenyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (4) (0.48) g as a diastereomeric mixture.

Chromatography of the residue afforded (1S)-1-C-3-amino-1-N-benzyloxycarbonyl-2-ethoxycarbonyl-4-pyrrolyl-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (5) (0.22 g). Example 1.6 A solution of the product from Example 1.5 (0.22 g) in ethanol (10 ml) was stirred with 10% Pd/C (50 mg) in an atmosphere of hydrogen for 3 h. The solids and solvent were removed and the residue was dissolved in ethanol (10 ml) containing formamidine acetate (0.40 g) and the solution was heated under reflux for 8 h. The solvent was removed and chromatography of the residue gave (1S)-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1,4-dideoxy-1-C-4-hydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (6) (156 mg).

The residue was dissolved in methanol and treated with Amberlyst-A21 base resin until the solution was pH7. The solids and solvent were removed and the residue was dissolved in water, treated with excess aqueous HCl and then lyophilized. Trituration of the residue with ethanol gave (1S)-1,4-dideoxy-1-C-(4-hydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-1,4-imino-D-ribitol (7) hydrochloride salt as a white solid (25 mg).

Example 2 Preparation of (1S)-1-C-(2-amino-4-hydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-ribitol Example 2.1 A solution of (1S)-1-C-3-amino-1-N-benzyloxycarbonyl-2-ethoxycarbonyl-4-pyrrolyl-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1,4dideoxy 1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (Example 1.5) (0.87 g) in ethanol was stirred with 10% Pd/C (100 mg) in an atmosphere of hydrogen for 1.5 h. The solids and solvent were removed to give a residue (0.61 g). To a solution of a portion of this residue (0.12 g) in dichloromethane (10 ml) at 0 C. was added a solution of benzoyl isothiocyanate in dichloromethane (31 mL in 1 ml). After 0.5 h the solution was warmed to room temperature and 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene (80 mL) and methyl iodide (100 mL) were added. After another 0.5 h the reaction solution was applied directly to a silica gel column and elution afforded 0.16 g of (1S)-1-C-3-(N-benzoyl-S-methylisothiocarbamoyl)amino-2-ethoxycarbonyl-4-pyrrolyl-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol. Example 2.2 A solution of this S-methylisothiocarbamoylamino derivative, (0.20 g) in methanol saturated with ammonia was heated in a sealed tube at 95 C. for 16 h. The solvent was removed and chromatography of the residue afforded (1S)-1-C-2-amino-4-hydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl -N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol. Example 2.3 A solution of this protected iminoribitol (64 mg) in trifluoroacetic acid was allowed to stand at room temperature for 16 h. The solvent was removed and a solution of the residue in aqueous methanol (1:1) was treated with Amberlyst A21 base resin until the pH of the solution was 7. The solids and solvent were removed and a solution of the residue in water was treated with excess HCl and then concentrated to dryness. Trituration with ethanol gave (1S)-1-C-(2-amino-4-hydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-ribitol hydrochloride salt (24 mg), which darkened at ca. 260 C. but did not melt below 300 C.

Example 25 Enzyme Inhibition Results Example 25.1 Inhibition of Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylases Enzyme assays were conducted to assess the effectiveness of the products of Examples 1 and 2 (compounds Ib and Ic respectively) as inhibitors of purine nucleoside phosphorylase. The assays used human RBC and calf spleen purine nucleoside phosphorylase (ex Sigma, 90% pure) with inosine as substrate, in the presence of phosphate buffer, with detection of released hypoxanthine using xanthine oxidase coupled reaction. Materials. Inosine was obtained from Sigma. Xanthine oxidase (EC 1.1.3.22, buttermilk), human erythrocyte (as a lyophilized powder) and bovine spleen (in 3.2 M ammonium sulfate) purine nucleoside phosphorylases (EC 2.4.2.1) were purchased from Sigma. Human purine nucleoside phosphorylases obtained as a powder was reconstituted in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and rapidly frozen and stored at 80 C. Kinetic experiments were performed on a Uvikon 933 double beam ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments, San Diego, Calif.). Protein Concentrations. Protein concentrations for both isozymes were determined based on the quantative ultraviolet absorbance, using E 1cm 1%9.64 at 280 nm Stoelkler et al, Biochemistry, 32 (1978) 278 and a monomer moleculer weight of 32,000 Williams et al, Nucleic Acids Res. 12 (1984) 5779. Enzyme Assay. Enzymes were assayed spectrophotometrically using the coupled xanthine oxidase method Kalckar, J. Biol. Chem. 167 (1947) 429; Kim et al, J. Biol. Chem., 243 (1968) 1763. Formation of uric acid was monitored at 293 nm. A 40 mM inosine solution gave an absorbance change of 0.523 units at 293 m, upon complete conversion of inosine to uric acid and ribose 1-phosphate. Unless otherwise noted, the standard assay reaction contained: inosine (500 M), potassium phosphate (50 mM, pH 7.5); xanthine oxidase (0.06 units) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase in a final volume of 1.0 mL. One-Third-the-Sites Inhibition. Reaction mixtures of 6.7 nM bovine purine nucleoside phosphorylase containing varying amounts of compound Ib were pre-incubated at 30 C. for 1 hour. Reactions were initiated by addition of substrate (40 M inosine, 3 times the K m value) and assayed at 30 C. The reaction containing 0.6 nM inhibitor (concentration ratio of compound Ib/purine nucleoside phosphorylase0.09) showed 29% inhibition, that containing 1 nM inhibitor (compound Ib/purine nucleoside phosphorylase0.15) showed 44%, whereas the reaction containing 3 nM inhibitor (compound Ib/purine nucleoside phosphorylase0.44) had a rate decrease of 96%, and that containing 6 nM inhibitor (compound Ib/purine nucleoside phosphorylate87%) showed 99% inhibition. These interactions are shown in FIG. 1 . Purine nucleoside phosphorylase is known to be a homotrimer with a catalytic site on each of the three protein subunits Stoelkler et al, Biochemistry 32, (1978) 278. When the concentration of enzyme subunits is 6.7 nM, 50% inhibition of purine nucleoside phosphorylase occurs at approximately 1.1 nM. This result demonstrates that compound Ib binds tightly and that binding of compound Ib to one site of the trimeric enzyme leads to complete inhibition. Activity Recovery from the Complex of Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase with Compound Ib. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (6.7 M) and sufficient compound Ib (3 M) to inhibit 96% of purine nucleoside phosphorylase activity were incubated at 30 C. for 1 hour. An aliquot of this solution was diluted 1000-fold into a buffered solution of 500 M inosine containing xanthine oxidase (0.06 units). The production of uric acid was monitored over time and the progres curve was fit to the kinetic model of FIG. 2 . Dilution of inhibited purine nucleoside phosphorylase into a large volume of solution without inhibitor provided the rate of release of compound Ib from inhibited purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Under conditions of the experiment in FIG. 2 , the time to achieve the new enzyme-inhibitor equilibrium is 5000 sec, an indication of a slow, tight-binding inhibitor Morrison and Walsh, Advances Enzymol. 61 (1988) 201. The rate contant k 6 is an estimate of the apparent first-order rate constant for dissociation of the complex under these experimental conditions and is 2.910 4 sec 1 in this example. Inhibitory Mechanism. Slow, tight-binding inhibitors generally follow the kinetic mechanism Morrison and Walsh, Advances Enzymol. 61 (1988) 201: where EI is a rapidly formed, initial collision complex of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (E) and compound Ib (I) that slowly isomerizes to a tighter complex EI*. Product formation curves are described by the following integrated rate equation 1: Pv s t(v o v s )(1e kt )/k1 where P is the amount of product hypoxanthine (observed as uric acid in the present assay system), t is time, v o is the initial rate, v s is the final steady-state rate and k is the overall (observed) rate constant given by equation 2: kk6k5(I/K i )/(1(S/K m )(I/K i where K m is the Michaelis complex for purine nucleoside phosphorylase, S is inosine concentration, I is the concentration of compound Ib and K i is as described below. The rate of formation of the tightly bound complex is k5 and the rate of its dissociation is k6. K i , the inhibition constant for standard competitive inhibition (which influences v o ) and K i *, the overall inhibition constant (which influences v.), are defined as: K i k4/k3 K i *K i k 6 /(k 5 k 6 ) Determination of K i *. K i * was determined by measuring v s for reactions at a range of inhibitor concentrations, plotting v s vs I and fitting the curve to the competive inhibition equation 3: v s V max S/K m (1I/K i *)S3 where V max is the uninhibited reaction rate for purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and the remaining terms are described above. The result of this analysis indicates an overall effective inhibition constant (K i *) of 2.50.210 11 M (252 pM) for compound Ib (FIG. 3 ). Approximation of K i , k 5 and k6. Calculation of K i directly from v o and the competitive inhibition equation (above) is difficult for compound Ib because v o changes very little as a function of I at inhibitor concentrations which cause complete inhibition following slow onset. This result establishes that the initial dissociation constant K i is much greater than the equilibrium dissociation constant K i *. Approximations of k 5 and K i were calculated from k (values obtained from curve fits of equation 1, FIG. 4 ) by using equation 2. Using the knowledge that k 6 k 5 (I/K i )/(1(A/K m )(I/K i ), equation 2 can be rearranged so that a double reciprocal plot of 1/k vs 1/I gives a straight line with y intercept1/k 5 and x intercept of (1/k 5 )/K i /k 5 )*(A/K m )). Substitution of these values into equation 2 give an approximation for k 6 . FIG. 4 demonstrates the slow-onset, tight-binding inhibition which occurs when a small concentration of enzyme (0.8 nM) competes for 200 nM compound Ib in the presence of 500 M inosine. Under these conditions the apparent first order rate constant for onset of inhibition in FIG. 4 was 2610 4 sec 1 . The result of FIG. 4 demonstrates that even at inosine concentrations over 100 times that present in human serum or tissues, compound Ib can give 99% inhibition of the enzyme after several minutes of slow-onset inhibition. Based on analyses of experiments of the type shown in FIGS. 1-4 , the experimentally estimated dissociation constants and rates for the bovine purine nucleoside hosphorylase with compound Ib are: K m 15 M K i 194 nM K i *252 pM k 5 1.40.210 2 sec 1 k 6 1.80.510 5 sec 1 Inhibition of Human Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase. Studies similar to those described above for the interaction of bovine purine nucleoside phosphorylase were conducted with purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) from human erythrocytes. The values for the overall inhibition constant, K i *, for the interaction of human and bovine PNP with compound Ib are: enzyme K i *, compound Ib K i *, compound Ic human PNP 72 26 pM 29 8 pM bovine PNP 23 5 pM 30 6 pM The compound Ic is a more efficient inhibitor for the human enzyme than compound Ib, but compound Ib is slightly more efficient at inhibiting the bovine enzyme. Compounds Ib and Ic are more efficient at inhibiting both PNP enzymes than previously reported compounds. Summary of Compounds Ib and Ic as Inhibitors of Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylases. Inhibitors usually function by binding at every catalytic site to cause functional inhibition in living organisms. The one-third-the-sites inhibition and the slow-onset tight-binding inhibition described above indicate that compounds Ib and Ic are very potent inhibitors of purine nucleoside phosphorylases able to function in the presence of a large excess of substrate. The methods for the determination of the kinetic constants are given in detail in Merkler, D. J., Brenowitz, M., and Schramm, V. L. Biochemistry 29 (1990) 8358-8364. Example 25.2 Oral Availability and in vivo Efficacy of Compound Ib as a PNP Inhibitor. A single oral dose of 10 7 mole of Compound Ib (27 g) was administered with food to a young adult male mouse. Blood samples were collected from the tail at times indicated in FIG. 5 . Dilution of blood into saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (final concentration 0.15%) resulted in lysis of blood cells and release of enzyme. PNP activity was measured with inosine and phosphate as substrates as indicated above. The results establish that Compound Ib is absorbed into the blood and taken up by blood cells to cause PNP inhibition with a half-time (t ) of 14 minutes. Blood samples were taken for an extended time and analyzed for PNP activity to determine the biological t for Compound Ib for inhibitors of blood PNP. The activity of blood PNP recovered with a t of 100 hours. These results establish that Compound Ib is orally available and has an extended period of biological effectiveness. These tests establish that the compounds described herein have favorable pharmacological lifetimes. Inhibition of Protozan Nucleoside Hydrolases by Compounds Ib and Ic. Protozan parasites use the hydrolysis of purine nucleosides such as inosine to provide purine bases such as hypoxanthine to provide essential precursors for RNA and DNA synthesis. Protozoan parasites are purine auxotrophs. Using inhibition methods similar to those described above, a nucleoside hydrolase from Crithidia fasciculata Parkin, et al, J Biol, Chem. 266 (1991) 20658 and a nucleoside hydrolase from Trypanosoma brucei brucei Parkin, J. Biol. Chem. (1996) 21713 were tested for inhibition by compounds Ib and Ic. The inhibition of nucleoside hydrolase from C. fasciculata by Compound Ib is exemplified in FIG. 6 . Similar studies indicated that Coumpound Ib and Ic are nanamolar inhibitors for nucleoside hydrolases from C. fasciculata and from T. brucei brucei . Compound Ic (ACH, BNH 2 , DH, XOH, YH, ZOH) is a nanamolar inhibitor of both enzymes and Compound Va (ORNH 2 , zOH, CO 2 BuH or H 2 , and the isopropylidine group removed to form two hydroxyl groups) is also a nanamolar inhibitor of both enzymes. The results are summarised below.

The inhibitors bind in direct competition with substrate, therefore the K i inhibition constants are direct competitive inhibition values. The compounds provide sufficient inhibition to the purine nucleoside hydrolases to inhibit protozoan parasites at readily accessible pharmacological doses. The methods and materials used are as described in published PCT international application WO 97/31008 using p-nitrophenyl riboside as substrate. Example 25.3 Inhibition of Purine Phosphoribisyl Transferases (PPRT) by 5-Phosphates of Compounds Ib and Ic. Protozoan parasites, human tissues and tumors use PPRT for salvage of purine bases. Interruption of PPRT activity is expected to disrupt purine metabolism in these systems. 5-phosphorylated Compounds I and Ic were anlyzed for inhibition of PPRT from human and malarial origins. The slow-onset inhibition curve for the 5-phosphate of Compound Ib with malaria PPRT is illustrated in FIG. 7 . The K i * determination for the 5-phosphate of Compound Ib with malarial PPRT is shown in FIG. 8 . Analysis of both human and malarial enzymes with the 5-phosphates of Compounds Ib and Ic are summarized below. enzyme Compound Ib-5-phosphate Compound Ic-5-phosphate source K i K i * K i K i * PPRT human 40 nM 3 nM 14 nM 8 nM PPRT 33 nM 3 nM 48 nM slow onset malaria not observed Full inhibition studies indicated that the inhibitors are competitive with IMP. The nanamolar inhibition constants for both inhibitors with both enzymes are readily accessible pharmacologic doses of these inhibitors. It is anticipated that the nucleoside kinase activities of human and/or parasitic organisms will convert one or more of the compounds described herein to the respective 5-phosphates. These compounds thereby provide precursors for pharmacologic doses of the 5-phosphates for intracellular interruption of PPRT activity.

Example 36.4 Sodium hydride (0.5 g, 60% dispersion in oil) was added to a solution of the product from example 36.3 (2.0 g) in tetrahydrofuran (40 ml) followed by tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (1.37 g) and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. The reaction was quenched with dropwise addition of water and then partitioned between ether (100 ml) and water (150 ml). The organic phase was dried and concentrated to dryness. A solution of the residue in dichloromethane (40 ml) was stirred while N-bromosuccinimide added slowly poriton-wise until t.l.c. analysis indicated complete conversion to a less polar product. The solution was washed with water, aqueous sodium bicarbonate, dried and concentrated. Chromatography of the residue afforded 2,4-dibenzyloxy-7-bromo-9-N-tert-butyldimethylsilylpyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidine as a white solid (1.8 g). Example 36.5 An imine was prepared from 5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (0.30 g) by N-chlorination with N-chlorosuccinimide followed by elimination of hydrogen chloride with lithium tetramethylpiperidide as described in Example 1.1, but with the following modifications: (i) when addition of the solution of lithium tetramethylpiperidide was complete, petroleum ether was added and the solution was washed with water, dried and concentrated to dryness; (ii) the residue was chromatographed on silica gel eluted with 0.2% triethylamine and 30% ethyl acetate in hexanes to afford the pure imine (0.215 g). A solution of this imine in ether (2 ml) was added to a solution prepared by slow addition of butyllithium (1.4 M in hexanes) to a solution of the product from Example 36.4 (0.786 g) in anisole (20 ml) and ether (30 ml) at 70 C. until t.l.c. analysis indicated lithium exchange with the starting material was complete. The mixture was allowed to slowly warm to 15 C., and then was washed with water, dried and concentrated. Chromatography of the residue afforded (1S)-1-C-)2,4-dibenzyloxy-9-N-tert-butyldimethylsilylpyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-5-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (0.225 g). Example 36.6 A solution of the product from Example 36.5 (0.10 g) in ethanol (5 ml) was stirred in a hydrogen atmosphere with 10% palladium on charcoal (0.05 g) for 2 h. The solids and solvent were removed and concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid (1 ml) was added to a solution of the residue in methanol (5 ml). After standing overnight, the solution was concentrated to dryness and the residue was extracted with ether and then triturated with ethanol and filtered to give (1S)-1,4-dideoxy-1-C-)2,4-dihydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-li4-imino-D-ribitol hydrochloride (0.025 g). 13 C NMR (D 2 O), (ppm) : 159.8 (C), 155.8 (C), 137.1 (C), 131.4 (CH), 114.2 (C), 104.1 (C), 76.2 (CH), 73.7 (CH), 68.5 (CH), 61.6 (CH 2 ) and 58.5 (CH). Example 37 Preparation of 1,4-dideoxy-(1S)-1-C-(2,4-dihydroxypyrrolo-3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-1,4-imino-D-ribitol 5-phosphate bis-ammonium salt Example 37.1 A solution tetrabutylammonium fluoride (1 M, 0.5 ml) was added to a solution of the bis-silylated product from Example 36.5 (110 mg) in tetrahydrofuran. After 2 h, the solution was diluted with toluene, washed with water (2), dried, and evaporated to dryness. The resulting syrup was dissolved in methanol and tert-butoxycarbonic anhydride (65 mg) was added. After 30 min, the reaction mixture was concentrated to dryness and subjected to chromatography to give (1S)-1-C-(2,4-dibenzyloxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-ribitol (64 mg). Example 37.2 The product for Example 37.2 (64 mg) was converted by the method detailed in Example 33 into, 1,4-dideoxy-(1S)-1-C-(2,4-dihydroxypyrrolo3,2-dpyrimidin-7-yl)-1,4-imino-D-ribitol 5-phosphate bis-ammonium salt (11 mg); 13 C-NMR (D 2 O), (ppm): 156.0 (C), 151.9 (C), 134.0 (C), 127.3 (CH), 110.9 (C), 102.8 (C), 75.1 (CH), 70.4 (CH), 65.1 (CH), 61.9 (CH 2 ), and 54.5 (CH).

The invented RAR antagonists can be administered to mammals, including humans, for the purpose of preventing or diminishing action of RAR agonists on the bound receptor sites. Specifically, the RAR agonists are administered or coadministered with retinoid drugs to prevent or ameliorate toxicity or side effects caused by retinoids or vitamin A or vitamin A precursors. The retinoid negative hormones can be used to potentiate the activities of other retinoids and nuclear receptor agonists. For example, the retinoid negative hormone called AGN 193109 effectively increased the effectiveness of other retinoids and steroid hormones in in vitro transactivation assays. Additionally, transactivation assays can be used to identify compounds having negative hormone activity. These assays are based on the ability of negative hormones to down-regulate the activity of chimeric retinoid receptors engineered to possess a constitutive transcription activator domain.",

The compounds of this invention: (i) potently inhibit farnesyl protein transferase, but not geranylgeranyl protein transferase I, in vitro; (ii) block the phenotypic change induced by a form of transforming Ras which is a farnesyl acceptor but not by a form of transforming Ras engineered to be a geranylgeranyl acceptor; (iii) block intracellular processing of Ras which is a farnesyl acceptor but not of Ras engineered to be a geranylgeranyl acceptor; and (iv) block abnormal cell growth in culture induced by transforming Ras. The compounds of this invention inhibit farnesyl protein transferase and the farnesylation of the oncogene protein Ras. Thus, this invention further provides a method of inhibiting farnesyl protein transferase, (e.g., ras farnesyl protein transferase) in mammals, especially humans, by the administration of an effective amount of the tricyclic compounds described above. The administration of the compounds of this invention to patients, to inhibit farnesyl protein transferase, is useful in the treatment of the cancers described below. This invention provides a method for inhibiting or treating the abnormal growth of cells, including transformed cells, by administering an effective amount of a compound of this invention. Abnormal growth of cells refers to cell growth independent of normal regulatory mechanisms (e.g., loss of contact inhibition). This includes the abnormal growth of: (1) tumor cells (tumors) expressing an activated Ras oncogene; (2) tumor cells in which the Ras protein is activated as a result of oncogenic mutation in another gene; and (3) benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant Ras activation occurs. This invention also provides a method for inhibiting or treating tumor growth by administering an effective amount of the tricyclic compounds, described herein, to a mammal (e.g., a human) in need of such treatment. In particular, this invention provides a method for inhibiting or treating the growth of tumors expressing an activated Ras oncogene by the administration of an effective amount of the above described compounds. Examples of tumors which may be inhibited or treated include, but are not limited to, lung cancer (e.g., lung adenocarcinoma), pancreatic cancers (e.g., pancreatic carcinoma such as, for example, exocrine pancreatic carcinoma), colon cancers (e.g., colorectal carcinomas, such as, for example, colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma), myeloid leukemias (for example, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)), thyroid follicular cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), bladder carcinoma, epidermal carcinoma, breast cancer and prostate cancer. It is believed that this invention also provides a method for inhibiting or treating proliferative diseases, both benign and malignant, wherein Ras proteins are aberrantly activated as a result of oncogenic mutation in other genesi.e., the Ras gene itself is not activated by mutation to an oncogenic formwith said inhibition or treatment being accomplished by the administration of an effective amount of the tricyclic compounds described herein, to a mammal (e.g., a human) in need of such treatment. For example, the benign proliferative disorder neurofibromatosis, or tumors in which Ras is activated due to mutation or overexpression of tyrosine kinase oncogenes (e.g., neu, src, abl, lck, and fyn), may be inhibited or treated by the tricyclic compounds described herein. The tricyclic compounds useful in the methods of this invention inhibit or treat the abnormal growth of cells. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that these compounds may function through the inhibition of G-protein function, such as ras p21, by blocking G-protein isoprenylation, thus making them useful in the treatment of proliferative diseases such as tumor growth and cancer. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that these compounds inhibit ras farnesyl protein transferase, and thus show antiproliferative activity against ras transformed cells.

This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/055,856 now abandoned; attorney docket number 33,194-1-C1), filed on Apr. 6, 1998, which is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser.

BACKGROUND The present invention relates to the discovery of novel, low molecular weight, non-peptide inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. gelatinases, stromelysins and collagenases) and TNF- converting enzyme (TACE, tumor necrosis factor- converting enzyme) which are useful for the treatment of diseases in which these enzymes are implicated such as arthritis, tumor metastasis, tissue ulceration, abnormal wound healing, periodontal disease, bone disease, proteinuria, aneurysmal aortic disease, degenerative cartilage loss following traumatic joint injury, demyelinating diseases of the nervous system and HIV infection. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a group of enzymes that have been implicated in the pathological destruction of connective tissue and basement membranes Woessner, J. F., Jr. FASEB J. 1991, 5, 2145; Birkedal-Hansen, H.; Moore, W. G. I.; Bodden, M. K.; Windsor, L. J.; Birkedal-Hansen, B.; DeCarlo, A.; Engler, J. A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol.

These zinc containing endopeptidases consist of several subsets of enzymes including collagenases, stromelysins and gelatinases. Of these classes, the gelatinases have been shown to be the MMPs most intimately involved with the growth and spread of tumors, while the collagenases have been associated with the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis Howell, D.

Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that gelatinase is involved in plaque rupture associated with atherosclerosis Dollery, C. M.; McEwan, J. R.; Henney, A. M. Circ. Res. 1995, 77, 863; Zempo, N.; Koyama, N.; Kenagy, R. D.; Lea, H. J.; Clowes, A. W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996, 16, 28; Lee, R. T.; Schoen, F. J.; Loree, H. M.; Lark, M. W., Libby, P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996, 16, 1070.. Other conditions mediated by MMPs are restenosis, MMP-mediated osteopenias, inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, skin aging, tumor growth, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, corneal ulceration, abnormal wound healing, bone disease, proteinuria, aneurysmal aortic disease, degenerative cartilage loss following traumatic joint injury, demyelinating diseases of the nervous system, cirrhosis of the liver, glomerular disease of the kidney, premature rupture of fetal membranes, inflammatory bowel disease, periodontal disease, age related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, ocular inflammation, keratoconus, Sjogrens syndrome, myopia, ocular tumors, ocular angiogenesis/neovascularization and corneal graft rejection. The hypothesis that MMPs are important mediators of the tissue destruction that occurs in arthritis has long been considered, since it was first recognized that these enzymes are capable of degrading collagens and proteoglycans which are the major structural components of cartilage Sapolsky, A. I.; Keiser, H.; Howell, D. S.; Woessner, J. F., Jr.; J. Clin. Invest. 1976, 58, 1030; Pelletier, J.-P.; Martel-Pelletier, J.; Howell, D. S.; Ghandur-Mnaymneh, L.; Enis, J. E.; Woessner, J. F., Jr., Arthritis Rheum. 1983, 26, 63., and continues to develop as new MMPs are identified. For example, collagenase-3 (MMP-13) was cloned from breast cancer cells in 1994, and the first report that it could be involved in arthritis appeared in 1995 Freiji, J. M.; Diez-Itza, I.; Balbin, M.; Sanchez, L. M.; Blasco, R.; Tolivia, J.; Lopez-Otin, C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994, 269, 16766; Flannery, C. R.; Sandy, J. D. 102-17, 41 st Ann. Meet. Orth Res. Soc. Orlando, Fla. Feb. 13-16, 1995.. Evidence is accumulating that implicates MMP-13 in the pathogenesis of arthritis. A major structural component of articular cartilage, type II collagen, is the preferred substrate for MMP-13 and this enzyme is significantly more efficient at cleaving type II collagen than the other collagenases Knauper, V.; Lopez-Otin, C.; Smith, B.; Knight, G.; Murphy, G. J. Biol. Chem., 1996, 271, 1544-1550; Mitchell, P. G.; Magna, H. A.; Reeves, L. M.; Lopresti-Morrow, L. L.; Yocum, S. A.; Rosner, P. J.; Geoghegan, K. F.; Hambor, J. E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996, 97, 761.. MMP-13 is produced by chondrocytes, and elevated levels of MMP-13 has been found in human osteoarthritic tissues Reboul, P.; Pelletier, J-P.; Hambor, J.; Magna, H.; Tardif, G.; Cloutier, J-M.; Martel-Pelletier, J. Arthritis Rheum. 1995, 38 (Suppl. 9), S268; Shlopov, B. V.; Mainardi, C. L.; Hasty, K. A. Arthritis Rheum. 1995, 38 (Suppl. 9), S313; Reboul, P.; Pelletier, J-P.; Tardif, G.; Cloutier, J-M.; Martel-Pelletier, J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996, 97, 2011. Potent inhibitors of MMPs were described over 10 years ago, but the poor bioavailability of these early peptidic, substrate mimetic MMP inhibitors precluded their evaluation in animal models of arthritis. More bioavailable, non-peptidic MMP inhibitors may be preferred for the treatment of diseases mediated by MMPs. TNF- converting enzyme catalyzes the formation of TNF- from membrane bound TNF- precursor protein. TNF- is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is now thought to have a role in rheumatoid arthritis, septic shock, graft rejection, insulin resistance and HIV infection in addition to its well documented antitumor properties. For example, research with anti-TNF- antibodies and transgenic animals has demonstrated that blocking the formation of TNF- inhibits the progression of arthritis Rankin, E. C.; Choy, E. H.; Kassimos, D.; Kingsley, G. H.; Sopwith, A. M.; Isenberg, D. A.; Panayi, G. S. Br. J Rheumatol. 1995, 34, 334; Pharmaprojects, 1996, Therapeutic Updates 17 (October), 197. This observation has recently been extended to humans as well. Other conditions mediated by TNF- are congestive heart failure, cachexia, anorexia, inflammation, fever, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, and inflammatory bowel disease. It is expected that small molecule inhibitors of gelatinase and TACE therefore have the potential for treating a variety of disease states. While a variety of MMP and TACE inhibitors have been identified and disclosed in the literature, the vast majority of these molecules are peptidic or peptide-like compounds that may have bioavailability and pharmacokinetic problems that would limit their clinical effectiveness. Low molecular weight, potent, long-acting, orally bioavailable inhibitors of gelatinases, collagenases and/or TACE are therefore highly desirable for the potential chronic treatment of the above mentioned disease states. Several non-peptidc, sulfur-containing hydroxamic acids have recently been disclosed and are listed below. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,455,258, 5,506,242 and 5,552,419, as well as European patent application EP606,046A1 and WIPO international publications WO96/00214 and WO97/22587 disclose non-peptide matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors of which the compound CGS27023A is representative. The discovery of this type of MMP inhibitor is further detailed by MacPherson, et. al. in J. Med. Chem., (1997),40, 2525. Additional publications disclosing sulfonamide based MMP inhibitors which are variants of the sulfonamide-hydroxamate shown below, or the analogous sulfonamide-carboxylates, are European patent application EP-757984-A1 and WIPO international publications WO95/35275, WO95/35276, WO96/27583, WO97/19068 and WO97/27174. Publications disclosing -sulfonamide-hydroxamate MMP inhibitor analogs of CGS 27023A in which the carbon alpha to the hydroxamic acid has been joined in a ring to the sulfonamide nitrogen, as shown below, include WIPO international publications WO96/33172 and WO97/20824. The German patent application DE19,542,189-A1 discloses additional examples of cylic sulfonamides as MMP inhibitors. In this case the sulfonamide-containing ring is fused to a phenyl ring to form an isoquinoline. Analogs of the sulfonamide-hydroxamate MMP inhibitors in which the sulfonamide nitrogen has been replaced by a carbon atom, as shown in the general structure below, are European patent application EP-780386-A1 and WIPO international publication WO97/24117.

The following scheme (Scheme I) illustrates the reaction sequence employed. In the schemes which follow, the moiety A is defined as the bicyclic heteroaryl moiety of B, as shown immediately below: For purposes of illustration only, wherein the bicyclic heteroaryl group A shown is a quinoline, 4-chloro-7-trifluoromethylquinoline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester, prepared from the corresponding aniline, is reacted with N-benzyl-p-methoxybenzenesulfonamide, wherein Z is p-methoxybenzene, to provide the requisite N,N-disubstituted sulfonamido-ester which is then converted into the corresponding hydroxamic acid in two steps. Alternatively, the 4-chloroquinoline carboxylic acid ester could be first reacted with R 7 NH 2 and the resulting 4-(R 7 -amino)quinoline carboxylic acid ester then reacted with the appropriate ZSO 2 Cl. Hydrolysis of the ester and reaction with hydroxylamine hydro-chloride would then give the invention compound. Functionalization of the quinoline ring via a palladium catalyzed Heck coupling between the iodoquinoline and tributylvinyltin is shown in Scheme II. ,-Unsaturated esters and amides can be coupled to the haloquinoline via Heck reactions. A variety of other trialkyltin reagents are readily available and may be similarly used. Boronic acids, commercially available or readily prepared, may also be coupled to the iodoquinoline using the Suzuki reaction. Functionalization of haloquinolines may also be accomplished via palladium catalyzed couplings of alkynes, as illustrated in Scheme III. Hydrogenation of the alkynes accesses the olefins and alkanes as well. Schemes IV and V illustrate two methods for incorporating amino groups into the substituent attached to the sulfonamide nitrogen of the compounds of the invention. Thus, in Scheme IV the NH-sulfonamide is alkylated with propargyl bromide to provide the propargyl sulfonamide. This alkyne is reacted with paraformaldehyde in the presence of a primary or secondary amine and cuprous chloride to give the propargyl amine which is converted, as before, to the desired hydroxamic acid. In Scheme V, selective hydrolysis of the ester of the p-carboethoxybenzyl sulfonamide group provides a mono-carboxylic acid. This acid may be converted into an amide (not shown), followed by conversion of the second ester, ACO 2 R, into the corresponding hydroxamate, or reduced to the corresponding alcohol with diborane. The alcohol may be converted into the analogous amine via the benzylic bromide, followed by conversion of the the ester, ACO 2 R, into the corresponding hydroxamate. Methods for synthesizing variations of substituents on the sulfonyl aryl group are shown in Schemes VI through VIII. As shown in Scheme VI, biaryl sulfonyl groups are synthesized by Suzuki couplings on a bromo-substituted benzene sulfonamide. The starting bromo-substituted benzene sulfonamide is synthesized from the commercially available bromobenzenesulfonyl chloride and the amino-acid or amino-ester, H 2 NACO 2 R, followed by alkylation of the resulting NH-sulfonamide. Alternatively, the bromo aryl sulfonamide is converted into the corresponding boronic acid by the method of Ishiyama, et.al. J. Org. Chem. (1995), 60, 7508 followed by coupling with an appropriate aryl halide. Methods for synthesizing sulfonyl aryl ethers are shown in Schemes VII through IX. In Scheme VII biaryl ethers, or aryl heteroaryl ethers, are synthesized starting from the known sulfonyl chlorides (see for example: Zook S E; Dagnino, R; Deason, M E, Bender, S L; Melnick, M J WO 97/20824). Alternatively, the biaryl ethers may be prepared from the corresponding boronic acids or via the sulfonyl phenols as shown in Scheme VIII. Aryl ethers may also be prepared via displacement of the fluorine from a para-fluorobenzene sulfonamide, as shown in Scheme IX. Aryl or alkyl ethers may be prepared in this manner. Scheme X illustrates the synthesis of pyrazolopyridines, isoxazolopyridines, and isothiazolopyridines of the invention. Thus, an aminopyrazole, aminoisoxazole or aminoisothiazole is condensed with ethoxymethylene malonate to provide the intermediate, B. This compound is converted into the pyrazolopyridine, isoxazolopyridine, or isothiazolopyridine, C, by heating at 240 C. Compound C is then converted into the chloro-ester, D, via reaction with phosphorus oxychloride. Displacement of the chloro substituent with a sulfonamide then gives compound E. Hydrolysis of the ester and conversion of the carboxylate into the hydroxamate then gives compound G. Salts of the invention compounds can be prepared according to standard procedures. Pyrazolo1,5-bpyrimidines of the invention are prepared according to scheme XI using reactions as described for scheme X. The following specific examples illustrate the preparation of representative compounds of this invention. The starting materials, intermediates, and reagents are either commercially available or can be readily prepared following standard literature procedures by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis.

As described for Example 91, the preceding compound is converted to the title compound. Representative compounds of this invention were evaluated as inhibitors of the enzymes MMP-1, MMP-9, MMP-13 and TNF- converting enzyme (TACE). The standard pharmacological test procedures used, and results obtained which establish this biological profile are shown below. Test Procedures for Measuring MMP-1, MMP-9, and MMP-13 Inhibition These standard pharmacological test procedures are based on the cleavage of a thiopeptide substrates such as Ac-Pro-Leu-Gly(2-mercapto-4-methyl-pentanoyl)-Leu-Gly-OEt by the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1, MMP-13 (collagenases) or MMP-9 (gelatinase), which results in the release of a substrate product that reacts colorimetrically with DTNB (5,5-dithiobis(2-nitro-benzoic acid)). The enzyme activity is measured by the rate of the color increase. The thiopeptide substrate is made up fresh as a 20 mM stock in 100% DMSO and the DTNB is dissolved in 100% DMSO as a 100 mM stock and stored in the dark at room temperature. Both the substrate and DTNB are diluted together to 1 mM with substrate buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM CaCl 2 ) before use. The stock of enzyme is diluted with buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM CaCl 2 , 0.02% Brij) to the desired final concentration. The buffer, enzyme, vehicle or inhibitor, and DTNB/substrate are added in this order to a 96 well plate (total reaction volume of 200 l) and the increase in color is monitored spectrophotometrically for 5 minutes at 405 nm on a plate reader and the increase in color over time is plotted as a linear line. Alternatively, a fluorescent peptide substrate is used. In this test procedure, the peptide substrate contains a fluorescent group and a quenching group. Upon cleavage of the substrate by an MMP, the fluorescence that is generated is quantitated on the fluorescence plate reader. The assay is run in HCBC assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mM Ca 2 , 0.02% Brij, 0.5% Cysteine), with human recombinant MMP-1, MMP-9, or MMP-13. The substrate is dissolved in methanol and stored frozen in 1 mM aliquots. For the assay, substrate and enzymes are diluted in HCBC buffer to the desired concentrations. Compounds are added to the 96 well plate containing enzyme and the reaction is started by the addition of substrate. The reaction is read (excitation 340 nm, emission 444 nm) for 10 min. and the increase in fluorescence over time is plotted as a linear line. For either the thiopeptide or fluorescent peptide test procedures, the slope of the line is calculated and represents the reaction rate. The linearity of the reaction rate is confirmed (r 2 0.85). The mean (xsem) of the control rate is calculated and compared for statistical significance (p0.05) with drug-treated rates using Dunnetts multiple comparison test. Dose-response relationships can be generated using multiple doses of drug and IC 50 values with 95% CI are estimated using linear regression. In vivo MMP Inhibition Test Procedure A 2 cm piece of dialysis tubing (molecular weight cut-off 12-14,000, 10 mm flat width) containing matrix metalloproteinase enzyme (stromelysin, collagenase or gelatinase in 0.5 mL of buffer) is implanted either ip or sc (in the back) of a rat (Sprague-Dawley, 150-200 g) or mouse (CD-1, 25-50 g) under anesthesia. Drugs are administered PO, IP, SC or IV through a canula in the jugular vein. Drugs are administered in a dose volume of 0.1 to 0.25 mL/animal. Contents of the dialysis tubing is collected and enzyme activity assayed. Enzyme reaction rates for each dialysis tube are calculated. Tubes from at least 3 different animals are used to calculate the meansem. Statistical significance (p0.05) of vehicle-treated animals versus drug-treated animals is determined by analysis of variance. ( Agents and Actions 21: 331, 1987). Test Procedure for Measuring TACE Inhibition Using 96-well black microtiter plates, each well receives a solution composed of 10 L TACE (final concentration 1 g/mL), 70 L Tris buffer, pH 7.4 containing 10% glycerol (final concentration 10 mM), and 10 L of test compound solution in DMSO (final concentration 1 M, DMSO concentration 1%) and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. The reaction is initiated by addition of a fluorescent peptidyl substrate (final concentration 100 M) to each well and then shaking on a shaker for 5 sec. The reaction is read (excitation 340 nm, emission 420 nm) for 10 min. and the increase in fluorescence over time is plotted as a linear line. The slope of the line is calculated and represents the reaction rate. The linearity of the reaction rate is confirmed (r 2 0.85). The mean (xsem) of the control rate is calculated and compared for statistical significance (p0.05) with drug-treated rates using Dunnetts multiple comparison test. Dose-response relationships can be generate using multiple doses of drug and IC 50 values with 95% CI are estimated using linear regression.

Sterile solutions can also be administered intravenously. Oral administration may be either liquid or solid composition form. The compounds of this invention may be administered rectally in the form of a conventional suppository. For administration by intranasal or intrabronchial inhalation or insufflation, the compounds of this invention may be formulated into an aqueous or partially aqueous solution, which can then be utilized in the form of an aerosol. The compounds of this invention may also be administered transdermally through the use of a transdermal patch containing the active compound and a carrier that is inert to the active compound, is non-toxic to the skin, and allows delivery of the agent for systemic absorption into the blood stream via the skin. The carrier may take any number of forms such as creams and ointments, pastes, gels, and occlusive devices. The creams and ointments may be viscous liquid or semi-solid emulsions of either the oil in water or water in oil type. Pastes comprised of absorptive powders dispersed in petroleum or hydrophilic petroleum containing the active ingredient may also be suitable. A variety of occlusive devices may be used to release the active ingredient into the blood stream such as a semipermeable membrane covering a reservoir containing the active ingredient with or without a carrier, or a matrix containing the active ingredient. Other occlusive devices are known in the literature. The dosage to be used in the treatment of a specific patient suffering a MMP or TACE dependent condition must be subjectively determined by the attending physician. The variables involved include the severity of the dysfunction, and the size, age, and response pattern of the patient. Treatment will generally be initiated with small dosages less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter the dosage is increased until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. Precise dosages for oral, parenteral, nasal, or intrabronchial administration will be determined by the administering physician based on experience with the individual subject treated and standard medical principles. Projected oral daily dosages are 2-500 mg/kg, preferred oral daily dosages are 2-50 mg/kg, and more preferred oral daily dosages are 5-25 mg/kg. Preferably the pharmaceutical composition is in unit dosage form, e.g., as tablets or capsules. In such form, the composition is sub-divided in unit dose containing appropriate quantities of the active ingredient; the unit dosage form can be packaged compositions, for example packed powders, vials, ampoules, prefilled syringes or sachets containing liquids. The unit dosage form can be, for example, a capsule or tablet itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any such compositions in package form. What is claimed: 1.

The synthesis of these compounds and their use as alpha 1a adrenergic receptor antagonists is also described. One application of these compounds is in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. These compounds are selective in their ability to relax smooth muscle tissue enriched in the alpha 1a receptor subtype without at the same time inducing hypotension. One such tissue is found surrounding the urethral lining. Therefore, one utility of the instant compounds is to provide acute relief to males suffering from benign prostatic hyperplasia, by permitting less hindered urine flow. Another utility of the instant compounds is provided by combination with a human 5-alpha reductase inhibitory compound, such that both acute and chronic relief from the effects of benign prostatic

Belg. 87 (1978) 229-238 or Davy reagent 2,4-bis(methylthio)-1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane; Sulfur Lett. 1983, 1, 167. This reaction is expediently carried out in an inert organic solvent such as an aliphatic or cyclic ether (for example, dimethoxyethane) or an aromatic hydrocarbon which may be halogenated (for example, benzene, toluene or chlorobenzene) and at an elevated temperature, especially at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. A compound of formula I in which one of X and Y signifies O and the other signifies (H,OH), is prepared by reducing a compound of formula I in which X and Y both signify O with a complex metal hydride. The reduction can be carried out in a known manner including the protection of substituents on the indole ring prior to reduction and deprotection after reduction according to known methods. An alkali metal aluminum hydride such as lithium aluminum hydride is preferably used as the complex metal hydride, although other hydrides such as diisobutylaluminum hydride and sodium dihydro-bis(2-methoxy-ethoxy)aluminate can also be used. Suitable inert organic solvents in which this reduction can be carried out include aliphatic and cyclic ethers such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran (THF) and hydrocarbons such as hexane, benzene and toluene. Conveniently, this reduction is carried out at about room temperature. A compound of formula I in which one of X and Y signifies O and the other signifies (H,H), can be prepared by catalytically hydrogenating a compound of formula I in which one of X and Y signifies O and the other signifies (H,OH). Conventional procedures can be used in carrying out the catalytic hydrogenation including the protection and deprotection of substituents on the indole ring according to known procedures. Thus, the catalytic hydrogenation can be carried out in the presence of a noble metal catalyst such as a palladium or platinum catalyst, for example, palladium/carbon (Pd/C), and an inert organic solvent such as an alkanol (for example, methanol or ethanol). This catalytic hydrogenation is expediently carried out at about room temperature and under atmospheric pressure. If desired, an acidic compound of formula I can be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt with a base or a basic compound of formula I can be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt with an acid. The conversion of an acidic compound of formula I into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can be carried out by treatment with a suitable base in a known manner. Suitable salts are those derived not only from inorganic bases, for example, sodium, potassium or calcium salts, but also from organic bases such as ethylenediamine, monoethanolamine or diethanolamine. The conversion of a basic compound of formula I into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can be carried out by treatment with a suitable acid in a known manner. Suitable salts are those derived not only from inorganic acids, for example, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates or sulphates, but also from organic acids, for example, acetates, citrates, fumarates, tartrates, maleates, methanesulphonates or p-toluenesulphonates. The pyrroles of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts inhibit cellular processes, for example cell proliferation, and can be used in the treatment or control of inflammatory disorders such as arthritis, immune diseases, in conjunction with organ transplants and in oncology. The epithelial breast carcinoma cell line (MDAMB-435) was purchased from ATCC (American Type Cell Culture Collection) and was grown in culture in medium as recommended by ATCC. For analysis of the effect of various compounds on growth of these cells, the cells were plated at a concentration of 1500 cells/well in a 96 well tissue culture plate (test plate). The day after the cells were plated, the compounds to be analyzed were dissolved in 100% DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) to yield at 10 mM stock solution. Each compound was diluted in H 2 O to 1 mM and was added to triplicate wells in the first row of a 96 well master plate which contains medium to yield a final concentration of 40 M. The compounds were then serially diluted in medium in the master plate. The diluted compound(s) were then transferred to test plates containing cells. A row of vehicle control cells received DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO in each well was 0.1%. 5 days post drug addition, the plate was analyzed as follows: MTT (3-(4-5 methyl thiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; thiazolyl blue) was added to each well to yield a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The plate was then incubated at 37 C. for 2-3 hours. The MTT containing medium was then removed and 50 l of 100% ethanol was added to each well to dissolve the formazan. The absorbences were then read using an automated plate reader (Bio-tek microplate reader). IC 50 s were calculated using the Reed and Munsch equation, see Am. J. Hygiene Vol. 27 pgs. 493-497, 1938.

They can also be administered rectally, for example, in the form of suppositories or parenterally, for example, in the form of injection solutions. For the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations these compounds can be formulated with therapeutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers. Lactose, maize starch or derivatives thereof, talc, steric acid or its salts can be used as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatin capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatin capsules are vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid or liquid polyols. Depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, generally required in the case of soft gelatin capsules. Suitable carriers for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are, water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar and glucose. Suitable carriers for injection solutions are water, alcohols, polyols, glycerine and vegetable oils. Suitable carriers for suppositories are natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid polyols. The pharmaceutical preparations can also contain preserving agents, solubilizing agents, stabilizing agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, sweetening agents, coloring agents, flavoring agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, coating agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances. As mentioned above, the pyrroles of formula I and their aforementioned salts can be used in the treatment or control of oncological, inflammatory, immunological, bronchopulmonary and cardiovascular disorders. The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, or course, be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral or parenteral administration to adult humans, a daily dosage of about 5mg to 5000 mg should be appropriate, although the upper limit may be exceeded when this is found to be expedient. The daily dosage can be administered as a single dose or in divided doses, or for parenteral administration, it may be given as continuous infusion.

The compounds are useful for treating uPA- or uPAR-mediated disorders, e.g., tumor metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, restenosis, chronic inflammation, or corneal angiogenesis. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to compounds that inhibit the interaction of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) with urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and methods for using such compounds to treat uPA or uPAR mediated disorders, e.g., cancer. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Urokinase-tpe plasminogen activator (uPA) is a multidomain serine protease, having a catalytic B chain (amino acids 144-411), and an amino-terminal fragment (ATF, aa 1-143) consisting of a growth factor-like domain (4-43) and a kringle (aa 47-135). The uPA kringle appears to bind heparin, but not fibrin, lysine, or aminohexanoic acid. The growth factor-like domain bears some similarity to the structure of epidermal growth factor (EGF), and is thus also referred to as an EGF-like domain. The single chain pro-uPA is activated by plasmin or other proteases, cleaving the chain into the two-chain active form, which is linked together by a disulfide bond. uPA binds to its specific cell surface receptor (uPAR). The binding interaction is apparently mediated by the EGF-like domain (S. A. Rabbani et al., J Biol Chem (1992) 267:14151-56). Cleavage of pro-uPA into active uPA is accelerated when pro-uPA and plasminogen are receptor-bound. Thus, plasmin activates pro-uPA, which in turn activates more plasmin by cleaving plasminogen. This positive feedback cycle is apparently limited to the receptor-based proteolysis on the cell surface, since a large excess of protease inhibitors is found in plasma, including 2 antiplasmin, and PAI-1. Plasmin can activate or degrade extracellular proteins such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, and zymogens, particularly of the matrix metalloproteinases. Plasminogen activators thus can regulate extracellular proteolysis, fibrin clot lysis, tissue remodeling, developmental cell migration, inflammation, and metastasis. Accordingly, there is great interest in developing uPA inhibitors and uPA receptor antagonists. E. Appella et al., J Biol Chem (1987) 262:4437-40, determined that receptor binding activity is localized in the EGF-like domain, and that residues 12-32 appear to be critical for binding. The critical domain alone (uPA, 12-32 ) bound uPAR with an affinity of 40 nM (about 100 fold less than intact ATF). Recent studies have shown that the invasiveness of human tumor cell lines in vitro correlates with surface bound urokinase, and that urokinase production itself is an independent prognostic indicator in human breast cancer (W. Schlechte et al., Cancer Comm ( 1990) 2:173-79; H. Kobayashi et al., Br J Cancer ( 1993) 67:537-44; J. A. Foekens et al., Cancer Res (1992) 52:6101-05). It has also been shown in both breast and colon cancer that urokinase is often made by stromal cells (fibroblasts and macrophages), whereas the urokinase receptor is found on tumor cells (C. Pyke et al., Cancer Res (1993) 53:1911-15; C. Pyke et al., Am J Path (1991) 138:1059-67). uPAR has independently been identified as a monocyte activation antigen, Mo3, whose expression is induced in these inflammatory cells upon activation (H. Y. Min et al., J Immunol (1992) 148:3636-42), as well as an activation antigen on human T lymphocytes (A. Nykjaer et al., J Immunol (1994) 152:505-16). Urokinase plasminogen activator knockout mice (in which the uPA gene is inactivated or deleted throughout the body) have been developed, and their macrophages are deficient in extracellular matrix degradation in vitro (P. Carmeliet et al., Fibrinolysis (1993) 7 Suppl. 1:27-28). In addition, these mice show greatly reduced smooth muscle cell migration/proliferation after arterial wounding, suggesting a possible role for uPA/uPAR in post-angioplasty restenosis. The induction of urokinase and its receptor by agents known to be angiogenic in vivo, such as bFGF, vEGF, and TNF, suggests a role for cell surface urokinase in angiogenesis (P. Mignatti et al., J Cell Biol (1991) 113:1193-202; L. E. Odekon et al., J Cell Physiol (1992) 150:258-63; M. J. Niedbala et al., Blood (1992) 79:678-87). Although many factors are likely to be angiogenic in pathological conditions, degradation of extracellular matrix by capillary endothelial cells and release of matrix-bound pro-angiogenic factors by cell surface plasmin is likely a common step in these processes (D. Weinstat-Saslo et al., FASEB J (1994) 8:401-07). This is further supported by the observation that several known anti-angiogenic substances reduce uPA expression (S. Tankano et al., Cancer Res (1994) 54:2654-60). In vivo studies have shown that prevention of urokinase-receptor binding, by urokinase antibodies or competition with inactive urokinase mutants, dramatically reduces or eliminates the metastatic potential of human prostate tumor cells in nude mice (C. W. Crowley et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (1993) 90:5021-25; L. Ossowski et al., Cell (1983) 35:611-19; L. Ossowski, J Cell Biol (1988) 107:2437-45). It has recently been shown in both in vitro and syngeneic in vivo models that the protein uPAR antagonists are anti-angiogenic (Min et al., Cancer Res (1996) 56:2428). Although a primary role of uPAR is in the focusing of uPA dependent plasmninogen activation to the cell surface, it also has other functions. For instance, uPAR is involved in cell adhesion, functioning as a uPA dependent vitronectin receptor (Wei et al., J Biol Chem (1994) 269:32380-88). More recently, it has been shown that uPAR interacts with integrins and is likely involved in cell shape changes and cell migration (Kindzelskii et al., J Immunol (1996) 156:297). Two small molecules have been described which inhibit the uPA:uPAR interaction (suramin: N. Behrendt et al., J Biol Chem (1993) 68:5985-89; and 8-anilinonaphthalene sulfonic acid: M. Ploug et al., Biochemistry (1994) 33:8991-97). Other compounds for inhibiting the uPA:uPAR interaction are described in International Publication No. WO 96/40747, published Dec. 19, 1996. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have invented novel compounds having a high affinity for uPAR, thereby inhibiting the uPA:uPAR interaction, making them useful for treating disorders or diseases mediated by uPA and/or uPAR.

As used herein, the depiction of a bond on the right side of one of the abbreviations for the foregoing amino acids represents a bond to the carboxyl-terminal carbonyl atom of the amino acid and a bond on the left side of one of the abbreviations for the foregoing amino acids represents a bond to the nitrogen atom of the amino-terminal portion of the amino acid. For example, Fmoc refers to 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl. The term biolablile ester means a pharmaceutically acceptable, biologically degradable ester derivative of a compound of formula (I) or (II), that is a prodrug which, upon administration to a animal or human being, is converted in the body to a compound of formula (I) or (II). The term uPA -or uPARmediated disorder refers to a disease state or malady which is caused or exacerbated by a biological activity of uPA or uPAR. The primary biological activity exhibited is plasminogen activation. Disorders mediated by plasminogen activation include, without limitation, inappropriate angiogenesis (e.g., diabetic retinopathy, corneal angiogenesis, Kaposis sarcoma, and the like), metastasis and invasion by tumor cells, and chronic inflammation (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, and the like). Fucosylated ATF is also mnitogenic for some tumor cells (e.g., SaOS-2 osterosarcoma cells), which sometimes self-activate in an autocrine mechanism. Accordingly, the uPAR antagonist of the invention is effective in inhibiting the proliferation of uPAactivated tumor cells. The term effective amount refers to an amount of uPAR antagonist compound sufficient to exhibit a detectable therapeutic effect. The therapeutic effect may include, for example, without limitation, inhibiting the growth of undesired tissue or malignant cells, inhibiting inappropriate angiogenesis, limiting tissue damage caused by chronic inflammation, and the like. The precise effective amount for a subject will depend upon the subjects size and health, the nature and severity of the condition to be treated, and the like. The effective amount for a given situation can be determined by routine experimentation based on the information provided herein. The following abbreviations are used for the solvents and reagents discussed herein: ethanol (EtOH); methanol (MeOH); acetic acid (AcOH); ethyl acetate (EtOAc); 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU); 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt); bromo-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBroP); N,N-dimethylformarmide (DMF); trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI); and diisopropylamine (DIPEA). In addition, Ph represents a phenyl group; tBu represents a C(CH 3 ) 3 group; and OtBu represents an OC(CH 3 ) 3 group. The compounds of the invention have asymmetric carbon atoms, and therefore, al. isomers, including enantiomers and diastereomers are within the scope of this invention. The invention includes d and l isomers in both pure form and in admixture, including racemic mixtures. Isomers can be prepared using conventional techniques, either by reacting chiral starting materials, or by separating isomers of compounds of formula (I) or (II). Certain compounds of the present invention will be acidic in nature (e.g., those which have a carboxyl or phenolic hydroxyl group). These compounds form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with inorganic and organic bases. The salt may be prepared by treating a solution of the compound with the appropriate base. Non-limitative examples of such salts are sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, gold and silver salts, and salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable amines such as ammonia, alkyl amines, hydroxyalkylamines, N-methylglucamine and the like. It may be desirable when providing the compounds of the invention for oral administration to use the compounds of formula (I) or (II) in the form of a biolabile ester. The suitability of any particular ester-forming group can be assessed by conventional in vivo animal or in vitro enzyme hydrolysis studies. Thus, desirably, for optimum effect, the ester should only be hydrolysed after absorption is complete. Accordingly, the ester should be resistant to premature hydrolysis by digestive enzymes before absorption, but should be productively hydrolysed by, for example, gutwall, plasma or liver enzymes. In this way, the active acid is released into the bloodstream following oral absorption of the prodrug. Suitable biolabile esters may include alkyl, alkanoyloxyalkyl, cycloalkanoyloxyalkyl, aroyloxyalkyl and alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl esters, including cycloalkyl and aryl substituted derivatives thereof, aryl esters and cycloalkyl esters, wherein said alkyl, alkanoyl or alkoxy groups may contain from 1 to 8 carbon atoms and be branched-chain or straight-chain, said cycloalkyl groups may contain from 3-7 carbon atoms and said cycloalkanoyl groups from 4-8 carbon atoms wherein both are optionally benzo-fused, and said aryl and aroyl groups include substituted phenyl, naphthyl or indanyl ring systems. Preferably, the biolabile esters of the invention are C 1 -C 4 alkyl esters. More preferably, they are methyl, ethyl and t-butyl esters. Biolabile esters may be obtained from the acids of formula (I) or (II) by standard reactions well known to persons skilled in the art. For example, aryl and alkyl esters can be synthesized via activation of a carboxylic acid group of (I) in a variety of ways, such as by forming the acyl chloride, followed by reaction with the required phenol or alcohol. Alternatively, alkyl esters are obtainable by alkylation of a suitable alkali, or alkaline earth, metal carboxylate salt of a compound of formula (I) or (II). The compounds of formula (I) may be prepared according to the following reaction scheme (Scheme I): In Scheme I, which depicts a solid phase preparation, compound 3, wherein n is 0 or 1, is reacted with compound 4 and a coupling agent, e.g., HBTU/HOBt or PyBroP to form the amide compound 5. This reaction may be carried out in a suitable organic solvent, e.g., CH 2 Cl 2 or DMF at temperatures of 0 to 80 C., with ambient temperature preferred. Resin 4 is a material having a ligand portion, wherein R 2 is as previously defined for formula (I) above, bound to a resin, preferably a cross-linked polystyrene or a polyethylene glycol/polystyrene copolymer, through a cleavable linker, L, preferably an acid labile linker such as those used in SASRIN resin or in Wang resin. Other resins which may be used include, e.g., chlorotrityl resin and Rink Amide MBHA resin (where R 1 is carbamoyl). The aminoacid portion of 4 is attached to the linker by methods well known in the art, depending on the specific linker used. Generally, the amino group is protected in Fmoc form. The Fmoc-group of amide compound 5 is then removed by conventional means, e.g., by treating with piperdine in DMF at 0 to 80 C., followed by acylation with Fmoc-NHCHR 5 COOH wherein R 5 is as previously defined for formula (I) above, to produce amide compound 6. The acylation is carried out employing the coupling reagents and reaction conditions described above. The FmocNHCHR 5 COOH compounds used in the acylation are either commercially available or preparable by known methods. The Fmoc-group of amide compound 6 is removed, followed by acylation with R 4 COOH, wherein R 4 is as previously defined for formula (I) above, to produce compound 7, using the same Fmoc-removal and acylation methods used to make compound 6. Alternatively, equivalent reagents R 4 COCl and R 4 CO 2 O may be employed instead of R 4 COOH, with the reaction conducted in CH 2 Cl 2 or DMF at 0 to 80 C., in the presence of a tertiary amine, e.g., DIPEA. Compound 8 is formed by cleavage from the linker and the resin portion of compound 7 by conventional means, e.g., by treating with dilute TFA in CH 2 Cl 2 at ambient temperature for 10 to 60 minutes. When it is desired to make compounds of formula (I) wherein Q is R 3 C(O), the Fmoc-group of amide compound 5 can be removed, followed by acylation with R 3 COOH under the same conditions described above, and the resulting compound may be cleaved from the resin under the same conditions described above to produce the desired compound. Scheme II depicts preparation of compounds wherein R is NH2 or R 1 and R 2 are H, alkyl, or aralkyl. In1 this scheme, attachment of 3 to the resin and linker provides resin 9. Subsequent steps as in Scheme I provide 11. When Rink amide linker is employed, cleavage of 11, typically with dilute TFA, affords amide 12. When a non-amide linker is present in 11, cleavage from the resin furnishes acid 13. Acid 13 may be converted to amide 12 by treatment with ammonia in the presence of an activating agent such as ethyl chloroformate. Alternatively, 13 may he converted to substituted amides 14 by treatment with a primary or secondary amine and a coupling agent such as EDCI. Starting compound 3 may be prepared according to several different methods, which are shown below (as reaction schemes for preparation of starting compounds 3a, 3b, and 3c ). For the preparation of starting compound 3a, nitration of compound 20 with fuming nitric acid at 0 C. produces compound 21, which upon catalytic hydrogenation with PtO 2 in aqueous methanolic NaOH yields compound 22. The Fmoc group is introduced typically with Fmoc-chloride or Fmoc-hydroxysuccinimide ester in basic semi-aqueous medium, preferably in aqueous dioxane at 0 to 25 C. Where desired, a transient silyl ester may be employed for this step. In a second method, shown below, Pd-mediated coupling between 23 and 24 yields biphenyl ester 25. Preferably, this reaction is carried out with a Pd(P(Ph) 3 ) 4 catalyst in a toluene/aqueous Na 2 CO 3 system at reflux. Saponification of compound 25, preferably with, alkali in aqueous methanol at 0 to 50 C., and reduction, preferably with Pd/C in aqueous. alkali, yield amino-acid 26, which may be converted as above to yield compound 3b. When n1, compound 3c may be prepared by the following method, shown below. Compounds 27 and 28 are coupled in a Pd-mediated reaction as above to yield compound 29. Compound 29 is reacted with N-bromosuccinimide in CCl 4 at reflux to yield bromide 30, which is converted to ester 31 by reaction with NaN 3 in DMF at ambient temperature, followed by hydrogenation with Pd/C in ethanol. Conversion of the ester 31 to Fmoc-acid 3c is cared out as described above. As an alternative to Scheme I, compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by a solution synthesis as shown in Scheme III, below: In Scheme III, compound 3, wherein n is 0 or 1 is reacted with compound 32 (wherein R 2 is as previously defined above, and R 7 is a removable protective group, e.g., t-butyl) and a coupling agent as described in Scheme I to form amide compound 33. Amide compound 33 is subjected to the same Fmoc removal/acylation steps as described in Scheme I above to produce compound 35. The protective group R 7 is then removed by conventional means to yield the desired compound 36. For example, t-butyl may be removed by TFA or by HCl/dioxane. The compounds of the invention having formula (II) can be made according to Schemes I, II and III above by using the following compounds in place of compound 3 in Schemes I, II and III: wherein n is 0 or 1. These starting compounds are known materials. Those skilled in the art will recognize that reactive groups in the foregoing reaction schemes (e.g., carboxyl, amino, hydroxy) may be protected if desired or necessary with conventional protecting groups that can be subsequently removed by standard procedures. See, e.g., McOmie, Protecting groups In Organic Chemistry, Plenum Press, New York, 1973, and Greene and Wuts, Protecting Groups In Organic Synthesis, 2nd Ed., John Wiley Sons, New York 1991. For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. The powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 70 percent active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are known in the art, e.g. magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed homogeneously therein as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby solidify. Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection. Liquid form preparations may also include solutions for intranasal administration. Opthalmic preparations may be formulated using commercially available vehicles such as Sorbi-care (Allergan) or Neodecadron (Merck, Sharp Dohme). Aerosol preparations suitable for inhalation may include solutions and solids in powder form, which may be in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as an inert compressed gas. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. The compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal compositions can take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose. Preferably, the pharmaceutical preparation is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose. The quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from 0.01 mg to 1000 mg, more preferably from 0.1 mg to 200 mg, most preferably from 5 mg to 100 mg, according to the particular application. The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. The amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of the invention will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the symptoms being treated. A typical recommended dosage regimen is oral administration of from 0.02 mg to 4,000 mg/day, preferably 0.2 mg to 800 mg/day, most preferably 10 mg to 400 mg/day in two to four divided doses to block tumor growth. The following examples illustrate the foregoing invention, although such examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. Alternative mechanistic pathways and analagous structures within the scope of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides amine functional cellulose ester compounds and compositions containing such amine functional cellulose ester compounds. The invention also provides a method of making an amine functional cellulose ester compound, a method of dispersing a pigment, and a method of obtaining an improved appearance in a cured pigmented coating. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Coatings applied to surfaces typically serve decorative and/or protective functions. This is particularly so for automotive finishes, which must provide an esthetically appealing appearance while simultaneously meeting and maintaining rigorous performance and durability requirements. As used herein, automotive coating or finish encompasses both original equipment (OEM) coatings and refinish coatings, but especially to refinish coatings, the later term referring to coatings which are applied after the car has left the manufacturer, usually for repair purposes. It will be appreciated that refinish coatings often have different application and performance parameters. Pigments are used in coatings to provide decorative and/or protective functions. As used herein, pigment refers to a fine, insoluble white, black, or colored material, typically suspended in a vehicle for use in a paint or ink. The term pigment may also include effect pigments such as micas, metallic pigments such as aluminum, opalescent pigments, and the like. Dry pigments comprise a mixture of primary particles, aggregates, and agglomerates that must be wetted and de-aggregated before dispersion forces can take full effect and enable the production of a stable, pigmentary dispersion in the medium of choice. Aggregates, or primary pigment particles joined face-to-face, must be reduced to their fundamental primary particle. An ideal dispersion consists of a homogeneous suspension of primary particles. See Organic Pigments, Federation Series on Coatings Technology, 2 nd Edition, Lewis, P. October 1988, Revised March 1995, pgs. 39-41, hereby incorporated by reference. Although pigments are acknowledged as a required component in many coatings, their presence may be a possible contributing factor to a variety of problems in liquid coatings and/or dry paint films. Examples of coatings/paint film defects thought to be attributable to pigments include: undesirable gloss due to aggregates, blooming, pigment fading, pigment flocculation and/or settlement, separation of pigment mixtures, pigment shock in millbases, instability in pigment suspensions, brittleness, moisture susceptibility, fungal growth susceptibility, and/or thermal instability. See Physical-Chemical Aspects of Pigment Applications, Surface Coating Reviews, Guthrie, James T., and Lin, Long, Oil Colour Chemists Association, 1994, Sections 4.3.1-4.3.2, hereby incorporated by reference. It has been recognized that the level of dispersion in a particular pigment containing coating composition affects the application properties of the wet composition as well as the optical properties of the cured film. Improvements in dispersion have been shown to result in improvements in gloss, color strength, brightness, and gloss retention. Dispersionthe neglected parameter. JOCCA, W. Carr, 65, 373 (1982). The prior art has long sought improved pigment dispersions for use in coating compositions, particularly with respect to pigments that are difficult to disperse such as carbon black and transparent oxides. The use of cellulose esters in organic solvent borne coatings has been known to impart desired properties such as improved pigment dispersions, improved metallic flake orientation, improved solvent release, and higher gloss coatings. They are also known to function as rheology control agents in solvent borne coating formulations. U.S. Pat. No. 3,959,193 discloses a combination of an aryl sulfonamide-formaldehyde resin and film forming material, such as cellulose acetate butyrate, which may further include a surfactant, such as a non-ionic surfactant including, for example, an alkylarylpolyether, as a universal dispersant for resin additives, such as pigment materials. The composition generally includes 40 to 90 weight percent of any of various types of additives, including pigments. U.S. Pat. No. 5,521,304 provides water soluble or water dispersible cellulose acetoacetate esters prepared by contacting a cellulose material with diketene, an alkyl acetoacetate, 2,2,6-trimethyl-4H-1,3-dioxin-4-one or a mixture thereof and a carboxylic anhydride in a solvent system comprising lithium chloride plus a carboxamide. Compositions containing the cellulose acetoacetate esters are disclosed to be useful for coating applications. Amine-containing cellulose esters, eg, the acetate N,N-diethylaminoacetate and propionate morpholinobutyrate have been suggested for use in controlled-release, rumen-protected feed supplements for ruminants. Such esters are prepared by the addition of the appropriate amine to the cellulose acylate crotonate ester or by replacement of the chlorine on cellulose acylate chloroacetate esters with amines. However, such amine containing cellulosic materials are not taught to be useful in coating compositions nor do they suggest the particular compositions of the invention. They lack an enamine structure, hydroxyl groups and the use of mixed acetate/butyrate esters. Eastman Chemical Products, Incs Publication No. X-263A, December, 1986, pgs. 2-3, discusses the possible reactions of acetoacetylated polymers. The carbonyl group of the acetoacetylated polymers is said to chelate with metals such as zinc, tin, lead, aluminum, copper and zirconium. Polyvalent cations are taught to useful for crosslinking purposes. In addition, the preparation of enamines by the reaction of amines with carbonyl groups is taught. Diamines are shown to crosslink acetoacetylated polymers. Despite these prior art attempts, there still exists a need for improved pigment dispersion, especially with respect to the dispersion of certain pigments intended for use in topcoat finishes. Topcoat finishes require a high quality of color depth and richness, especially with pigments such as carbon black and the like. Such high quality of color depth and richness, known as jetness with respect to carbon black, has been difficult to obtain in an efficient and cost effective manner with prior art dispersants and dispersion processes. Jetness as used herein refers to a clean looking color with blue undertones. Accordingly, it is desirable to obtain an improved dispersion with respect to pigmented coating compositions. It is further desirable to obtain such improved dispersion with an agent that is economical and easily obtained. More particularly, it is desirable to obtain a dispersant for use with pigments, especially hard to disperse pigments such as carbon black, which would provide coatings having an improved appearance, especially as to color and/or jetness, when pigments dispersed with such a dispersant are incorporated into the coating. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has surprisingly been found that these and other objects are obtained with the use of the present invention which provides a composition comprising an amine functional cellulose ester resin, the amine functional cellulose ester resin comprising at least one repeat unit of the structure: wherein R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 are selected independently from the group consisting of hydrogen, R 4 CO, and wherein at least one of R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 is hydrogen, at least one of R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 is R 4 CO, and at least one of R 1 , R 2 , or R 3 groups have the structure preferably 0.5% to 10% by weight of the total weight of the amine functional cellulose ester being of R 1 , R 2 , or R 3 groups having the structure R 4 is selected from the group consisting of C 1 -C 20 alkyl groups, C 1 -C 20 phenyl groups, C 1 -C 20 napthyl groups, and C 1 -C 20 alkenyl groups, L is a divalent linking group and R 6 is selected from the group consisting of H and compounds having at least one secondary amine group, tertiary amine group and mixtures thereof. The invention further provides a method of making the amine functional cellulose ester of the invention wherein a cellulose acetoacetate ester resin is provided, the resin comprising one or more repeat units of the structure wherein R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 are selected independently from the group consisting of hydrogen, acetoacetyl, and R 4 CO, R 4 is selected from the group consisting of C 1 -C 20 alkyl groups, C 1 -C 20 phenyl groups, C 1 -C 20 napthyl groups, and C 1 -C 20 alkenyl groups, at least one of R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 is R 4 CO, at least 0.5 percent of the total weight of the cellulose ester resin is of R 1 , R 2 , or R 3 groups which are acetoacetyl and at least one or more of R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 is H. This cellulose ester resin is then reacted with an amine functional compound comprising at least one primary amine group to provide an amine functional cellulose ester resin. The invention also provides a method of dispersing a pigment in a resin, wherein one or more pigments are ground, i.e., are subject to a means for reducing and maintaining the average particle size of the pigment, in the presence of the amine functional cellulose ester resin of the invention. Finally, the invention discloses a method of providing a cured pigmented coating having an improved appearance. The method requires the application and curing of a coating composition comprising a least one pigment that has been dispersed in the presence of the amine functional cellulose ester resin of the invention. The resulting cured pigmented coating has an appearance with respect to color (jetness in the case of black pigments) which is improved relative to a similar coating which contains pigment which has not been dispersed in the presence of the amine functional cellulose ester resin of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The instant invention(s) requires the use of a particular amine functional cellulose ester resin. This amine functional cellulose ester resin is the reaction product of a cellulose ester comprising at least one acetoacetyl group and an amine functional compound comprising at least one primary amine. As used herein, the term acetoacetyl group refers to The terms acetoacetonate and acetoacylate are intended to be equivalent to and interchangeable with acetoacetyl. The acetoacetyl group may be obtained via the direct acetoacylation of raw cellulose as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,292,877, 5,420,267, 5,521,304, and 5,595,591 all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. These patents disclose water soluble or water dispersible cellulose acetoacetate esters prepared by contacting a cellulose material with diketene, an alkyl acetoacetate, 2,2,6-triemethyl-4H-1,3-dioxin-4-one or a mixture thereof and a carboxylic anhydride in a solvent system comprising lithium chloride plus a carboxamide. Alternatively, the required cellulose acetoacetate ester may be obtained via the acetoacylation of previously esterified cellulose material. Cellulose esters are known in the art and are commercially available from Eastman Kodak of Kingsport, Tenn. and Bayer of Pittsburg, Pa. Suitable cellulose esters for use in the instant invention are those resulting from the reaction of cellulose with organic acids, anhydrides, and acid chlorides. Methods for making cellulose esters are discussed in Cellulose Esters, Organic, Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, Vol. 3, pgs, 158-181. Suitable cellulose esters for use in the instant invention are those having the following structure: wherein R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 are selected independently from the group consisting of hydrogen and R 4 CO; R 4 is selected from the group consisting of C 1 -C 20 alkyl groups, C 1 -C 20 phenyl groups, C 1 -C 20 napthyl groups, and C 1 -C 20 alkenyl groups; and at least one of R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 is H. Preferably, the remaining R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 that are not H are different. Preferred for use as R 4 are the C 1 -C 20 alkyl groups, especially the C 1 -C 10 alkyl groups, and most preferably the C 1 -C 6 alkyl groups. Most preferred cellulose esters are mixed cellulose esters such as cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) and cellulose acetate propionate (CAP). Cellulose esters suitable for use in the instant invention may also be characterized by particular physical and/or performance parameters such as the number of acyl groups per repeating unit, acyl chain unit length, and the degree of polymerization or molecular weight (number average). In general, suitable performance and/or physical parameters are a viscosity of from 0.01 to 20 sec, (per ASTM D817 (Formula A) and D 1343) a % Acetyl of from 0.6 to 20, more preferably from 2 to 14, (per ASTM D817), a % butyryl of from 17 to 53, more preferably from 35 to 53, (per ASTM D817), a % hydroxyl of from 0.8 to 5.0, more preferably from 1.0 to 2.0, a T g of from 50 to 200 degrees C., more prefereably from 80 to 135 degrees C., and a number average molecular weight value of from 10,000 to 70,000, more preferably from 15,000 to 40,000, based on a polystyrene equivalent molecular weight determined using size exclusion chromatography. Suitable cellulose esters include those commercially available from Eastman Chemicals, i.e., CAB 551-0.01, CAB 531-1, CAB-381-0.5 and CAB-381-2. The necessary acetoacetate group may be placed on a suitable cellulose ester such as described above via reaction with a compound containing an acetoacetate group. Examples of such compounds are alkyl acetoacetates having alkyl groups with from 1 to 20 carbons, preferably 1 to 10 carbons and most preferably from 1 to 6 carbons. Examples of suitable alkylacetoacetates are tert-butyl acetoacetate, methyl acetoacetate, ethyl acetoacetate and the like. Preferred acetoacetate group-containing compounds are tert-butyl acetoacetate. The desired cellulose ester resin is modified with from 0.5% to 10% alkyl acetoacetate, based on the total weight of the cellulose ester resin. More preferably from 0.5 to 5.0%, and most preferably from 0.5 to 2.0% of alkyl acetoacetate is used, based on the total weight of the cellulose ester resin. It will thus be appreciated that some repeating units of the total cellulose ester resin may not comprise any R1 or R2 or R3 groups which have been modified with the acetoacetate group. However, from 0.5 to 10%, more preferably from 0.5 to 5% and most preferably from 0.5 to 2.0% of the total weight of the cellulose ester resin will have sites wherein a hydroxyl group has been replaced with an acetoacetate group. Methods of incorporating the acetoacetate group into the cellulose ester include transesterification as described below and direct reaction of a hydroxyl group with a diketene. A preferred method of incorporating the acetoacetate group into a suitable cellulose ester requires incorporation of a commercially available cellulose ester and a high boiling point, good cutting solvent such as ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate (EEP), PM acetate, EXXATE solvents and the like. Most preferably, ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate is used. After removal of water, an alkyl acetoacetate is added along with additional EEP. The resultant acetoacetylated cellulose ester is collected along with removal of the alkyl alcohol. The acetoacetate group-containing cellulose ester is reacted with at least one amine functional compound to provide the amine functional cellulose ester resin of the invention. Suitable amine functional compounds will comprise at least one primary amine group. More preferably, the amine functional compounds will comprise at least one or more additional amine groups selected from the group consisting of secondary amine groups and tertiary amine groups, and mixtures thereof. Amines containing both a primary amine group and a tertiary amine group, as well as those containing a primary amine group, a secondary amine group and a tertiary amine group are most preferred.

Preferred amine functional compounds are 1-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine and 4-(2-aminoethyl)morpholine. A most preferred amine functional compound is 1-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine. The amine functional compound will be used in the reaction with the acetoacetate functional cellulose ester in an amount such that all of the acetoacetate groups will be amine functionalized. At least 95% by weight of the acetoacetate groups will be modified with the amine functional group, preferably at least 98%, and most preferably 100%, based on the total weight of the acetoacetate groups present in the cellulose ester resin. Thus, from 0.5 to 10% by weight of amine functional compound should be used, based on the total weight of acetoacetylated cellulose ester. More preferably, from 0.5 to 5.0% by weight should be used and most preferably from 0.5 to 2.0% by weight, based on the total weight of acetoacetylated cellulose ester. Accordingly, the amine functional cellulose ester resin of the invention is characterized by a structure having at least one repeat unit: wherein R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 are selected independently from the group consisting of hydrogen, R 4 CO, and At least one of R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 is hydrogen. At least one of R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 is R 4 CO, and preferably at least two of R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 is R 4 CO. At least one repeat unit in the instant resin will have at least one of R 1 , R 2 , or R 3 groups being Most preferably, at least 0.5% by weight of the total weight of the amine functional cellulose ester will be of R 1 , R 2 , or R 3 groups having the structure: It will thus be appreciated that some individual repeating units of the total resin may not comprise any R 1 , R 2 , or R 3 groups having the structure However, the invention requires only that from 0.5 to 10% by weight of the total polymer, more preferably 0.5 to 5.0% and most preferably 0.5 to 2.0% be comprised of R 1 , R 2 , or R 3 groups having the structure based on the total weight of the polymer. In the above formula, R 4 is selected from the group consisting of C 1 -C 20 alkyl groups, C 1 -C 20 phenyl groups, C 1 -C 20 napthyl groups, and C 1 -C 20 alkenyl groups. Preferably R 4 is selected from the group consisting of C 1 -C 20 alkyl groups, and most preferably is selected from the group consisting of C 1 -C 6 alkyl groups. R 6 is selected from the group consisting of H and compounds having at least one amine group selected from the group consisting of secondary amine groups, tertiary amine groups and mixtures thereof. Preferably R 6 will be selected from the group of compounds having at least one amine group selected from the group consisting of secondary amine groups, tertiary amine groups and mixtures thereof. Most preferably, R 6 will be a secondary or tertiary amine group. L is a divalent linking group having from 1 to 20 carbons atoms and from 0 to 10 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen, and mixtures thereof. Illustrative examples of suitable L groups are aliphatic or cycloaliphatic linking groups of from 1 to 20 carbons, aromatic linking groups of from 1 to 10 carbons, and mixtures thereof. Preferred L groups include aliphatic or cycloaliphatic groups of from 2 to 10 carbons having from 0 to 5 heteroatoms. The amine functional cellulose esters of the invention may be used in coating compositions containing one or more pigments, pigment pastes, and mixtures thereof. Pigment pastes may be defined as compositions containing at least 0.2% by weight of pigment, based on the total weight of the composition. When used in pigment pastes, the amine functional cellulose esters of the invention will typically be used in an amount of from 2 to 15, preferably from 5 to 10, and most preferably from 7 to 8% by weight, based on the total weight of the pigment paste. The amine functional cellulose esters of the invention may be used in coating compositions containing one or more pigments, pigment pastes, and mixtures thereof. Typically, the pigment desired to be dispersed is subject to an action which decreases the average particle size of the pigment, in the presence of the amine functional cellulose ester of the invention. Such actions may be referred to as grinding or dispersion. Pigments are generally ground to a certain fineness of grind. Fineness of grind is often measured by the absence of seeds on a grind gauge, tint strength, or absence of pigment flocculation upon application. Encapsulation of the ground pigment particle is believed to prevent reagglomeration. After grinding or the like, additional resins, solvents and additives may be added to the pigment paste. Examples of coating compositions in which the instant cellulose esters may used include coating compositions include primers, basecoats, and/or clearcoats which are one component, two component or multicomponent systems and may include OEM coatings and refinish coatings. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that such coatings may used over variety of substrates such as metal, plastic, previously painted substrates, and mixtures thereof, and may be subjected to variety of curing schemes including ambient cure, elevated temperature cures, and/or radiation.

EXAMPLES Example I A 5-liter, 3-necked round-bottom flask was fitted with an agitator, thermocouple probe, inert gas inlet, reflux condenser, Dean-Stark distillation receiver and heating mantle. The flask was charged with a mixture of 950 g of Eastman Chemical Co.s cellulose acetobutyrate (CAB) 531.01 and 645 g. ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate (EEP). An additional 25 g of EEP was placed in the distillation receiver. The water content in the CAB was removed by heating the mixture slowly with stirring under an inert nitrogen atmosphere to a temperature of 158 C. About 5 g of water was collected in the distillation receiver and drained off. The temperature of the solution was then lowered to 120 C. with continued stirring, and a mixture of 8.95 g. tert-butyl acetoacetate (TBAAEastman Chemical Co.) and 30.0 g. EEP was added slowly from a dropping funnel over a period of 30 minutes. Reaction mixture temperature was then increased to about 150 C. and about 3 g of byproduct tert-butanol was collected in the distillation receiver. Some of the t-butanol crystallized in long needles. A mixture of 269 g. xylene and 288 g. butyl acetate was added to the acetoacetate-functional polymer and the temperature reduced to 60 C. with continued stirring. A solution of 7.2 g. aminoethylpiperazine dissolved in 13.8 g butyl acetate was added slowly from a dropping funnel, while maintaining stirring of the reaction mixture and a temperature of 60-67 C. After heating the reaction mixture for one hour at 60 C., 1822 g methyl isobutyl ketone was added with stirring. The flask was then cooled to 25 C. The product with mixed hydroxy and amino functionality was a viscous amber colored solution with a measured viscosity of 150 Stokes and a measured solids content of 23.25%. Example 2 A 5-liter flask fitted as in Example I was charged with 944.5 g of Eastman Chemicals CAB 551.01 and 404.8 g of ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate (EEP), with an additional 25 g of EEP in the distillation receiver. Water was removed by heating and stirring under nitrogen to a temperature of 158 C. and draining off about 9.3 ml water from the distillation receiver. After heating to 167 C. to refill the distillation receiver with EEP, the temperature was lowered to about 140 C. and a mixture of 18.9 tert-butyl acetoacetate and 5.0 g. EEP added over 30 minutes. About 8 ml tert-butanol distilled into the receiver. The temperature was raised to 150 C. and a total amount of about 12.0 g of a combination of liquid and crystallized tert-butanol was collected. A mixture of 405 g xylene and 390 g butyl acetate was added to the flask and the temperature reduced to 60 C. before dropping in 15.1 g of aminoethylpiperazine. The temperature was held at 60 C. for an additional three hours, then 1336 g of methyl isobutyl ketone was added before cooling. The product was an amber liquid (color: Gardner 6) with a measured solids level of 30.05% and Gardner/Holdt viscosity of 132.5 centistokes.

The resulting solution containing acetoacetate-functional polymer was held at 31 C., then to it was added 1.4 g of dimethylaminopropyl amine dissolved in 15.0 g of butyl acetate. The mixture was heated to 117 C. and cooled while 144.2 g methyl isobutyl ketone was added in steps. The product was a dark amber liquid with solids level of 29.4% and viscosity of 140 centistokes. Example 7 A charge of 950 g of Eastman Chemicals CAB 531.1 and 644 g EEP (with an additional 30 g EEP) in the distillation receiver) was heated to 160 C. About 2 g water was collected in the distillation receiver. The reaction mixture was cooled to about 140 C. then to it was added 30 g t-butylacetoacetate and 15 g cyclohexane. The temperature was raised to 160 C. over a two-hour period. About 2 g 1-butanol was collected in the distillation receiver. The solution was then diluted with a mixture of 410 g butyl acetate and 390 g xylene and cooled to 60 C. A solution of 14.8 g aminoethylmorpholine and 15.0 g butyl acetate was dropped in over about 15 minutes and the temperature maintained at 60-67 C. for an additional three hours before 1625 g methyl isobutyl ketone was added.

Technical Field of the Invention The invention relates to a process for the preparation of (5--(dialkylamino)alkylamino-8-hydroxyimidazo4,5,1-deacridin-6-ones of general formula (I), wherein R 1 and R 2 represent alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms which may be the same or different and n is 2 to 5. These compounds show anti-neoplastic activity, in particular against leukaemia, melanomas or colon adenocarcinomas, as more fully set forth in Z. Mazerska et al., Anti-Cancer Drug Design 11, 73-88 (1996). The invention further relates to certain new 1--(dialkylamino)alkylamino-4-substituted-7-hydroxyacridin-9(10H)-ones, useful as intermediates in the process of the invention and also having anti-neoplastic activity. 2. Description of the Related Art Methods of preparation of the imidazoacridinones of general formula I are known from PCT Application WO-A-92/15583 and W. Cholody et al. J. Med. Chem 35, 378-382 (1992), and depend on cyclisation of amines of general formula (II). The amines (II) can be prepared by a multi step process, as described in the above patent application and shown in Scheme 1: It was a problem that the 7-hydroxy-4-amino-1--(dialkylamino)alkylaminoacridin-9(10H)-one compounds of formula II are unstable. See particularly W. Cholody et al. J. Med. Chem. 35, 378-382 (1992), at page 379, right-hand column. This problem might be overcome by running the reduction and cyclisation as a single step in a one pot reaction, by heating the nitro compounds of formula III with Raney nickel and formic acid. This reaction was carried out in the context of synthesising some imidazo4,5,1-de1,4-diazepino5,6,7-mnacridines, see W. Cholody et al., J. Heterocyclic Chem. 29, 1749-1752 (1992). This procedure does not require isolation of the unstable amine (II). Unfortunately, however, another problem arose. The purification of the preferred compound 5-2-(diethylamino)ethylamino-8-hydroxyimidazo4,5,1-deacridin-6-one, of formula I, wherein R 1 and R 2 are ethyl and n is 2, free of nickel ions is difficult because both the compound and nickel ions are soluble in acidic solution, but precipitated by adding alkali. This is a serious problem, expected to arise to a greater or less degree with all the compounds of formula I, especially as they are intended for pharmaceutical use. When, to avoid contamination by nickel ions, the reduction-cyclisation mixture composed of Raney nickel and formic acid was replaced by formic acid and palladium, the product compounds of formula (I) decomposed slowly during the reaction. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that the last-mentioned problem can be solved if the reduction is carried out in formic acid at room temperature or slightly above, in the presence of palladium catalyst and either (a) a hydrogen-provider such as hydrogen gas or (b) formate ions, substantially all the palladium catalyst is removed and the substantially palladium-free solution is heated to effect cyclisation. Further, this method provided an unexpected, additional benefit. Namely, the order of the operations of deprotecting the hydroxy groups and reacting the 4-chloro compound with the amine could be reversed and the deprotection could then be carried out in the same one-step reaction as the reduction and cyclisation. By this means three reactions can be carried out in one step, thus reducing the overall number of steps from four to two. The reduction reaction produces an N-formyl compound as intermediate. This N-formyl compound is then cyclised. The overall Scheme is shown below as Scheme 2: Accordingly, the present invention provides a process of preparing a compound of formula (I): wherein R 1 and R 2 are alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and n is from 2 to 5, which comprises reacting a 1-chloro-7-(protected hydroxy)-4-nitroacridin-9(10H)-one of Formula (IV-P): wherein A is a hydroxy-protecting group removable by reduction, with an -(dialkylamino)alkylamine of formula NH 2 (CH 2 ) n NR 1 R 2 in which n, R 1 and R 2 are as defined above, to produce a 7-(protected hydroxy)-4-nitro-1--(dialkylamino)alkylaminoacridin-9(10H)-one of formula (III-P): in which A, n, R 1 and R 2 are as defined above, reducing the compound of formula (III-P) at a temperature of from 15 to 50 C. with a reducing agent stronger than formic acid, such as hydrogen gas or formate anions, in the presence of a palladium catalyst and formic acid, removing substantially all the residual palladium and heating the remaining reaction mixture, typically at a temperature above 50 C., to effect cyclisation to the corresponding compound of formula (I). The compound of formula (I), if produced as an addition salt, may be converted to the free base and vice versa. Any known procedures for these purposes may be used. The invention further includes the N-formyl compounds (II-For) of formula shown in Scheme 2 per se, their preparation by isolation from the above-described filtrate from which substantially all the palladium has been removed, and their conversion to the corresponding compound of formula I comprising heating to effect cyclisation. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The process of the invention requires as starting material a 4-nitro-1-chloro compound of formula (IV-P) in which the hydroxy group is protected. These compounds IV-P can be prepared by preliminary steps shown in Scheme 3 below: The hydroxy-protecting group, A, may be any which prevents the OH from reacting with the carboxylic acid function of the benzoic acid derivative in Scheme 3 and may be removed by reduction, preferably benzyl (PhCH 2 ). Other such usable protecting groups include allyl, 4-(dimethylaminocarbonyl)benzyl or arylbenzyl carbonate. An example of a preparation in accordance with Scheme 3 can be found in Example 2 of European Patent EP-B-0145226 (Warner-Lambert Co.), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Turning now to the process of the invention shown in Scheme 2, the amination step may be carried out in any of the ways described in PCT Application WO-A-92/15583 or in European Patent EP-B-0145226, the disclosures of which in relation thereto are herein incorporated by reference. Preferably amination is by heating at moderately elevated temperature, e.g. 40 to 80 C., in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide. The preferred classes of compounds of formula (I) are those in which n is 2 or 3; also those in which R 1 and R 2 are the same, especially both methyl or both ethyl, so the same preferences (separately or together) apply to the amine reactant. The reduction can be carried out by using hydrogen gas. While this reaction is best carried out at room temperature, say 15-30 C., the benefits of the invention are diminished, but not extinguished, at higher temperatures up to 50 C., especially up to 40 C. Alternatively the reduction can be carried out by using a salt of formic acid, for example ammonium formate, instead of hydrogen, and raising the temperature to between 30 and 50 C. In either case, formic acid, preferably at 80-98% w/v in water, is used. Preferably the formic acid is at 90-97% strength. The palladium catalyst may be present in any amount conventional in this reaction. It is removed from the reaction after reduction is judged to be complete, which is usually within the range 5 to 30 hours, typically 20 hours, at room temperature, depending on the amount of catalyst and stirring rate, and a correspondingly shorter time at slightly elevated temperature. Conveniently it is removed by filtration. The resultant reaction mixture, substantially free of palladium, is then heated to effect cyclisation, preferably to a temperature of above 50 C. and preferably from 80 C. up to reflux. No additional solvent is necessary, formic acid serving this purpose. The cyclisation reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a strong acid (a term which excludes formic acid, which is considered a weak acid), most preferably one which will form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt such as hydrochloric or methanesulphonic acid. Sulphuric acid is less preferred. Use of hydrochloric acid has been found to shorten the reaction time from 48 to 10 hours. The compound of formula (I), obtained as the acid addition salt in the preferred method or by acidifying the free base, may be purified by crystallisation. The preferred compound (n2, R 1 R 2 C 2 H 5 ) may be crystallised from water or ethanol-water. Conveniently it is dissolved in hot 50% v/v aqueous ethanol, additional ethanol is optionally added and the solution allowed to crystallise. The novel process avoids deprotection of 7-hydroxy group in a separate step, and thus avoids operation with the possibly mutagenic hydroxy intermediate. The new intermediate (III-P) can be prepared from chloro derivative (IV-P) with very good yields and is easy to purify. The process avoids operations involving free, very unstable amine (II), and does not involve isolation of the amine even as a salt. Further, it avoids the problem of contamination of the potential pharmaceutical product by metal ions derived from Raney nickel. Alternatively, the reaction mixture, substantially free of palladium, is treated to work up the N-formyl compound (II-For), at a temperature below 40 C. This compound can then be crystallised and cyclised by heating in a solvent, to give the corresponding compound I. The compounds II-For show an anti-neoplastic, especially anti-leukaemia, effect and are thus useful in their own right as well as intermediates in the preparation of compounds I. The present invention will now be described further by way of illustration only by reference to the following non-limiting Examples. Further embodiments of the invention will occur to those skilled in the art in the light of these. EXAMPLES Example 1 1. Preparation of 1-2-(diethylamino)ethylamino-7-benzyloxy-4-nitroacridin-9(10H)-one (III-P) A mixture of 7-benzyloxy-1-chloro-4-nitroacridin-9(10H)-one (IV-P) (9.52 g, 25 mmol), 2-diethylaminoethylamine (4.3 ml, 30 mmol) and triethylamine (3.5 ml, 25 mmol) in dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulphoxide (150 ml) was stirred and heated at 60 C. for 1 hour. Next water (500 ml) and a concentrated solution of sodium carbonate (40 ml) were added and the precipitate was filtered, washed with water and dried to give 10.8 g (94%) of crude product. Crystallisation from dimethylformamide (100 ml) gave analytically pure product, yield 10 g (87%). 2. Preparation of 5-2-(diethylamino)ethylamino-hydroxy-imidazo4,5,1-deacridin-6-one Dihydrochloride (I) A mixture of 1-2-(diethylamino)ethylamino-7-benzyloxy-4-nitroacridin-9(10H)-one (III-P) (9.2 g, 20 mmol) and 10% palladium on charcoal (1 g) in 96% formic acid (100 ml) was hydrogenated, by bubbling in hydrogen gas, at room temperature for 24 hours. Next the catalyst was filtered off, and the filtrate was heated at 90 C. for 48 hr. (Alternatively, concentrated hydrochloric acid (5 ml) was added and the reaction time reduced to 10-15 hr). The solvent was evaporated under vacuum, the residue treated with 150 ml of hot 50/50 solution of concentrated hydrochloric acid and methanol, cooled and filtered to give the crude product (7 g, 79%). The crude product was refluxed in 50% ethanol (30 ml) with charcoal (1.5 g) for 5 min. The hot solution was filtered, 95% ethanol (100 ml) was added and the solution was left for crystallisation for 20 hours. The product was filtered and washed with ethanol to give yellow crystals of the product (6.4 g, 72%). Example 2 1. Preparation of 5-2-(diethylamino)ethylamino-8-hydroxy-imidazo4,5,1-de-acridin-6-one Dihydrochloride (I) A mixture of 1-2-(diethylamino)ethylamino-7-benzyloxy-4-nitroacridin-9(10H)-one (III-P) (2.3 g, 5 mmol), ammonium formate (2.5 g) and 10% palladium on charcoal (0.25 g) in 96% formic acid (25 ml) was stirred at 40 C. until completion of the reaction as judged by TLC, typically 20 hours. Next the catalyst was filtered off, and the filtrate was heated at 90 C. for 48 hr. (Alternatively, concentrated hydrochloric acid (1 ml) was added and the reaction time reduced to 10-15 hours). The solvent was evaporated under vacuum, the residue treated with 150 ml of hot 50/50 solution of concentrated hydrochloric acid and methanol, cooled and filtered to give the crude product (71. g, 77%). The product can be purified as described above in Example 1. 2. Preparation of 1-2-(diethylamino)ethylamino-7-hydroxy-4-(N-formylamino)acridin-9(10H)-one (II-For) Part 1 of this Example was repeated up to filtering off the catalyst. Then the solvent was evaporated from the filtrate under vacuum at a temperature below 40 C. The residue was dissolved in methanol and product precipitated with diethyl ether. The purification procedure was repeated three times to give a yellow hygroscopic solid. The solid was dissolved in water and made alkaline with sodium bicarbonate, to give a yellow precipitate. The precipitate was crystallised from DMF-methanol to give the title compound, (540 mg. 27%). The product was analysed by C,H,N elemental analysis, 500 MHZ 1 H NMR, homoCOSY and 13 C NMR. The data confirm the proposed structure and demonstrate that, at least in DMSO solution, the compound exists as a 1:2 mixture of two isomers of different orientations of the N-formyl group. 3.

"abstract": "A new reagent for preparation of a caged compound in accordance with the present invention is a compound having, as a basic structure, an N-succinimidyl cinnamate structure expressed by the following formula 1: Another reagent for preparation of a caged compound in accordance with the present invention is a compound having, as a basic structure, a p-nitrophenyl cinnamate structure expressed by the following formula 3: BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to new reagents for preparation of caged compounds, and new caging methods using the same. 2. Related Background Art For investigating the mechanism of action of a substance in an organism, it is necessary to quantitatively measure the rise and fall of this substance within a biological system in a short period of time. Further, it is important to observe various changes following the substance introduced into the system. On the other hand, biological reactions are mostly very fast, and a plurality of reactions usually progress at the same time while complicatedly relating to each other. Therefore, when the above-mentioned substance is added from the outside, the process of its diffusing within the system rather becomes the rate-determining step, thereby often making it hard to clearly grasp the subsequent reaction to be determined in practice. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION For overcoming such a problem, various methods have been proposed as to a method of rapidly adding a target substance. As one of such methods, a method using a technique based on irradiation with light, i.e., so-called caged reagent, has been reported. In general, this method comprises the steps of introducing into a biological system a caged compound (which refers to a compound in which a so-called caging group is introduced or a compound labeled with a caging group) in which a specific protective group protects an active part of a physiologically active substance to be traced; verifying that this substance has sufficiently diffused to a point of application; and liberating the protective group (caging group) upon irradiation with light, so as to release the target substance, thereby making it possible to trace the reaction caused by the substance. This protective group is characterized in that it can attain deprotection (release of the protective group) upon irradiation with light alone, it can achieve deprotection very fast, and it allows the light irradiation to be narrowed to only a specific part as necessary. The present invention provides new reagents capable of preparing caged compounds having such a function with a new structure by a simple reaction. Also, the present invention provides methods of yielding caged compounds by introducing a caging group into a target physiologically active substance by using these new reagents. As a result of diligent studies, the inventor has succeeded in finding new reagents which can prepare caged compounds having such an excellent function by a simple reaction. Also, the inventor has succeeded in establishing methods of caging various compounds by using these new reagents, thereby accomplishing the present invention. Namely, a new reagent for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention is a compound having, as a basic structure, an N-succinimidyl aminocinnamate structure expressed by the following formula 1: where X and Y may be identical or different, each representing one kind selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, an alkyloxy group having a carbon number from I to 4, a benzo group, and an alkylamino group having a carbon number from 1 to 4; R 1 represents one kind selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, and a group expressed by the following formula 2: where R 6 represents one kind selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, a phenyl group, and an alkylsilyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, and n represents an integer from 0 to 2; R 2 and R 3 may be identical or different, each representing one kind selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen and an alkyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4; and Z represents one kind selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom and SO 3 M, where M represents one kind selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, an alkali metal, and an alkaline-earth metal. As preferable examples of the new reagent for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention, those having the respective structures shown in the following formulae 4 to 17 can be noted specifically: Another new reagent for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention is a compound having, as a basic structure, a nitrophenyl ester structure expressed by the following formula 3: where X and Y may be identical or different, each representing one kind selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, an alkyloxy group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, a benzo group, and an alkylamino group having a carbon number from 1 to 4; R 1 represents one kind selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having a carbon number from l to 4, and a group expressed by the following formula 2: where R 6 represents one kind selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, a phenyl group, and an alkylsilyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, and n represents an integer from 0 to 2; and R 2 and R 3 may be identical or different, each representing one kind selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen and an alkyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4. As preferable examples of the new reagent for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention, those having the respective structures shown in the following formulae 18 to 23 can be noted specifically: On the other hand, the methods in accordance with the present invention are caging methods in which the above-mentioned reagents for preparation of caged compounds are reacted with compounds having various functional groups (physiologically active substances such as amino acids) , so as to prepare caged compounds. FIGS. 1A and 1B show caging methods of compounds having various functional groups, in which the reagents for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention are used. FIG. 2 shows a photolysis reaction of a caged compound obtained. As shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B , N-succinimidyl group and p-nitrophenyl group easily react with various functional groups under mild reaction conditions. Preferable examples of the above-mentioned functional groups include amino group, hydroxide group, phenol group, thiol group, carboxylic acid group, and the like. The caged compounds obtained by the methods of the present invention are stable in the dark since the double bond of cinnamate group is kept in a trans (E) form.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In the following, the present invention will be explained further in detail. Synthesizing Method The method of synthesizing reagents for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention is not restricted in particular, and known organic chemistry reactions are favorably usable in general. Specifically, reagents for preparation of caged compounds having various substituents in accordance with the present invention can easily be synthesized with a favorable yield and a high purity according to the synthesizing route shown in FIGS. 3A to 3 E in the case of compounds having an N-succinimidyl aminocinnamate structure as their basic structure, and according to the synthesizing route shown in FIGS. 4A to 4 E in the case of compounds having a p-nitrophenyl aminocinnamate structure as their basic structure. The synthesis of compounds having an N-succinimidyl aminocinnamate structure as a basic structure shown in FIGS. 3A to 3 E includes a step of forming a cinnamate skeleton upon a reaction between a 2-nitrobenzaldehyde derivative (including a phenylketone derivative) having a favorable substituent and Wittig reagent (including Wadsworth-Emmons reagent) for introducing the favorable substituent (FIG. 3 A). For the 2-nitrobenzaldehyde derivative (including a phenylketone derivative) and Wittig reagent (including Wadsworth-Emmons reagent), which are necessary starting materials, commercially available products can be used. Also, they can be synthesized by conventionally known organic synthesizing methods (Organic Synthesis, col. vol. 3, 641; Organic Synthesis, col. vol. 4,735; Organic Synthesis, col. vol. 5,825; Kienzle et al., Helv. Chim. Acta, 63 (8), 2364-2369 (1980); and Wani et al., J. Med. Chem. 1980, 23, 554-560). The reaction condition of Wittig reaction is not restricted in particular, and known conditions are usable in general (e.g., Organic Reaction, vol. 14, p. 270-423 (1965); and Organic Reaction, vol. 25, 73 (1977)). It is easy for those skilled in the art to select and optimize a favorable reaction condition in view of such literatures and the like. Here, the resulting cinnamate derivative may be any of cis form and trans form with respect to the double bond, and may be a mixture thereof. Means for verifying its structure is not restricted in particular, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specifically, such means as infrared absorption spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, mass spectrum, and the like can easily verify the existence of double bond, ester group, and nitro group. Also, various known or commercially available liquid chromatographs, gas chromatographs, and the like can be used for determining the yield and purity of the product. Further, the synthesis shown in FIGS. 3A to 3 E includes a reaction of hydrolyzing an ester group into a carboxylic acid (FIG. 3 B). The method of reaction for hydrolyzing such an ester (which is a methyl or ethyl ester in general) is not restricted in particular either, and known methods (Greene et al., Protective Group in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed., p. 224-251, John Wiley Sons (1991)) can favorably be used in general. A specific example thereof is a reaction under an acidic or alkaline condition. The reaction condition of such a hydrolyzing reaction is not restricted in particular, and known conditions are usable in general. It is easy for those skilled in the art to select and optimize a favorable reaction condition in view of such a literature. Here, the resulting acid derivative may be any of cis form and trans form with respect to the double bond, and may be a mixture thereof. Means for verifying its structure is not restricted in particular, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specifically, such means as infrared absorption spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, mass spectrum, and the like can easily verify the existence of double bond, carboxylic acid, and nitro group. Also, various known or commercially available liquid chromatographs, gas chromatographs, and the like can be used for determining the yield and purity of the product. Further, the synthesis shown in FIGS. 3A to 3 E includes a reaction by which the resulting acid derivative and N-hydroxysuccinimide (including its derivatives having sulfonic acid group) are dehydrated and condensed so as to form N-succinimidyl cinnamate (FIG. 3 C). Here, the method of this dehydration and condensation reaction is not restricted in particular, and known methods (Anderson et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 85, 3039 (1963)) can favorably be used. Preferably, various dehydrators are used in a polar nonaqueous solvent (e.g., dimethylformaldehyde (DMF), 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), or dichloromethane). Specific examples of dehydrators include dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC), and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC-HCl). The reaction condition of such dehydration and condensation is not restricted in particular, and known conditions are usable in general. It is easy for those skilled in the art to select and optimize a favorable reaction condition in view of such a literature or the like. The acid derivative having an N-succinimidyl ester group introduced therein obtained here may be any of cis form and trans form with respect to the double bond, and may be a mixture thereof. Means for verifying its structure is not restricted in particular, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specifically, such means as infrared absorption spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, mass spectrum, and the like can easily verify the existence of double bond, N-succinimidyl ester group, and nitro group. Also, various known or commercially available liquid chromatographs, gas chromatographs, and the like can be used for determining the yield and purity of the product. Further, the synthesis shown in FIGS. 3A to 3 E includes a reaction by which the nitro group substituted at the aromatic ring of the N-succinimidyl cinnamate derivative is reduced to an amino group, so as to yield the final product (FIG. 3 D). Here, the method of reducing the nitro group to the amino group is not restricted in particular, and various known methods (Articoa et al., Synthesis Comm., 22 (10), 1433-1439 (1992); Sato et al., Heterocycles, 33 (2), 589-595 (1992); Mack et al., J. Org. Chem., 58, 6158-6162 (1993); and Martin et al., Helvetica Chemica Acta, 17, 111-120 (1994)) can favorably be used. A specific example thereof is a reduction reaction with various metals under an acidic condition. A more specific example is a method using iron (including iron powder) under an acidic condition of acetic acid. The condition of such an acetic acid/iron reduction reaction is not restricted in particular, and known conditions are usable in general. It is easy for those skilled in the art to select and optimize a favorable reaction condition in view of such literatures or the like. The amino derivative obtained here is the final product, which becomes a reagent for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention. This amino derivative is in a trans form with respect to the double bond. It is because of the fact that, while a cis product is also generated upon the above-mentioned reduction reaction, a nitrogen-substituted coumarin derivative (carbostyril derivative) is easily formed according to a mechanism similar to the photoreaction shown in FIG. 2 . Means for verifying the structure is not restricted in particular, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specifically, such means as infrared absorption spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, mass spectrum, and the like can easily verify the existence of trans double bond, N-succinimidyl ester group, and aromatic amino group. Also, various known or commercially available liquid chromatographs, gas chromatographs, and the like can be used for determining the yield and purity of the product. Further, the synthesizing route shown in FIGS. 3A to 3 E includes a reaction for alkylating an aromatic amino group ( FIG. 3E ) in the case where, as the reagent for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention, one having an aromatic alkyl amino group is to be obtained. The method of this amino group alkylating reaction is not restricted in particular, and various known methods (Anderson et al., Synthesis, 1974, 665; Tsuji et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 45 (6), 987-995 (1997); Padmanabhan et al., Synth. Commun., 1997, 27 (4), 691-699; Zhao et al., Synth. Commun., 1997, 27 (12), 2103-2110; and Ramrao et al., Synth. Commun., 21 (1991) 10-11, 1129-1135) can favorably be used in general. Specific examples include reactions with alkyl halides, alkyl sulfonates, and alkyl tosylates. A more specific example includes a method using an alkyl iodide. The reaction condition of such alkylation is not restricted in particular, and various known methods can favorably be used. It is easy for those skilled in the art to select and optimize a favorable reaction condition in view of such literatures or the like. Means for verifying the structure of the alkylamino derivative obtained here is not restricted in particular, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specifically, such means as infrared absorption spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, mass spectrum, and the like can easily verify the existence of trans double bond, N-succinimidyl ester group, and aromatic alkyl amino group. Also, various known or commercially available liquid chromatographs, gas chromatographs, and the like can be used for determining the yield and purity of the product. The synthesis of compounds having a p-nitrophenyl aminocinnamate structure as a basic structure shown in FIGS. 4A to 4 E includes a step of forming a cinnamate skeleton upon a reaction between a 2-nitrobenzaldehyde derivative (including a phenylketone derivative) having a favorable substituent and Wittig reagent (including Wadsworth-Emmons reagent) for introducing the favorable substituent (FIG. 4 A). For the 2-nitrobenzaldehyde derivative (including a phenylketone derivative) and Wittig reagent (including Wadsworth-Emmons reagent), which are necessary starting materials, commercially available products can be used. Also, they can be synthesized by conventionally known organic synthesizing methods. The reaction condition of Wittig reaction is not restricted in particular, and known conditions are usable in general. Here, the resulting cinnamate derivative may be any of cis form and trans form with respect to the double bond, and may be a mixture thereof. Means for verifying its structure is not restricted in particular, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specifically, such means as infrared absorption spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, mass spectrum, and the like can verify the existence of double bond, ester group, and nitro group. Also, various known or commercially available liquid chromatographs, gas chromatographs, and the like can be used for determining the yield and purity of the product. Further, the synthesis shown in FIGS. 4A to 4 E includes a reaction of reducing an aromatic nitro group to an amino group (FIG. 4 B). Here, the method of reducing the nitro group to the amino group is not restricted in particular, and various known methods mentioned in the foregoing explanation of FIG. 3D can favorably be used in general. A specific example thereof is a reduction reaction with metals under an acidic condition of acetic acid. A more specific example is a method using iron (including iron powder) under an acidic condition of acetic acid. The condition of such an acetic acid/iron reduction reaction is not restricted in particular, and known conditions are usable in general. It is easy for those skilled in the art to select and optimize a favorable reaction condition in view of literatures. The amino derivative obtained here is in a trans form with respect to the double bond. It is because of the fact that, while a cis product is also generated upon the above-mentioned reduction reaction, a nitrogen-substituted coumarin derivative (carbostyril derivative) is easily formed according to a mechanism similar to the photoreaction shown in FIG. 2 . Means for verifying the structure is not restricted in particular, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specifically, such means as infrared absorption spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, mass spectrum, and the like can easily verify the existence of trans double bond, ester group, and aromatic amino group.

Further, the synthesis shown in FIGS. 4A to 4 E includes a reaction of hydrolyzing an ester group into a carboxylic acid (FIG. 4 C). The method of reaction for hydrolyzing such an ester (which is a methyl or ethyl ester in general) is not restricted in particular, and known methods can favorably be used in general. A specific example thereof is a reaction under an acidic or alkaline condition. The reaction condition of such a hydrolyzing reaction is not restricted in particular, and the reaction can be effected under known conditions in general. It is easy for those skilled in the art to select and optimize a favorable reaction condition in view of a literature. Means for verifying the structure is not restricted in particular either, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specifically, such means as infrared absorption spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, mass spectrum, and the like can verify the existence of trans double bond, carboxylic acid, and aromatic amino group. Also, various known or commercially available liquid chromatographs, gas chromatographs, and the like can be used for determining the yield and purity of the product. Further, the synthesis shown in FIGS. 4A to 4 E includes a reaction by which the above-mentioned carboxylic acid derivative and p-nitrophenol are dehydrated and condensed, so as to yield p-nitropheyl aminocinnamate (FIG. 4 D). The method of such a dehydration and condensation reaction is not restricted in particular, and known methods (Billington et al., Tetrahedron 47 (1991) 28, 5231-5236; Huang et al., J. Org. Chem. 56 (1991) 21, 6007-6018; Pfeiffer et al., J. Org. Chem. 58 (1993) 3, 735-740; and Cabaret et al., Synthesis (1994) 5, 480-482) can favorably be used in general. Preferably, various dehydrators are used in a polar nonaqueous solvent (e.g., dimethylformaldehyde, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, or dichloromethane). Specific examples of dehydrators include dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC), and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC-HCl). The reaction condition of such dehydration and condensation is not restricted in particular, and known conditions are usable in general. It is easy for those skilled in the art to select and optimize a favorable reaction condition in view of such literatures. Means for verifying the structure is not restricted in particular, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specifically, such means as infrared absorption spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, mass spectrum, and the like can verify the existence of trans double bond, ester group, aromatic amino group, and aromatic nitro group. Also, various known or commercially available liquid chromatographs, gas chromatographs, and the like can be used for determining the yield and purity of the product. As mentioned above, reagents for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention can be obtained by the synthesizing routes shown in FIGS. 3A to 3 E and 4 A to 4 E, and the target caged compounds can be obtained with a high yield and high selectivity by use of these reagents. Further, when a group expressed by the following formula 2: (where R 6 represents one kind selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, a phenyl group, and an alkylsilyl group having a carbon number from 1 to 4, and n represents an integer from 0 to 2) is introduced to an aromatic amino group of the reagent for preparation of caged compounds, side reactions are suppressed, so that the target caged compounds can be obtained with a higher yield and higher selectivity. FIGS. 5A and 5B show an example of the method of introducing the protective group to the amino group, which does not limit the method of synthesizing the reagents for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention at all. The synthesizing route shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B includes a reaction of introducing the protective group expressed by formula 2 to the aromatic amino group of the amino derivative obtained as an intermediate product (FIG. 5 A). The method of reaction for introducing the protective group is not restricted in particular, and known methods can favorably be used in general. Specific examples include reactions with alkylsilylalkoxycarbonyl chloride and benzylcarboxy chloride. The reaction condition for introducing the protective group is not restricted in particular, and known conditions can be used in general to carry out the reaction (Greene et al., Protective Group in organic Synthesis, 2nd ed., p. 315-345, John Wiley Sons (1991)). It is easy for those skilled in the art to select and optimize a favorable reaction condition in view of such a literature. Means for verifying the structure of the amino derivative having the protective group introduced therein obtained here is not restricted in particular, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specifically, such means as infrared absorption spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, mass spectrum, and the like can easily verify the existence of double bond, ester group, aromatic amino group, and aromatic amino group. Also, various known or commercially available liquid chromatographs, gas chromatographs, and the like can be used for determining the yield and purity of the product. The synthesizing route shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B includes a reaction by which the amino derivative having the protective group introduced therein and N-succinimide or p-nitrophenol are dehydrated and condensed, so as to yield a reagent for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention (FIG. 5 B). The reaction method and condition for the dehydration and condensation are not restricted in particular, and known methods and conditions are usable in general. Specifically, the methods and conditions similar to those in the reactions shown in FIGS. 3C and 4D can be mentioned. Also, means for verifying the structure of obtained compounds is not restricted in particular, and known means for analyzing organic compounds are usable in general. Specific examples thereof include analyzing means similar to those used for verifying the structures of compounds obtained by the reactions of FIGS. 3C and 4D . The reagents for preparation of caged compounds to which the protective group expressed by formula 2 has been introduced are particularly effective when the target substance to be caged is an amino group having a secondary amino group (NHR group). Here, the protective group expressed by formula 2 can easily be liberated in a post-processing step of the coupling (caging) reaction with the target substance. Specifically, in the case of trimethylsilylethyloxycarbonyl group, it can easily be liberated by use of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Reaction of Reagents for Preparation of Caged Compounds Since the above-mentioned reagents for preparation of caged compounds have an active ester group such as N-succinimide ester group or p-nitrophenyl group, they can easily react with various compounds having a functional group such as amino group under a mild condition (FIGS. 1 A and 1 B). In this reaction, water, an inorganic solvent, or their mixed solvents can be used as a reaction solvent. The reaction rapidly progresses at a reaction temperature from about 0 C. to about 100 C. The concentration required for the reaction of the above-mentioned reagents for preparation of caged compounds is not restricted in particular, and they can also be used by an amount equivalent to the amount of the target substance to be caged or more. In the case where the target substance to be caged has a plurality of functional groups, a plurality of functional groups can be caged when the concentration of the reagents for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention is adjusted. In the case where the compound has a plurality of A functional groups different from each other (e.g., amino group and carboxyl acid group), only a specific functional group may be caged according to the difference in reactivity of the reagents for preparation of caged compounds in accordance with the present invention between the functional groups. FIGS. 6 and 7 show various applied examples of reaction of reagents for preparation of caged compounds. In the following, the present invention will be explained in further detail with reference to Examples, which do not limit the present invention at all.

The aforesaid reaction is performed at a temperature of about 10 C. to about 60 C., preferably ranging between 0 C. and about 22 C. (i.e., room temperature). The compounds of formula IV are obtained as mixtures of geometric isomers about the olefinic double bond (i.e. cis and trans isomers); separation of the isomers is not necessary. Compounds of said formula I, wherein Y is (C 1 -C 6 )alkyl, can be saponified to the free acid (i.e. Y is hydrogen) using a base such as sodium hydroxide in a protic solvent such as ethanol, methanol or water or a mixture such as water and ethanol, water and toluene, or water and THF. The preferred solvent system is water and toluene. The reaction is conducted for a period of 30 minutes to 24 hours, preferably about 2 hours. Compounds of the formula V, wherein R 1 is optionally substituted benzyl can be prepared according to methods known in the art. The alkylsulfonamides that can be prepared by the methods of the present invention and the starting materials of formula V are also described in the literature. PCT Publications WO 96/27583 and WO 98/07697, published Mar. 7, 1996 and Feb. 26, 1998, respectively, refer to arylsulfonyl hydroxamic acids. Each of the above referenced publications is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Compounds of the formula V wherein R 2 and R 3 are tetrahydropyran-4-yl or a bicyclo ring of the formula wherein the asterisk indicates the carbon atom common to R 2 and R 3 can be prepared according to methods analogous to those of Examples 2 and 3. The compounds of the formula I which are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate a compound of the formula I from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent, and subsequently convert the free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is obtained. The acids which are used to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are those which form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate or bisulfate, phosphate or acid phosphate, acetate, lactate, citrate or acid citrate, tartrate or bitartrate, succinate, maleate, fumarate, gluconate, saccharate, benzoate, methanesulfonate and pamoate ie, 1,1-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate) salts. Those compounds of the formula I which are also acidic in nature, are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. These salts are all prepared by conventional techniques. The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of this invention are those which form non-toxic base salts with the herein described acidic compounds of formula I. These non-toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, etc. These salts can easily be prepared by treating the corresponding acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired pharmacologically acceptable cations, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum product yields. The ability of the compounds of formula I or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts (hereinafter also referred to as the active compounds) to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases or ADAMs (such as inhibiting the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)) and, consequently, demonstrate their effectiveness for treating diseases characterized by matrix metalloproteinase or ADAM (such as the production of tumor necrosis factor) can be determined according to in vitro assay tests well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. One example of an assay recognized as demonstrating that the final products produced by the methods of the invention is the following Inhibition of Human Collagenase Assay. BIOLOGICAL ASSAY Inhibition of Human Collagenase (MMP-1) Human recombinant collagenase is activated with trypsin using the following ratio: 10 g trypsin per 100 g of collagenase. The trypsin and collagenase are incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes then a five fold excess (50 g/10 g trypsin) of soybean trypsin inhibitor is added. 10 mM stock solutions of inhibitors are made up in dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted using the following Scheme: 10 mM120 M12 M1.2 M0.12 M Twenty-five microliters of each concentration is then added in triplicate to appropriate wells of a 96 well microfluor plate. The final concentration of inhibitor will be a 1:4 dilution after addition of enzyme and substrate. Positive controls (enzyme, no inhibitor) are set up in wells D1-D6 and blanks (no enzyme, no inhibitors) are set in wells D7-D12. Collagenase is diluted to 400 ng/ml and 25 l is then added to appropriate wells of the microfluor plate. Final concentration of collagenase in the assay is 100 ng/ml. Substrate (DNP-Pro-Cha-Gly-Cys(Me)-His-Ala-Lys(NMA)-NH 2 ) is made as a 5 mM stock in dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted to 20 mM in assay buffer. The assay is initiated by the addition of 50 l substrate per well of the microfluor plate to give a final concentration of 10 M. Fluorescence readings (360 nM excitation, 460 nm emission) were taken at time 0 and then at 20 minute intervals. The assay is conducted at room temperature with a typical assay time of 3 hours. Fluorescence vs time is then plotted for both the blank and collagenase containing samples (data from triplicate determinations is averaged). A time point that provides a good signal (the blank) and that is on a linear part of the curve (usually around 120 minutes) is chosen to determine IC 50 values. The zero time is used as a blank for each compound at each concentration and these values are subtracted from the 120 minute data. Data is plotted as inhibitor concentration vs % control (inhibitor fluorescence divided by fluorescence of collagenase alone100). IC 50 s are determined from the concentration of inhibitor that gives a signal that is 50% of the control. If IC 50 s are reported to be 0.03 M then the inhibitors are assayed at concentrations of 0.3 M, 0.03 M, 0.03 M and 0.003 M. The following Examples illustrate the preparation of the compounds of the present invention. Melting points are uncorrected. NMR data are reported in parts per million (6) and are referenced to the deuterium lock signal from the sample solvent (deuteriochloroform unless otherwise specified).

This is a Divisional of application Ser. No. 09/262,184, filed on Mar. 4, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,111,000, which claims the benefit of Provisional No. 06/077,602 filed Mar. 10, 1998. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a borate compound which is useful in rubber compositions and the processing of a rubber composition containing borate compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION U.S. Pat. No. 4,057,529 discloses a rubber composition containing a carboxylated cobalt oxy metal complex. Representative metals include boron. These complex carboxylated cobalt oxy metal compounds may be prepared by reacting a cobalt salt of a carboxylic acid with an alkoxide of boron as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,296,242. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to borate compounds wherein R 1 and R 2 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms; R 3 is selected from the group consisting of alkylene groups having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms and arylene and alkyl substituted arylene groups having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms; X is selected from the group consisting of SH, SCN, and NH 2 ; and Y is selected from the group consisting of S x and Se x where x is an integer of from 1 to 8. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION There is also disclosed a method for processing a silica-filled rubber composition which comprises mixing (i) 100 parts by weight of at least one elastomer containing olefinic unsaturation selected from conjugated diene homopolymers and copolymers and from copolymers of at least one conjugated diene and aromatic vinyl compound; and (ii) 0.05 to 10 phr of a compound of the formulae wherein R 1 and R 2 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms; R 3 is selected from the group consisting of alkylene groups having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms and arylene and alkyl substituted arylene groups having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms; X is selected from the group consisting of SH, SCN, and NH 2 ; and Y is selected from the group consisting of S x and Se x where x is an integer of from 1 to 8. There is also disclosed a rubber composition comprising an elastomer containing olefinic unsaturation and a compound of the formulae wherein R 1 and R 2 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms; R 3 is selected from the group consisting of alkylene groups having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms and arylene and alkyl substituted arylene groups having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms; X is selected from the group consisting of SH, SCN, and NH 2 ; and Y is selected from the group consisting of S x and Se x where x is an integer of from 1 to 8. The present invention may be used to process rubbers or elastomers containing olefinic unsaturation. The phrase rubber or elastomer containing olefinic unsaturation is intended to include both natural rubber and its various raw and reclaim forms as well as various synthetic rubbers. In the description of this invention, the terms rubber and elastomer may be used interchangeably, unless otherwise prescribed. The terms rubber composition, compounded rubber and rubber compound are used interchangeably to refer to rubber which has been blended or mixed with various ingredients and materials and such terms are well known to those having skill in the rubber mixing or rubber compounding art. Representative synthetic polymers are the homopolymerization products of butadiene and its homologues and derivatives, for example, methylbutadiene, dimethylbutadiene and pentadiene as well as copolymers such as those formed from butadiene or its homologues or derivatives with other unsaturated monomers. Among the latter are acetylenes, for example, vinyl acetylene; olefins, for example, isobutylene, which copolymerizes with isoprene to form butyl rubber; vinyl compounds, for example, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile (which polymerize with butadiene to form NBR), methacrylic acid and styrene, the latter compound polymerizing with butadiene to form SBR, as well as vinyl esters and various unsaturated aldehydes, ketones and ethers, e.g., acrolein, methyl isopropenyl ketone and vinylethyl ether. Specific examples of synthetic rubbers include neoprene (polychloroprene), polybutadiene (including cis-1,4-polybutadiene), polyisoprene (including cis-1,4-polyisoprene), butyl rubber, styrene/isoprene/butadiene rubber, copolymers of 1,3-butadiene or isoprene with monomers such as styrene, acrylonitrile and methyl methacrylate, as well as ethylene/propylene terpolymers, also known as ethylene/propylene/diene monomer (EPDM), and in particular, ethylene/propylene/dicyclopentadiene terpolymers. The preferred rubber or elastomers are polybutadiene and SBR. In one aspect the rubber is preferably of at least two of diene based rubbers. For example, a combination of two or more rubbers is preferred such as cis 1,4-polyisoprene rubber (natural or synthetic, although natural is preferred), 3,4-polyisoprene rubber, styrene/isoprene/butadiene rubber, emulsion and solution polymerization derived styrene/butadiene rubbers, cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubbers and emulsion polymerization prepared butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers. In one aspect of this invention, an emulsion polymerization derived styrene/butadiene (E-SBR) might be used having a relatively conventional styrene content of about 20 to about 28 percent bound styrene or, for some applications, an E-SBR having a medium to relatively high bound styrene content, namely, a bound styrene content of about 30 to about 45 percent. The relatively high styrene content of about 30 to about 45 for the E-SBR can be considered beneficial for a purpose of enhancing traction, or skid resistance, of the tire tread. The presence of the E-SBR itself is considered beneficial for a purpose of enhancing processability of the uncured elastomer composition mixture, especially in comparison to a utilization of a solution polymerization prepared SBR (S-SBR). By emulsion polymerization prepared E-SBR, it is meant that styrene and 1,3-butadiene are copolymerized as an aqueous emulsion. Such are well known to those skilled in such art. The bound styrene content can vary, for example, from about 5 to about 50 percent. In one aspect, the E-SBR may also contain acrylonitrile to form a terpolymer rubber, as E-SBAR, in amounts, for example, of about 2 to about 30 weight percent bound acrylonitrile in the terpolymer. Emulsion polymerization prepared styrene/butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymer rubbers containing about 2 to about 40 weight percent bound acrylonitrile in the copolymer are also contemplated as diene based rubbers for use in this invention. The solution polymerization prepared SBR (S-SBR) typically has a bound styrene content in a range of about 5 to about 50, preferably about 9 to about 36, percent. The S-SBR can be conveniently prepared, for example, by organo lithium catalyzation in the presence of an organic hydrocarbon solvent. A purpose of using S-SBR is for improved tire rolling resistance as a result of lower hysteresis when it is used in a tire tread composition. The 3,4-polyisoprene rubber (3,4-PI) is considered beneficial for a purpose of enhancing the tires traction when it is used in a tire tread composition. The 3,4-PI and use thereof is more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,087,668 which is incorporated herein by reference. The Tg refers to the glass transition temperature which can conveniently be determined by a differential scanning calorimeter at a heating rate of 10 C. per minute. The cis 1,4-polybutadiene rubber (BR) is considered to be beneficial for a purpose of enhancing the tire treads wear, or treadwear. Such BR can be prepared, for example, by organic solution polymerization of 1,3-butadiene. The BR may be conveniently characterized, for example, by having at least a 90 percent cis 1,4-content. The cis 1,4-polyisoprene and cis 1,4-polyisoprene natural rubber are well known to those having skill in the rubber art. The term phr as used herein, and according to conventional practice, refers to parts by weight of a respective material per 100 parts by weight of rubber, or elastomer. The borate compounds of the present invention are of the formula wherein R 1 and R 2 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms; R 3 is selected from the group consisting of alkylene groups having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms and arylene and alkyl substituted arylene groups having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms; X is selected from the group consisting of SH, SCN, and NH 2 ; and Y is selected from the group consisting of S x and Se x where x is an integer of from 1 to 8. Preferably, each R 1 and R 2 are alkoxy radicals having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, R 3 is an alkylene group having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, X is S x and Y is SH. The borate compounds may comprise a high purity product or mixture of products conforming to the above formula. The borate compound of Formula I where X is SH may be prepared according to the reaction scheme listed below. The borate compound of Formula I where X is SCN may be prepared according to the reaction scheme listed below. The borate compound of Formula I where X is an epoxide group may be prepared according to the reaction scheme listed below. The borate compound of Formula I where X is an episulfide may be prepared according to the reaction scheme listed below. The borate compound of Formula I where X is an amine may be prepared according to the reaction scheme listed below. The borate compound of Formula II where Y is S x may be prepared according to the reaction scheme listed below. The borate compound of Formula II where Y is Se x may be prepared according to the reaction scheme listed below. The above reactions are generally conducted in the presence of a suitable solvent. The primary criteria is to use a solvent which does not react with the starting materials or end product. Representative organic solvents include chloroform, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, xylene, benzene, toluene, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic alcohols. Preferably, water is avoided to prevent reaction with the siloxy groups of the compounds. The borate compounds used in the present invention may be added to the rubber by any conventional technique such as on a mill or in a Banbury. The amount of the borate compound may vary widely depending on the type of rubber and other compounds present in the rubber composition. Generally, the amount of the borate compound is used in a range of from about 0.05 to about 10.0 phr with a range of 0.1 to about 5.0 phr being preferred. The borate compound is preferably added in the nonproductive stage. For ease in handling, the borate compound may be used per se or may be deposited on suitable carriers. Examples of carriers which may be used in the present invention include silica, carbon black, alumina, alumina silicates, clay, kieselguhr, cellulose, silica gel and calcium silicate. The rubber composition may contain a sufficient amount of filler (such as silica, alumina, aluminosilicate and/or carbon black) to contribute a reasonably high modulus and high resistance to tear. The filler may be added in amounts ranging from 10 to 250 phr. More specifically, silica is generally present in an amount ranging from 15 to 80 phr. If carbon black is also present, the amount of carbon black, if used, may vary. Generally speaking, the amount of carbon black will vary from 0 to 80 phr. Preferably, the amount of carbon black will range from 0 to 40 phr. It is to be appreciated that the silica coupler may be used in conjunction with a carbon black, namely pre-mixed with a carbon black prior to addition to the rubber composition, and such carbon black is to be included in the aforesaid amount of carbon black for the rubber composition formulation. Where the rubber composition contains both silica and carbon black, the weight ratio of silica to carbon black may vary. For example, the weight ratio may be as low as 1:5 to a silica to carbon black weight ratio of 30:1. Preferably, the weight ratio of silica to carbon black ranges from 1:3 to 5:1. The combined weight of the silica and carbon black, as herein referenced, may be as low as about 30 phr, but is preferably from about 45 to about 90 phr. The commonly employed siliceous pigments used in rubber compounding applications can be used as the silica in this invention, including pyrogenic and precipitated siliceous pigments (silica) and aluminosilicates, although precipitate silicas are preferred. The siliceous pigments preferably employed in this invention are precipitated silicas such as, for example, those obtained by the acidification of a soluble silicate, e.g., sodium silicate. Such silicas might be characterized, for example, by having a BET surface area, as measured using nitrogen gas, preferably in the range of about 40 to about 600, and more usually in a range of about 50 to about 300 square meters per gram. The BET method of measuring surface area is described in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Volume 60, page 304 (1930). The silica may also be typically characterized by having a dibutylphthalate (DBP) absorption value in a range of about 100 to about 400, and more usually about 150 to about 300. Further, the silica, as well as the aforesaid alumina and aluminosilicate may be expected to have a CTAB surface area in a range of about 100 to about 220. The CTAB surface area is the external surface area as evaluated by cetyl trimethylammonium bromide with a pH of 9. The method is described in ASTM D 3849 for set up and evaluation. The CTAB surface area is a well known means for characterization of silica. Mercury surface area/porosity is the specific surface area determined by Mercury porosimetry. For such technique, mercury is penetrated into the pores of the sample after a thermal treatment to remove volatiles. Set-up conditions may be suitably described as using a 100 mg sample; removing volatiles during 2 hours at 105 C. and ambient atmospheric pressure; ambient to 2000 bars pressure measuring range. Such evaluation may be performed according to the method described in Winslow, Shapiro in ASTM bulletin, p.39 (1959) or according to DIN 66133. For such an evaluation, a CARLO-ERBA Porosimeter 2000 might be used. The average mercury porosity specific surface area for the silica should be in a range of about 100 to 300 m 2 /g. A suitable pore-size distribution for the silica, alumina and aluminosilicate according to such mercury porosity evaluation is considered herein to be five percent or less of its pores have a diameter of less than about 10 nm; 60 to 90 percent of its pores have a diameter of about 10 to about 100 nm; 10 to 30 percent of its pores have a diameter of about 100 to about 1000 nm; and 5 to 20 percent of its pores have a diameter of greater than about 1000 nm. The silica might be expected to have an average ultimate particle size, for example, in the range of 0.01 to 0.05 micron as determined by the electron microscope, although the silica particles may be even smaller, or possibly larger, in size. Various commercially available silicas may be considered for use in this invention such as, only for example herein, and without limitation, silicas commercially available from PPG Industries under the Hi-Sil trademark with designations 210, 243, etc; silicas available from Rhone-Poulenc, with, for example, designations of Z1165MP and Z165GR and silicas available from Degussa AG with, for example, designations VN2, VN3, BV3380GR, etc, and silicas available from Huber, for example Huber Sil 8745. Optionally, conventional sulfur containing organosilicon compounds can be present in the rubber composition. Examples of suitable sulfur containing organosilicon compounds are of the formula: Z-Alk-S n -Alk-ZIII in which Z is selected from the group consisting of where R 4 is an alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, cyclohexyl or phenyl; R 5 is alkoxy of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or cycloalkoxy of 5 to 8 carbon atoms; Alk is a divalent hydrocarbon of 1 to 18 carbon atoms and n is an integer of 2 to 8.

Preferably Z is where R 5 is an alkoxy of 2 to 4 carbon atoms, with 2 carbon atoms being particularly preferred; Alk is a divalent hydrocarbon of 2 to 4 carbon atoms with 3 carbon atoms being particularly preferred; and n is an integer of from 2 to 4. The amount of the above sulfur containing organosilicon compound in a rubber composition may range from 0.1 to 40 phr. Preferably, the level of sulfur containing organosilicon compound may range from 5 to 15 phr. When a filler is used, the level of sulfur containing organosilicon compound may vary depending on the level of filler that is used. Generally speaking, the amount of the compound of formula III will range from 0 to 1.0 parts by weight per part by weight of the filler. Preferably, the amount will range from 0 to 0.4 parts by weight per part by weight of the filler. In accordance with one aspect of this invention, a rubber composition is prepared by a process which comprises the sequential steps of: (A) thermomechanically mixing in at least one preparatory mixing step to a temperature of about 140 C. to about 190 C., for a total mixing time of about 2 to about 20 minutes (i) 100 parts by weight of at least one elastomer containing olefinic unsaturation selected from conjugated diene homopolymers and copolymers and copolymers of at least one conjugated diene and aromatic vinyl compound; (ii) about 10 to about 250 phr of particulate filler selected from the group consisting of precipitated silica, alumina, aluminosilicate, carbon black and mixtures thereof; (iii) about 0.05 to about 10 phr of at least one borate compound of the formula I or II; (B) subsequently blending therewith, in a final thermomechanical mixing step at a temperature to about 100 C. to about 130 C. for a time of about 1 to about 3 minutes, about 0.1 to about 5 phr of elemental sulfur. It is readily understood by those having skill in the art that the rubber composition would be compounded by methods generally known in the rubber compounding art, such as mixing the various sulfur-vulcanizable constituent rubbers with various commonly used additive materials such as, for example, sulfur donors, curing aids, such as activators and retarders and processing additives, such as oils, resins including tackifying resins and plasticizers, fillers, pigments, fatty acid, zinc oxide, waxes, antioxidants and antiozonants and peptizing agents. As known to those skilled in the art, depending on the intended use of the sulfur vulcanizable and sulfur vulcanized material (rubbers), the additives mentioned above are selected and commonly used in conventional amounts. Typical amounts of reinforcing type carbon blacks(s), for this invention, if used, are herein set forth. Representative examples of sulfur donors include elemental sulfur (free sulfur), an amine disulfide, polymeric polysulfide and sulfur olefin adducts. Preferably, the sulfur vulcanizing agent is elemental sulfur. The sulfur vulcanizing agent may be used in an amount ranging from 0.5 to 8 phr, with a range of from 1.5 to 6 phr being preferred. Typical amounts of tackifier resins, if used, comprise about 0.5 to about 10 phr, usually about 1 to about 5 phr. Typical amounts of processing aids comprise about 1 to about 50 phr. Such processing aids can include, for example, aromatic, naphthenic, and/or paraffinic processing oils. Typical amounts of antioxidants comprise about 1 to about 5 phr. Representative antioxidants may be, for example, diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine and others, such as, for example, those disclosed in the Vanderbilt Rubber Handbook (1978), pages 344-346. Typical amounts of antiozonants comprise about 1 to 5 phr. Typical amounts of fatty acids, if used, which can include stearic acid comprise about 0.5 to about 3 phr. Typical amounts of zinc oxide comprise about 2 to about 5 phr. Typical amounts of waxes comprise about 1 to about 5 phr. Often microcrystalline waxes are used. Typical amounts of peptizers comprise about 0.1 to about 1 phr. Typical peptizers may be, for example, pentachlorothiophenol and dibenzamidodiphenyl disulfide. In one aspect-of the present invention, the sulfur vulcanizable rubber composition is then sulfur-cured or vulcanized. Accelerators are used to control the time and/or temperature required for vulcanization and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. In one embodiment, a single accelerator system may be used, i.e., primary accelerator. The primary accelerator(s) may be used in total amounts ranging from about 0.5 to about 4, preferably about 0.8 to about 1.5, phr. In another embodiment, combinations of a primary and a secondary accelerator might be used with the secondary accelerator being used in smaller amounts, such as from about 0.05 to about 3 phr, in order to activate and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. Combinations of these accelerators might be expected to produce a synergistic effect on the final properties and are somewhat better than those produced by use of either accelerator alone. In addition, delayed action accelerators may be used which are not affected by normal processing temperatures but produce a satisfactory cure at ordinary vulcanization temperatures. Vulcanization retarders might also be used. Suitable types of accelerators that may be used in the present invention are amines, disulfides, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams, sulfenamides, dithiocarbamates and xanthates. Preferably, the primary accelerator is a sulfenamide. If a second accelerator is used, the secondary accelerator is preferably a guanidine, dithiocarbamate or thiuram compound. The mixing of the rubber composition can be accomplished by methods known to those having skill in the rubber mixing art. For example the ingredients are typically mixed in at least two stages, namely at least one non-productive stage followed by a productive mix stage. The final curatives including sulfur vulcanizing agents are typically mixed in the final stage which is conventionally called the productive mix stage in which the mixing typically occurs at a temperature, or ultimate temperature, lower than the mix temperature(s) than the preceding non-productive mix stage(s). The terms non-productive and productive mix stages are well known to those having skill in the rubber mixing art. In further accordance with the invention, the process comprises the additional step of vulcanizing the prepared rubber composition at a temperature in a range of about 140 C. to about 190 C. Accordingly, the invention also thereby contemplates a vulcanized rubber composition prepared by such process. In additional accordance with the invention, the process comprises the additional steps of preparing an assembly of a tire or sulfur-vulcanizable rubber with a tread comprised of the said rubber composition prepared according to the process of this invention and vulcanizing the assembly at a temperature in a range of about 140 C. to about 190 C. Accordingly, the invention also thereby contemplates a vulcanized tire prepared by such process. Vulcanization of the rubber composition of the present invention is generally carried out at conventional temperatures ranging from about 100 C. to 200 C. Preferably, the vulcanization is conducted at temperatures ranging from about 110 C. to 180 C. Any of the usual vulcanization processes may be used such as heating in a press or mold, heating with superheated steam or hot air or in a salt bath. Upon vulcanization of the sulfur vulcanized composition, the rubber composition of this invention can be used for various purposes. For example, the sulfur vulcanized rubber composition may be in the form of a tire, belt or hose. In case of a tire, it can be used for various tire components. Such tires can be built, shaped, molded and cured by various methods which are known and will be readily apparent to those having skill in such art. Preferably, the rubber composition is used in the tread of a tire. As can be appreciated, the tire may be a passenger tire, aircraft tire, truck tire and the like. Preferably, the tire is a passenger tire. The tire may also be a radial or bias, with a radial tire being preferred. While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating the invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.

This is a division of application Ser. No. 09/035,811 filed Mar. 6, 1998 now abandoned. The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of enantiomerically pure 3-hydroxyoctanedioic acid diesters of the general formula I, where R 1 and R 2 are identical or different and are a C 1 -C 20 -alkyl group, C 3 -C 12 -cycloalkyl group, C 7 -C 12 -aralkyl group or a mono- or binuclear aryl group. The compounds (R)-I are novel, whereas the compounds (S)-I are known. Both are used mainly as intermediates for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure -lipoic acid of the formula II and its derivatives. -Lipoic acid is 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid (thioctic acid). The (R)-enantiomer of -lipoic acid (R)-()-II is a natural substance which occurs in low concentrations in virtually all animal and plant cells. As a coenzyme in the oxidative decarboxylation of -ketocarboxylic acids (e.g. pyruvic acid), -lipoic acid is of essential importance. -Lipoic acid is pharmacologically active and has anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive (analgesic) and cytoprotective properties. An important medical indication is the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy. According to recent results (A. Baur et al., Klin. Wochenschr. 1991, 69, 722; J. P. Merin et al., FEBS Lett. 1996, 394, 9), -lipoic acid may possibly gain importance in the control of diseases caused by HIV-1 and HTLV IIIB viruses. In the case of the pure optical isomers of -lipoic acid (R- and S-form, i.e. (R)--lipoic acid and (S)--lipoic acid), unlike the racemate, the (R)-enantiomer mainly has anti-inflammatory activity and the (S)-enantiomer mainly antinociceptive activity (EP 0427247, 08.11.90). Different pharmacokinetic properties of the two enantiomers have likewise been found (R. Hermann et al., Eur. J. Pharmaceut. Sci. 1996, 4, 167). The synthesis of the pure enantiomers is therefore of great importance. Known preparation processes for the enantiomerically pure -lipoic acids include the resolution of the racemates of -lipoic acid or its precursors, asymmetric syntheses using chiral auxiliaries, chiral pool syntheses using naturally occurring optically active starting compounds and microbial syntheses (review article: J. S. Yadav et al., J. Sci. Ind. Res. 1990, 49, 400; and also: E. Walton et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955, 77, 5144; D. S. Acker and W. J. Wayne, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957, 79, 6483; L. G. Chebotareva and A. M. Yurkevich, Khim.-Farm. Zh. 1980, 14, 92; A. S. Gopalan et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1989, 5705; A. G. Tolstikov et al., Bioorg. Khim. 1990, 16, 1670; L. Dasaradhi et al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. 1990, 729; A. S. Gopalan et al., J. Chem. Perkin Trans. 1 1990, 1897; EP 0487986 A2, 14.11.91; B. Adger et al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. 1995, 1563; Y. R. Santosh Laxmi and D. S. Iyengar, Synthesis, 1996, 594). Of these, the resolution of the racemate via the formation of diastereomeric salts of -lipoic acid with optically active a-methylbenzylamine (DE-A 4137773.7, 16.11.91 and DE-A 4427079.8, 30.07.94) represents the most economical variant up to now. Since the racemate separation only takes place in the last stage of the synthesis sequence, however, high yields cannot be attained. The only known chemocatalytic asymmetric process for the preparation of enantiomerically pure -lipoic acid (DE-A 3629116.1, 27.08.86) is based on the Sharpless epoxidation of allyl alcohols, but is uneconomical because of the high costs of the starting compounds. Among the biocatalytic synthesis routes described, the asymmetric reduction of 3-oxooctanedioic acid diesters III with bakers yeast is to be emphasized (EP 0487986 A2, 14.11.91). The disadvantages of this process, however, are that the space-time yield is extremely low, a high enantiomeric excess can only be achieved when using the isobutyl ester (R 1 iBu) and always only the (S)-enantiomer (S)-I is formed. The object of the invention is therefore alternatively to make both enantiomers of -lipoic acid available in high chemical and optical space-time yield when using inexpensive starting substances. According to the invention, this is achieved by asymmetric chemocatalytic hydrogenation of 3-oxooctanedioic acid diesters of the formula III, in which R 1 and R 2 in each case independently of one another are a C 1 -C 20 -alkyl group, C 3 -C 12 -cycloalkyl group, C 7 -C 12 -aralkyl group or a mono- or binuclear aryl group, in the presence of complexes of ruthenium and optically active phosphines or of Raney nickel and optically active tartaric acid as catalysts. In this case, independently of the nature of the ester groups (R 1 , R 2 ), constant high optical and chemical yields of 3-hydroxyoctanedioic acid diesters I are attained. Unlike the biocatalytic variants, the reaction can be carried out at very high substrate concentrations. The compounds III are known and obtainable especially by acylation of Meldrums acid with monoalkyl adipoyl chloride and subsequent alcoholysis (H. Thoma and G. Spiteller, Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1983, 1237; EP 0487986 A2, 14.11.91). Under certain reaction conditions, according to the invention preferably also the alkyl 6-(2,2-dimethyl-4,6-dioxo-1,3-dioxan-5-ylidene) 6-hydroxyhexanoates of the formula IV (R 1 C 1 -C 20 -alkyl, C 3 -C 12 -cycloalkyl, C 7 -C 12 -aralkyl and/or mono- or binuclear aryl) which are intermediately formed and can be isolated can be used for the asymmetric hydrogenation. They can be prepared as described (H. W. Schmidt and M. Klade, Org. Prep. Proced. Int. 1988, 20, 184) or prepared in an analogous manner. Of particular interest as catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation are ruthenium-diphosphine complexes. As typical examples but not as a restriction, the ruthenium complexes of the following formulae V to XI may be mentioned: RuHal 2 D 1,2 (L) x V RuHalAD Y VI RuD n OOCR 3 OOCR 4 VII RuH x D n m Y m VIII RuHal(PR 5 2 R 6 )D 2 Hal 2 IX RUHHalD 2 X DRu(acac) 2 XI in which: acac is acetylacetonate, D is a diphosphine of the general formula XII, Hal is halogen, in particular iodine, chlorine or bromine, R 3 and R 4 are identical or different and are alkyl having up to 9 C atoms, preferably up to 4 C atoms, which is optionally substituted by halogen, in particular fluorine, chlorine or bromine or are phenyl which is optionally substituted by alkyl having 1 to 4 C atoms or are -aminoalkanoic acid preferably having up to 4 C atoms, or jointly form an alkylidene group having up to 4 C atoms, R 5 and R 6 in each case are identical or different and are optionally substituted phenyl, preferably substituted by alkyl having 1 to 4 C atoms or halogen, Y is Cl, Br, I, ClO 4 , BF 4 or PF 4 , A is an unsubstituted or substituted benzene ring such as p-cymene, L is a neutral ligand such as acetone, a tertiary amine or dimethylformamide, n and m in each case are 1 or 2, x is 0 or 1, where in formula VIII n is 1 and m is 2 if x0, and n is 2 and m is 1 if x1. The complexes of the formulae V to XI can be prepared by methods known per se (V and X: EP 174057 and J. P.Genet et al., Tetrahedron Asymmetry 1994, 5, 675; VI: EP 366390; VII: EP 245959 and EP 272787; VIII: EP 256634; IX: EP 470756; XI: P. Stahly et al., Organometallics 1993, 1467). Optically active diphosphine ligands which can be used are compounds of the general formula XII: in which: Q is a group bridging the two P atoms having 2 to 24 carbon atoms and optionally 1 to 4 heteroatoms, preferably O, S, N and Si, the bridge being formed by at least 2 of the carbon atoms and optionally 1 to 4 of the heteroatoms, R 7 -R 10 in each case are identical or different and are alkyl groups having 1 to 18 C atoms, cycloalkyl groups having 5 to 7 C atoms or aryl groups having 6 to 12 C atoms. As particularly preferred chiral diphosphines which can be used in enantiomerically pure form, the following ligands can be mentioned as examples: The ligands mentioned above as racemic structures for the sake of simplicity are known compounds in their enantiomerically pure forms (BINAP: R. Noyori et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980, 102, 7932; BIMOP, FUPMOP, BIFUP: M. Murata et al., Synlett 1991, 827; BIBHEMP: R. Schmid et al., Helv. Chim. Acta 1988, 71, 697; MeO-BIPHEP: R. Schmid et al., Helv. Chim. Acta 1991, 74, 370; BICHEP: A. Miyashita et al., Chem. Lett. 1989, 1849; DuPHOS: M. Burk et al., Organometallics 1990, 9, 2653; BPE: M. Burk et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 4423; BIBFUP: EP 643065; CHIRAPHOS: B. Bosnich et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977, 99, 6262; XIII: WO 96/01831). The asymmetric hydrogenation of the compounds of the formula III in the presence of the optically active ruthenium-diphosphine complexes of the formulae V to XI described above can be carried out in suitable organic solvents which are inert under the reaction conditions. Those which can be mentioned in particular are alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride or dichloroethane, cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, esters such as, for example, ethyl acetate, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene or toluene, or alternatively mixtures thereof and the like. To suppress possible ketal formation when working in alcohols as solvents, up to 10% by volume of water can be added. The substrate concentrations are preferably 5 to 50% by volume, in particular 20 to 40% by volume. The reactions can preferably be carried out at temperatures from approximately 10 C. to 120 C., in particular from approximately 20 C. to 70 C. and under a hydrogen pressure from approximately 1 to 100 bar, in particular from 4 to 50 bar. In general, the reaction times are 2 to 48 hours, usually 6 to 24 hours. The molar ratio between ruthenium in the complexes V to XI and the compounds III to be hydrogenated is expediently between approximately 0.001 and approximately 5 mol %, preferably between approximately 0.005 and approximately 0.2 mol %. Under the abovementioned conditions, according to the invention compounds of the formula IV can also be asymmetrically hydrogenated in the presence of the optically active ruthenium-diphosphine complexes of the formulae V to XI, the reaction preferably being carried out in alcohols or mixtures of the abovementioned organic solvents and at least 1, preferably 4 to 10, mol of alcohol, based on the compound IV to be hydrogenated, and at temperatures from approximately 40 C. to 120 C., in particular from approximately 50 C. to 100 C. In the reaction products I, the radical R 2 is then defined by the corresponding alcohol employed. In the reaction, the desired enantiomer of the formula I can be obtained by selection of the optically active diphosphine ligands of the formula XII with the appropriate configuration. Thus, for example, the use of (R)-()-BINAP leads to products of the formula (R)-I, the use of (S)-()-BINAP to products of the formula (S)-I. According to the invention, chirally modified Raney nickel complexes can also be used as catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation. These complexes can be prepared by methods known per se (T. Harada et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1994, 67, 2473; A. Tai et al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. 1991, 795; H. Brunner et al., Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1990, 1, 159; T. Harada et al., Chem. Lett. 1980, 1125; T. Harada and Y. Izumi, Chem. Lett. 1978, 1195). In this case, Raney nickel complexes treated with enantiomerically pure tartaric acid with addition of sodium bromide prove to be particularly suitable, ultrasonically treated Raney nickel being preferably employed for the formation of the catalyst complex. The asymmetric hydrogenation of the compounds of the formula III in the presence of the optically active nickel-tartaric acid complexes described above can be carried out in suitable organic solvents which are inert under the reaction conditions. Those which can be mentioned in particular are alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride or dichloroethane, cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, esters such as, for example, ethyl acetate or propionic acid esters, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene or toluene, or alternatively mixtures thereof and the like. The solvent or solvent mixture used can contain up to 10% by volume, preferably 0.05 to 2% by volume, of a carboxylic acid, in particular acetic acid. The substrate concentrations are preferably 5 to 60% by volume, in particular 30 to 50% by volume. The reactions can preferably be carried out at temperatures from approximately 20 C. to 140 C., in particular from approximately 70 C. to 100 C. and under a hydrogen pressure from approximately 1 to 100 bar, in particular from 20 to 80 bar. In general, the reaction times are 2 to 48 hours, usually 6 to 36 hours. The molar ratio between nickel in the complexes and the compounds III to be hydrogenated is expediently between approximately 0.01 and approximately 50 mol %, preferably between approximately 1 and approximately 20 mol %. Under the abovementioned conditions, according to the invention compounds of the formula IV can also be asymmetrically hydrogenated in the presence of the optically active nickel-tartaric acid complexes, the reaction preferably being carried out in alcohols or mixtures of abovementioned organic solvents and at least 1, preferably 4 to 10, mol of alcohol, based on the compound to be hydrogenated. In the reaction products I, the radical R 2 is then defined by the corresponding alcohol employed. In the reaction, the desired enantiomer of the formula I can be obtained by selection of the optically active tartaric acid with the appropriate configuration in the preparation of the catalyst complex. Thus the use of (R,R)-()-tartaric acid leads to products of the formula (R)-I, the use of (S,S)-()-tartaric acid to products of the formula (S)-I. The compounds I are used for the preparation of the enantiomerically pure -lipoic acids of the formula II, by reducing them in a known manner (EP 0487986 A2, 14.11.91) to the compounds XIV, where R 1 is a C 1 -C 20 -alkyl group, C 3 -C 12 -cycloalkyl group, C 7 -C 12 -aralkyl group or a mono- or binuclear aryl group and these a) are converted into the bis-sulphonic acid ester of XIV in organic solution using a sulphonyl chloride and a tertiary nitrogen base, b) this compound is reacted in a polar solvent with sulphur and an alkali metal sulphide to give the -lipoic acid ester and c) this ester is converted, if desired, into the respective pure enantiomer of -lipoic acid. In this case, starting from the compounds (R)-I (S)-()--lipoic acid and, starting from the compounds (S)-I, (R)-()--lipoic acid is obtained. The compounds (R)-I and (S)-I and also (R)-()-II and (S)-()-II prepared by the processes according to the invention as a rule have a high enantiomeric excess, corresponding to an optical yield of 70 to 99%. The enantiomer ratios are measured directly by means of chiral HPLC on optically active columns. The present invention enables the enantiomerically pure 3-hydroxyoctanedioic acid diesters of the general formula I (R 1 , R 2 C 1 -C 20 -alkyl, C 3 -C 12 -cycloalkyl, C 7 -C 12 -aralkyl and/or mono- or binuclear aryl) to be made available in an economical manner in high chemical and optical yields as intermediates for the preparation of the enantiomerically pure -lipoic acids of the formula II. The following examples illustrate the invention without restricting it. EXAMPLE 1 43.5 mg (0.087 mmol) of RuCl 2 (C 6 H 6 ) 2 , 113.7 mg (0.183 mmol) of (R)-BINAP and 3 ml of dimethylformamide were added under argon to a 20 ml Schlenk vessel. The reddish-brown suspension was heated to 100 C. for 10 min. The now clear solution was cooled and concentrated in vacuo (1 to 0.1 mm Hg) at 50 C. with vigorous stirring over a period of 1 h.

Example 12 Raney nickel (W1 type) prepared from 3.8 g of an Ni/Al alloy (Ni/Al - 42/58) was treated in a glass flask for 3 min. in an ultrasonic bath (48 kHz) after addition of 40 ml of water. The supernatant turbid solution was decanted off by immobilizing the paramagnetic nickel on the bottom of the vessel with the aid of a magnet. This process was repeated twice. 2.4 g of (R,R)-()-tartaric acid and 24 g of sodium bromide were dissolved in 240 ml of water and the solution was adjusted to pH3.2 by addition of 1M NaOH. The solution was then heated in a boiling water bath. Half of the hot solution was added to the ultrasonically-treated Raney nickel and kept at 100 C. for 30 min. The supernatant solution was then decanted off and the catalyst complex was washed with 20 ml of water. The catalyst complex was then again suspended in the other half of the (R,R)-()-tartaric acid/sodium bromide solution and treated as described before. The supernatant solution was then decanted off and the catalyst complex was washed twice each with 20 ml of water, 20 ml of methanol, 20 ml of tetrahydrofuran and 20 ml of the solvent used in the hydrogenation. The (R,R)-()-tartaric acid-Raney nickel catalyst complex thus obtained was employed in the asymmetric hydrogenations as a suspension in the respective solvent. Example 13 Raney nickel (W1 type) prepared from 3.8 g of an Ni/Al alloy (Ni/Al - 42/58) was treated in a glass flask for 3 min. in an ultrasonic bath (48 kHz) after addition of 40 ml of water. The supernatant turbid solution was decanted off by immobilizing the paramagnetic nickel on the bottom of the vessel with the aid of a magnet. This process was repeated twice. 2.4 g of (S,S)-()-tartaric acid and 24 g of sodium bromide were dissolved in 240 ml of water and the solution was adjusted to pH3.2 by addition of 1M NaOH. The solution was then heated in a boiling water bath. Half of the hot solution was added to the ultrasonically-treated Raney nickel and kept at 100 C. for 30 min. The supernatant solution was then decanted off and the catalyst complex was washed with 20 ml of water. The catalyst complex was then again suspended in the other half of the (S,S)-()-tartaric acid/sodium bromide solution and treated as described before. The supernatant solution was then decanted off and the catalyst complex was washed twice each with 20 ml of water, 20 ml of methanol, 20 ml of tetrahydrofuran and 20 ml of the solvent used in the hydrogenation. The (S,S)-()-tartaric acid-Raney nickel catalyst complex thus obtained was employed in the asymmetric hydrogenations as a suspension in the respective solvent. Example 14 A 100 ml autoclave was loaded with 10.8 g (0.05 mol) of dimethyl 3-oxooctanedioate, with 0.9 g of the (R,R)-()-tartaric acid-Raney nickel catalyst prepared under Example 12, with 25 ml of methyl propionate and with 0.25 ml of acetic acid. The hydrogenation was carried out at 80 C., a constant pressure of 65 bar of pure H 2 and with intensive stirring for 24 hours. After completion of the reaction, 50 ml of diethyl ether were added, the catalyst complex was separated off by filtration, the filtrate was washed with aqueous sodium carbonate solution and the solvent was distilled off on a rotary evaporator. 10.6 g (97%) of dimethyl (R)-3-hydroxyoctanedioate (content: 98%) having an enantiomeric excess of 88% (chiral HPLC) were obtained. Example 15 A 100 ml autoclave was loaded with 10.8 g (0.05 mol) of dimethyl 3-oxooctanedioate, with 0.9 g of the (S,S)-()-tartaric acid-Raney nickel catalyst prepared under Example 13, with 25 ml of methyl propionate and with 0.25 ml of acetic acid. The hydrogenation was carried out at 90 C., a constant pressure of 60 bar of pure H and with intensive stirring for 18 hours. After completion of the reaction, 50 ml of diethyl ether were added, the catalyst complex was separated off by filtration, the filtrate was washed with aqueous sodium carbonate solution and the solvent was distilled off on a rotary evaporator. 10.7 g (98%) of dimethyl (S)-3-hydroxyoctanedioate (content: 97%) having an enantiomeric excess of 89% (chiral HPLC) were obtained. Example 16 A 100 ml autoclave was loaded with 11.5 g (0.05 mol) of 1-ethyl 8-methyl 3-oxooctanedioate, with 0.9 g of the (R,R)-()-tartaric acid-Raney nickel catalyst prepared under Example 12, with 25 ml of methyl propionate and with 0.25 ml of acetic acid. The hydrogenation was carried out at 90 C., a constant pressure of 75 bar of pure H 2 and with intensive stirring for 18 hours. After completion of the reaction, 50 ml of diethyl ether were added, the catalyst complex was separated off by filtration, the filtrate was washed with aqueous sodium carbonate solution and the solvent was distilled off on a rotary evaporator. 11.2 g (97%) of 1-ethyl 8-methyl (R)-3-hydroxyoctanedioate (content: 98%) having an enantiomeric excess of 85% (chiral HPLC) were obtained. Example 17 A 100 ml autoclave was loaded with 12.2 g (0.05 mol) of diethyl 3-oxooctanedioate, with 0.9 g of the (S,S)-()-tartaric acid-Raney nickel catalyst prepared under Example 13, with 25 ml of methyl propionate and with 0.25 ml of acetic acid. The hydrogenation was carried out at 80 C., a constant pressure of 50 bar of pure H 2 and with intensive stirring for 24 hours. After completion of the reaction, 50 ml of diethyl ether were added, the catalyst complex was separated off by filtration, the filtrate was washed with aqueous sodium carbonate solution and the solvent was distilled off on a rotary evaporator. 11.9 g (97%) of diethyl (S)-3-hydroxyoctanedioate (content: 97%) having an enantiomeric excess of 86% (chiral HPLC) were obtained. Example 18 A 100 ml autoclave was loaded with 14.3 g (0.05 mol) of methyl 6-(2,2-dimethyl-4,6-dioxo-1,3-dioxan-5-ylidene)-6-hydroxyhexanoate, with 1.9 g of the (R,R)-()-tartaric acid-Raney nickel catalyst prepared under Example 12, with 25 ml of ethyl acetate and with 5 ml of methanol. The hydrogenation was carried out at 90 C., a constant pressure of 80 bar of pure H 2 and with intensive stirring for 24 hours. After completion of the reaction, 50 ml of diethyl ether were added, the catalyst complex was separated off by filtration, the filtrate was washed with aqueous sodium carbonate solution and the solvent was distilled off on a rotary evaporator. 10.4 g (95%) of dimethyl (R)-3-hydroxyoctanedioate (content: 95%) having an enantiomeric excess of 82% (chiral HPLC) were obtained. Example 19 A 100 ml autoclave was loaded with 14.3 g (0.05 mol) of methyl 6-(2,2-dimethyl-4,6-dioxo-1,3-dioxan-5-ylidene)-6-hydroxyhexanoate, with 1.9 g of the (S,S)-()-tartaric acid-Raney nickel catalyst prepared under Example 13, with 25 ml of ethyl acetate and with 5 ml of ethanol.
