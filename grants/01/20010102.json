It has therefore been demanded to develop a new antitumor agent having a different mechanism of action from that of 5-FU drugs which is more efficacious than 5-FU drugs and is effective on 5-FU-resistant tumors as well. An object of the present invention is to provide a potent antitumor agent which has a novel chemical structure not heretofore reported and exhibits efficacy on 5-FU-resistant tumors as well.

Addition of Alkyl Group Where R 5 is not a hydrogen atom, a corresponding compound (IX) can be obtained by reacting compound (VIII) with an alkyl metal compound. The alkyl addition reaction can be conducted in a customarily employed manner. For example, compound (VIII) is treated with an alkyllithium or an alkylmagnesium halide. Suitable alkyl metal compounds include alkyllithiums, such as methyllithium and ethyllithium, and alkylmagnesium halides, such as methylmagnesium iodide and ethylmagnesium bromide. The reaction can be performed in the presence of a solvent, such as an ether solvent, e.g., diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, a hydrocarbon solvent, e.g., hexane, pentane, benzene, toluene or xylene, or a mixture thereof. The reaction is executed usually at a temperature of 78 to 100 C., preferably 78 C. to room temperature, for a period of 5 minutes to 120 hours, preferably 30 minutes to 48 hours. Substitution with Amino Group The hydroxy group of compound (IX) is once changed to a releasable group, such as a halogen atom or a sulfonic ester group, and then the resulting derivative of compound (IX) is reacted with a basic compound, such as substituted piperazine, to obtain compound (X). Conversion of a hydroxy group to a releasable group, such as a halogen atom or a sulfonic ester group, can be effected in a usual manner. For example, halogenation is achieved by treating with a phosphorus trihalide, a phosphorus pentahalide, etc. in a solvent, e.g., dichloromethane or chloroform; or treating with a Vilsmeier reagent, such as N,N-dimethylchloroforminium chloride or bromide, in a solvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide or dioxane. Sulfonylation can be conducted by, for example, treating with methanesulfonyl chloride, p-toluenesulfonyl chloride, etc. in a solvent in the presence of an appropriate base. The substitution reaction between the resulting derivative of compound (IX) and a basic compound (e.g., substituted piperazine) can be performed in a conventional manner. For example, a mixture of the derivative of compound (IX) and a basic compound (e.g., substituted piperazine) is heated in a solvent (e.g., acetonitrile) in the presence of a base (e.g., potassium carbonate) to give compound (X). Removal of Protective Group The hydroxy-protective group of compound (X) can be removed under conditions known for the protective group used. Dehydration Dehydration of compound (XI) gives compound (I). The dehydration can be conducted in a known manner, for example, by heating in the presence of an acid. Either organic acids or inorganic acids can be used. Examples of useful inorganic acids are hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, and potassium hydrogensulfate. Examples of useful organic acids are p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, and oxalic acid. Inorganic acids are preferred to organic ones. In addition, alumina is also useful. A solvent may be used in the dehydration. Suitable solvents include amide solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, acetamide, and dimethylacetamide; halogenated hydrocarbons, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, and carbon tetrachloride; ethers, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, and dioxane; aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, and xylene; and mixtures thereof. The reaction is conducted usually at 20 to 150 C., preferably 0 to 100 C., for 5 minutes to 72 hours, preferably 10 minutes to 24 hours. Compound (I) in which the alkenyl group moiety is trans can be synthesized according to process D shown below. wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , Q, Z, and Z are as defined above; R 6 represents a hydrogen atom, a carboxyl group, an alkoxycarbonyl group, a chlorine atom, a bromine atom or an iodine atom; and R 7 represents an alkoxycarbonyl group, a carbamoyl group or a cyano group. That is, compound (IIa) and compound (XIII) are condensed to obtain compound (XII). Compound (XII) and a basic compound HGZ are reacted (reductive aminated) to give compound (I). Compound (XII) where R 5 is a hydrogen atom is also obtainable by condensing compound (IIa) and compound (XIV) to obtain compound (XV) and reducing compound (XV). Each reaction included in process D will be described below in detail. Condensation The condensation reaction of compound (IIa) into compound (XII) or (XV) can be carried out by the condensation generally employed in the art. For example, compound (IIa) and compound (XIII) or (XIV) are subjected to Aldol condensation; or compound (IIa) and a phosphonium salt synthesized from compound (XIII) or (XIV) are subjected to Wittig reaction; or compound (IIa) and an alkylphosphorous diester synthesized from compound (XIII) or (XIV) to Wittig-Horner reaction. Phosphonium salts synthesized from compound (XIII) or (XIV) include a triphenylphosphonium salt and a tri-n-butylphosphonium salt. Alkylphosphorous diesters synthesized from compound (XIII) or (XIV) include dimethyl alkylphosphites, diethyl alkylphosphites, and diphenyl alkylphosphites. Reduction Compound (XII) in which R 5 is a hydrogen atom can be obtained by treating compound (XV) in a solvent in the presence of a reducing agent. Where the reduction proceeds to give a corresponding alcohol, the resulting alcohol is oxidized to obtain compound (XII). Suitable reducing agents include those generally used for 1,2-reduction of an ,-unsaturated carbonyl compound, such as diisobutylaluminum hydride or lithium aluminum hydride. Reductive Amination Reductive amination can be conducted in the same manner as described above.

system as a whole being optionally substituted; X represents CH or N; and L is absent, or represents a cyclic group of formula Ia, or represents a chain of formula Ib, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are useful in therapy, in particular in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. This invention relates to novel compounds useful in therapy, particularly in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. International Patent Application WO 89/05297 discloses a number of substituted quinazoline compounds which are indicated as inhibitors of gastric acid secretion. International Patent Application WO 97/23462 (published after the priority date of this application) discloses quinoline and quinazoline compounds having a 5-phenyl substituent. The compounds are indicated in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. According to the present invention, there is provided a compound of formula I, wherein R 1 represents C 1-4 alkoxy optionally substituted by one or more fluorine atoms; R 2 represents H or C 1-6 alkoxy optionally substituted by one or more fluorine atoms; R 3 represents a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring containing at least one heteroatom selected from N, O and S, the ring being optionally substituted by one or more groups selected from halogen, C 1-4 alkoxy, C 1-4 alkyl and CF 3 ; R 4 represents a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered heterocyclic ring containing at least one heteroatom selected from N, O and S, the ring being optionally fused to a benzene ring or a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring containing at least one heteroatom selected from N, O and S, the ring system as a whole being optionally substituted by one or more groups independently selected from OH, C 1-4 alkyl, C 1-4 alkoxy, halogen, CONR 8 R 9 , SO 2 NR 8 R 9 , (CH 2 ) b NR 8 R 9 and NHSO 2 (C 1-4 alkyl), and when S is a member of the ring system, it may be substituted by one or two oxygen atoms; R 8 and R 9 independently represent H or C 1-4 alkyl, or together with the N atom to which they are attached they may represent a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring containing at least one heteroatom selected from N, O and S; b represents 0, 1, 2 or 3; X represents CH or N; and L is absent, or represents a cyclic group of formula Ia, in which N is attached to the 2-position of the quinoline or quinazoline ring; A is absent or represents CO or SO 2 ; Z represents CH or N; m represents 1 or 2, and in addition, when Z represents CH, it may represent 0; and n represents 1, 2 or 3, provided that the sum of m and n is 2, 3, 4 or 5; or represents a chain of formula Ib, in which N is attached to the 2-position of the quinoline or quinazoline ring; A and Z have the same significance as A and Z above, respectively; R 6 and R 7 independently represent H or C 1-4 alkyl; and p represents 1, 2 or 3, and in addition, when Z represents CH, it may represent 0; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (referred to together herein as the compounds of the invention). Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include acid addition salts, such as hydrochloride and hydrobromide salts, and phosphate salts. Alkyl and alkoxy groups that R 1-4 may represent or include can be straight chain, branched chain, cyclic, or a combination thereof. Preferably, R 3 is an aromatic ring, for example pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, thienyl, furanyl or oxazolyl. Heterocyclic groups that R 4 comprises may be saturated or unsaturated. However, it is preferred that the ring attached to L, or when L is absent, to the quinoline or quinazoline ring, is saturated. The compounds of the invention may be optically active. In particular, they may exhibit atropisomerism about the bond joining R 3 to the rest of the molecule when an R 3 substituent is in the ortho-position of the ring. The invention includes all optical isomers of the compounds of formula I, and all diastereoisomers thereof. Preferred groups of compounds that may be mentioned include those in which: (a) R 1 represents methoxy; (b) R 2 represents methoxy; (c) R 3 represents 2-pyridinyl or 2-pyrimidinyl; (d) R 4 comprises a saturated 6-membered N-containing ring which is fused to a benzene or pyridine ring; for example R 4 may be a saturated 6-membered N-containing ring which is fused to a benzene ring substituted by NHSO 2 (C 1-4 alkyl); (e) X represents N; and (f) L is absent. According to the invention, there is also provided a process for the production of a compound of the invention, which comprises: (a) when X represents CH, cyclizing a compound of formula X, in which R 1-4 and L are as defined above; (b) when A or A is present, and Z or Z represents N, reacting a compound of formula XIIIa or XIIIb, as appropriate, in which R 1-3 , R 6 , R 7 , X, m, n and p are as defined above, with a compound of formula XIV, in which R 4 is as defined above, A represents CO or SO 2 and Lg represents a leaving group; (c) reacting a compound of formula XVIII, in which R 1 , R 2 , R 4 , X and L are as defined above, with a compound of formula XIX, R 3 MXIX in which R 3 is as defined above and M represents substituted boron, zinc or tin, in the presence of a palladium catalyst; (d) when X represents N, reacting a compound of formula XXII, in which R 1-3 are as defined above, with a compound of formula XXIIIa or XXIIIb, as appropriate, in which R 4 , R 6 , R 7 , A, A, Z, Z, m, n and p are as defined above; (e) when A or A represents CO and R 4 comprises a nucleophilic nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic ring attached to L, reacting a compound of formula XXVIIIa or XXVIIIb, as appropriate, in which R 1-3 , R 6 , R 7 , X, Z, Z, m, n and p are as defined above, and Lg is a leaving group, with a compound of formula XXIX, HR 4a XXIX in which R 4a represents the groups defined by R 4 above which contain a nucleophilic nitrogen atom in the ring, this nucleophilic nitrogen atom being attached to H; (f) conversion of a compound of formula I in which L represents a cyclic group of formula Ia, to a corresponding compound of formula I in which L represents a chain of formula Ib in which R 6 and R 7 each represent H, by the action of a strong base; (g) when A or A is absent and Z or Z represents N, reacting a compound of formula XIIIa or XIIIb, as defined above, with a compound of formula XXX, R 4 HalXXX in which R 4 is as defined above and Hal represents a halogen atom attached to the ring; or (h) when X represents N, L is absent and R 4 comprises a nucleophilic nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic ring attached to the quinoline or quinazoline ring, reacting a compound of formula XXII, as defined above, with a compound of formula XXIX, as defined above; and where desired or necessary converting the resulting compound of formula I into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or vice versa. In process (a), the cyclization may be carried out in the presence of a strong base (for example lithium diisopropylamide) in a solvent which does not adversely affect the reaction (for example tetrahydrofuran) around room temperature and quenched with water. In a variation, it may be performed using potassium hydroxide in a solvent such as DMSO at an elevated temperature. Alternatively, it may be performed using zinc chloride in a solvent which does not adversely affect the reaction (for example tetrahydrofuran), at the reflux temperature of the solvent. In process (b), suitable leaving groups are OH and Cl. When the compound of formula XIV is a carboxylic acid, the reaction may be carried out in the presence of conventional coupling agents for example 1-hydroxybenz6triazole monohydrate, 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride and 4-methylmorpholine in a solvent which does not adversely affect the reaction (for example CH 2 Cl 2 ) at or around room temperature. When the leaving group is Cl, the reaction may be carried out in a solvent which does not adversely affect the reaction (for example CH 2 Cl 2 ) around 0 C. In process (c), the palladium catalyst may be tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium. M may be B(OH) 2 , B(CH 2 CH 2 ) 2 , Sn(CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 ) 3 or ZnCl. The reaction may be carried out in a solvent which does not adversely affect the reaction (for example, when M is B(OH) 2 , a mixture of toluene, ethanol and 1M aqueous sodium carbonate) at an elevated temperature (for example the reflux temperature of the solvent). Optionally, when M represents ZnCl or substituted Sn, copper(I) iodide may be used as a co-catalyst.

Compounds of formulae XI, XII, XIV, XVIIa, XVIIb, XIX, XXI, XXIIa, XXIIb, XXIIIa, XXIIIb, XXVI, XXIX and XXX are either known or are available using known techniques, as illustrated by the Examples. The intermediate compounds of formulae X, XIIIa, XIIIb, XXII, XXVIIIa and XXVIIIb form a further aspect of the invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that sensitive functional groups may need to be protected and deprotected during synthesis of a compound of the invention. This may be achieved by conventional techniques, for example as described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by T W Greene and P G M Wuts, John Wiley and Sons Inc. 1991. The compounds of the invention are useful because they possess pharmacological activity in animals. In particular, the compounds are useful in the treatment of a number of conditions including hypertension, myocardial infarction, male erectile dysfunction, hyperlipidaemia, cardiac arrhythmia and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The latter condition is of greatest interest. Thus, according to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia which comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention to a patient suffering from such a disorder. The use of the compounds of the invention as pharmaceuticals, and the use of the compounds of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, are also provided. The compounds of the invention may be administered by any convenient route, for example orally, parenterally (e.g intravenously, transdermally) or rectally. The daily dose required will of course vary with the particular compound used, the particular condition being treated and with the severity of that condition. However, in general a total daily dose of from about 0.01 to 10 mg/kg of body weight, and preferably about 0.05 to 1 mg/kg, is suitable, administered from 1 to 4 times a day. Oral administration is of particular interest. The compounds of the invention will generally be administered in the form of a suitable pharmaceutical formulation. Thus, according to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation including preferably less than 50% by weight of a compound of the invention in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. The pharmaceutical formulation is preferably in unit dose form. Such forms include solid dosage forms, for example tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, and suppositories for oral, parenteral or rectal administration; and liquid dosage forms, for example sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, suitably flavoured syrups, flavoured emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil and peanut oil, and elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Solid formulations may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with pharmaceutical carriers, for example conventional tabletting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, gums and other diluents, for example water, to form a homogeneous preformulation formulation in which the active ingredient is uniformly dispersed so that it may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms containing typically from 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient. The solid dosage forms may be coated or otherwise compounded to prolong the action of the formulation. The formulations of the invention may also contain a human 5- reductase inhibitory compound see International Patent Application WO 95/28397, or a compound of the invention could be presented in a pharmaceutical pack also containing a human 5- reductase inhibitory compound as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use. The compounds of the invention may be tested in the screens set out below. Contractile Responses of Human Prostate Prostatic tissue was cut into longitudinal strips (approximately 3210 mm) and suspended in organ baths under a resting tension of 1 g in Krebs Ringer bicarbonate of the following composition (mM): NaCl (119), KCl (4.7), CaCl 2 (2.5), KH 2 PO 4 (1.2), MgSO 4 (1.2), NaHCO 3 (25), glucose (11), and gassed with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 . The solution also contained 10 mM cocaine and 10 mM corticosterone. Tissues were exposed to a sensitising dose of ()-noradrenaline (100 mM) and washed over a 45 minute period. Isometric contractions were obtained in response to cumulative additions of ()-noradrenaline to obtain control curves in all tissues. A further curve was then generated in the presence or absence of antagonist (incubated for 2 hours). Antagonist affinity estimates (pA 2 ) were determined using a single concentration of competing antagonist, pA 2 log A/(DR-1) where the dose ratio (DR), relative to corresponding controls, was produced by a single concentration of antagonist A, assuming competitive antagonism and Schild regression close to unity. Anaesthetised Dog Model of Prostatic Pressure and Blood Pressure Mature male beagles (12-15 kg body weight) were anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbitone (30-50 mg/kg i.v.) and a tracheal cannula was inserted. Subsequent anaesthesia was maintained using pentobarbitone infusion. The animals were respirated with air using a Bird Mk8 respirator (Bird Corp., Palm Springs, Calif., USA) adjusted to maintain blood gasses in the range pO 2 90-110 mm Hg, pCO 2 35-45 mm Hg, pH 7.35-7.45. Body temperature was maintained at 36-37.5 C. using a heated operating table. Catheters were placed into the left femoral artery for recording blood pressure and into the left femoral vein for compound administration. Heart rate was recorded via the lead II E.C.G. A laparotomy was performed to cannulate both ureters to prevent change of fluid volume within the bladder. A 7F cardiac catheter (with a 1.5 ml capacity balloon tip) was inserted into the bladder via the urethra. The balloon was filled with air and the catheter withdrawn until the balloon became lodged in the prostate, which was confirmed by digital pressure. Balloon pressure was recorded via a Druck transducer. Prostatic pressure and haemodynamic parameters were made on a Grass Polygraph (Grass Instruments, Quincy, Mass., U.S.A.) and the data measured on line using a Motorola 68000-based microcomputer system (Motorola Inc., Temple, Ariz., U.S.A.). Compounds were made up in PEG 300 and administered i.v. through a catheter in the femoral vein. Responses to phenylephrine (1-16 g/kg i.v. in saline) were obtained to generate control dose-response curves (two control curves for each experiment). Compounds were administered (in terms of compound base) at 10-300 g/kg i.v. 5 min before construction of phenylephrine curves (constructed up to a maximum dose of 128 g/kg in the presence of test compound). Due to 1 -related dysrhythymic properties of phenylephrine, absolute maximal responses were not obtained but were taken as 10% greater than the control response obtained with 16 g/kg phenylephrine. Drug concentrations were calculated on the basis of molar weight of compound/kg body weight thus allowing a pseudo pA 2 calculation by Schild analysis using dose ratios derived from shifts in the phenylephrine dose-response curves. The compounds of the invention may have the advantage that they are more potent, have a longer duration of action, have a broader range of activity, are more stable, have fewer side effects or are more selective (in particular they may have beneficial effects in benign prostatic hyperplasia without causing undesirable cardiovascular effects, for example because they are able to selectively antagonise prostatic receptor subtypes of the 1 -adrenoceptor), or have other more useful properties than the compounds of the prior art.

Aminoguanidine compounds can be used as therapeutically effective agents against a variety of diseases of the nervous system such as diabetic and toxic neuropathies, peripheral nervous system diseases, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, stroke, Huntingtons disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, motor neuron disease, traumatic nerve injury, multiple sclerosis, dysmyelination and demyelination disorders, and mitochondrial diseases. The aminoguanidine compounds which can be used in the present method include (1) aminoguanidine and diaminoguanidine analogs which can act as substrates or substrate analogs for creatine kinase; (2) bisubstrate inhibitors of creatine kinase comprising covalently linked structural analogs of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and aminoguanidine; (3) aminoguanidine analogs which can act as reversible or irreversible inhibitors of creatine kinase; and (4) N-phosphoroaminoguanidine analogs bearing nontransferable moieties which mimic the N-phosphoryl group.", "related_docs": [], "pct_data": [],

This application is a 371 of PCT/JP98/04780, filed Oct. 22, 1988. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to novel derivatives of antibiotic erythromycin A. BACKGROUND ART Erythromycin A is an antibiotic widely used as an agent for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by Gram-positive bacteria, mycoplasmas, etc. However, erythromycin A is decomposed by gastric acid due to its instability to acids, and thus has a drawback of no constancy of movement in the body. Hitherto many erythromycin derivatives have been prepared for the purpose of the improvement of such biological or pharmaceutically effective properties. For example, it is reported that 6-O-methylerythromycin A derivatives have an improved stability to acids and have a superior in vivo antibacterial activity in comparison with erythromycin A when administered orally (U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,803). There are also recent reports relating to 11,12-cyclic carbamate derivatives obtained from 6-O-methylerythromycin A as a starting material with the aim of expansion of antibacterial spectrum as well as a stability to acids (EP. Patent No. 487411, U.S. Pat. No. 4,742,049). In addition, the present inventors have reported the antibacterial activity of the ester derivatives esterified at the 3-position (EP. Patent No. 619320). An object of the present invention is to provide post-generational macrolide antibiotics having a strong antibacterial activity not only against previous erythromycin-sensitive bacteria but also against erythromycin-resistant bacteria which recently show a tendency to increase. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present inventors have found that the compounds wherein a certain substituted aminoalkyl group or a certain alkyl group having an arylsulfonamide group has been introduced into the hydroxyl group formed by the reduction of the carbonyl group at the 9-position of erythromycin A have a strong antibacterial activity not only against sensitive bacteria but also resistant bacteria, thereby the present invention has been accomplished. The present invention relates to an erythromycin A derivative represented by the formula: wherein n is an integer of from 1 to 8, R 1 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, R 2 is a pyridylmethyl group, a quinolylmethyl group, a pyridylsulfonyl group or a quinolylsulfonyl group, R 3 is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or a cinnamyl group, R 4 is a cladinosyloxy group or a group represented by the formula: wherein m is 0 or 1, R 5 is a pyridyl group, a quinolyl group, a phenyl group, a phenyl group substituted with one, two or three members selected from alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a nitro group, alkoxy groups having 1 to 3 carbon atoms and halogen atoms, or a pyridyl or quinolyl group substituted with one or two members selected from alkyl groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a nitro group, alkoxy groups having 1 to 3 carbon atoms and halogen atoms; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In the present invention, examples of the alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms are a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, a butyl group, a pentyl group, a hexyl group, an isopropyl group, an isobutyl group, a t-butyl group, an isopentyl group and a cyclohexyl group; examples of the alkoxy group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms are a methoxy group, an ethoxy group, a propoxy group and an isopropoxy group; and the halogen atom refers to a fluorine atom, a chlorine atom, a bromine atom or an iodine atom. The pharmaceutically acceptable salt refers to a salt used in chemotherapy or prophylaxis of bacterially infectious diseases. It includes, for example, a salt with an acid such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, stearic acid, succinic acid, ethylsuccinic acid, lactobionic acid, gluconic acid, glucoheptonic acid, benzoic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, laurylsulfuric acid, malic acid, aspartic acid, glutaminic acid, adipic acid, cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydroiodic acid, nicotinic acid, oxalic acid, picric acid, thiocyanic acid, undecanoic acid, polyacrylate or carboxyvinyl polymer. The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the bellow-mentioned examples. The erythromycin A derivatives of the present invention can be administered orally or parenterally. They can be administered in a dosage form such as tablets, capsules, powders, troches, ointments, suspensions, suppositories or injectional preparations, all of which can be prepared by ordinary preparation techniques. The dose is from 100 to 1,000 mg per day for the treatment of adults, and it can be administered once or in several divided portions. This dose can be properly increased or decreased depending on the age, body weight and conditions of the patient.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compounds useful for inhibiting a retrovirus in a human cell infected with said retrovirus. More particularly, the present invention provides pyran-2-ones, 5,6-dihydropyran-2-ones, 4-hydroxy-benzopyran-2-ones, 4-hydroxy-cycloalkylbpyran-2-ones, and derivatives thereof as HIV-proteinase inhibitors. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION During the past decade, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has progressed from having the status of a medical curiosity afflicting only a small number of individuals to a problem of major proportions, both medically and economically. John Saunders and Richard Storer, New Developments in RT Inhibitors, DNP 5(3), April 1992, pages 153-169. WHO figures reveal that more than 360,000 cases of AIDS have been reported worldwide, including nearly 175,000 cases in the U.S.A. Of these, approximately 100,000 worldwide (50,000 in the U.S.A.) were reported in the preceding 12-month period. In the U.S.A., the number of seropositive individuals is thought to be approximately two million, and estimates suggest that 5-10 million people worldwide may be seropositive. Saunders and Storer, page 153. Since the first description of the malady in the early part of this decade, acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome (AIDS) and its devastating consequences have been subjects of continuous and intense coverage in both the lay and scientific press. Indeed, an edition of Scientific American was entirely devoted to AIDS (Scientific American 289, 4 (1988)), and the literature on the disease and the virus is already so vast as to defy thorough citation. On Mar. 20, 1987, the FDA approved the use of the compound, zidovudine (AZT), to treat AIDS patients with a recent initial episode of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, AIDS patients with conditions other than pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or patients infected with the virus with an absolute CD4 lymphocyte count of less than 200/mm 3 in the peripheral blood. AZT is a known inhibitor of viral reverse transcriptase, an enzyme necessary for human immunodeficiency virus replication. U.S. Pat. No. 4,724,232 claims a method of treating humans having acquired immunodeficiency syndrome utilizing 3-azido-3-deoxy-thymidine (azidothymidine, AZT). Following the discovery of the anti-HIV activity of AZT, much effort has been focused on a wide variety of other dideoxynucleoside analogues in the search for superior agents. In the case of the 2.3-dideoxy series, ddC and ddI have shown potent activity against HIV in vitro and have been evaluated in clinical trials. Saunders and Storer, page 160. The compound ddC is currently being developed by Hoffman-La Roche Co. as a potential anti-AIDS drug. Its limiting toxicity in humans is peripheral neuropathy which is reversible at low doses. Raymond R. Schinazi, Jan R. Mead and Paul M. Feorino, Insights Into HIV Chemotherapy, AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses, Vol. 8, Number 6, 1992, pages 963-990. It has been approved by the FDA for AIDS therapy in combination with AZT. The compound ddI has also been evaluated in clinical trials. Its limiting toxicities are peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis. It has also been shown to stimulate hepatic glycolysis leading to irreversible liver damage. Schinazi, Mead and Feorino, page 966. It has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of HIV-1 infections in adults and pediatric patients who are intolerant to or whose health has significantly deteriorated while on AZT treatment. Schinazi, Mead and Feorino, page 966. Among these approved drugs, AZT is currently the only drug that has been shown to decrease the mortality and frequency of opportunistic infections associated with AIDS. Schinazi, Mead and Feorino, page 963. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has long been recognized as the causative agent in AIDS, although a minority opinion to the contrary has been expressed (e.g., P. Duesberg, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 86:755-764 (1989)). Sequence analysis of the complete genomes from several infective and non-infective HIV-isolates has shed considerable light on the make-up of the virus and the types of molecules that are essential for its replication and maturation to an infective species. The HIV protease is essential for the processing of the viral gag and gag-pol polypeptides into mature virion proteins. L. Ratner, et al., Nature, 313:277-284 (1985); L. H. Pearl and W. R. Taylor, Nature, 329:351 (1987). HIV exhibits the same gag/pol/env organization seen in other retroviruses. L. Ratner, et al., above; S. Wain-Hobson, et al., Cell, 40:9-17 (1985); R. Sanchez-Pescador, et al., Science, 227:484-492 (1985); and M. A. Muesing, et al., Nature, 313:450-458 (1985). Reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme unique to retroviruses that catalyzes the conversion of viral RNA into double stranded DNA. Blockage at any point during the transcription process, by AZT or any other aberrant deoxynucleoside triphosphate incapable of elongation, should have dramatic consequences relative to viral replication. Much work on the RT target is in progress based, in large measure, upon the fact that nucleosides like AZT are easily delivered to cells. However, the inefficiency of phosphorylation steps to the triphosphate, and the lack of specificity and consequent toxicity, constitute major drawbacks to use of AZT and similar nucleosides having a blocked, or missing, 3hydroxyl group. The T4 cell receptor for HIV, the so-called CD4 molecule, has also been targeted as an intervention point in AIDS therapy. R. A. Fisher, et al., Nature, 331:76-78 (1988); R. E. Hussey, et al., Nature, 331:78-81 (1988); and K. C. Deen, et al., Nature, 331:82-84 (1988). The exterior portion of this transmembrane protein, a molecule of 371 amino acids (sCD4) has been expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and Genentech (D. H. Smith, et al., Science, 238:1704-1707 (1987)) has had a product in clinical trials since the fall of 1987. CD4 has been shown to have a narrow spectrum of activity against wild-type virus and so far has failed to control HIV infection in humans. Schinazi, Mead and Feorino, page 963. The idea behind CD4 based therapy is that the molecules can neutralize HIV by interfering with viral attachment to T4, and other cells which express CD4 on their surfaces. A variant on this theme is to attach cell toxins to CD4 for specific binding and delivery to infected cells which display glycoprotein gp-120 on their surfaces. M. A. Till, et al., Science, 242:1166-1168 (1988); and V. K. Chaudhary, et al., Nature, 335:369-372 (1988). Another therapeutic target in AIDS involves inhibition of the viral protease (or proteinase) that is essential for processing HIV-fusion polypeptide precursors. In HIV and several other retroviruses, the proteolytic maturation of the gag and gag/pol fusion polypeptides (a process indispensable for generation of infective viral particles) has been shown to be mediated by a protease that is, itself, encoded by the pol region of the viral genome. Y. Yoshinaka, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82:1618-1622 (1985); Y. Yoshinaka, et al., J. Virol., 55:870-873 (1985); Y. Yoshinaka, et al., J. Virol., 57:826-832 (1986); and K. von der Helm, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 74:911-915 (1977). Inhibition of the protease has been shown to inhibit the processing of the HIV p55 in mammalian cell and HIV replication in T lymphocytes. T. J. McQuade, et al., Science, 247:454 (1990). The protease (or proteinase), consisting of only 99 amino acids, is among the smallest enzymes known, and its demonstrated homology to aspartyl proteases such as pepsin and renin (L. H. Pearl and W. R. Taylor, Nature, 329:351-354 (1987); and I. Katoh, et al., Nature, 329:654-656 (1987)), led to inferences regarding the three-dimensional structure and mechanism of the enzyme (L. H. Pearl and W. R. Taylor, above) that have since been borne out experimentally. Active HIV protease has been expressed in bacteria (see, e.g., P. L. Darke, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 264:2307-2312 (1989)) and chemically synthesized (J. Schneider and S. B. Kent, Cell, 54:363-368 (1988); and R. F. Nutt, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 85:7129-7133 (1988)). Site directed mutagenesis (P. L. Darke, et al., above); and N. E. Kohl, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 85:4686-4690 (1988)) and pepstatin inhibition (P. L. Darke, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 264:2307-2312 (1989); S. Seelmeier, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 85:6612-6616 (1988); C. -Z. Giam and I. Borsos, J. Biol. Chem., 263:14617-14720 (1988); and J. Hansen, et al., EMBO J., 7:1785-1791 (1988)) have provided evidence for HIV proteases mechanistic function as an aspartyl protease. A study has demonstrated that the protease cleaves at the sites expected in peptides modeled after the regions actually cleaved by the enzyme in the gag and pol precursor proteins during viral maturation. P. L. Darke, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Communs., 156:297-303 (1988). X-ray crystallographic analysis of the HIV-protease (M. A. Navia, et al., Nature, 337:615-620 (1989)) and a related retroviral enzyme from Rous sarcoma virus (M. Miller, et al., Nature, 337:576-579 (1989)) reveal an active site in the protease dimer that is identical to that seen in other aspartyl proteases, thus supporting the supposition (L. H. Pearl and W. R. Taylor, above) that the HIV enzyme is active as a dimer. See also Joseph A. Martin, Recent Advances in the Design of HIV Proteinase Inhibitors, Antiviral Research, 17 (1992) 265-278. To date, the scientific search for a fully effective and safe means of inhibiting retroviruses in a human hosting such a virus, and thereby effectively treating diseases caused by such a virus, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), continues.

The compounds of the present invention are named according to the IUPAC or CAS nomenclature system. The carbon atoms content of various hydrocarbon-containing moieties is indicated by a prefix designating the minimum and maximum number of carbon atoms in the moiety, i.e., the prefix C 1 -C 3 indicates a moiety of the integer i to the integer j carbon atoms, inclusive. Thus, for example, C 1 -C 3 alkyl refers to alkyl of one to three carbon atoms, inclusive, or methyl, ethyl, propyl, and isopropyl, straight and branched forms thereof. Also, the carbon atom content of various hydrocarbon-containing moieties of the present invention is indicated by a subscripted integer representing the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the moiety, e.g., C n H 2n indicates a moiety of the integer n carbon atoms, inclusive, and the integer 2n hydrogen atoms, inclusive. Thus, for example, C n H 2n wherein n is one to three carbon atoms, inclusive, and two to six hydrogen atoms, inclusive, or methyl, ethyl, propyl and isopropyl, and all isomeric, straight and branched forms thereof. Examples of alkyl of one to nine carbon atoms, inclusive, are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, and nonyl, and all isomeric forms thereof and straight and branched forms thereof. Examples of alkenyl of one to five carbon atoms, inclusive, are ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, pentenyl, all isomeric forms thereof, and straight and branched forms thereof. By halo is meant the typical halogen atoms, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. The compounds of formula I and II of the present invention inhibit retroviral proteinases and thus inhibit the replication of the virus. They are useful for treating patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which results in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and related diseases. More particularly, the compounds of the present invention are useful as novel human retroviral protease inhibitors. Therefore, the compounds inhibit retroviral proteases and thus inhibit the replication of the virus. They are useful for treating human patients infected with a human retrovirus, such as human immunodeficiency virus (strains of HIV-1 or HIV-2) or human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV-I or HTLV-II) which results in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and/or related diseases. The capsid and replicative enzymes (i.e. protease, reverse transcriptase, integrase) of retroviruses are translated from the viral gag and pol genes as polyproteins that are further processed by the viral protease (PR) to the mature proteins found in the viral capsid and necessary for viral functions and replication. If the PR is absent or nonfunctional, the virus cannot replicate. The retroviral PR, such as HIV-1 PR, has been found to be an aspartic protease with active site characteristics similar to those exhibited by the more complex aspartic protease, renin. The term human retrovirus (HRV) includes human immunodeficiency virus type I, human immunodeficiency virus type II, or strains thereof, as well as human T cell leukemia virus 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) or strains apparent to one skilled in the art, which belong to the same or related viral families and which create similar physiological effects in humans as various human retroviruses. Patients to be treated would be those individuals: 1) infected with one or more strains of a human retrovirus as determined by the presence of either measurable viral antibody or antigen in the serum and 2) in the case of HIV, having either an asymptomatic HIV infection or a symptomatic AIDS defining infection such as i) disseminated histoplasmosis, ii) isopsoriasis, iii) bronchial and pulmonary candidiasis including pneumocystic pneumonia iv) non-Hodgkins lymphoma or v) Kaposis sarcoma and being less than sixty years old; or having an absolute CD4 lymphocyte count of less than 500/mm 3 in the peripheral blood. Treatment would consist of maintaining an inhibitory level of the compound used according to this invention in the patient at all times and would continue until the occurrence of a second symptomatic AIDS defining infection indicates alternate therapy is needed. More specifically, an example of one such human retrovirus is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, also known as HTLV-III or LAV) which has been recognized as the causative agent in human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), P. Duesberg, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:755 (1989). HIV contains a retro viral encoded protease, HIV-I protease, that cleaves the fusion polypeptides into the functional proteins of the mature viral particle, E. P. Lillehoj, et al., J. Virology, 62:3053 (1988); C. Debuck, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 84:8903 (1987). This enzyme, HIV-I protease, has been classified as an aspartyl protease and has a demonstrated homology to other aspartyl proteases such as renin, L. H. Pearl, et al., Nature 329:351 (1987); I. Katoh, et al., Nature 329:654 (1987). Inhibition of HIV-I protease blocks the replication of HIV and thus is useful in the treatment of human AIDS, E. D. Clerq, J. Med. Chem. 29:1561 (1986). Inhibitors of HIV-I protease are useful in the treatment of HIV-infected individuals who are asymptomatic or symptomatic of AIDS. Pepstatin A, a general inhibitor of aspartyl proteases, has been disclosed as an inhibitor of HIV-I protease, S. Seelmeier, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:6612 (1986). Other substrate derived inhibitors containing reduced bond isosteres or statine at the scissle position have also been disclosed, M. L. Moore, et al., Biochem. Biophys, Res. Commun. 159:420 (1989); S. Billich, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263:17905 (1988); Sandoz, D. E. 3812-576-A. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are useful for treating diseases caused by retroviruses, such as human acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome (AIDS). The compounds are also useful for treating non-human animals infected with a retrovirus, such as cats infected with feline leukemia virus. Other viruses that infect cats include, for example, feline infectious peritonitis virus, calicivirus, rabies virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline parvovirus (panleukopenia virus), and feline chlamydia. Exact dosages, forms and modes of administration of the compounds of the present invention to non-human animals would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as a veterinarian. The compounds of formula I and II of the present invention are prepared as described in the Charts, Preparations and Examples below, or are prepared by methods analogous thereto, which are readily known and available to one of ordinary skill in the art of organic synthesis. CHART A Nitration of the cyclopropylphenyl ketone of formula A-1, which is commercially available, with fuming nitric acid at 40 C. produces a ca. 2:1 mixture of isomers. The desired m-nitro compound of formula A-2 is easily separated from the crude mixture by recrystallization from methanol. Catalytic hydrogenation of the cyclopropyl-(3-nitrophenyl)methanone of formula A-2 with 10% platinum on carbon in methanol gives the aniline of formula A-3. The aniline is then coupled with benzenesulfonyl chloride using pyridine in methylene chloride to give the sulfonamide derivative of formula A-4. Reduction of the ketone with sodium borohydride in tetrahydrofuran and ethanol then produces the carbinol of formula A-5. The dianion of the cyclooctylpyranone of formula A-6, prepared as described in Chart B, is formed using lithium diisopropyl amide in tetrahydrofuran at 0 C., and then alkylated with iodopropane to give the 10-propyl-cyclooctylpyranone of formula A-7. The cyclooctylpyranone of formula A-7 and the carbinol of the formula A-5 are then coupled using p-toluenesulfonic acid in methylene chloride to give the sulfonamide derivative of formula A-8. CHART B The commercially available amine of the formula B-1 is protected using benzyl chloroformate and sodium bicarbonate in THF/water solution to give the compound of formula B-2. The aldehyde of formula B-2 is then reacted with a Grignard reagent to give the secondary alcohol of formula B-3, wherein, e.g., R 1 is isobutyl. The known cyclooctylpyranone of formula B-4 is prepared by acylation of the trimethylsilyl enol ether of cyclooctanone with malonyl dichloride as described in R. Effenberger, T. Ziegler, K. -H. Schonwalder, T. Kesmarszky, B. Bauer Chem. Ber. 119:3394-3404 (1986). The alcohol of formula B-3 is then used to alkylate the cyclooctylpyranone of formula B-4 in refluxing toluene and p-toluenesulfonic acid to obtain the compound of the formula B-5, wherein, e.g., R. is isobutyl. At this point, the enantiomers of formula B-5 are separated using a chiral HPLC column. The benzyloxy protecting group is then cleaved using 10% Pd/C in cyclohexene to give the amine of formula B-6, wherein, e.g., R 1 is isobutyl, which is reacted with aryl sulfonyl chlorides to give the compounds of the formula B-7, wherein, e.g., R 1 is isobutyl and R 2 is 1-methylimidazole. CHART C 3-Bromobenzyl alcohol of formula C-1, which is commercially available, in tetrahydrofuran is treated with methyllithium, n-butyllithium and cyclpropanecarboxaldehyde in sequence at 78 C. The resulting solution is gradually warmed to room temperature and then heated at reflux affording the alcohol of formula C-2. The resulting alcohol, in dichloromethane, in the presence of molecular sieves, is treated with 4-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,9,10-hexahydrocyclooctabpyran-2-one of formula C-8, prepared as described in Chart B, and p-toluenesulfonic acid. The solution is heated at reflux to afford the alcohol of formula C-3. The benzyl alcohol is treated with carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in dichloromethane at 0 C. to afford compounds of formula C-4 and C-5 as an inseparable mixture after an aqueous brine workup. The mixture is then treated with any thiol (e.g., thiophenol) and an organic base and heated at reflux to afford sulfides of the formula C-6. Finally treatment of the compounds of the formula C-6 with oxone in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran, methanol and water gives sulfones of formula C-7. CHART D This chart describes a generic procedure for the preparation of C-3 branched 5,6-dihydropyrones via aluminum chloride (AlCl 3 ) mediated condensation with 3-nitrobenzaldehyde. Thus, the AlCl 3 catalyzed reaction of the compound of formula D-1, prepared as described below in the Preparations, (e.g., wherein R 1 is phenethyl or propyl; R 2 is phenethyl or propyl) with 3-nitrobenzaldehyde (formula D-2), which is commercially available, provides compounds of formula D-3 (e.g., wherein R 1 is phenethyl or propyl; R 2 is phenethyl or propyl). Subsequent reaction with trialkyl aluminums or Grignard reagents in the presence of cuprous bromide-dimethylsulfide complex (CuBrMe 2 S) provides compounds of formula D-4 (e.g., wherein R 1 is phenethyl or propyl; R 2 is phenethyl or propyl; R 1 is ethyl or cyclopropyl). Transfer hydrogenation with Pd/C and ammonium formate provides compounds of formula D-5 (e.g., wherein R 1 is phenethyl or propyl; R 2 is phenethyl or propyl; R 3 is ethyl or cyclopropyl). Treatment of the compound of formula D-5 with sulfonyl chlorides of formula D-7, wherein R 4 is defined below, and pyridine in methylene chloride (CH 2 Cl 2 ) provides compounds of formula D-6 (e.g., wherein R 1 is phenethyl or propyl; R 2 is phenethyl or propyl; R 3 is ethyl or cyclopropyl; R 4 is 4-cyanophenyl, 4-fluorophenyl, 1-methylimidazol-4-yl, quinolin-8-yl, 2-pyridyl, 4-cyano-2-pyridyl, quinolin-2-yl, 2-hydroxyphenyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 2-quinazoline, 7H-purin-6-yl, 1H-imidazol-2-yl, 1H-benzimidazol-2-yl or thiazol-2-yl). CHART E Treatment of commercially available 4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-pyrone of formula E-1 with three equivalents of lithium diisopropylamide in tetrahydrofuran and hexamethylphosphoramide is followed by bromomethylcyclopropane to afford the compound of formula E-2. Reaction between the compound of formula E-2 and the compound of formula F-5, prepared as described in Chart F, in benzene with p-toluenesulfonic acid catalyst in the presence of molecular sieves affords the compound of formula E-3. Hydrogenolysis of the compound of formula E-3 in methanol with hydrogen and palladium on charcoal gives the free amine of formula E-4.

Under similar conditions, compounds of general formula E-5 are obtained by reacting amine E-4 with alkyl, aryl and heteroaryl sulfonyl chlorides in the presence of pyridine to give compounds of formula E-5 wherein R is alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl. Also, for example, the enantiomers of the compound of formula E-9 are separated chromatographically by chiral HPLC to give compounds of formula E-10 and E-11. Additional final compounds of the present invention of formula E-6, E-7, E-8, and E-12-E-16 are prepared using similar conditions.

Catalytic hydrogenation of cyclopropyl-(3-nitrophenyl)methanone of formula N-2 with 10% platinum on carbon in methanol at 0 C. provides the aniline of formula N-3. The product is isolated by filtration and concentration. The amino group is then protected using benzyl chloroformate and diisopropylethylamine in methylene chloride to give the ketone of formula N-4. The ketone is then reduced with sodium borohydride in 5:1 THF and ethanol to give the alcohol of formula N-5.

The ketone of formula LLL-11 is treated with TiCl 4 in methylene chloride below 0 C. followed by the addition of an amine base, then addition of either 4-heptanone or 1-phenyl-3-hexanone, to give the compound of formula LLL-12 wherein R 1 is, e.g., n-propyl or phenethyl, respectively. The compound of formula LLL-12 is treated with TiCl 4 in methylene chloride below 0 C. followed by the addition of an amine base, then the addition of trimethyl orthoformate to yield the compound of formula LLL-13. The compound of formula LLL-13, in an organic solvent such as THFor methylene chloride, is treated with a base followed by the addition of trimethylsilyl chloride. The solvent is removed from the aforementioned reaction and the resulting protected tertiary alcohol is oxidized (e.g. Ru cat./t-BuOH (see Murahashi et. al. Chemistry Letters 2237, 1992); tritylperchlorate/methylene chloride (see Mukaiyama et. al. Chemistry Letters 1255, 1985), ozone/methylene chloride (see Can. J. Chem. 49, 2465, 1971)) to afford the lactone LLL-6 directly or in a two step sequence where the intermediate ester is lactonized with the aid of either sodium hydride, potassium tert. butoxide or n-Bu 4 NF in an ether solvent. The conversion of the compound of formula LLL-6 to the final product is described above. Following the same strategy the compound of formula LLL-16 is converted to the final products of formula LLL-23 wherein R 1 is propyl or phenethyl. CHART MMM The diastereomers of formulae MMM-5 and MMM-7 are also prepared by separation of a diastereomeric mixture of these two compounds. Alternatively, the diastereomeric mixture of formula MMM-1 (X-11 where R 1 is, e.g., phenethyl) prepared as described in Chart X, is separated into the single diastereomers of formulae MMM-2 and MMM-3 using a preparative chiral HPLC column. The benzyl protecting group groups of compounds MMM-2 (less polar diastereomer) and MMM-3 (more polar diastereomer) are then removed by catalytic hydrogenation using 10% palladium on carbon in ethyl acetate to form the amines of fromulae MMM-4 and MMM-6, respectively. The amine intermediates are then converted to the desired sulfonamide derivatives of formulae MMM-5 and MMM-7, respectively, by treatment with 5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridinylsulfonyl chloride, prepared using the methods described in Chart O, and pryidine in methylene chloride. CHART NNN The commercially available (1R, 2S)-()ephedrine of formula NNN-2 is treated with triethylamine and the acid chloride of formula NNN-1 (W-2), prepared as described in Chart W, to afford the amide of formula NNN-3. A t-butyl methyl ether solution of this amide at 0 C. is treated sequentially with 1.1 equivalents of propyl magnesium chloride and 2.0 equivalents of 3-bis(trimethylsilyl)aminophenyl magnesium chloride, stirred for 3 hours at 0 C., washed with ammonium chloride solution and concentrated in vacuo. The residue is then stirred with silica gel in chloroform to afford the compound of formula NNN-4. Alternatively, the above reaction mixture may be washed with 1 N hydrochloric acid solution during the workup instead of ammonium chloride solution to generate the compound of formula NNN-4. The amine is then converted to the derivative of formula NNN-5 by heating a mixture of the compound of formula NNN-4, 2.2 equivalents of benzyl bromide and 2.2 equivalents of sodium carbonate in acetonitrile. The intermediate of formula NNN-5 is then treated with 2 equivalents of lithium diisopropylamide in tetrahydrofuran to form the lithium enolate, which is trapped with acetyl chloride to afford the -ketoamide of formula NNN-6. A solution of this amide in methylene chloride at low temperature may be treated with 1 equivalent of titanium tetrachloride and 1 equivalent of diisopropylethylamine, followed by 4-heptanone to generate the compound of formula NNN-7. Conversion of the amide of formula NNN-7 to the dihydropyrone of formula NNN-8 may be accomplished with either sodium hydride in tetrahydrofuran or with aqueous acid. The benzyl protecting groups may then be removed by catalytic hydrogenation using 10% palladium on carbon in ethyl acetate. The resulting amine of formula NNN-9 is converted to the desired sulfonamide derivative of formula NNN-10 (W-12) by treatment with 5-trifluoromethylpyridine-2-sulfonyl chloride, prepared using the methods described in Chart O, and pyridine in dichloromethane. CHART OOO The compound of formula OOO-7 (NNN-8) may also be generated as described in Chart OOO. The amide of formula OOO-1 (NNN-5) is treated with aqueous acid to afford the compound of formula OOO-2. The methyl ester of formula OOO-3 is formed from the compound of formula OOO-2 using catalytic acid in methanol. Treatment of the methyl ester of formula OOO-3 with lithium diisopropylamide, followed by trimethylsilyl chloride gives the compound of formula OOO-4. Treatment of this intermediate with either 2-methoxy-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane followed by hydrolysis or treatment with acetyl chloride affords the -keto ester of formula OOO-5. This -keto ester is converted to the compound of formula OOO-6 by treatment of either the titanium enolate (formed using 1 equivalent of titanium tetrachloride and 1 equivalent of diisopropylethylamine in methylene chloride at low temperature) or the lithium dianion (formed using 2 equivalents of lithium diisopropylamide in tetrahydrofuran at low temperature) with 4-heptanone. The dihydropyrone of formula OOO-7 (NNN-8) is formed by treatment of the compound of formula OOO-6 with either sodium hydride in tetrahydrofuran or aqueous base. CHART PPP Reduction of the commercially available ethyl 4,4,4-trifluorobutyrate of formula PPP-1, with DiBAL-H followed by in situ alkylation with 2-phenethyl magnesium bromide or chloride produces the alcohol of formula PPP-2. Swern oxidation of the alcohol gives the ketone of formula PPP-3. The ketone is converted to the dihydropyrone of formula PPP-4 by alkylation with the dianion of methyl acetoacetate followed by saponification to the acid and lactonization with base. CHART QQQ The aluminum trichloride catalyzed reaction of the dihydropyrone of formula QQQ-1 (PPP-4), prepared as described in Chart PPP, with the CBZ-protected 3-aminobenzaldehyde (which is available from the reaction of benzyl chloroformate with commercially available 3-aminobenzaldehyde) of formula QQQ-2 and subsequent reaction with trialkyl aluminums or Grignard reagents in the presence of cuprous bromide-dimethylsulfide complexes provides compounds of formula QQQ-3. The individual stereoisomers are separated by HPLC using a chiral stationary phase to give the four possible stereoisomers of formula QQQ-4, QQQ-5, QQQ-6, and QQQ-7. Transfer hydrogenation of each stereoisomer with Pd/C and ammonium formate gives the amines of formula QQQ-8, QQQ-9, QQQ-10, and QQQ-11. Treatment of the amines with sulfonyl chlorides of general formula QQQ-12 and pyridine in methylene chloride provides compounds of general formula QQQ-13, QQQ-14, QQQ-15, and QQQ-16, wherein R 2 is, e.g., 5-cyano-2-pyridinyl, 1-methyl-4-imidazolyl, or 5-amino-2-pyridinyl. CHART RRR The procedure for the preparation of compounds of formula RRR-11 to RRR-15 is described in Chart RRR. The pyrone RRR-A is coupled to the Cbz protected benzaldehyde RRR-B in THF with AlCl 3 followed by treatment of the resulting intermediate with R 1 MgX where XBr or Cl in THF with added CuBr.Me 2 S to give RRR-1. De-protection of the resulting intermediate with 10% Pd/C in methanol with added ammonium formate gives RRR-2. Separation of the racemic compound RRR-1 into its 4 enantiomers gives RRR-3 to RRR-6. De-protection of the resulting intermediates with 10% Pd/C in methanol with added ammonium formate gives the free amines RRR-7 to RRR-10. Treatment of the amines RRR-7 to RRR-10 and RRR-2 with an appropriate sulfonyl chloride gives the sulfonamides RRR-11 to RRR-14 and RRR-15, respectively. CHART SSS The procedure for the preparation of compounds of formula SSS-7 to SSS-9 is described in Chart SSS. The pyrone SSS-A is coupled to the Cbz protected benzaldehyde SSS-B in THF with AlCl 3 followed by treatment of the resulting intermediate with R 1 MgX where XBr or Cl in THF with added CuBr.Me 2 S to give SSS-1. De-protection of the resulting intermediate with 10% Pd/C in methanol with added ammonium formate gives SSS-2. Separation of the racemic compound SSS-1 into its 2 enantiomers gives SSS-3 to SSS-4. De-protection of the resulting intermediates with 10% Pd/C in methanol with added ammonium formate gives the free amines SSS-5 to SSS-6.

CHART TTT The procedure for the preparation of compounds of formula TTT-6 and TTT-7 is described in Chart TTT. The pyrone TTT-A is coupled to the Cbz protected benzaldehyde TTT-B in THF with AlCl 3 followed by treatment of the resulting intermediate with R 1 MgX where XBr or Cl in THF with added CuBr.Me 2 S to give TTT-1. Separation of the racemic compound TTT-1 into its 2 enantiomers gives TTT-2 and TTT-3. De-protection of the resulting intermediates with 10% Pd/C in methanol with added ammonium formate gives the free amines TTT-4 and TTT-5. Treatment of the amine with an appropriate sulfonyl chloride gives the sulfonamides TTT-6 and TTT-7. CHART UUU Reaction between commercially available thiourea in hot ethanol with commercially available 2-chloro-5-nitropyridine of formula UUU-1 affords the isothiourea compound of formula UUU-2. Treatment of the compound of formula UUU-2 with aqueous sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide provides the thiol compound of formula UUU-3. Oxidation of the compound of formula UUU-3 with chlorine gas provides the sulfonyl chloride compound of formula UUU-4. Treatment of the compound of formula D-5 (e.g., the compound of formula T-4 wherein R 1 is 2-phenylethyl, R 2 is propyl, R 1 is tert-butyl) in dichloromethane with two equivalents of pyridine followed by one equivalent of the compound of formula UUU-4 gives the sulfonamide compound of formula UUU-5 (wherein R 1 is 2-phenylethyl, R 2 is propyl, R 3 is tert-butyl). Reduction of the compound of formula UUU-5 with palladium on carbon and ammonium formate affords the compound of formula UUU-6, which is the compound: 5-amino-N-3-(1-5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-6-(2-phenylethyl)-6-propyl-2H-pyran-3-yl-2,2-dimethylpropyl)phenyl-2-pyridinesulfonamide (Formula UUU-6: R 1 is 2-phenylethyl, R 2 is propyl, R 3 is tert-butyl). CHART VVV The compound of Formula VVV-1, which is 2-mercapto-5-carbamoylpyridine, is prepared via published procedure (J. Chem. Soc. 1948, 1939-1945). Treatment of a suspension of this compound in dilute hydrochloric acid with chlorine gas at 0 provides the sulfonyl chloride of Formula VVV-2. CHART WWW Amines of the generic formula WWW-1 are reacted with benzyl chloroformate to provide CBZ derivatives WWW-2. The individual stereoisomers of formula WWW-2 are generally separated by chiral HPLC methods, and then converted back to the free amines WWW-3 via hydrogenolysis. Sulfonation of the amines in the usual manner known to one of ordinary skill in the art provides the final compounds of formula WWW-4, in stereochemically pure form. CHART XXX Dihydropyrone XXX-1, which is prepared by procedures analogous to those in described in Preparations 17 and 84, is condensed with meta-nitrobenzaldehyde in the presence of aluminum trichloride to provide the benzylidene intermediate XXX-2. Conjugate reduction of the double bond using sodium cyanoborohydride, followed by reduction of the nitro group via catalytic hydrogenation, affords amine of formula XXX-4, which is converted to the sulfonamides XXX-5 by treatment with the appropriate sulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane and pyridine. CHART YYY Dihydropyrones of Formula YYY-1, wherein R 1 and R 2 are propyl or phenethyl, and which are synthesized as described in Preparation 84, are condensed with the aldehyde of Formula B-2 using aluminum trichloride to provide the benzylidene intermediates of formula YYY-2. Conjugate addition of tert-butylmagnesium chloride in the presence of copper (I) bromide-dimethyl sulfide provides compounds of Formula YYY-3. Hydrogenolytic deprotection affords amines of formula YYY-4, which are converted to the sulfonamides of formula YYY-5 using the appropriate sulfonyl chloride in dichloromethane with added pyridine. The procedures used are analogous to those described for Chart D. CHART ZZZ Polymeric meta-aminobenzaldehyde is protected by treating with benzyl bromide and potassium carbonate in acetonitrile at reflux to yield the compound of formula ZZZ-2. A vinyl anion is generated from 2-bromovinyltrimethylsilane of formula ZZZ-3 by treatment with t-butyl lithium at 78 C. to 20 C. The vinyl anion so generated is cooled to 78 C. and the diprotected meta-aminobenzaldehyde of formula ZZZ-2 is added to afford the desired allylic alcohol of formula ZZZ-3. The alcohol is easily converted to the acetate or carbonate of formula ZZZ-5 by standard means (e.g., CH 3 COCl, pyridine, CH 2 Cl 2 , 0 C.). These substrates participate in palladium catalyzed allylic substitutions as delineated in Charts AAAA-CCCC (C. G. Frost; J. Howarth; J. M. J. Williams, Tetrahedron: Asymmetry (1992) 3:1089-1122). CHART AAAA The sodium salt of methyl acetoacetate of formula AAAA-1 generated by treating methyl acetoacetate with sodium hydride at 0 C. in either DMF or THF acts as the nucleophile in a palladium catalyzed allylic substitution. If this reaction is run in the presence of palladium allyl chloride dimer of formula AAAA-3 as the palladium source and a chiral phosphine ligand (P. von Matt; A. Pfaltz, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. (1993) 32:566-568), a kinetic resolution of the starting allylic acetate or carbonate results in the synthesis of optically enriched allylated product of formula AAAA-4. If the reaction with nucleophile is slow, the acetate generated from formation of the pi-allyl palladium intermediate isomerizes the two possible diastereomeric pi-allyl complexes so that a stereoselective synthesis of the allylated product occurs (B. M. Trost; P. E. J. Strege, Am. Chem. Soc. (1977) 99:1649). Treatment of the resulting vinyl silane of formula AAAA-4 with para-toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile at reflux affords the desilylated olefin of formula AAAA-5. The dihydropyrone product of formula AAAA-7 is formed by generating the dianion of the ketoester under standard conditions (J. R. Peterson; T. J. Winger; C. P. Miller, Syn. Comm. (1988) 18(9):949-963), (NaH, n-butyllithium, THF) and quenching with an appropriate symmetrical ketone of formula AAAA-6 (such as 4-heptanone). Hydrolysis of the ester (0.1 N NaOH/THF) and acidic work-up provide the dihydropyrone product of formula AAAA-7. Standard hydrogenation conditions reduce the olefin and deprotect the amine. Subsequent treatment of the amino compound with the appropriate sulfonyl chloride of formula AAAA-8 (pyridine, CH 2 Cl 2 ) provides the desired sulfonamide protease inhibitor of formula AAAA-9. CHART BBBB Alternatively, the palladium catalyzed allylic substitution may be performed with the sodium anion of the requisite dihydropyrone J. R. (Peterson; T. J. Winger; C. P. Miller, Syn. Comm. (1988) 18(9):949-963) of formula BBBB-1 (dihydropyrone, NaH, THF or DMF, 0 C.) as the nucleophilic partner. Once again, if palladium allyl chloride dimer of formula BBBB-3 and a chiral phosphine ligand (P. von Matt; A. Pfaltz, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. (1993) 32:566-568) are employed as catalyst, a kinetic resolution results in the synthesis of optically pure allylated dihydropyrone of formula BBBB-4; and a stereoselective synthesis of the allylated product will occur if the reaction with nucleophile is slow relative to isomerization of the two possible diastereomeric pi-allyl complexes by acetate generated from formation of the pi-allyl palladium intermediate. Subsequent, desilylation (p-TsOH, CH 3 CN), olefin reduction and amine deprotection (H 2/ Pd/C), and sulfonylation of the amine (ArSO 2 Cl, pyridine, CH 2 Cl 2 ) with a compound of the formula BBBB-5 provides the desired dihydropyrone protease inhibitor of formula BBBB-6. CHART CCCC Treatment of m-bis(benzyl)aminobenzoic acid of formula CCCC-1 with oxalyl chloride to form the acid chloride and reaction with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene and AlCl 3 in methylene chloride affords the propargylic ketone of formula CCCC-2. Asymetric reduction of the ketone with a chiral borane (H. C. Brown; Beeraraghavan Ramachandran, P. Acc. Chem. Res. (1992) 25:16-24) such as DIP chloride () or ()--chlorodiisopinocampheylborane and acetylene reduction with REDAL provides the allylic alcohol of formula CCCC-3, primarily as a single enantiomer. Formation of the carbonate of formula CCCC-4 (methyl chloroformate, pyridine, CH 2 Cl 2 , 0 C.) and subjection to palladium catalyzed allylic substitution with the desired dihydropyrone of formula CCCC-5 as nucleophile affords primarily one enantiomer of the allylated dihydropyrone of formula CCCC-6 (retention of configuration) (T. Hayashi; T. Hagihara; M. Konishi; M. J. Kumada, Am. Chem. Soc. (1983) 105:7768-7770). This product is transformed into the desired protease inhibitor of formula CCCC-7 as previously described in Chart BBBB. CHART DDDD The known cycloalkylpyranones of formula DDDD-1 are prepared by acylation of the trimethylsilyl enol ether of the corresponding cycloalkyl ketone with malonyl dichloride as described in R. Effenberger, T. Ziegler, K. -H. Schonwalder, T. Kesmarszky, B. Bauer Chem. Ber. 119: 3394-3404 (1986). Catalytic hydrogenation of the cycloalkylpyranones of formula DDDD-1 with platinum oxide (PtO 2 ) in acetic acid produces the cycloalkyldihydropyrones of Formula DDDD-2. The intermediate of formula DDDD-3 is then formed by aluminum chloride (AlCl 3 ) catalyzed condensation of the compound of formula DDDD-2 with 3-nitrobenzaldehyde, which is commercially available. Subsequent reaction of the intermediate of formula DDDD-3 with trialkyl aluminums in the presence of copper bromide-dimethyl sulfide complex (CuBrMe 2 S) or zinc reagents generated from zinc metal, alkyl halide, cuprous cyanide (CuCN) and lithium chloride (LiCl) provides compounds of formula DDDD-4 which contain a C-3a branched substituent. Catalytic hydrogenation of compounds of the formula DDDD-4 with Pd/C in ethanol (EtOH) provides the amine derivatives of the formula DDDD-5. Treatment of the compounds of formula DDDD-5 with sulfonyl chlorides of formula DDDD-6 and pyridine in methylene chloride (CH 2 Cl 2 ) provides compounds of the formula DDDD-7 (e.g., wherein n is 1, 2, or 3; R 1 is ethyl or t-butyl; R 2 is 4-cyanophenyl or 5-cyano-2-pyridyl). Procedures by which the compounds of the present invention are prepared are also described in International application, PCT/US93/10645, filed Nov. 9, 1993 (WO 94/11361, published May 26, 1994), and International application, PCT/US94/00938, filed Feb. 3, 1994 (WO 94/18188, published Aug. 18, 1994), both of which are incorporated by reference herein. As is apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, the compounds of the present invention can occur in several diastereomeric forms, depending on the configuration around the asymmetric carbon atoms. All such diastereomeric forms are included within the scope of the present invention. Also, the dihydropyrones of the present invention can be separated into individual stereoisomers or prepared as individual diastereomers. A diastereomeric pair can be prepared wherein C-3 is a homogeneous center and C-6 is a mixture. All such enantiomeric and diastereomeric forms, and mixtures thereof, are included within the scope of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention of formula I can exist in several tautomeric forms, including the particular enol forms as depicted by formula I and IA and the keto form of formula IB. (For formulas I, IA and IB, the dashed line indicates that a double bond may be present or absent.) All such tautomeric forms are included within the scope of the present invention. For compounds of the present invention which are 4-hydroxy-pyran-2-ones of formula VII, the enol form predominates. For compounds of the present invention which are 5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-pyran-2-ones of formula VI, a mixture of the enol and keto forms is commonly expected. Also, the compounds of the present invention of formula II can exist in several tautomeric forms of the 4-hydroxy-pyrone ring, including the particular enol forms depicted by formulas II and IIA, and the particular keto form depicted by formula IIB, and mixtures thereof. All such tautomeric forms are included within the scope of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention may be in either free form or in protected form at one or more of the remaining (not previously protected) carboxyl, amino, hydroxy, or other reactive groups. The protecting groups may be any of those known in the art. Examples of nitrogen and oxygen protecting groups are set forth in T. W. Greene, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley, New York, (1981); J. F. W. McOmie, ed. Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Plenum Press (1973); and J. Fuhrhop and G. Benzlin, Organic Synthesis, Verlag Chemie (1983). Included among the nitrogen protective groups are t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl, acetyl, allyl, phthalyl, benzyl, benzoyl, trityl and the like. The present invention provides for compounds of formula I and II or pharmacologically acceptable salts and/or hydrates thereof. Pharmacologically acceptable salts refers to those salts which would be readily apparent to a manufacturing pharmaceutical chemist to be equivalent to the parent compound in properties such as formulation, stability, patient acceptance and bioavailability. Examples of salts of the compounds of formula I include acidic salts, such as sodium, potassium, lysine, arginine and calcium salts, and basic salts, such as the hydrochloride salt, wherein the R substituents in formula I contain a basic moiety. Examples of salts of the compounds of formula II include the hydrohalide salts, such as the hydrochloride and hydroiodide salts; and the sodium, potassium, calcium, lysine and arginine salts. Also included as salts of the compounds of formulae I and II of the present invention are the bis-salts, such as the bis-arginine, bis-lysine, bis-sodium, bis-potassium and bis-calcium salts, provided that the compound contains, for example, NHSO 2 , SO 3 H, CONH, OH or COOH. The bis-sodium salt is most preferred. The compounds of the present invention are useful for treating patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which results in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and related diseases. For this indication, these compounds may be administered by oral, intranasal, transdermal, subcutaneous and parenteral (including intramuscular and intravenous) routes in doses of 0.1 mg to 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. Those skilled in the art would know how to formulate the compounds of this invention into appropriate pharmaceutical dosage forms. Examples of the dosage forms include oral formulations, such as tablets or capsules, or parenteral formulations, such as sterile solutions. When the compounds in this invention are administered orally, an effective amount is from about 0.1 mg to 100 mg per kg of body weight per day. Either solid or fluid dosage forms can be prepared for oral administration. Solid compositions, such as compressed tablets, are prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with conventional ingredients such as talc, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, magnesium aluminum silicate, calcium sulfate, starch, lactose, acacia, methyl cellulose, or functionally similar pharmaceutical diluents and carriers. Capsules are prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with an inert pharmaceutical diluent and placing the mixture into an appropriately sized hard gelatin capsule. Soft gelatin capsules are prepared by machine encapsulation of a slurry or solution of the compounds of this invention with an acceptable inert oil such as vegetable oil or light liquid petrolatum. Pharmaceutically acceptable formulations of the disodium salts of the compounds of the present invention include: soft elastic capsules (SEC) containing a suspension of the salt; salt tablets; salt spray coated sucrose beads; or salt spray dried matrix with an enteric or non-enteric polymer. Formulations of the compounds of the present invention, which present the compounds in free acid form, preferably contain the free acid in non-crystalline form. Examples of such formulations include: soft elastic capsules containing free acid solution; non-crystalline spray dried matrix of the free acid with an enteric or non-enteric polymer; or a solid non-crystalline matrix of free acid in polyethyleneglycol (PEG) or Gelucire 44/14 (Gattefosse, Saint Priest, France). Syrups are prepared by dissolving the compounds of this invention in an aqueous vehicle and adding sugar, aromatic flavoring agents and preservatives. Elixirs are prepared using a hydroalcoholic vehicle such as ethanol, suitable sweeteners such as sugar or saccharin and an aromatic flavoring agent. Suspensions are prepared with an aqueous vehicle and a suspending agent such as acacia, tragacanth, or methyl cellulose. When the compounds of this invention are administered parenterally, they can be given by injection or by intravenous infusion. An effective amount is from about 0.1 mg to 100 mg per kg of body weight per day. Parenteral solutions are prepared by dissolving the compounds of this invention in liquid vehicle and filter sterilizing the solution before placing in a suitable sealable vial or ampule. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same way except a sterile suspension vehicle is used and the compounds of this invention are sterilized with ethylene oxide or suitable gas before it is suspended in the vehicle. The exact route of administration, dose, or frequency of administration would be readily determined by those skilled in the art and is dependant on the age, weight, general physical condition, or other clinical symptoms specific to the patient to be treated. Patients to be treated would be those individuals: 1) infected with one or more than one strain of a human immunodeficiency virus as determined by the presence of either measurable viral antibody or antigen in the serum and 2) having either an asymptomatic HIV infection or a symptomatic AIDS defining infection such as i) disseminated histoplasmosis, ii) isoporiasis, iii) bronchial and pulmonary candidiasis including pneumocystis pneumonia, iv) non-Hodgkins lymphoma, or v) Kaposis sarcoma and being less than sixty years old; or having an absolute CD4lymphocyte count of less than 500/mm 3 in the peripheral blood. Treatment would consist of maintaining an inhibitory level of the compounds of this invention in the patient at all times and would continue until the occurrence of a second symptomatic AIDS defining infection indicates alternate therapy is needed. The utility of representative compounds of the present invention has been demonstrated in the biological tests described below: The HIV protease screening assay is based on fluorescently labeled substrate which can be resolved from nonlabeled cleavage product using special beads coated with streptavidin. The substrate is biotinylated at the amino terminal arginine and fluorescently labeled with fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC) at the carboxyl terminal lysine. This assay has been employed to detect novel, nonpeptidic inhibitors of HIV-1 protease. Substrate (20 M of 0.2 M), sample (10 l of desired concentraion), and enzyme (10 l of 0.1 M) are added to a 96 well pandex plate. The assay is run in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.5 in the presence of 1.0 M sodium chloride and 0.05% NP-40 with incubated in the dark for one hour at room temperature. Strepavidin coated polystyrene beads 40 l of 0.1% (w/v) are added and the plate is incubated in the dark for an additional half hour. The labeled cleavage product is separated from the unreacted substrate via filtration and is read on the Idexx screen machine. The data are analyzed by appropriate computer algorithms to ascertain percent inhibition values. Determination of K i values utilizes the same materials and equipment employed for percent inhibition studies. Two-fold serial dilutions are made for a given inhibitor from 2, 3 or 4 starting concentrations with a total of 24, 36 or 48 individual inhibitor concentrations. These dilutions are performed utilizing the BioMek robotics system. The assay consists of 10 L of 40 nM HIV-1 protease, 10 L of the various inhibitor concentrations, and 20 L of 200 M substrate (40 L total). The reaction is allowed to proceed for 90 min at room temperature, terminated with 40 L of avidin beads and processed (supra vide). An inhibitor with a known K; is run in parallel to verify the validity of the assay. The data is processed utilizing a computer program employing a nonlinear least square analysis of the data to generate the K i values. The % inhibition values and/or K i values of representative compounds of the present invention tested in the HIV protease screening assay are listed in Table I below. In the enzyme inhibition assay described above, the sensitivity of K i value determination is in part limited by the ability to continue to lower the enzyme concentration for compounds with high binding affinity. To prevent de-dimerization at low enzyme concentration, a tandemly linked enzyme is prepared in which the two monomers are covalently linked by an appropriate stretch of amino acid residues. Using the latter enzyme, the sensitivity of the inhibition assay is improved since much lower enzyme concentration can be utilized, as compared to the condition using the wild-type enzyme. Protocol for K. value determination with tandem HIV protease: Due to the greater stability (no dedimerization) of the single chain tethered (tandem) HIV protease enzyme, in which the two monomeric units are engineered to be linked by a polypeptide stretch, the method for the determination of K i values for inhibitors uses very low concentrations of enzyme (0.2 nM) and increased incubation times (96 hours) at room temperature to improve the sensitivity in the measurement of K i values for very potent inhibitors. The starting inhibitor concentrations are determined based on preliminary enzyme inhibition screening results which estimate the expected potency of the inhibitor. Inhibitor concentrations are then prepared using the Biomek 1000 (Beckman) and the Quadra 96 (Tomtec). Substrate (biotinylated at the amino terminal arginine and fluorescently labeled with fluorescein at the carboxyl terminal lysine), inhibitor and the tandem enzyme are allowed to react in solution at pH 5.5 (buffers identical to those used with the native dimeric enzyme) in the dark for 96 hours. Streptavidin coated polystyrene beads are added to stop the reaction. The labeled cleavage product is separated from unreacted substrate via filtration. Residual fluorescence is quantitated with the Idexx SM2000 (Idexx) and the resulting data are analyzed using the NLLSF program. The % inhibition values and/or K i values of representative compounds of the present invention tested in the HIV protease screening assay and/or tandem HIV protease assay are listed in Table II below. Several compounds of the present invention, such as N-3-(1-5,6-Dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-6-(2-phenethyl)-6-propyl-2H-pyran-3-yl-2,2-dimethylpropyl)phenyl-1-methyl-1H-imidazole-4-sulfonamide were tested in known human cell lines, such as human T-cell lines, e.g., MT4 and H9, which were infected with HIV-1 IIIB , and certain of these compounds were further tested in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), which were infected with HIV-1 JRCSF (a clinical isolate).

The invention, moreover, relates to oligomeric liquid crystalline bismaleimides of general formula (II) wherein A, X, M and R are as defined above, n represents and integer from 1 to 100 and B represents piperazinyl or a divalent radical which is derived from a primary or secondary para-substituted cyclic diamine, wherein B is bonded via the amino groups of the diamine. The invention also relates to methods of producing said bismaleimides. This invention relates to new bismaleimides comprising mesogenic groups and to methods of producing them. Polymeric networks with liquid crystalline properties are materials which are potentially of interest, since they are capable of preferentially exhibiting outstanding mechanical and optical properties in their oriented state. Amongst the optical properties of networks of this type, the change in birefringence and the direction of polarisation in electric, mechanical and magnetic fields, which are utilised for the storage and display of information, e.g. in polymer network LCDs, should be emphasised in particular. In thermally crosslinked materials a refinforcement by liquid crystalline phases results in an increase in the modulus of elasticity, in the bending and fracture strength, and in hardness. Mesogenic compounds are suitable for the synthesis of liquid crystalline crosslinking agents. Mesogenic compounds such as these are mainly aromatic compounds comprising at least two benzene rings, which are linked para to each other by suitable groups, such as ester-(COO), amide (CONH) or azomethine (CHN) groups for example, wherein the terminal aromatic rings are each substituted in the para position in relation to these linking groups by an OH, COOH or NH 2 group. In order to attain liquid crystalline properties, the mesogens generally also have to be linked to suitable spacer chains via the aforementioned reactive OH, COOH or NH 2 groups. The liquid crystals which are thus formed exhibit what are predominantly nematic textures under the polarising microscope. If the spacer chains of the mesogens which were schematically described above have functions at their ends which are capable of crosslinking, such as acrylate, vinyl ether or glycidyl ethergroups for example, liquid crystalline compounds of this type are self-crosslinking or are capable of crosslinking with other reactive compounds by copolymerization. Their solubility in solvents, compatibility with the oligomeric and polymeric reactants and the liquid crystalline temperature ranges depend on the length of the linear aliphatic spacers, which may have a length corresponding to 1 to 30, preferably 3 to 20 CH 2 groups. Due to the spacer chains, the mesogens which form the liquid crystalline phase are isolated from the crosslinking sites, which is advantageous for the formation and for the capacity of orientation of the mesogenic phase. Examples thereof include liquid crystalline diglycidyl ethers, such as those described by D. J. Broer et al. in Macromolecules, 26, 1244-47 (1993) and by B. Koscielny et al. in Polymer Bulletin, Vol. 32 (5-6), 529-36 (1994), as well as diacrylate and divinyl ethers, such as those described by R. A. M. Hikmet et al. in Macromolecules 28, 3313-27 (1995) and in Polymer, 34, 1736-40 (1993). As essential characteristic property for the existence of liquid crystallinity is the length/diameter ratio of the individual molecule, which should reach or exceed a value of 5. When the above mesogens are used, the resulting networks also predominantly exhibit nematic behaviour. The industrial use of liquid crystalline crosslinking agents for the synthesis of mesogenic networks has hitherto foundered because of the costly synthesis of compounds of this type, which cannot be employed in an economically and technically feasible manner on an industrial scale. Multistage syntheses using protective groups are necessary in many cases, as described, for example, by M. Ando and T. Uryu in J. Polymer Science, Part A, 28, 2575-84 (1990) for liquid crystalline diacrylates. This publication describes the general procedure which was known hitherto for the synthesis of crosslinking agents of this type, which consists of reacting previously prepared bifunction mesogens, which comprise aromatically bonded para-substituted reactive OH, COOH or NH 2 groups or halogen atoms, mainly fluorine, bromine or iodine, in a Williamson ether synthesis with an excess of an ,-dihalo- or dihydroxyalkane, whereby the polyalkylene chains which are necessary as spacers are introduced. If ,-dihydroxyalkanes are used, an OH function generally has to be protected by a suitable reversible protective group before di-substitution. A reaction with compounds which contain a group which is capable of polymerization is not effected until the end, optionally after the removal of the protective groups. The groups which are employed as crosslinking groups are frequently those which are only capable of reacting with themselves or with a limited selection of other groups. Examples include the aforementioned acrylate, methacrylate and vinyl ether functions, which crosslink in addition polymerization reactions with compounds which contain groups of the same type or similar groups, or such as glycidyl ethers, which react with few other compounds, such as dicarboxylic acids, anhydrides or diamines. Moreover, liquid crystalline crosslinking agents which comprise said active crosslinking groups always require initiators or catalysts in order to initiate the reaction. The object of the present invention was to identify liquid crystalline crosslinking agents which can be produced in as simple a manner as possible, and which can be produced in a simpler, less costly manner, even on an industrial scale, than the mesogenic crosslinking agents known hitherto, which could only be obtained in laboratory syntheses. At the same time, the object was to identify a method which was equally suitable for the production of as many different products as possible which differ only as regards their mesogen and by the length of their spacer group, so as to produce suitable products for as many areas of application as possible. In order to achieve this object, the number of reaction steps required for the formation of liquid crystalline crosslinking agents have had to be significantly reduced and the few steps which were required must proceed with a high yield and be only slightly dependent, or not dependent at all, on the structure of the reactants. The present invention relates to bismaleimides comprising mesogenic groups, which consist, corresponding to formula (I) given below, of two reactive terminal maleimide groups which are linked via linear or singly alkyl-substituted alkylene chains A, which are linked to an aromatic mesogen M via ester, amide or ether groups, wherein A independently represents an alkylene chain comprising 3 to 20 CH 2 groups, wherein one C atom of each alkylene chain A can be chiral due to alkyl substitution, X independently represents C(O)O, C(O)NH or O, and M represents a mesogen consisting of at least two rings including an aromatic or a heterocyclic ring, which are linked para to each other by single bond, CH 2 CH 2 , CHCH, CC, ester (COO), amide (CONH), methylstilbene (C(CH 3 CH), azomethine (CHN), azine (CHNNCH), azo (NN) or azoxy (N(O)N) groups, and which can be mono- or di-substituted by alkyl groups, wherein the terminal aromatic rings are each substituted in the para position to these linking groups by an O or NH group of X, and R independently represents an H atom, an alkyl group comprising 1 to 8 C atoms, a phenyl ring or a halogen atom. Unless otherwise stated, the term alkyl denotes a hydrocarbon group comprising 1 to 5 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and pentyl, including the isomers thereof. Methyl is preferred. The bismaleimides of formula (I) according to the invention can be produced from maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids, the single-stage synthesis of which is described in EP-A-0 847 991, by linking the acid chlorides thereof, which can be obtained in a simple manner and in good yield, with difunctional aromatic mesogens. Therefore, the present invention further relates to a method of producing bismaleimides comprising mesogenic groups of general formula (I) as defined above, in which X represents C(O)) or C(O)NH, wherein maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids of general formula wherein R and A are as defined above, are converted into the corresponding acid chloride, 2 equivalents of the acid chloride are reacted with a compound of formula HOMOH or H 2 NMNH 2 , wherein M is defined above, in a suitable solvent, optionally in the presence of a catalyst and/or an acid acceptor, and at a temperature of 0 to 70 C., and the bismaleimide is isolated. The essential advantage of the maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids which are described in EP-A-0 847 991 and which are used for the production of bismaleimides of formula (I) according to the present invention is that the polymerisable function comprising a spacer group, which consists of 1 to 20, preferably of 3 to 12 CH 2 groups, one of which can be chiral due to substitution by alkyl, already exists in them, and is linked to a reactive, terminal COOH group. The bismaleimides comprising mesogenic groups according to the invention which are produced in this manner may exhibit liquid crystalline or non-liquid crystalline behaviours above their melting point. This depends both on the length of the alkylene spacers and on the type of mesogenic group. However, non-liquid crystalline bismaleimides can be converted into liquid crystalline bismaleimides by secondary reactions such as addition reactions, and can be further used as such. Aliphatic maleimides can be homopolymerized by a radical mechanism, and can be polymerized with numerous other monomers, such as acrylates, methacrylates and vinyl compounds, such as styrene for example. Furthermore, the maleimide function enters into thermal, catalysed, uncatalysed and photochemical reactions with a multiplicity of other functional groups. Examples include the reactions thereof with glycidyl ethers, allyl ethers and esters, vinyl ethers, isocyano-esters, dithiols, diamines and phenylacetylenes. Compared with known liquid crystalline diacrylates, dimethacrylates, divinyl ethers and diglycidyl ethers, liquid crystalline bismaleimides thus exhibit a more versatile reaction behaviour, and in principle are thus outstandingly suitable for the synthesis of a multiplicity of LC networks. According to the teaching of EP-A-0 847 991, maleimidocarboxylic acids can be produced in one step and in good yields from maleic anhydride and ,-aminocarboxylic acids. The ,-aminocarboxylic acids which are required therefore can be obtained industrially with different alkylene chain lengths between (CH 2 ) 1 and (CH 2 ) 20 . Maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids with alkylene chain lengths of (CH 2 ) 3 to (CH 3 ) 12 are the most preferred starting materials for the production of liquid crystalline crosslinking agents, since they already contain, in one molecule, a polymerisable or crosslinkable function and a spacer group of suitable and selectable chain length. Compared with methods known hitherto for the production of liquid crystalline crosslinking agents, this is a decisive advantage industrially. The terminal carboxyl group of maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids enables them to be reacted with a difunctional mesogen, in only one or at most two reaction steps, to form liquid crystalline crosslinking agents. Numerous reactions which are known in the art for the production of esters or acid amines are suitable for coupling maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids to OH or NH 2 functional mesogens, such as the reaction of acid chlorides with alcohols or amines in the presence of an acid scavenger, transesterification, or condensation with the separation of water. One preferred method of producing bismaleimides according to the invention is the reaction of maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acid chlorides with OH-functional mesogens in the presence of basic acid scavengers. Bismaleimides according to the invention which comprise amide linkages can be produced analogously from NH 2 -functional mesogens and maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acid chlorides. The requisite acid chlorides can be produced, in a simple synthesis which proceeds to completion, from maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids by reaction with thionyl chloride, sulphuryl chloride or oxalyl chloride, wherein thionyl and oxalyl chlorides are preferred. Examples of suitable maleimidocarboxylic acids, to which the present invention is not exclusively restricted, however, include maleimidoacetic acid, maleimidopropionic acid, maleimidobutyric acid, D- and L-maleimidoisobutyric acids, maleimidocaproic acid, maleimidoheptanoic acid, maleimidononanoic acid, maleimidoundecanoic acid, maleimidododecanoic acid, 2-methylmaleimidocaproic acid, 2-methylmaleimidounecanoic acid, 2,3-dimethylmaleimidobutyric acid and 2,3-dimethyl-maleimidoundecanoic acid, wherein bismaleimides of long chain maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids exhibit better liquid crystalline properties. These maleimidoalkylcarboxylic acids can be converted into their acid chlorides, in a simple manner and in quantitative yields, with thionyl chloride, sulphuryl chloride, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus oxychloride or oxalyl chloride, wherein thionyl and oxalyl chloride are preferred, in suitable solvents, advantageously in halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, 1,1,2-trichloroethane or 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, at temperatures of 0 to 100 C., preferably 0 to 70 C., optionally in the presence of acid scavengers such as tertiary amines or pyridine. These acid chlorides can be converted into bismaleimides according to the invention by their reactions, which are known in the art, with aromatic mesogens M corresponding to general structure (III) as shown below, with the formation of ester or amide bonds, wherein ester bond linkages are preferred: where XO or NH; and if N is present: NCOO, CONH, CHCH, C(CH 3 )CH, CC, NN, N(O)N, CHN or CHNNCH. The mesogens M must contain two OH or NH 2 groups which are reactive with acid chlorides and must contain at least two aromatic rings which are linked para to each other by single, double or triple CC bonds or by azo, azoxy, ester, amide, azomethine or azine groups, and which can be mono- or di-substituted in any position by alkyl groups or halogen atoms. An aromatic ring can be replaced by a heterocyclic ring, such as pyrimidine or 1,3-dioxane. Examples of mesogens which are suitable for the formation of bismaleimides according to the invention are the following: 4,4-dihydroxybiphenyl, 4,4-dihydroxyterphenyl, 4,4-dihydroxydiphenyl-acetylene, 4,4-dihydroxystilbene, 4,4-dihydroxymethylstilbene, 4,4-dihydroxy-azobenzene, 4,4-dihydroxyazoxybenzene, 4-hydroxyphenyl-4-hydroxy-benzoate, 4-aminophenyl-4-aminobenzoate, hydroquinone-bis-(4-hydroxybenzoate), 2-methyl-hydroquinone-1,4-bis-(4-hydroxybenzoate), bi-phenylyl-4,4-bis-(4-hydroxy-benzoate), 1,4-naphthylene-bis-(4-hydroxybenzoate), 1,5-naphthylene-bis-(4-hydroxybenzoate), 4,4-dihydroxydiphenylazomethine, 4,4-dihydroxydiphenylazine, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-hydroxypyrimidine, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-hydroxy-1,3-dioxane, and N,N-terephthalylidene-bis(4-hydroxybenzene). The mesogens which are particularly preferred for the production of bismaleimides which crosslink above 100 C. with the formation of liquid crystalline phases are 4-hydroxyphenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, hydroquinone-bis(4-hydroxybenzoate), 2-methylhydroquinone-1,4-bis(4-hydroxybenzoate) and diphenylyl-4,4-bis(4-hydroxybenzoate). These mesogens can be produced from inexpensive compounds in a simple manner and in one step, even on a large scale, according to the teaching of the DE-OS 3622611 or as described by F. N. Jones et al. Polym. Preprints ACS, 30(2), 462 (1989), and are therefore particularly suitable for the commercial production of bismaleimides according to the invention. Bismaleimides of general structure 1 in which X represents an ether linkage can also be produced. Thus -haloalkylmaleimides, preferably -bromoalkylmaleimides comprising 1 to 20, preferably 3 to 12, CH 2 groups which are linked linearly to each other, and which may also contain a chiral centre obtained by alkyl substitution, preferably by methyl substitution, can be linked to form bismaleimides by methods comprising Williamson ether synthesis under mild reaction conditions with the aromatic para-hydroxy-substituted mesogens cited above by way of example. Therefore, the present invention further relates to a method of producing bismaleimides of formula (I), wherein X represents O, in which 2 equivalents of a halogenated N-alkylmaleimide of general formula wherein R and A are as defined above and Hal represents a halogen atom, are reacted with a compound of general formula HOMOH, wherein M is defined as above, in a suitable solvent, in the presence of a catalyst or an acid acceptor, and at a temperature of 20 to 200 C., preferably 50 to 150 C., and the bismaleimides are isolated. -haloalkylmaleimides can be obtained from -hydroxyalkylmaleimides by reaction with a halogenating agent such as PX 3 , POX 3 or PX 5 , wherein X represents Cl or Br. Another method of producing the desired -haloalkylmaleimides is the reaction of an alkali metal salt of maleinimide or of 7-oxabicycloheptene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid imide, which can be obtained in a simple manner by the Diels-Alder reaction of furane with maleinimide, with an excess of an ,-dihaloalkane, wherein ,-dibromoalkanes comprising 3 to 12 CH 2 groups are preferred. The desired -haloalkylmaleimides can be isolated from the reaction mixture by filtering off the alkali metal halide and preferably by removing the excess of ,-dihaloalkane by distillation, wherein the furane is also removed when 7-oxabicycloheptene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid imide is used. The reaction of the -haloalkylmaleimides, which are produced in this manner, with para-substituted OH-functional mesogens of general formula (III) is advantageously conducted in the presence of dry K 2 CO 3 in a dipolar aprotic solvent, such as acetone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone or dimethylformamide, wherein acetone is preferred, with the addition of a catalytic amount of potassium iodide. Alternatively, bismaleimides of general formula (I) according to the invention, wherein X represents O, can be produced by method in which (i) a compound of general formula HOMOH, wherein M is as defined above, is reacted with 2 equivalents of an ,-haloalkane nitrile of general formula HalACN, wherein Hal represents a halogen atom and A represents an alkylene chain comprising 2 to 19 CH 2 groups, and wherein one C atom of each alkylene chain A can be chiral due to alkyl substitution, in a suitable aprotic dipolar solvent, in the presence of a catalyst and/or of an acid acceptor, and at a temperature of 20 to 200 C., preferably 50 to 150 C., to form an ,-dinitrile of general formula NCAOMOACN, wherein A and M are as defined above, (ii) the ,-dinitrile is reduced with a complex metal hydride in the presence of a strong acid with subsequent hydrolysis to form the corresponding ,-diamine of general formula H 2 NCH 2 AOMOACH 2 NH 2 , wherein A and M are as defined above, and (iii) the ,-diamine is imidised with two equivalents of a maleic anhydride of general formula wherein R is as defined above, in a mixture consisting of an aliphatic carboxylic acid and an aromatic hydrocarbon at a temperature of 100 to 180 C., with the separation of water, to form the liquid crystalline bismaleimides. In this method, the Williamson ether synthesis described above is first effected between the aforementioned exemplary aromatic para-hydroxy-substituted mesogens and 2 equivalents of an ,-haloalkane nitrile, preferably in the presence of dry K 2 CO 3 in a dipolar aprotic solvent, such as acetone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone or dimethylformamide for example, wherein acetone is preferred, with the addition of a catalytic amount of potassium iodide, within the temperature range from 20 to 200 C., preferably 50 to 150 C. The ,-haloalkane nitriles which are preferably used are ,-bromoalkane nitriles comprising 3 to 12 CH 2 groups, one of which may be chiral due to alkyl substitution, preferably methyl substitution. The nitrile groups are then reduced to amines by methods known in the art, e.g. by reduction with complex metal hydrides in the presence of a strong acid, by LiAlH 4 /H 2 SO 4 for example, as described by N. M. Yoon and H. C. Brown in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 90, 2927 (1968). The diamines which are thus obtained are then reacted with equivalent amounts of unsubstituted or substituted maleic anhydride by methods of cyclisation which are likewise known, for example by heating in aliphatic carboxylic acids with the azeotropic removal of water by an aromatic entraining agent according to the teaching of EP-A-0 847 991, to form bismaleimides according to the invention which comprise ether linkages. Bismaleimides according to the invention which comprise ether linkages can also be produced from diamines and maleic anhydride by the method described by C. Komehl, H.- I. Nagel and A. Phal in Agnewandte Makromolekulare Chemie 227, 139-57 (1995), wherein two equivalents of maleic anhydride are reacted with one equivalent of a diamine in dimethylformamide in the presence of one equivalent of acetic anhydride and of a catalyst constituting of nickel(II) acetate and triethylamine, at temperatures of 90 to 105 C., to form aliphatic bismaleimides. The melting temperatures and the occurrence of liquid crystalline behaviour on melting, which can be observed under the polarising microscope in the form of multi-coloured textures which are generally nematic, depends on the length of the alkylene spacers and on the type of linking between the alkylene spacers and the mesogenic group, and also depends on the type of mesogenic group used. In general, bismaleimides comprising alkylene spacers with fewer than 3 CH 2 groups are not liquid crystalline. The more para-linked rings which are present in the mesogenic group, the more is liquid crystalline behaviour to be anticipated at average alkylene spacer lengths between (CH 2 ) 5 and (CH 2 ) 10 . Thus bismaleimides comprising (CH 2 ) 5 and (CH 2 ) 10 chains and only two para-substituted benzene rings do not yet exhibit liquid crystalline properties. Furthermore, the occurrence of liquid crystallinity also depends on the mutual interactions of the mesogenic groups in the melt. Since the bismaleimides according to the invention, which are of particular interest commercially since they can be obtained from simple precursors, either do not exhibit liquid crystalline behaviour or only have very narrow LC temperature ranges above 100 C. which limit their suitability for the formation of liquid crystalline networks to relatively narrow ranges of crosslinking temperatures, a further object of the present invention was to modify the bismaleimides according to the invention, by reactions which are as simple as possible and which as far as possible proceed to completion, so that their liquid crystalline transition range becomes wider or so that liquid crystallinity occurs anyway. Therefore, the present invention also relates to oligomeric liquid crystalline bismaleimides of general formula (II) wherein A, X, M and R are as defined above, n represents an integer from 1 to 100 and B represents piperazinyl or a divalent radical which is derived from a primary or secondary para-substituted cyclic diamine, wherein B is bonded via the amino groups of the diamine. The oligomeric liquid crystalline bismaleimides of general formula (II) according to the invention are produced from liquid crystalline bismaleimides of general formula (I) by the oligomerisation thereof by a Michael addition, in a suitable solvent, with half to one equivalent of a para-substituted aromatic, alicyclic or heterocyclic primary or secondary amine at a temperature of 0 to 80 C., preferably 20 to 50 C., and the reaction products are isolated by methods known in the art. In this reaction, what are termed aspartimide linkages are formed between the diamines and the bismaleimides of general formula (I). The bismaleimides of general formula (I) which are preferably reacted are those in which the maleimide double bonds comprise H atoms or one methyl group only. The choice of solvent is not critical. Halogenated hydrocarbons, tertiary amides and ethers can be used for example, as well as mixtures thereof. Cyclic 1,4-diamines are preferably used in the method according to the invention of producing oligomeric liquid crystalline bismaleimides. Examples thereof include p-phenylenediamine, 4,4-diaminobiphenyl, 4,4-diamino-3,3,5,5-tetramethyl-biphenyl and N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine. Oligomeric compounds of this type can be described in terms of general structure IV: where Z1,4-phenylene or 4,4-biphenylene, and SH or CH 3 , wherein A, M, R and X have the same meanings as described for structure (I) and n denotes an integer between 1 and 100. The reaction of bismaleimides with piperazine is particularly preferred, and results in liquid crystalline bismaleimides of general structure (V): where A, M, R ad X have the same meanings as those described for structure (I) and n denotes an integer between 1 and 100. The reaction of bismaleimides according to the invention with half an equivalent of a cyclic diamine essentially results in bisaspartimides with n1, wherein oligomers with N1 can still be formed, depending on the temperature of reaction. In contrast, the reaction of one equivalent of a cyclic diamine with a bismaleimide results in oligomers with n1. In cases such as these, where the mixtures obtained are soluble in CHCl 3 or tetrahydrofuran, chromatographically separated individual products are obtained by gel permeation chromatography which comprise 1 to 10 repeating units and a proportion of higher polymers with molecular weights up to 20,000 g/mole. On average, both types of product comprise two terminal maleimide groups per oligomer molecule, which are available for further reaction. Chain extension of bismaleimides according to the invention with diamines, wherein piperazine is preferred, results in a plurality of significant improvements in properties. Thus the liquid crystalline temperature range, even for bisaspartimides (n1), is for the most part considerably broadened compared with the corresponding bismaleimides. Thus the bismaleimide formed from 2 moles of maleimidohexanoic acid chloride and one mole of hydroquinone-bis(4-hydroxybenzoate) exhibits a nematic phase under the polarising microscope between 125 and 140 C., whilst the reaction product thereof with one mole of piperazine exhibits a nematic phase between 100 and about 325 C. Similar broadenings of the liquid crystalline temperature range are also observed for other LC bismaleimides and are due to an increase in the typical length/diameter ratio of the liquid crystalline bismaleimides. In this connection, the liquid crystalline temperature ranges also depend on the temperature of formation of the polyaspartimides, since in the upper region of the given reaction temperature range more products of higher molecular weight are formed, the mesogenic phases of which occur at higher temperatures than those which are produced at room temperature. A characteristic of all low and high molecular weight bismaleimides according to the invention is their capacity for thermal crosslinking at temperatures above 200 C., which is due to thermal crosslinking bis maleimide groups. Depending on the mesogen used and on the alkylene spacer length, crosslinking may either occur in the mesogenic phase or may first occur in the isotropic phase above the clear point. If para-substituted primary aromatic diamines are used for chain extension, the more weakly basic secondary amino groups of the aspartimide groups can also react with the maleimide double bonds by a Michael addition at higher temperatures above 150 C. Piperazine-modified products are therefore preferred in many cases. In each case, liquid crystalline compounds are present which are capable of thermal crosslinking. It is also of considerable practical importance that liquid crystalline properties are imparted by this modification even to those bismaleimides which do in fact contain mesogenic groups but which still do not exhibit liquid crystalline behaviour. Thus, for example, 4,4-biphenyl-bis(oxycarbonylpentylmaleimide) itself does not exhibit a liquid crystalline transition, but merely exhibits a melting point at 110 C., wherein the melt remains isotropic under the polarising microscope. In contrast, the oligomeric reaction product with half an equivalent of piperazine exhibits, after isolation, a broad melting range up to 114 C. and moreover exhibits a nematic texture. The isolated oligomeric product from the reaction with one equivalent of piperazine exhibits a transition from the crystalline phase to the nematic phase at 79 C. and has a clear point of 180 C. The solubility of piperazine-modified bismaleimides in many organic solvents is also better than that of bismaleimide starting materials, which is important for many applications. The present invention embraces a liquid crystalline medium for electro-optical display, which comprises one or more than one mesogenic-group-containing bismaleimide and/or oligomeric bismaleimide obtained by oligomerization of the mesogenic-group-containing bismaleimide according to the present invention. The liquid crystalline medium for electro-optical display of the present invention may contain, as the one or more than one bismaleimide and/or oligomeric bismaleimide according to the present invention, at least one compound selected from the group of conventionally known liquid crystalline compounds within an extent not impairing the advantages of the present invention such as liquid crystallinity. Specific examples of the conventionally known liquid crystalline compound include biphenyl compounds, terphenyl compounds, phenyl or cyclohexyl benzoate compounds, phenyl or cyclohexyl cyclohexanecarboxylate compounds, phenyl or cyclohexyl cyclohexexylbenzoate compounds, phenyl or cyclohexyl cyclohexylcyclohexanecarboxylate compounds, cyclohexylphenyl benzoate compounds, cyclohexylphenyl cyclohexanecarboxylate compounds, cyclohexylphenyl cyclohexylcyclohexanecarboxylate compounds, phenylcyclohexane compounds, cyclohexylbiphenyl compounds, phenylcyclohexylcyclohexane compounds, cyclohexylcyclohexane compounds, cyclohexylcyclohexene compounds, cyclohexylcyclohexylcyclohexene compounds, 1,4-bis-cyclohexylbenzene compounds, 4,4-bis-cyclohexylbiphenyl compounds, phenyl- or cyclohexyl-pyrimidine compounds, phenyl- or cyclohexylpyridine compounds, phenyl- or cyclohexyldioxane compounds, phenyl- or cyclohexyl-1,3-dithian compounds, 1,2-diphenylethane compounds, 1,2-dicyclohexylethane compounds, 1-phenyl-2-cclohexylethane compounds, 1-cyclohexyl-2-(4-phenylcyclohexyl)ethane compounds, 1-cyclohexyl-2-biphenylethane compounds, 1-phenyl-2-cyclohexylphenylethane compounds and tolan compounds and fluorinated compounds thereof. Since the above-exemplified compounds differ in melting point and liquid crystallinity, a liquid crystalline composition suited for various liquid crystalline media can be prepared using a plurality of them in combination. Bismaleimides according to the invention and aspartimide oligomers thereof are capable of forming liquid crystalline networks in solution or in the melt by crosslinking, either purely thermally or with radical initiators. When used as additives in amounts of 5-50% by weight, commercially available aromatic bismaleimide resins give rise to an improvement in the mechanical properties, primarily the toughness, of the cured products. They can also form liquid crystalline networks in combination with other unsaturated monomers, oligomers and reactive polymers. The synthesis and properties of bismaleimides according to the invention can be demonstrated by means of the following examples.

The batch was subsequently stirred for a further 15 hours at room temperature, the turbid, solids-containing mixture was filtered off and the filtrate was stirred into in 900 ml H 2 O. The resulting colourless solid was recrystallised from 200 ml toluene/ethanol (1:1). Yield: 8.25 g56% theoretical.

EXAMPLE 3 2-methylhydroquinone-bis(maleimidopentylcarbonyloxybenzoate) 1.4 g (3.8 mmole) 2-methylhydroquinone-bis(4-hydroxybenzoate) were dissolved, with stirring and under N 2 , in a mixture of 30 g dimethylformamide and 0.9 g triethylamine, in a 50 ml round bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer bar and an N 2 gas inlet tube. The mixture was cooled on an ice bath to 0 to 5 C. and 2.0 g (8.6 mmole) maleimidohexanoic acid chloride was added drop-wise over 10 minutes. The batch was subsequently stirred for a further 15 hours at room temperature, the turbid, solids-containing mixture was filtered off and the filtrate was poured into 500 ml of iced water with stirring. In the course of this procedure, a white glutinous precipitate was deposited on the wall of the glass beaker.

The resulting yellow precipitate was washed with water and recrystallised from 200 ml methanol, 1.5 g of insoluble residue being filtered off hot. A total of 6.2 g of recrystallised product was isolated and was recrystallised again from methanol, with the bulk of the first crystallised product remaining undissolved. Since this residue only exhibited a weak OH band in its IR spectrum at 3400 cm 1 , the product was recrystallised a third time from 50 ml methanol. After isolation and drying under vacuum, 1.6 g of the desired product were isolated, which had a purity of 95% as determined by NMR and liquid chromatography.

To the resulting suspension, 220 ml of a dichloromethane solution of 3,4-dihydropyrane (22.2 g) were added dropwise over about 1 hour while maintaining the temperature at not higher than 10 C. The reaction mixture was then stirred at room temperature for about 4 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere. When the reaction mixture became a uniform brown solution, the progress of the reaction was checked by thin-layer chromatography or gas chromatography.

These transition metal complexes are widely used in the hydrogenation of organic double or triple bonds, in particular olefinic double bonds and carbon-heteroatom double bonds. The complexes are particularly suitable for enantioselective hydrogenation using chiral ferrocenyldiphosphines and corresponding prochiral unsaturated compounds. Ferrocenyldiphosphines having a functional group in the 1 position are also important intermediates for ferrocenyldiphosphine ligands and their metal complexes of d-8 metals such as rhodium, ruthenium, palladium or iridium which are bound to inorganic polymeric supports via this functional group.
