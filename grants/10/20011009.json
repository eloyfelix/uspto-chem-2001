Pigment dispersions making use of the above dispersants are suited for the production of writing or recording pigment inks. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION a) Field of the Invention This invention relates to dispersants for organic pigments (hereinafter simply referred to as pigments), pigment dispersions and writing or recording pigment inks, and more specifically to pigment dispersants and also to pigment dispersions making use of the pigment dispersants, having excellent fluidity, dispersion stability, storage stability and the like and suited especially for the production of writing or recording pigment inks. b) Description of the Related Art Marking inks for use in writing instruments, which make use of bundled fiber tips or felt tips, have conventionally been made of resins, pigments and solvents, and as the pigments, dyes have been employed. As the solvents, ester or aromatic solvents have been used from the standpoint of solubility for the resins and also solubility for the dyes. It is however desired to avoid use of aromatic solvents, because they give deleterious effects on the health of workers (organic solvent intoxication) and they themselves are air pollutants. Although there is a move toward water-based writing inks, solvent-based maker pens are still employed widely. This can be attributed to the excellent writing performance of solvent-based inks on plastic films such as polyethylene films and also to the superb drying characteristics of the solvent-based inks shortly after written on plastic films. Ink-jet printing, on the other hand, is a digital printing controlled by a computer. Printing information signals are supplied to a printer directly from the computer, so that no plate-making is needed. Ink-jet printing is therefore suited particularly for the printing of various images in small numbers of copies, and recent advancements in ink-jet printers have made it possible to perform printing of a variety of highly-detailed large images. Ink-jet printing inks are required to have low viscosity and excellent stability. There are organic-solvent-based inks making use of dyes, but as pigment-type inks, water-based inks are used because ink-jet printing inks making use of pigments involve technical difficulties. However, water-based inks contain, as vehicles, resins at extremely low concentrations so that good color developments are not available. Water-based inks are also accompanied by a problem of adhesion to plastic films. Under these circumstances, there is a strong desire for the development of alcohol-based ink-jet printing inks making use of pigments and assuring good color developments. Incidentally, as is observed from paints and the like, the conventional technology expects much on the dispersing power of a resin for a pigment upon dispersing the pigment on a resin solution. When the dispersing power of the resin is insufficient for the pigment, a pigment dispersant (pigment treatment) (hereinafter simply referred to as a pigment dispersant) has been employed. in general paints, sufficient dispersion of pigments is feasible with conventional dispersants. Compared with paints, however, writing or recording pigment inks are required to have extremely low viscosity and in addition, to have an extremely high degree of dispersion of pigments. Despite these requirements, use of conventional resins and dispersants is unable to achieve sufficient dispersion of pigments or leads to changes in the viscosity of pigment dispersions along the passage of time due to desorption of the dispersant from the pigments and insufficient compatibility between the pigments and the resins, thereby making it extremely difficult to obtain pigment dispersions which meet the property and performance requirements. If an alcoholic solvent such as ethanol can be used as a solvent in an organic-solvent-based pigment ink, deleterious effects on the health of users of writing instruments and people studying or working in the same environment as the users can be reduced, the problem of air pollution can be lessened owing to the avoidance of an organic solvent, and further, the problems of drying characteristics and wetting to plastic films, said problems being inherent to water-based inks, can also be eliminated. Moverover, alcoholic solvents are resources reproducible in the natural world so that use of such solvents is preferred. Nonetheless, with resins soluble in conventionally-known alcoholic solvents, it is still extremely difficult to obtain pigment inks satisfactory in the requirements for low viscosity, high dispersion and high dispersion stability even if dispersants are used. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a dispersant which is excellent in the dispersibility of pigments and permits production of a pigment dispersion excellent in the stability of viscosity. Another object of the present invention is to provide a pigment dispersion, writing ink or recording ink, which is using a pigment as a coloring matter, contains a resinwhich is soluble in an organic solvent, especially an alcoholic solventin a sufficient. amount relative to the pigment, has a low viscosity, good pigment dispersibility and excellent viscosity stability, and gives less deleterious effects on the health of a user of a writing instrument or recording apparatus and people studying or working in the same environment as the user. To achieve the above-described objects, the present invention provides an dispersant for organic pigments, comprising a compound represented by the following formula (I): wherein X and X each independently represent a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group, a primary, secondary or tertiary amino group, or an acylamino group; Y represents an anthraquinonylamino, phenylamino or phenoxy group having a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group, a primary, secondary or tertiary amino group, or an acylamino group at the 4-position or 5-position thereof; A and B each independently represent an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group or an aryl group, and at least one of A and B has at least one substituent group containing a basic nitrogen atom; and Z represents a hydrogen atom, a cyano group, a halogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, a nitro group, a benzoylamino group or a 3-benzoyl group, and the 3-benzoyl group may be fused together with X to form an acridone ring; a pigment dispersion comprising an organic pigment, a dispersant, a film-forming resin and an organic solvent, wherein the dispersant is the above-described dispersant; a writing or recording pigment ink comprising the dispersion; and a writing instrument or recording apparatus comprising the ink (the pigment dispersion and the writing ink or recording ink will hereinafter be collectively called the ink). The term at least one substituent group containing a basic nitrogen atom as used herein may mean a primary, secondary or tertiary amino group, a quaternary ammonium group or a pyridinium group, with a tertiary amino group being particularly preferred. The dispersant according to the present invention is useful as a dispersant for a variety of conventionally-known pigments, especially as a dispersant for various pigments used as coloring matters in inks, various paints, various printing inks, various, pigment printing agents and synthetic resins. In particular, use of the dispersant according to the present invention by adding it as a dispersant to red, green yellow and purple inks makes it possible to stably produce low-viscosity inks and eventually to obtain excellent inks.

Conventionally-known organic solvents employed in various paints, coating formulations, printing inks and the like are all usable as organic solvents in the present invention. When using inks according to the present invention as inks for writing instruments or recording apparatuses, use of alcoholic solvents is preferred. As alcoholic solvents, solvents containing alcohols the boiling points of which are 150 C. or lower are preferred. Alcohols amount to at least 10 wt. %, preferably to 50 to 100 wt. % of alcoholic solvents. Preferred examples of alcohols can include ethanol, propanol, methoxypropanol, ethoxypropanol, and propyloxyethanol. They can be used either singly or in combination. Solvents other than these alcohols can also be used to extents not contrary to the spirit of the present invention. For example, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, ethyl-cyclohexane, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl propyl ketone and the like can be used in combination. The film-forming resin (hereinafter simply referred to as a resin) employed in the present invention is required to be soluble in the above-described organic solvent, especially the alcoholic solvent described above. Such a resin comprises, as constituent monomers, an addition-polymerizing monomer containing a carboxyl group, a hydroxyl group or an amido group and a monomer addition-polymerizable with the addition-polymerizing monomer. A description will hereinafter be made about the monomers which make up the resin for use in the present invention. Examples of the carboxyl-containing monomer can include acrylic acid and methacrylic acid; fumaric acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, alkyl monoesters thereof, and hydroxyalkyl monoesters thereof; and monoesters between hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates, such as hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate and hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, and dibasic acids, for example, succinic anhydride, phthalic anhydride and cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid anhydride. Incidentally, acrylic acid and methacrylic acid will be called (meth)acrylic acid in the present invention. Examples of the hydroxyl-containing monomer can include hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates, for example, hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate and hydropropyl (meth)acrylate; esters of monoesters between the above-described hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates and dibasic acids with dihydroxyalkyl compounds, for example, monoesters of monoesters between hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate and hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate and succinic acid, phthalic acid and cyclohexanecarboxylic acid with dihydroxyalkyl compounds such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol. The carbon numbers of the alkyl groups in the above-described carboxyl- and hydroxyl-containing monomers range from about 1 to 12. Examples of the amido-containing monomer can include (meth)acrylamides and N-substituted (meth)acrylamides, for example, (meth)acrylic butoxymethylamide, N-tert-butylacrylamide, N-tert-butylmethacrylamide, diacetoneacrylamide, N-isopropylacrylamide, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, N,N-diethylacrylamide, N-methylol-(meth)acrylamide, and N-alkyloxyethyl(meth)acrylamide. In addition to the above-described monomers, addition-polymerizing monomers copolymerizable with the above-described respective monomers can be used to extents soluble in the alcoholic solvent in order to impart waterproofness, flexibility and/or other physical properties to the resin. Examples of such monomers can include (meth)acrylate esters, for example, methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, propyl (meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate, octyl (meth)acrylate, lauryl (meth)acrylate, stearyl (meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl (meth)acrylate, benzyl (meth)acrylate, isobornyl (meth)acrylate, and tetrafulfuryl (meth)acrylate; styrene and styrene derivatives, for example, -methylstyrene; dialkyl esters of dibasic acids, for example, dialkyl maleates, dialkyl fumarates, and dialkyl itaconates; and vinyl acetate, and (meth)acrylonitrile. The resin for use in the present invention can be obtained by using the above-described monomers and copolymerizing them, for example, by suspension polymerization or solution polymerization, which uses an alcoholic solvent, in the presence or absence of a conventionally-known radical polymerization initiator. As a resin for use in the present invention, it is preferred to use a resin in which a monomer between an alkyl (meth)acrylate and a dibasic acidsaid monomer being represented by the following formula: CH 2 C(R 1 )COOR 2 OCOR 3 COOH in which R 1 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, R 2 represents an alkylene chain which contains 2 to 6 carbon atoms and may contain a branched chain, R 3 represents an alkylene group which may contain a branched chain or unsaturated groupis copolymerized at least a part of a copolymer. A blend of the copolymer with a copolymer free of the above-described specific monomers may also be used. Whichever resin is used, it is preferred to contain units of a monoester monomer between hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate and a dibasic acid in a proportion of from 1 to 50 wt. %, preferably from 3 to 40 wt. % based on the whole resin. If the content of the monomer units is too low, the resin is not very effective for dispersing pigments. If the content of the monomer units is too high, on the other hand, writing matter or printed matter has lowered alkali resistance. It is therefore not preferred to contain the monomer units outside the above range. To obtain the resin by copolymerizing a mixture of the above-described monomers, the monoester of the hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate and the dibasic acid may account preferably for 1 to 50 wt. %, more preferably for 3 to 40 wt. % of the monomer mixture. The proportion(s) of other monomer(s) can be suitably determined such that the resulting resin is soluble in the alcoholic solvent and can satisfy its performance requirements, and no particular limitation is imposed on their proportions. The number average molecular weight of the resin (the number average molecular weight as obtained by measuring the resin by GPC and converting the data with reference to the corresponding data of standard polystyrene) ranges generally from 2,000 to 100,000, preferably from 2,000 to 50,000. The acid value of the resin ranges generally from 0.5 to 300 mgKOH/g, preferably from 5 to 180 mgKOH/mg. The ink according to the present invention can be produced in a similar manner as in the production of conventional inks and paints by using the above-described pigment, dispersant, film-forming resin and organic solvent, and no particular limitation is imposed on the production method itself. Illustrative productions methods can include a method in which the pigment, subsequent to its advance treatment with the dispersant, is dispersed in a solution of the resin in an alcoholic solvent; and a method in which the untreated pigment and the dispersant are mixed with the resin solution and the pigment is subjected to dispersion processing in a disperser. When the method that the pigment, subsequent to its advance treatment with the dispersant, is dispersed in the solution of the resin in the alcoholic solvent is adopted, the treatment of the pigment can be practiced, for example, as will be described next. (1) Subsequent to dissolution of the pigment and the dispersant in sulfuric acid or the like, the resultant solution is poured into water. The thus-obtained mixture is alkalinized to have both of the pigment and dispersant precipitated as a solid solution. The solid solution is collected by filtration, washed with water, dried and then ground, whereby the pigment is obtained in a treated form. (2) The dispersant is converted into a salt with sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, acetic acid or the like. The salt is mixed with the pigment in water and, if necessary, the resultant mixture is subjected to dispersion processing in a disperser to have the dispersant adsorbed on pigment surfaces. The thus-treated pigment is caused to precipitate under alkaline condition, collected by filtration, washed with water, dried and then ground, whereby the pigment is obtained in the treated form. (3) The dispersant is dissolved in a liquid organic acid such as acetic acid, followed by the addition of the pigment. After the dispersant is allowed to be adsorbed on pigment surfaces with optional dispersing processing in a disperser, the thus-treated pigment is collected by filtration, washed with an alkaline solution, washed with water, dried and then ground, whereby the pigment is obtained in the treated form. The treated pigment obtained as described above is dispersed in the solution of the resin in an alcoholic solvent to produce the ink of the present invention. When the method that the untreated pigment and the dispersant are mixed with the resin solution and the pigment is subjected to dispersion processing in a disperser is adopted, the pigment and the dispersant are added to the solution of the resin in the alcoholic solvent and subsequent to optional provisional agitation, the mixture is dispersed in a disperser to obtain an ink. No particular limitation is imposed on the disperser which can be used in the present invention. Examples can include a kneader, an attritor, a ball mill, a sand mill and a horizontal disperser with tumbling means contained therein, said sand mill and horizontal disperser making use of glass, zircon or the like, and a colloid mill. Upon using the dispersant-treated pigment, it is also possible to further disperse the dispersant-treated pigment in a solid resin to obtain pigment chips and then to dissolve the pigment chips in an alcoholic solvent to obtain an ink. Subsequent to the dissolution of the pigment chips, a resin may be added as needed. Pigment chips can be obtained, for example, by one of the following methods: (1) A solid resin obtained by suspension polymerization or a solid resin collected from a resin solution obtained by solution polymerization and a dispersant-treated pigment are kneaded under heat by using a kneader, a Banbury mixer, a mixing roll, a three-roll mill or the like either singly or in combination such that the pigment is dispersed in the resin. The resultant pigment-dispersed resin is then ground or chopped to obtain chips. (2) A solution of a resin in a water-soluble solvent and a presscake of a dispersant-treated pigment are mixed in a kneader, followed by heating to the softening point of the resin or higher to remove water. If necessary, the pigment is dispersed by using a three-roll mill, an extruder or the like. The resultant pigment-dispersed resin is ground or chopped to obtain pigment chips. (3) A presscake of a dispersant-treated pigment and a solid resin are subjected to flushing at the softening temperature of the resin or higher. In the ink according to the present invention, the above-described dispersant may be used generally in a proportion of from 0.5 to 50 parts by weight, preferably in a proportion of from 1 to 30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the pigment. On the other hand, the pigment may be used generally in a proportion of from 5 to 500 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the resin. The concentration of the pigment in the ink according to the present invention may be from 0.3 to 50 wt. % in general, with 0.5 to 30 wt. % being preferred, although it varies depending on the pigment. The viscosity of the ink may range generally from 1 to 50 mPas, preferably from 2 to 30 mPas. Depending on the construction of the writing instrument, a viscosity lower than 7 mPas may be required in some instances. It is particularly important for an ink to be equipped with excellent stability in viscosity along the passage of time. owing to the use of the above-described dispersant and resin along with a pigment, the ink according to the present invention has been imparted with excellent time-dependent stability in viscosity. A variety of additives can also be added to the ink of the present invention. Illustrative of such additives are fastness improvers such as ultraviolet absorbers and antioxidants; anti-settling agents; release agents and releasability improvers; perfumes and antimicrobial agents; plasticizers; and drying inhibitors. If necessary, one or more dyes can be added further. As a resin, a resin which has compatibility with the resin for use in the present invention may also be used in combination to an extent not lowering the dispersion stability of the pigment. In general, the thus-obtained ink can be used as is. It is however preferable to process the ink further in a centrifugal separator or an ultracentrifugal separator or through a filter, because removal of coarse particles of the pigment, which may exist in a trace amount in some instances, makes it possible to heighten the reliability of the writing instrument or recording apparatus. The writing instrument according to the present invention can be obtained by filling the ink of this invention, which has been obtained as described above, in a casing equipped with a porous tip. No particular limitation is imposed on the casing insofar as it has a size and shape convenient for writing as in the case of a variety of conventional writing instruments fitted with porous tips. The material of the casing, including its cap, can be a metal, a plastic or a composite. material thereof insofar as it is practically free from solvent permeation. No limitation is imposed on the structure or material of the porous tip insofar as it allows the ink to move from the interior of the casing to the free end of the tip as writing proceeds. However, excellent writing characteristics, durability and solvent resistance are required. Usable examples of fibers of bundled fiber tips and felt tips can include synthetic fibers such as polyester, polypropylene, nylon, polyacrylonitrile and vinylon fibers; cellulose and cellulose-derived regenerated fibers; and natural fibers such as wool, silk and cotton. Usable examples of open-cell foamed plastic products can include rigid or flexible urethane resin foams, foams of acetalized polyvinyl alcohol, and foamed of regenerated fibers. Usable examples of ink-occluding members can include bundles fibers, felted fibers, knitted fibers, and open-cell foamed plastic products. In the above description, inks making use of the dispersants according to the present invention have been referred to as representative examples. The present invention is however not limited only to inks. For example, the dispersants according to the present invention are useful as dispersants for a variety of conventionally-known pigments, and are useful as dispersants for various pigments employed as coloring matters in diverse paints, printing inks, pigment printing agents, synthetic resins and the like. The present invention will next be described more specifically by Examples and Comparative Examples, in which the designations of part or parts and % are all by weight.

A cooling coil was set, followed by polymerization at 75 C. for 10 hours. After cooling, the resin solution was taken out of the polymerizer. It was provided as a resin solution. The resin content was 40%, and the viscosity was 250 mPas. The number average molecular weight of the resin was 8,600 as measured by GPC and converted with reference to the corresponding data of standard polystyrene, and the acid value of the resin was 39.

RELATED APPLICATION DATA This application claims priority benefits under 35 U.S.C. 119 based on U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/041,781, filed Mar. 24, 1997, which application is entirely incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Vaccines have been very effective in protecting people from a wide variety of diseases, whether caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi. The ability of vaccines to induce specific protection against such a wide range of pathogenic organisms results from their ability to stimulate specific humoral antibody responses, as well as cell-mediated responses. This invention relates to a process for preparing such vaccines, and particularly to a process for making conjugates that are used in preparing vaccines. Additionally, the process of the invention can be used to produce immunogens and other valuable immunological, therapeutic, or diagnostic reagents. The invention further relates to the vaccines, immunogens, and reagents produced from the conjugates made according to the invention, as well as to the use of these products. It is often very desirable to induce immune responses against polysaccharides. For example, antibodies against a bacterial capsular polysaccharide can provide protection against that bacterium. Many polysaccharides, however, are poorly immunogenic, particularly in infants and young children. Furthermore, in both children and adults, there is usually no booster effect with repeated polysaccharide immunizations, and the principal antibody class is IgM. These features are all characteristic of so called T cell independent (TI) antigens. In many cases, the immunogenicity of polysaccharides can be enhanced by covalently linking proteins or T cell epitope-containing peptides to the polysaccharide. Certain other components, such as lipids, fatty acids, lipopolysaccharides, and lipoproteins, also are known to enhance the immunogenicity of the polysaccharide. As described in the dual conjugate patent application of Mond and Lees, conjugation of a protein to a polysaccharide can enhance the immune response to the protein as well as to the polysaccharide. See U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,100; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/444,727 (filed May 19, 1995); and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/468,060 (filed Jun. 6, 1995). These patent applications each are entirely incorporated herein by reference. This effect also is described in A. Lees, et al., Enhanced Immunogenicity of Protein-Dextran Conjugates: I. Rapid Stimulation of Enhanced Antibody Responses to Poorly Immunogenic Molecules, Vaccine, Vol. 12, No. 13, (1994), pp. 1160-1166. This article is entirely incorporated herein by reference. In view of this potential for improving the immune response against polysaccharides, there is a need in the art for methods to covalently link proteins or other moieties to polysaccharides. Ideally, the process of covalently linking moieties to a polysaccharide must be done in a way to maintain antigenicity of both the polysaccharide and protein components and to minimize damage to necessary epitopes of each component. Furthermore, the linkage should be stable. Therefore, there is a need for a mild and gentle means for coupling proteins, peptides, haptens, organic molecules, or other moieties to polysaccharides. Vaccines are not the only products that can benefit from an improved procedure for coupling molecules together. For example, certain diagnostic or therapeutic reagents are produced by coupling polysaccharides, high molecular weight carbohydrates, and low molecular weight carbohydrates to solid phase materials (e.g., solid particles or surfaces). Thus, there is a need in the art for improved means for coupling polysaccharides, high molecular weight carbohydrates, and low molecular weight carbohydrates to solid phase materials. Two main methods for coupling molecules together are used. In the first method, the means for coupling entails the crosslinking of a protein (or peptide or other moiety) directly to a polysaccharide (or some other moiety). Sometimes, however, a spacer molecule is needed between the coupled moieties, either to facilitate the chemical process and/or to enhance the immune response to the protein and/or the polysaccharide. In either method, it is usually necessary to activate or functionalize the polysaccharide before crosslinking occurs. Some methods of activating or functionalizing polysaccharides are described in W. E. Dick, et al., Glycoconjugates of Bacterial Carbohydrate Antigens: A Survey and Consideration of Design and Preparation Factors, Conjugate Vaccines (Eds. Cruse, et al.), Karger, Basel, 1989, Vol. 10, pp. 48-114. This excerpt is entirely incorporated herein by reference. Additional activation methods are described in R. W. Ellis, et al. (Editors), Development and Clinical Uses of Haemophilus B Conjugate Vaccines , Marcel Dekker, New York (1994), which book is entirely incorporated herein by reference. One preferred method for activating polysaccharides is described in the CDAP patent applications of Lees, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/124,491 (filed Sep. 22, 1993, now abandoned); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,651,971; 5,693,326; and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/482,666 (filed Jun. 7, 1995). These U.S. patents and patent applications each are entirely incorporated herein by reference. The use of CDAP also is described in Lees, et al., Activation of Soluble Polysaccharides with 1-Cyano-4-Dimethylamino Pyridinium Tetrafluoroborate for Use in Protein-Polysaccharide Conjugate Vaccines and Immunological Reagents, Vaccine, Vol. 14, No. 3 (1996), pp. 190-198. This article also is entirely incorporated herein by reference. One specific method of preparing conjugates is through the condensation of amines (or hydrazides) and carboxyls to amides using carbodiimides. The carboxyl nucleophile reacts with the carbodiimide to form a highly reactive but unstable intermediate that can then either hydrolyze or react with an amine to form a stable amide bond. 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) is a water soluble example of this class of carbodiimide reagent. As one example of this reaction, Robbins describes functionalizing Haemophilus influenza (PRP) polysaccharide with hydrazides and condensing this functionalized material with carboxyls on tetanus toxoid. See C. Chu, et al., Infection and Immunity, Vol. 40, 1983, beginning at pg. 245. Additionally, the coupling of a carboxylated polysaccharide to diptheria toxoid by this general process also is described by Robbins. See S. C. Szu, et al., Journal of Experimental Medicine, Vol. 166, 1987, beginning at page 1510. These articles each are entirely incorporated herein by reference. In general, however, there are a myriad of problems when one attempts to use carbodiimide for coupling multivalent ligands (e.g., proteins and polysaccharides) that contain both activatable groups and nucleophiles. The reaction is difficult to control, and it frequently leads to extensive homopolymerization, interchain crosslinking, and reduced antigenicity. A further problem is that the carboxyl-carbodiimide intermediate can undergo an O to N acyl shift, resulting in a stable, unreactive addition product that adds new epitopes to the protein (see G. T. Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., (1996), which document is entirely incorporated herein by reference). Another method of forming conjugates is through the use of active ester intermediates. Reagents that form active ester intermediates include norborane, p-nitrobenzoic acid, NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide), and S-NHS (sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide). NHS esters (or other suitable reagents) can react with nucleophiles like amines, hydrazides, and thiols. The reaction products of NHS esters with amines and hydrazides are particularly stable, forming an amide bond. NHS ester intermediates can be formed in a one step process using carbodiimide (to activate the carboxyls) and NHS (or S-NHS). In this process, NHS (or S-NHS), the carboxyl-containing component, and the amine-containing component are combined, and the carbodiimide is added thereto. Although coupling efficiency often is higher in this reaction than is the case when NHS is not present, problems, such as homopolymerization, interchain crosslinking, and over-crosslinking, can occur in this process. Additionally, other undesirable side reactions can occur and cause problems, as will be described in more detail below. Alternatively, a two step activation process can be used. In this procedure, one attempts to remove or destroy the remaining carbodiimide before adding the component to be crosslinked. In one protocol using EDC and NHS, before adding the protein, the remaining carbodiimide is deactivated with a thiol (e.g., mercaptoethanol). See Grabarek and Gergely, Analytical Biochemistry, Vol. 185 (1990), beginning at pg. 131, which article is entirely incorporated herein by reference. By this method, the amount of carbodiimide present during protein addition is minimized. The addition of the thiol, however, also can hydrolyze the desired NHS ester intermediate. In this two step process, it would be preferable to isolate the NHS ester intermediate. It can be difficult, however, to isolate this intermediate because it is only moderately stable in aqueous media. An additional problem with carbodiimide/NHS procedures is the possible formation of a -alanine derivative resulting from the reaction of carbodiimide with two moles of NHS in a Lossen rearrangement (see Wilchek and Miron, Biochemistry, Vol. 26, beginning at pg. 2155, 1987, which article is entirely incorporated herein by reference). This derivative can react with amines to form an unstable crosslink. Carbodiimide and NHS also have been used to activate oligosaccharides. In such procedures, the reducing ends of oligosaccharides are functionalized with carboxyl groups and then converted to active esters using carbodiimide and NHS in organic solvents. These functionalized oligosaccharides are then coupled to proteins. See Porro, U.S. Pat. No. 5,153,312 (Oct. 6, 1992) for the use of this procedure with an oligosaccharide from Neisseria meningiditis polysaccharide type C. This patent is entirely incorporated herein by reference. The reported overall coupling efficiency, however, is low, and low molecular weight oligosaccharides are used. One reason for the low coupling efficiency is that the oligosaccharides have only one NHS per molecule. It either hydrolyzes or couples. A variety of other reagents are known for introducing NHS esters; however, most of these require dry organic solvents and are unsuitable for use in aqueous media. One exception includes certain uronium salts, such as the reagent O-(N-succinimidyl) N,N,N,N-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TSTU), which are somewhat stable in water, although more so in mixed organic/aqueous media. TSTU has been used to form NHS esters of low molecular weight molecules in organic solvents (see Moller et al., Versatile Procedure of Multiple Introduction of 8-Aminomethylene Blue into Oligonucleotides, Bioconjugate Chemistry, Vol. 6 (1995), pp. 174-178; Lefevre et al., Texas Red-X and Rhodarnine Red-X, New Derivatives of Sulforhodamine 101 and Lissamine Rhodamine B with Improved Labeling and Fluorescence Properties, Bioconjugate Chemistry, Vol. 7 (1996), pp. 482-489; and Bannwarth et al., 219, Bathophenanthroline-ruthenium (II) Complexes as Non-Radioactive Labels for Oligonucleotides which can be Measured by Time-Resolved Fluorescence Techniques, Helvetica Chimica Acta, Vol. 71 (1988), beginning at pg. 2085, which articles each are entirely incorporated herein by reference.) Additionally, TSTU and other uronium salts have been used to form NHS esters of low molecular weight molecules in mixed organic/aqueous media (see Knorr et al.,New Coupling Reagents in Peptide Chemistry, Tetrahedron Letters , Vol. 30, No. 15 (1989), pp. 1927-1930; and Bannwarth and Knorr, Formation of Carboxamides with N,N,N,N-Tetramethyl (Succinimido) Uroniumn Tetrafluoroborate in Aqueous/Organic Solvent-Systems, Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 32, No. 9 (1991), pp. 1157-1160, which articles also are entirely incorporated herein by reference). TSTU also has been used to prepare active esters of solid phase carboxylated beads in organic solvents (see Wilchek et al., Improved Method for Preparing N-Hydroxysuccinimide Ester-Containing Polymers for Affinity Chromatography, Bioconjugate Chemistry, Vol. 5 (1994), pp. 491-492, which article is entirely incorporated herein by reference). Reagents like TSTU are advantageous over the carbodiimide/NHS method because there is a reduced likelihood of various side reactions, such as an O to N shift reaction or a Lossen rearrangement. M. A. Andersson, et al., Synthesis of oligosaccharides with oligoethylene glycol spacers and their conversion into glycoconjugates using N,N,N,N-tetramethyl(succinimido)uronium tetrafluoroborate as a coupling reagent, Glycoconjugate Journal, Vol. 10 (1993), pp. 461-465, which article is entirely incorporated herein by reference, describes the use of TSTU to activate a carboxylated saccharide in a mixed aqueous/organic solvent and the subsequent coupling of this activated material to a protein. Andersson does not describe the use of this method for producing vaccines. European Patent Application No. 0,569,086 A2 (S. J. Danielson et al.) describes the use of TSTU and similar reagents for preparing active esters of insoluble carboxylated substrates and particles. These activated solids are subsequently coupled to biologically relevant molecules to prepare diagnostic reagents. This document is entirely incorporated herein by reference. Despite the various coupling and activation methods described in the various documents mentioned above, there is an on-going need in the art for improved methods for coupling biologically relevant molecules to one another to produce vaccines. Additionally, there is a need in the art for an improved procedure for coupling biologically relevant molecules to non-carboxylated surfaces and particles to produce various reagents. This invention seeks to provide an improved coupling method for producing conjugates for vaccines and immunogens. In addition, these methods will be useful for producing immunological reagents, diagnostic reagents, and therapeutic reagents. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method for producing a conjugate, and advantageously, conjugate vaccines. In this method, a first moiety (e.g., a polysaccharide, a high or low molecular weight carbohydrate, a hydroxylated compound (such as polyvinyl alcohol), etc.) is activated with a uronium salt reagent. The uronium salt reagent is believed to activate carboxyl groups or hydroxyl groups present on the first moiety, although Applicants do not wish to be bound by any specific chemical mechanisms or theories of operation. The first moiety can be present in an aqueous media, in a mixture of an aqueous/organic media, or in an organic media. According to the process of the invention, the uronium salt reagent has a chemical structure corresponding to formula I: wherein: R 1 is defined as wherein R 6 represents the carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, and optionally one or more heteroatoms, which, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, constitute a 5 to 10 membered heterocyclic ring, which may be substituted or unsubstituted. R 2 and R 3 are defined as follows: R 2 represents a hydrogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or an alkynyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms; R 3 represents a hydrogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or an alkynyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms; or R 2 and R 3 , when taken together, represent the carbon, hydrogen, sulfur, nitrogen, and/or oxygen atoms necessary to complete a 5 to 7 membered heterocyclic ring with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, wherein the heterocyclic ring can be substituted or unsubstituted. R 4 and R 5 are defined as follows: R 4 represents a hydrogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or an alkynyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms; R 5 represents a hydrogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or an alkynyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms; or R 4 and R 5 , when taken together, represent the carbon, hydrogen, sulfur, nitrogen, and/or oxygen atoms necessary to complete a 5 to 7 membered heterocyclic ring with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, wherein the heterocyclic ring can be substituted or unsubstituted. X represents an acid anion (e.g., Cl , Br , F , I , PF 6 , and BF 4 ). Other suitable acid anions for use in this invention are described in European Patent Appl. No. 0,569,086. Also, in the method of the invention, a second moiety (e.g., a protein, a peptide, a hapten, a lipoprotein, a carbohydrate, an organic molecule, a spacer molecule, a solid phase material, a homobifunctional reagent, a heterobifunctional reagent, etc.) is mixed with the first moiety. The first moiety is activated and reacts with the second moiety to form a conjugate or a functionalized first moiety. One preferred class of uronium salt reagents for use in the invention includes the salts of formula I wherein the group is a member selected from the group of: Specific reagents of this class include: 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU); 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)- 1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU); 2-(5-Norbornene-2,3-dicarboximido)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TNTU); and O-(N-Succinimidyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TSTU). Other suitable uronium salt activating reagents for use in this invention are described in European Patent Appl. No. 0,569,086. In the method of the invention, the uronium salt reagent can be mixed with the first moiety before the second moiety is mixed with the first moiety. This initiates an activation reaction between the uronium salt reagent and the first moiety. In this first step, the first moiety is activated by the uronium salt reagent, and thereafter, the second moiety is mixed with the activated first moiety. Optionally, the activated first moiety can be isolated from the reaction mixture before the second moiety is mixed in, and then the second moiety can be mixed with the isolated product that includes the uronium salt activated first moiety. As another alternative procedure, the second moiety can be mixed with the first moiety before the uronium salt reagent is mixed with the first moiety. In this manner, when the uronium salt is mixed with the mixture of the first and second moieties, the first moiety is activated by the uronium salt reagent, and the reaction between the activated first moiety and the second moiety proceeds in a single step. A single step reaction process also can occur when the uronium salt reagent and the second moiety are simultaneously mixed with the first moiety. If desired, the first moiety can be functionalized with one or more chemical groups that are capable of being activated by the uronium salt. For example, a polysaccharide can be functionalized with carboxyls. This can be achieved, for example, by activating the first moiety (e.g., a polysaccharide or a high or low molecular weight carbohydrate) with a reagent selected from the group of CNBr, CDAP, and a vinylsulfone reagent, followed by reaction with 6-aminohexanoic acid. The invention further relates to the reaction products produced by the process of the invention. These reaction products may include conjugates (including protein/polysaccharide conjugates) and conjugate vaccines (including protein/polysaccharide conjugate vaccines). The invention also can be used to produce immunogens, immunological reagents, therapeutic reagents, or diagnostic reagents. The invention also relates to methods for using these reaction products for their intended purpose. For example, the invention relates to methods of inducing an immune response in a subject by administering a conjugate vaccine to the subject. As such, the invention can be used to prevent, treat, diagnose, or ameliorate the symptoms of various diseases or ailments. The process of producing a conjugate according to this invention has several advantages over the various methods and processes disclosed in the above-noted documents. None of the documents noted above describes the use of uronium salt reagents to form conjugate vaccines. The process of the invention, on the other hand, is a straightforward and easy method for producing conjugate vaccines. The process of the invention advantageously can be performed in the solution phase and can be used with both carboxylated and non-carboxylated polysaccharides. In addition, the reaction can proceed using small quantities of reagents, allowing one to quickly, efficiently, and inexpensively determine optimum reaction conditions. Unlike many known coupling methods, the process of the invention also allows for direct coupling of the first and second moieties (e.g., the protein and polysaccharide materials). This further simplifies the reaction procedure and reduces the costs. Furthermore, the process of the invention is advantageous because it uses relatively safe reagents and mild reaction conditions (e.g., low pH, no hood or other special facilities). Many polysaccharides, such as PRP polysaccharide, are easily hydrolyzed at extreme pHs. The conditions used during uronium salt activation and coupling are relatively mild and gentle so that important epitopes are retained on the polysaccharide (i.e., minimal modifications of the protein and polysaccharide starting materials are induced). CNBr activation, on the other hand, requires the use of a high pH and a highly toxic reagent under a hood. Another advantage of the invention relates to the one step procedure described above. Because the protein and polysaccharide components (or other moieties) can be mixed together before activation and coupling is initiated, the method of the invention allows one to continue adding fresh reagent and removing excess reagents until a sufficient and desired level of coupling is achieved. This is not readily possible with other activation methods, especially those methods that require activation of the polysaccharide followed by addition of the protein. The method of the invention also allows one to monitor the progress of the coupling during the conjugation procedure, thereby limiting waste or excessive use of the various reagents. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The advantageous aspects of the invention will be more fully understood and appreciated when considered in conjunction with the following detailed description and the attached figure, wherein FIG. 1 illustrates HPLC runs for Samples 1A and 1C in Example 1 described below. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention, polysaccharides, high or low molecular weight carbohydrates, or other moieties are activated with uronium salt reagents, such as TSTU, TNTU, HBTU, or TBTU, so they may be coupled to proteins, haptens, peptides, or other moieties. The invention further relates to the conjugates produced by the method of the invention, which conjugates can be used in preparing vaccines, immunological reagents, diagnostic reagents, therapeutic reagents, immunogens, and the like. The invention also relates to methods of using the conjugates of the invention as vaccines or reagents. The conjugate vaccines of the invention can be administered to a subject to induce an immune response. The procedure of the invention is generally described as follows. A first moiety is reacted with a uronium salt reagent in a suitable environment to transfer an NHS-ester to the first moiety. For example, in accordance with the invention, a polysaccharide can be reacted with TSTU reagent in a base, such as dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) base. This reaction can take place in an aqueous media, in a mixed organic/aqueous media, or in an organic media. Various organic solvents can be used, including acetonitrile, dimethylformamide (DMF), and N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP). A mildly basic pH generally is maintained during the reaction (e.g., 8 to 9.5), if necessary, by adding more base. The second moiety (e.g., a protein) is mixed with the first moiety at some time during this procedure. The amount of uronium salt reagent can be adjusted and the activation time varied to optimize the activation and coupling efficiency. The addition of the uronium salt reagent can be staggered to minimize excess uronium salt reagent in the reaction at any given time. If desired, old or excess uronium salt reagent can be removed, e.g., by dialysis or ultrafiltration, before new reagent is mixed with the protein/polysaccharide mixture. In this manner, one can minimize the amount and percentage of organic solvent in the mixture and also maintain the protein and polysaccharide concentration at an optimum level to facilitate good coupling. This reagent removal step offers a level of control over the coupling because small amounts of activating reagent can be added, as necessary, and the progress of the conjugation reaction procedure can be monitored (e.g., by analyzing aliquots of the reaction mixture). This procedure also offers possibilities for scaling up the conjugation procedure. Those skilled in the art will be capable of determining optimum reaction conditions (such as pH and reaction time), reagent amounts, and reagent concentrations through routine experimentation. Any conjugation procedure can be followed without departing from the invention. For example, in one procedure, a carboxylated polysaccharide is used as the starting material. This can be accomplished by starting with a polysaccharide that naturally contains carboxyl groups, such as Neisseria meningiditis polysaccharide type C (Neisseria PsC). Alternatively, carboxyl groups can be added to a polysaccharide. A variety of procedures are known to those skilled in the art for carboxylating polysaccharides. For example, polysaccharides can be activated with CNBr or CDAP and carboxylated with an appropriate reagent, such as 6-aminohexanoic acid. CNBr activation is described by W. E. Dick, supra., and CDAP activation is described in the patent applications and articles of Lees described above. Vinyl sulfone reagents also can be used to activate polysaccharides, as described in U.S. Provisional Patent Appln. No. 60/017,103 in the name of Andrew Lees, filed May 9, 1996, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/852,733, filed May 7, 1997, which applications are entirely incorporated herein by reference. In a one step protocol according to the invention, the first moiety and the second moiety are mixed first, and the uronium salt reagent then is mixed in. The uronium salt reagent can be added in small amounts at a plurality of different times. The first moiety is activated and reacts with the second moiety. This one step protocol is described in more detail in the following general example. First, a first moiety (e.g., a polysaccharide) is mixed with a second moiety (e.g., a protein). Then, a uronium salt reagent (e.g., TNTU or TSTU) is mixed with this mixture, followed by the addition of a base material (e.g., triethylamine (TEA)). Under this procedure, the operator can continue adding additional TNTU and/or TEA until a sufficient or desired level of coupling is observed. In fact, the reaction procedure and degree of coupling can be determined at various different times by analyzing aliquots of the reaction mixture as the reaction proceeds. In a two step protocol according to the invention, the first moiety (e.g., a polysaccharide) is activated with a uronium salt reagent, and thereafter, the second moiety (e.g., a protein) is mixed with the activated first moiety. The buffer, reagent concentration, time, and temperature conditions, etc. can be selected such that at the time the second moiety (i.e., the component to be linked) is mixed in, the concentration of the activating reagent is too low to cause significant polymerization of that component. Due to the relative stability of the NHS-ester and their multiplicity on the first moiety, there can still be a sufficient number of activated groups on the first moiety molecule at the time the second moiety is mixed in for coupling to take place. In this way, one can avoid the necessity of isolating the activated intermediate of the first moiety. If desired and if the intermediate is stable, however, the reaction product of the uronium salt and first moiety reaction (e.g., the uronium salt activated polysaccharide) can be isolated before the second moiety material (e.g., the protein) is mixed with it. Also, in accordance with the invention, the first moiety can be activated with the uronium salt reagent, isolated, and stored for later use, as long as it remains stable under the isolation and storage conditions. The presence of some uronium salt reagent at the time the second moiety is mixed in may not be detrimental because it can promote coupling of the second moiety to the first moiety by continuing to activate the moieties. Actually, the presence of some excess uronium salt reagent when the second moiety is added in this two step protocol may make the overall procedure somewhat of a blend of the one and two step procedures. In general, at least two mechanisms are available for activating a first moiety. In one mechanism, carboxyl groups on the first moiety are activated, and in the other mechanism, hydroxyl groups are activated. The process of the invention can be used with many polysaccharides because they are or can be carboxylated or hydroxylated. Because many polysaccharides naturally contain carboxyl groups as part of their repeat unit, e.g., Neisseria PsC, a separate carboxylation is not always necessary. Typically, some of these carboxyl groups can be modified without destroying the antigenicity of the polysaccharide. These native carboxyls can be used, or carboxylated arms can easily be added to the polysaccharide, as described in the examples. In other cases, carboxyl groups can be introduced easily, especially with CDAP. For example, CDAP can be used to derivatize Pneumococcal polysaccharide type 14 (Pn 14) with 6-aminohexanoic acid. Amine-containing polysaccharides can be carboxylated using glutaric anhydride. Carboxymethyl dextran can be prepared easily from dextran and chloroacetic acid in base, as described by Inman, Journal of Immunology, Vol. 114, page 704 (1975) (which article is entirely incorporated herein by reference). Methods for converting various functional groups to carboxyl groups also are well known. Note the discussion in G. T. Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., (1996), pg. 187. Thus, many polysaccharides can be carboxylated and activated by the method according to the invention. As noted above, however, it is not a requirement that the first moiety starting material contain carboxyls. Hydroxyl groups on the first moiety also can be activated with uronium salt reagents. As demonstrated in the examples below, the process of the invention can be used with starting materials that do not contain carboxyls (e.g., Pn 14). Thus, using a first moiety material that contains carboxyls should be viewed as optional. Different starting materials can be used in the process according to the invention. For example, the first moiety can be a polysaccharide, a high or low molecular weight carbohydrate, or a hydroxylated compound (e.g., a synthetic hydroxylated compound, such as polyvinyl alcohol or polyethylene glycol). Additionally, the first moiety can be a natural or synthetic material that is either soluble or insoluble in water. Examples of specific polysaccharides for use in the method according to the invention include dextran, carboxylated dextran (such as carboxymethyl dextran), Neisseria meningiditis polysaccharide type C, Pneumococcal polysaccharides (such as Pn 14, Pn 6, Pn 19, and Pn 23), and Haemophilus influenza (PRP) polysaccharide. Examples of suitable high or low molecular weight carbohydrates for use in the invention include sucrose, PRP oligosaccharide, lipopolysaccharide, and lipooligosaccharide. Examples of suitable hydroxylated compounds for use in the invention include polyvinyl alcohol, Ficoll, and polyethylene glycol. In the reaction process of the invention, the activated first moiety reacts with a second moiety present in the reaction mixture. Suitable examples of materials that can be used as the second moiety include proteins, haptens, peptides, lipoproteins, carbohydrates, organic molecules, spacer molecules, solid phase materials, homobifunctional reagents, or heterobifunctional reagents. This second moiety can be a natural or synthetic material that is either soluble or insoluble in water. The process according to the invention can be used to make conjugates of these first and second moieties, including protein/polysaccharide conjugates, glycosolated protein/protein conjugates and the like. Additionally, an activated first moiety (e.g., an activated polysaccharide) can be coupled to an amino or hydrazide surface in the process of the invention to produce reagents. Examples of specific suitable proteins for use in this invention include bovine serum albumin, tetanus toxoid, diptheria toxoid, pertussis toxoid, rib protein, intimin, and gD protein. Examples of suitable peptides for use in the invention include LHRH peptide and CFA/I consensus peptide (see F. J. Cassels, et al., Journal of Industrial Microbiology, 1996 Annual Meeting for the Society of Industrial Microbiology). Examples of suitable lipoproteins for use in the invention include lipoOspA and lipoD. Examples of suitable haptens include PamCys and monophosphorolipid A. Examples of other carbohydrates for use in the invention include glycosolated proteins and horseradish peroxidase. An example of a suitable organic molecule for use in the invention includes biotin hydrazide. Examples of suitable spacer molecules include hexanediamine and adipic dihydrazide. Examples of suitable solid phase materials for use in the invention include ELISA (enzyme-linked imnmunosorbent assay) plates, beads, and chromatography media. Examples of suitable heterobifunctional reagents include hydrazido 3-(2-pyridyl dithio) propionate and mercaptoethyl amine. An example of a suitable homobifunctional reagent for use in the invention includes cystamine. Preferred uronium salt reagents for use according to the invention include the members the following group: 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU); 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU); 2-(5-Norbornene-2,3-dicarboximido)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TNTU); and O-(N-Succinimidyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TSTU). These uronium salts are available from NovaChem. Additionally, TSTU can be obtained from Aldrich. TSTU and TNTU are particularly preferred uronium salt reagents. Because it is a relatively mild reagent, TSTU is a less harmful crosslinker than carbodiimides. Applicants have observed that TSTU appears to cause much less homopolymerization of proteins than does EDC. Various vaccines can be made using conjugates produced by the process of the invention. The vaccines include, but are not limited to, the vaccines set forth below: Diphtheria vaccine Pertussis (subunit) vaccine Tetanus vaccine H. influenzae, type b (polyribose phosphate) S. pneumoniae, all serotypes E. coli, endotoxin or J5 antigen (LPS, Lipid A, and Gentabiose) E. coli, O polysaccharides (serotype specific) Klebsiella, polysaccharides (serotype specific) S. aureus, types 5 and 8 (serotype specific and common protective antigens) S. epidermidis, serotype polysaccharide I, II, and III (and common protective antigens) N. meningiditis, serotype specific or protein antigens Polio vaccine Mumps, measles, rubella vaccine Respiratory Syncytial Virus Rabies Hepatitis A, B, C, and others Human immunodeficiency virus I and II (GP120, GP41, GP160, p24, others) Herpes simplex types 1 and 2 CMV EBV Varicella/Zoster Malaria Tuberculosis Candida albicans, other candida Pneumocystis carinii Mycoplasma Influenzae virus A and B Adenovirus Group A streptococcus Group B streptococcus, serotypes, Ia, Ib, II, and III Pseudomonas aeroginosa (serotype specific) Rhinovirus Parainfluenzae, types 1, 2, and 3 Coronaviruses Salmonella Shigella Rotavirus Enteroviruses Chlamydia trachomatis and pneumoniae (TWAR) Glycoproteins Neo-formans cryptococcus As one specific example of the process of the invention, uronium salts can be used to activate lipopolysaccharides or lipooligosaccharides in the manner described in more detail in the examples below. Thereafter, the activated lipopolysaccharide or lipooligosaccharide can be coupled to a protein for use in a vaccine. Antibodies to lipopolysaccharides and lipooligosaccharides can provide protection against sepsis and non-typeable Haemophilus influenza. Such conjugates of lipopolysaccharides or lipooligosaccharides with a protein (e.g., tetanus toxoid) fall within this invention. In the process of the invention, conjugates can be made wherein the weight ratio of the second moiety to the first moiety in the conjugate is greater than 0.05 mg/mg (e.g., 0.05 mg protein/mg polysaccharide). For protein/polysaccharide conjugate vaccines, the weight ratio of protein to polysaccharide can be greater than 0.05, with a range of 0.05 to 7 being preferred, and the range of 0.1 to 2 mg protein per mg of polysaccharide being particularly preferred. The invention will be described more specifically below in terms of various preferred embodiments and specific examples. These preferred embodiments and specific examples should be construed as being illustrative of the invention, and not as limiting the same. Additionally, certain examples use bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein and/or dextran as a model polysaccharide. Of course, biologically relevant proteins and polysaccharides also can be used in the practice of the invention. Specific examples including biologically relevant proteins and polysaccharides also are included in this application. Many of the specific examples below include the use of DMAP as a base in the reaction process. Many other bases, however, also can be used. For example, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, triethylamine, or diethylisopropylamine also can be used without departing from the invention. The following examples also include various abbreviations, standard procedures, and materials that are well known to those skilled in the art. The following information will help one to more readily understand the information included in the following examples. These definitions apply in the following examples, unless there is an indication to the contrary. Monomeric BSA is used in certain examples because the use of the monomeric protein makes it easier to observe the coupling process as a shift in the molecular weight. The monomeric BSA used in these examples was prepared from Cohn fraction V BSA (from Sigma Chemical Co.) or Intergen low endotoxin BSA (from Intergen Corp.) by brief treatment with 10 mM iodoacetamide in HEPES buffer (described below) at pH 7.3, and then gel filtration on a 2.5100 cm S100HR column (from Pharmacia) as described in Lees, et al., Vaccine, Vol. 14, No. 3, (1996) pp. 190-198 (described above). The dextran was T2000 dextran obtained from Pharmacia. For some experiments, the high molecular weight fraction of the T2000 dextran was used. This material was obtained by passing dextran over a gel filtration column (2.5100 cm S400 HR), as described above. Tetanus toxoid, the various Pneumococcal polysaccharides, the Neisseria meningiditis polysaccharide, and the PRP polysaccharide were obtained from SmithKline Beecham (Rixensart, Belgium). Commercial sources for suitable proteins and polysaccharides for use with the invention include American Tissue Culture Collection of Rockville, Md. and Bema Laboratories of Fla. HEPES buffer (or HE buffer), as used in this application, represents a mixture of 0.15 M hydroxyethyl piperazine N-2-ethane sulfonic acid (HEPES) and 2 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA) to provide a solution having a pH of 7.3. HEPES refers to HEPES alone, without EDTA (pH8). 5HEPES buffer (or 5HE buffer) represents a mixture of 0.75 M HEPES and 10 mM EDTA to provide a solution having a pH of 7.3. 2.5HEPES buffer represents a mixture of equal volumes of 5HEPES buffer and saline. Saline represents a 0.15 M solution of NaCl in water. When high performance liquid chromatographs (HPLC) are conducted, unless indicated to the contrary, a Waters model 626 pump was used with a model 600S controller and a model 486 absorbance detector. Prior to running the HPLC chromatographs, all samples were spin filtered using an ultrafree MC 0.45 m filter unit. The size exclusion HPLC columns used, unless indicated to the contrary, were Phenomenex Biosep G4000 columns (3007.8 mm), equilibrated with 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.3. The run velocity was 1 ml/min. Some runs included the use of a guard column of the same material. Sterile filtering, when performed, was performed on a Millex GV device, unless indicated to the contrary. The pH, as used in this application, refers to apparent pH as measured by a Ross electrode (available from Orion Research) or estimated with colorfast pH paper (available from EM Science.) Furthermore, in this application, unless indicated to the contrary, the presence of amines was determined using a trinitrobenzenesulfonic (TNBS) acid assay, as described by J. Vidal and C. Franci, J Immunol. Meth., Vol. 86, pg. 155 (1986). The presence of hydrazides also was determined using a TNBS assay as described by Qi, et al., Anal. Chem., Vol. 275, pg. 139 (1988). The presence of polysaccharides was determined using the resorcinol/sulfuric acid method of Monsigny, et al., Anal. Chem. Vol. 175, pg. 525 (1988), using the relevant polysaccharide standard. The presence of protein was determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (available from Pierce Chemical Co., of Rockport, Ill.) (an appropriate protein, such as BSA or tetanus toxoid, was used as the standard). All of these cited documents are entirely incorporated herein by reference. Finally, where HPLC is used for determining the extent of conjugation (e.g., mg protein/mg polysaccharide), it is calculated from the initial protein/polysaccharide ratio in the starting materials and the percent of the UV absorbance for the conjugated protein peak (based on the total UV absorbance of the protein), as measured by the HPLC. EXAMPLE 1 In this first example, dextran polysaccharide moieties were coupled to a BSA protein moiety to produce a conjugate. The dextran moieties were both carboxylated and non-carboxylated. Carboxymethyl dextran (CM dextran) was prepared at a concentration of 39 mg dextran/mi in saline by the method of Inman, identified above. The non-carboxylated dextran was present at a concentration of 74 mg/ml in saline. The monomeric BSA protein was present at a concentration of 32 mg/ml in 2.5HEPES buffer having a pH of 7.3. TSTU and DMAP reagents each were present as 0.2 M solutions in DMF. Sample 1A For this Sample, 82 l of the CM dextran material was mixed with 82 l of water and 86 l DMF. At time t0, 10 l TSTU and 10 l DMAP were added to the dextran material. At time t1 minute, an additional 10 l of TSTU was added, and at time t2 minutes, an additional 10 l TSTU was added. During this portion of the procedure, DMAP was added as necessary to maintain the pH of the solution in the range of 8-9. In total, approximately 50 l of DMAP was added. At time t5 minutes, 100 l of the BSA material was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was allowed to react overnight at a temperature of 4 C. to produce the conjugate. Sample 1B In Sample 1B, the procedure for Sample 1A was followed, but T2000 dextran was used in place of the CM dextran material. Sample 1C For Sample 1C, the procedure for Sample 1A was followed, but 82 l of saline was substituted for the CM dextran material used in Sample 1A. This Sample was a control sample illustrating the effects of eliminating the polysaccharide material. The reaction products of Samples 1A through 1C were analyzed by HPLC on a Phenomenex Biosep SEC3000, 7.8150 cm, equilibrated in 0.1 M KPO 4 at a pH of 7.3. It was found that Sample 1A, using CM dextran, produced a BSA/dextran conjugate having about 0.67 mg BSA/mg dextran. Sample 1B, using a non-carboxylated dextran starting material, resulted in a BSA/dextran conjugate having about 0.87 mg BSA/mg dextran. Sample 1C, the control sample which did not include a dextran polysaccharide, showed less than 5% high molecular weight protein. This indicates that only a small amount of dimerization of the protein resulted from the reaction procedure. FIG. 1 illustrates the HPLC runs for Samples 1A and 1C. As shown in the HPLC for Sample 1A, a very pronounced high molecular weight absorbance peak was found for the conjugate. This high molecular weight peak represents the BSA/TSTU/CM dextran conjugate of Sample 1A. The HPLC run for Control Sample 1C, which included saline substituted for the CM dextran polysaccharide, did not exhibit this high molecular weight peak corresponding to a conjugate. This Example demonstrates that uronium salts can be used to produce conjugates of proteins with both carboxylated and non-carboxylated polysaccharides. There is minimal homopolymerization of the protein component in this reaction process. EXAMPLE 2 This Example illustrates that various different polysaccharides can be activated with uronium salt reagents. Furthermore, the polysaccharides in this Example, once activated, were functionalized with either amines or hydrazides. For Samples 2A and 2H, non-carboxylated dextran was used as the polysaccharide. This polysaccharide was activated by the uronium salt reagents and derivatized with both amines (Sample 2A) and hydrazides (Sample 2H). Samples 2B through 2E use clinically relevant Pneumococcal (Pn) capsular polysaccharides. Samples 2F and 2G demonstrate that uronium salt reagents can be used to activate carboxylated polysaccharides, and Sample 2F further demonstrates that this class of reagents can activate a plant polysaccharide. Sample 2I shows use of the invention with a clinically relevant PRP polysaccharide. The experimental protocols for performing the activation and derivatization will be described in more detail below. The following reagents were prepared and used in the various experiments described below, unless there is some indication to the contrary: (a) TSTU reagent prepared as a 0.5 M solution in DMF; (b) DMAP reagent prepared as a 0.5 M solution in water; (c) ethylenediamine reagent prepared as a 1 M solution in water; and (d) adipic dihydrazide solution prepared as a 0.5 M solution in water. Sample 2A Sample 2A was prepared according to the following protocol. 65 l of T2000 dextran, at a concentration of 74 mg/ml, was mixed with 35 l of saline and 100 l of water. At time t0, 20 l of TSTU (0.5 M in DMF) was added to the solution. At time t20 seconds, 20 l of DMAP (0.5 M in water) was added, and then at t1 minute and t1.5 minute, 20 additional l of TSTU was added to the reaction mixture. In total, 60 l of TSTU was added to the dextran starting material. During the procedure, DMAP was added, as necessary, to maintain the pH of the reaction solution in the range of 8 to 8.5. At time t2 minutes, 300 l of 0.67 M ethylenediamine in water was added. After 1 hour, the reaction mixture was desalted on a P6DG column (from BioRad), equilibrated in saline, and pooled. The resulting material was assayed for amines and dextran, and it was determined that the resulting activated polysaccharide contained 9.4 NH 2 /100 KDa dextran. Sample 2B This Sample describes the activation of a biologically relevant polysaccharide using the uronium salts in the process of the invention. At time t0, 20 l of TSTU was added to 0.5 ml of a Pn 14 polysaccharide solution, having a concentration of 10 mg Pn 14/ml in water. Immediately thereafter, 20 l DMAP was added to the solution. At time t1 minute, an additional 20 l of TSTU was added, and at time t1.5 minute, an additional 20 l TSTU was added. A suitable amount of DMAP was added during this procedure to maintain the reaction solution at a pH of about 8.5. At time t2 minutes, 200 l of the 1 M ethylenediamine solution was added. After about 1 hour, the reaction mixture was desalted on a P6DG column (available from BioRad), equilibrated with saline. Assays were performed to determine the presence of amines (NH 2 ) and the polysaccharide, and it was determined that this activated polysaccharide contained 7.6 NH 2 /100 KDa Pn 14. Sample 2C In this Sample, the procedure of Sample 2B was followed, except the starting material was 0.5 ml Pn 6 at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in water. After the initial assay, the samples were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon device (available from Amicon). The sample was rerun on the P6DG column and reassayed. It was determined that the resulting activated Pn 6 polysaccharide contained 10.4 NH2/100 KDa Pn 6. Sample 2D In this Sample, the procedure of Sample 2B was followed, except the starting material was 0.5 ml Pn 19, having a concentration of 10 mg/ml in saline. It was determined that the resulting activated Pn 19 polysaccharide contained 9.9 NH 2 /100 KDa Pn 19. Sample 2E In this Sample, the procedure of Sample 2C was followed, except the starting material was 0.5 ml Pn 23 having a concentration of 10 mg/ml in saline. It was determined that the resulting activated Pn 23 polysaccharide contained 3.4 NH 2 /100 KDa Pn23. Sample 2F For this Sample, the polysaccharide solution was 0.5 ml pectin (citrus fruit pectin available from Sigma) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in water, plus 200 l sodium carbonate (1M), at a pH of about 9.6. At time t0, 20 l of 0.5 M TSTU (in DMF) was added to this polysaccharide solution. Then, at time t1 minute, an additional 20 l of TSTU was added, and the pH was maintained in the range of 9-9.5 using the 1 M sodium carbonate solution. At time t3 minutes, 500 l of 1M ethylenediamine (in water) was added. This reaction mixture was allowed to stand overnight at room temperature, and then it was desalted on a P6DG column (available from BioRad). It was determined that the resulting activated polysaccharide contained 8.4 NH 2 /100 KDa Pectin. Sample 2G For this Sample, 200 l of CM dextran (containing 7.5 carboxyls/100 KDa), at a concentration of 48 mg/ml in saline, was mixed with 200 l of water. At time t0, 20 l of TSTU (0.5 M in DMF) was added to the solution. At time t20 seconds, 20 l of DMAP (0.5 M in water) was added, and then at t1 minute and t1.5 minute, 20 additional l of TSTU was added to the reaction mixture. In total, 60 l of TSTU was added to the CM dextran starting material. During the procedure, DMAP was added, as necessary, to maintain the pH of the reaction solution in the range of 8 to 8.5. At time t2 minutes, 200 l of 0.5 M ethylenediamine (in water) was added. After 1 hour, the reaction mixture was desalted on a P6DG column (from BioRad), equilibrated in saline, pooled, concentrated on a Centricon 30 device (available from Amicon), and desalted again. The resulting material was assayed for amines and dextran, and it was determined that the resulting activated polysaccharide contained 10.6 NH 2 /100 KDa CM dextran. Sample 2H In this Sample, the procedure of Sample 2B was followed, except the starting material was 100 l T2000 dextran having a concentration of 55 mg/ml in water. Also, during the reaction procedure, at time t2 minutes, 200 l of the 0.5 M adipic dihydrazide solution was added instead of the 200 l of 1 M ethylenediamine solution added in the process of Sample 2B. It was determined that the resulting activated T2000 dextran polysaccharide contained 8.9 hydrazide (Hz) per 100 KDa dextran. Sample 2I In this Sample, a PRP polysaccharide was activated using a TNTU uronium salt reagent. To do so, 80 l of 0.3 M TNTU (in NMP) and 48 l of 0.5 M TEA (in NMP) were mixed into 0.5 ml of PRP (at a concentration of 10 mg/ml) in 2M NaCl. After 2 minutes, 250 l of 0.5 M hexanediamine in 0.1 M sodium borate (pH9.3) was added to the above mixture. The reaction proceeded overnight at a temperature of 4 C. The reaction mixture was then desalted on a P6DG column (available from BioRad), equilibrated with saline. The reaction product was assayed for amines and the polysaccharide, and it was determined that the resulting material had 11.4 NH 2 groups/100 kDa PRP. Conclusion Regarding Example 2 This Example illustrates that uronium salt reagents can be used to derivatize a variety of different polysaccharides and to functionalize the polysaccharides with either amines or hydrazides. Proteins or any other second moieties can be substituted for diamine or dihydrazide and coupled to the activated polysaccharides. Also, this Example shows that clinically relevant polysaccharides can be functionalized by the process of the invention, as well as plant polysaccharides. EXAMPLE 3 This Example demonstrates the process of the invention wherein the uronium salt reagents are removed before the protein is coupled to the activated polysaccharide. The polysaccharide starting material was 5 mg of T2000 dextran material, present at a concentration of 74 mg dextran/ml solution (corresponding to about 68 l of the dextran solution). 68 l water, 135 l NMP, 50 l 0.2 M TSTU (in NMP), and 50 l 0.2 M DMAP (in NMP) were added to this dextran solution. The pH at the start was about 9.6, and it dropped from this level. At time t30 minutes, about 1 ml of water was added. The excess reagents were then removed by ultrafiltration using a Filtron Omega 30 K membrane, 10 ml size, to produce 0.5 ml final volume. An additional 1 ml of water then was added, and the resulting mixture was concentrated to about 400 l. The polysaccharide was removed from the apparatus, and an additional 100 l of water was used to rinse the membrane, thereby providing a total volume of about 500 l. BSA monomer was added at a ratio of 1.7 mg BSA/mg dextran to this activated polysaccharide solution. The final BSA concentration was about 7.3 mg/ml. This reaction mixture was allowed to stand overnight at a temperature of about 4 C. An HPLC was conducted (OD 280 nm) to determine the existence of a BSA/dextran conjugate and the amount of BSA material present in the conjugate reaction product. The HPLC was conducted on a Phenomenex SEC3000, 1507.8 cm, equilibrated with 0.1 M KPO 4 , pH7.3, at a run velocity of 1 ml/minute. From HPLC, it was found that 35% of the protein was present in the high molecular weight peak for the conjugate (and 65% was present as free protein). Therefore, the resulting conjugate was found to contain about 0.6 mg BSA/mg dextran. EXAMPLE 4 For this example, the uronium salt reagent and various other reagents were added to the polysaccharide material at different times. Between additions of the uronium salt reagent, excess reagents were removed by ultrafiltration. A solution was prepared containing 15 mg dextran, 15 mg BSA monomer, and 3.33 ml saline. At time t0, 40 l of 0.3 M TNTU (in NMP) and 12 l of 1 M TEA (in NMP) were added to the solution. Then, at time t2 minutes, an additional 6 l of TEA was added. At time t1 hour, the following washing protocol was performed. The mixture was washed by ultrafiltration (on a Filtron Omega 30, 10 ml size). The filtered mixture was diluted to 10 ml with saline and then concentrated to 3 ml. Of this solution, 0.6 ml was removed for analysis. To the remaining polysaccharide solution, TNTU and TEA were added in the same manner as described above. After 1 hour of reaction time, the wash protocol was again repeated. At this time, 0.6 ml again was removed for analysis. The TNTU and TEA addition procedure was repeated a third time and again a fourth time, with the washing protocol as described above provided between these procedures. For these third and fourth additions, however, the amount of TNTU and TEA was doubled. After the fourth addition of TNTU and TEA, after the reaction proceeded for 1.5 hours, the reaction mixture was concentrated to 1.5 ml, and 0.5 ml of this solution was removed for analysis. The remaining material was concentrated to 0.6 ml. 40 l of TNTU and 10 l of TEA were added to the remaining 0.6 ml of material. After 1 hour, the mixture was passed over a S400HR gel filtration column. Through analysis of the samples, it was found that after the first addition, the resulting conjugate material contained about 0.043 mg BSA/mg dextran. After the fourth addition, the conjugate contained 0.17 mg BSA/mg dextran. This Example demonstrates that when the protein and polysaccharide are dilute, there is less coupling then when they are more concentrated. By the repeated addition of reagents, it was possible to significantly increase the amount of coupling. Removal of the used reagent and solvent kept their concentrations low, even when they were added multiple times. EXAMPLE 5 In this Example, a carbohydrate was coupled to a protein using TSTU to form a conjugate. For this procedure, 20 l of 0.5 M TSTU (in DMF, corresponding to about 10 moles TSTU) and 20 l of 0.5 M DMAP (in water) were mixed into 200 l sucrose (corresponding to about 30 moles). At time t1 minute, an additional 20 l of the TSTU solution and 20 l of the DMAP solution were added. At time t1.5 minutes, an additional 20 l of the TSTU solution and another 20 l DMAP were added. Then, at time t2 minutes, 200 l of 32.2 mg/ml BSA (monomeric) in saline was added to the activated sucrose solution. After about 20 seconds, 20 l of 1 M sodium carbonate was added, and then another 20 l of 1 M sodium carbonate was added. After about 20 minutes, the resulting reaction mixture was desalted on a 115 cm P6DG column (available from BioRad), equilibrated with PBS, and the void volumes were pooled. Then, the material was concentrated using a Centricon 30 device (available from Amicon) and again desalted, and finally the void volumes were pooled. The protein content was determined by the BioRad assay, and the carbohydrate content was determined using the resorcinol assay with sucrose as the standard. It was found that the resulting conjugate had 17.5 moles sucrose per mole BSA. This indicated coupling of a low molecular weight carbohydrate to a protein. EXAMPLE 6 Various uronium salts are used in this example to demonstrate that different salts can be used to activate polysaccharides in the process of the invention. In total, four different uronium salts, namely TSTU, TNTU, HBTU, and TBTU, were tested in this Example. All of the starting uronium salts were produced in a 0.3 M solution in NMP. DMAP used in this procedure also was present in a 0.3 M solution in NMP. The BSA protein material is monomeric with a concentration of 64.4 mg BSA/ml. This BSA material was mixed 1:1 (by weight) with 5HEPES buffer (which corresponds to 0.75 M HEPES and 5 mM EDTA to produce a solution having a pH of about 7.3). To carry out the reaction procedure for this Example, 54 l of T2000 dextran at a concentration of 74.4 mg/ml (corresponding to 4 mg dextran) was mixed with 28 l saline, 82 l water, and 86 l NMP in each of four different test tubes. Then, at time t0, 10 l of one of the uronium salts was added to each test tube so that each test tube contained a different uronium salt. 10 l of DMAP also was added to each test tube along with the uronium salt. At time t1 minute, an additional 10 l of the appropriate uronium salt was added to the corresponding test tube, and again at time t2 minutes, an additional 10 l of the appropriate uronium salt was added to the corresponding test tube. During this portion of the reaction procedure, the pH of the solution was maintained in the range of 8-9 with DMAP, and a total of about 50 l of DMAP was needed in each test tube to maintain the pH in this range. At the time t10 minutes, 100 l of the BSA solution was added to each test tube, which amount corresponds to about 1 mg BSA/mg dextran. The reaction in each test tube was allowed to proceed for about 20 hours, at which time the reaction product was assayed by HPLC on a Phenomenex BioSep G4000 (1507.8 cm, 50% 0.1 M KPO 4 , pH7.3, 50% 0.5 M KCl, 1 ml/minute) monitored at 280 nm. The assay results are tabulated below. TABLE 1 Uronium Salt % HMW BSA TSTU 79% TNTU 87% HBTU 36% TBTU 27% These test results confirm that all of the tested uronium salt reagents worked to activate the polysaccharide and supported coupling of the activated polysaccharide to the protein. EXAMPLE 7 This Example demonstrates that TNTU can be used to activate synthetic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The PVA was obtained from Aldrich (catalog number 36,062-7). It was 80% hydrolyzed and had an average molecular weight of 9000 to 10,000. The PVA was solubilized in water, with gentle heating, to a concentration of 20 mg/ml. 250 l of this PVA solution (corresponding to about 5 mg PVA) was mixed with 250 l hexanediamine to provide a solution having a pH of about 8. At time t0, 40 l of 0.3 M TNTU and 24 l 1 M TEA in NMP were added to the PVA solution. Then, at time t1 minute, an additional 12 l of the 1 M TEA solution was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight. A solid lump formed in the solution, and the mixture was warmed to resolubilize the solid. The resultant solution was then dialyzed exhaustively into saline (volume about 3.5 ml). It was determined that the resulting PVA solution, activated with TNTU, was about 0.113 mM in NH 2 , which corresponds to more than 6 NH 2 /100 KDa. This Example demonstrates that a uronium salt (e.g., TNTU in this example) can activate secondary alcohols. Since PVA is a synthetic polymer (not containing carboxyl groups), this shows that the process of the invention can be used to activate synthetic, non-carboxylated polymers. EXAMPLE 8 This Example is provided to demonstrate the one step procedure for simultaneously activating and coupling clinically relevant proteins and polysaccharides. Sample 8A For this sample, the protein starting material, tetanus toxoid, was present in a saline solution at a concentration of 16.8 mg/ml. The polysaccharide used was a PRP polysaccharide, solubilized at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in 2 M NaCl by rotating for one hour at room temperature. The TNTU activating agent was present in a 0.3 M solution in NMP. The TEA used in this Example was present in a 2 M solution in NMP. Finally, the glycine used was at a 2 M concentration in water, adjusted to pH 8. For the reaction procedure, 0.5 ml of the PRP solution (corresponding to 5 mg PRP) was combined with 297 l of the tetanus toxoid solution (corresponding to 5 mg of TT). This mixture was then concentrated to 0.5 ml using a Centricon 50 device (from Amicon). Thereafter, at time t0, 50 l of the TNTU activating agent was added. Approximately 15 seconds later, 20 l of the TEA was added. After 2 hours, 100 l of the glycine reagent was added. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand overnight. Then, the sample was passed over a 150 cm S400HR gel filtration column, equilibrated with saline. The high molecular weight fractions were pooled and assayed for tetanus toxoid and PRP. The material was found to have 0.78 mg tetanus toxoid per mg of PRP. Sample 8B For this Sample, a tetanus toxoid/Neisseria PsC conjugate was prepared using TNTU as an activating agent to activate the Neisseria PsC. This reaction procedure followed the one-step reaction protocol wherein the protein and polysaccharide are first mixed together, and thereafter, the uronium salt activating reagent is added to this mixture. First, 238 l of tetanus toxoid (having a concentration of 16.8 mg/ml) was added to 0.4 ml of Neisseria PsC (having a concentration of 10 mg/ml in saline). This mixture was then concentrated to about 0.3 ml using a Filtron Omega 30 pressure filtration device. 50 l of 0.3 M TNTU (in NMP) was then added to the concentrated protein/polysaccharide mixture. Thereafter, 50 l of 1M TEA (in NMP) was added, and shortly thereafter, an additional 25 l of 1 M TEA was added. The reaction proceeded overnight at 4 C. The mixture was passed over a S400HR gel filtration column (Pharmacia), 150 cm, equilibrated with PBS. The mixture was then sterile filtered on a Millex GV to obtain the high molecular weight fraction. This reaction product was assayed to determine the tetanus toxoid and Neisseria PsC content. It was found that the resulting conjugate contained 0.32 mg TT/mg Neisseria PsC. As is evident from the test results, this Example demonstrates the process of the invention wherein the polysaccharide is activated and coupled with the protein in a single process step. Additionally, this Example demonstrates the usefulness of TNTU in producing clinically relevant conjugates with a carboxyl containing polysaccharide. EXAMPLE 9 This Example describes the use of uronium salt reagents to prepare solid phase reagents. In general, a polysaccharide in liquid media (e.g., aqueous, organic/aqueous mixed, or organic media) is activated with a uronium salt reagent and coupled to an amino-bead, ELISA plate, or other solid phase material. The coupled polysaccharide and solid phase material may be useful, for example, as a diagnostic reagent, such as a solid phase material to absorb specific antibodies for analysis. A more specific example follows. 100 l of Pn 14 (at 10 g/ml) in saline is pipetted into the wells of an amino-functionalized ELISA plate (e.g., Nunc Covalink). 5 l of 0.3 M TSTU (in NMP) is pipetted into each well, followed by 5 l of 0.3 M TEA (in NMP). As controls, saline only, TSTU and TEA only, or Pn 14 only are placed in additional wells. After 1 hour, the wells are washed with saline. The wells are tested for the presence of Pn 14 bound to the ELISA plate using known anti-Pn 14 positive antisera, according to Lees et al., Vaccine, 1996, described above. These ELISA plates then are used for evaluation of anti-Pn 14 antisera. Other polysaccharides can be coupled to solid phase materials as well. Those skilled in the art will be capable of devising coupling schemes for other solid phase reagents, such as amino or hydrazide microbeads (available from Bangs Laboratories) and amino or hydrazide chromatography media (available from Pharmacia). EXAMPLE 10 Various Pneumococcal 14 based reagents and conjugates were prepared in this Example. The Pneumococcal based reagent comprises a biotin-Pn14 conjugate, coupled via a spacer (Sample 10A) or directly to the activated polysaccharide (Sample 10B). Sample 10A The starting material for this procedure was 0.5 ml Pneumococcal type 14 (available from American Tissue Culture Collection of Rockville, Md.) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in water. At time t0, 20 l of 0.5 M TSTU (in DMF) was added to the polysaccharide, followed immediately by the addition of 20 l of DMAP (0.5 M in water). At t1 minute, an additional 20 l of TSTU was added, and an additional 20 l TSTU was added at t1.5 minutes. 200 l of 1 M ethylenediamine (in water) was added at t2 minutes. DMAP was added periodically to the reaction solution throughout this procedure, in order to maintain the pH of the solution at about 8.5. After about an hour, the reaction mixture was desalted on a P6DG column (from BioRad, equilibrated in saline), and the resultant material was assayed for amines and polysaccharides. The material, containing ethylenediamine/TSTU/Pn 14 was determined to contain 7.6 amines/100 kDa Pn 14 at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. The biotin conjugate was then produced. 300 l of the ethylenediamine/TSTU/Pn 14 mixture described above (2 mg/ml) was mixed with 50 l 5HE. Then, 1.6 mg of sulfo NHS LC biotin (available from BioAffinity Systems) in 60 l of 50% DMF was added to the mixture. After 1 hour, the reaction mixture was still TNBS positive, so additional solid LC biotin was added. After 2 total hours, the reaction mixture was desalted on a P6DG column (from BioRad), equilibrated with PBS, and the void volumes were pooled. Sample 10B This Sample was produced in the same manner as Sample 10A, except at time t2 minutes, 250 l of biotincaproic hydrazide (available from Sigma), in 50% DMF was added (the biotin material was poorly soluble). After 1 hour, the undissolved material was removed by centrifuging, and the resulting solution was desalted on a P6DG column (available from BioRad), equilibrated in saline. To confirm the coupling of the biotin with the Pn 14 in these Samples, an assay for biotin was performed by ELISA, as generally described in E. A. Bayer and M. Wilchek, Methods of Enzymology, Vol. 184 (1990), pp. 49-51, which article is entirely incorporated herein by reference. In brief, for this procedure, ELISA immunoassay stripwell plates (available from Nunc Maxisorp) were coated with streptavidin (available from Zymed) at 1 g/ml in PBS and then incubated in a draft-free environment with the indicated concentrations of biotinylated Pn 14 or control Pn 14. A monoclonal anti-Pn 14 was then used to test for binding of the Pn 14 to the streptavidin coated plates. The following table illustrates the test results. TABLE 2 ELISA Absorbance Assay of Pn 14-Biotin or Pn 14 on Streptavidin-Coated Plates (10 minute test results) Pn 14 (g/ml) Sample 10A Sample 10B Pn 14 Alone 1.0 3.311 3.252 0.094 0.333 3.214 2.678 0.097 0.111 2.733 1.805 0.085 0.037 1.980 1.051 0.087 0.012 0.861 0.403 0.095 0.004 0.360 0.216 0.108 0.001 0.166 0.142 0.092 None 0.100 0.105 0.093 Primary Antibody: Monoclonal anti-Pn 14 at 1:2000 Secondary Antibody: Rabbit anti-mouse IgG-3-HRP Substrate: TMB Blocking: None As is apparent from these assay results, unlabeled control Pn 14 did not bind to the streptavidin coated ELISA plates, as indicated by the background level of the absorbance. The conjugate samples, however, did detachably bind to the plates, even at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml. This indicates that Samples 10A and 10B contained Pn 14 labeled with biotin. Sample 10C For this Sample, a clinically relevant conjugate vaccine was synthesized where a tetanus toxoid protein was coupled to a Pn 14 polysaccharide with a spacer. For this procedure, the NH 2 /TSTU/Pn14 material produced in Sample 10A was used. The coupling reaction procedure was conducted as follows, which is the same general coupling procedure described in A. Lees, et al., Vaccine, Vol. 12, No. 13, (1994), pp. 1160-1166, described above. For this coupling procedure, 100 l of 0.75 M HEPES, 10 mM EDTA at a pH of 7.3, and 75 l 0.1 M N-hydroxysuccinimidyl iodoacetate (SIA, available from BioAffinity Systems) in DMF were combined with 1.66 mg of the NH 2 /TSTU/Pn 14 material present in 1.15 ml saline. This reaction produced an iodoacetylated Pn 14 reaction product (Pn 14-SIA). In a separate procedure, 3 mg of tetanus toxoid, at a concentration of 16.8 mg/mil in saline (corresponding to 180 l of solution), was mixed with 100 l of HE and 6 l of 0.1 M N-succinimidyl S-acetylthioacetate (SATA, available from BioAffinity Systems) in DMF. This reaction produced a tetanus protein with protected thiols (TT-SATA). After three hours, the reaction products above were separately desalted on a 115 cm P6DG column (from BioRad), equilibrated in PBS for the tetanus toxoid product and equilibrated in saline for the Pn 14 product. The void volumes of each fraction were concentrated (separately) in a Centricon 30 device (available from Amicon). At this time, 125 l of the TT-SATA reaction product was combined with about 300 l of the Pn 14-SIA reaction product and 50 l of 5HE and 0.5 M hydroxylamine. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight. Then, the reaction was quenched by adding 10 l of 10 mM mercaptoethanol (BME) and allowed to stand for one hour. Then, 10 l of 0.5 M iodoacetamide was added, and this mixture was allowed to stand for 10 minutes. The resulting reaction mixture was passed over an S400HR gel filtration column (available from Pharnacia) (150 cm, equilibrated in PBS, 0.25 ml/minute, about 1 ml/tube), and the void volume fraction was obtained. The resulting conjugate was found to have about 1.5 mg tetanus toxoid per mg of Pn 14. Sample 10D For this Sample, a tetanus toxoid protein was coupled directly to a Pn 14 polysaccharide using TNTU as an activating agent. Therefore, this Sample demonstrates that a clinically relevant protein/polysaccharide conjugate can be produced using a TNTU activating agent. First, Pn 14 polysaccharide and tetanus toxoid protein each were mixed into a saline solution, each at a concentration of about 6.3 mg/ml. Then, at time t0, 24 l of 0.5 M TNTU in NMP was added to the mixture. 12 l of 1 M TEA in NMP was then added. At time t1 minute, an additional 6 l of 1 M TEA was added to the mixture. At time t75 minutes, the reaction was quenched by adding 150 l of 1 M glycine (pH 8). The mixture was fractionated on an S400HR column (equilibrated in PBS), and the high molecular weight fraction was pooled, sterile filtered, and assayed. It was found that the resulting conjugate material contained 0.44 mg tetanus toxoid per mg of Pn 14. In addition to demonstrating that a TNTU uronium salt activating agent can be used to produce a clinically relevant conjugate, this Example demonstrates that the activation step and the coupling step can occur in a one step procedure. Notably, in the procedure of this Example, the protein and polysaccharide are mixed together first, and then the activating reagent (TNTU) is added to this mixture. As the polysaccharide is activated by the activating reagent, the protein is immediately available for coupling in a convenient one step procedure. EXAMPLE 11 In this Example, the immunogenicity of certain conjugates produced using the uronium activating agents was tested. Sample 11A To begin the conjugate preparation procedure, 2.5 mg of Pn 14 polysaccharide and 2.5 mg of tetanus toxoid protein were mixed together in a total volume of 350 l. At time t0, 24 l of 0.5 M TNTU (in NMP) was added, and then 12 l of 1 M TEA (in NMP) was added. At time t1 minute, an additional 6 l of 1 M TEA was added. The reaction was quenched at time t75 minutes by adding 150 l of 1 M glycine (pH8). The reaction mixture was passed over an S400HR gel filtration column, equilibrated in PBS, the high molecular weight fractions were pooled, sterile filtered, and assayed. It was determined that the resulting conjugate had 0.44 mg TT/mg Pn 14. Sample 11B For this Sample, the tetanus toxoid-SATA-SIA-NH 2 /TSTU/Pn 14 conjugate prepared in Example 10C was used. As noted above, this conjugate was found to include 1.5 mg TT/mg Pn 14. Immunogenicity Data Sample 11A and Sample 11B were used in a mouse model to test the immunogenicity of the resulting conjugates. Three groups of mice (having four mice per group) were treated with various different immunogens. One group of mice was treated with vaccine conjugate Sample 11A, one group with vaccine conjugate Sample 11B, and one group with Pn 14 alone. On Day 0 each mouse was vaccinated with a priming dosage of the respective immunogen (each immunogen contained 5 g of Pn 14, either present alone or as part of the conjugate). On Day 14, each mouse received a booster immunization using the same immunogen. The mice were led on Day 28. The sera from the mice of the group were pooled, and an anti-Pn 14 IgG titer as performed giving the following results: TABLE 3 Conjugate Anti-Pn 14 IgG titer Sample 11A 72,900 Sample 11B 110,284 Pn 14 Only 326 As demonstrated by these test results, the two Samples made according to the invention, using uronium salts, induced excellent immunogenic responses in the mice of the group. As expected, Pn 14 alone induced little immunogenic response. EXAMPLE 12 For this example, the immunological and bactericidal properties of a conjugate according to the invention were investigated. In this instance, a tetanus toxoid/Neisseria PsC conjugate was prepared using TNTU as an activating agent. First, 4 mg of tetanus toxoid solution (having a concentration of 19.8 mg/ml) were added to 0.4 ml of Neisseria PsC (having a concentration of 10 mg/ml in saline). The tetanus toxoid material was obtained from Mass Public Health Labs. At time t0, 50 l of 0.3 M TNTU (in NMP) was added to the protein and polysaccharide mixture. Thereafter, 25 l of 2M TEA (in NMP) were added. The reaction proceeded overnight at 4 C. Then, the mixture was passed over a S400HR gel filtration column (Pharmacia), equilibrated with PBS. The high molecular weight fractions were pooled and then sterile filtered by passing the mixture through a Millex GV device (available from Millipore Corp.). It was determined that the resulting conjugate product contained 0.29 mg TT/mg Neisseria PsC. This conjugate material was then used in a mouse model to test the immunogenicity of the resulting conjugates. Each of four mice was vaccinated with a priming dosage of the conjugate containing 2.5 g Neisseria PsC on Day 0. On Day 14, each mouse received a booster immunization of the conjugate in the same amount. The mice were bled on Day 28. The sera from the mice were pooled and assayed by ELISA (0.1 OD end point) for anti-PsC antibodies. Additionally, a bactericidal assay was performed according to the procedure described in K. H. Wong, et al., Journal of Biological Standards, Vol. 5 (1977), beginning at page 197 (this article is entirely incorporated herein by reference). The following test results were obtained: Anti-PsC IgG titer31,019 Bactericidal titer1:320. As is evident from this data, the conjugate according to the invention induced excellent immunogenic responses in the mice of the group. Additionally, an excellent bactericidal effect was induced by the conjugates according to the invention (a bactericidal titer greater than 1:40 is typically considered protective). OTHER FEATURES OF THE INVENTION This invention further relates to vaccines, immunogens, and immunological, therapeutic, and diagnostic reagents that can be prepared from the conjugates produced in accordance with the invention.

Additionally, applicants have described several examples and processes for producing conjugates in accordance with the invention. While these procedures may be further optimized (e.g., optimizing the pH conditions during coupling), such optimization of the process and reaction conditions is a matter of routine experimentation.

The compositions of the present invention have excellent compatibility with the skin, good sensation during use, and a high degree of safety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to phosphoric triesters which have remarkable compatibility with skin, have excellent feel during use, and are mild to the skin. The invention also relates to external compositions containing the triesters as well as to a method for effectively preparing asymmetric phosphoric triesters. 2. Description of Related Art Liquid oils are very important and indispensable to cosmetic bases. In addition to performing essential functions such as imparting lubricity to the skin, exhibiting barrier functions by forming hydrophobic films, and suppressing transdermal loss of moisture, liquid oils today are required to 1) be compatible with the skin, 2) provide good sensation when applied to the skin, and 3) be safe to the skin. In order to meet these requirements, a diversity of new liquid oil bases have been developed and applied in various ways. For example, triglycerides such as squalane, olive oil, etc. are used as sebum analogs for the purpose of providing skin compatibility. Synthetic ester oils such as isopropyl palmitate and isopropyl myristate as well as silicone oils are used to provide the skin with good sensation, due to their low viscosity. However, these conventional oil bases are problematic in that those having higher polarities which generally accounts for higher skin compatibility tend to have stronger intermolecular forces, resulting in disagreeable sensations, e.g., stickiness, to the skin. Particularly, when ester oils and triglycerides are used, they tend to decompose and cause safety problems, as their compatibility with the skin is enhanced. Moreover, oil bases having low molecular weights also involve crucial problems in safety, although they have relatively good sensation and compatibility with the skin. On the other hand, lower trialkyl phosphoric esters are already widely used as additives such as plasticizers and stabilizers, as lubricants, or as dispersants due to their excellent characteristics. They are liquid at ambient temperatures, chemically stable, and low in cloud point. They have polarity as well as excellent dissolvability, compatibility, miscibility, and pigment-dispersing ability. However, they are not necessarily satisfactory in terms of safety to the skin. Higher trialkyl esters are reliable in safety, but lack in good sensation as they have high viscosities or high melting points. As described above, no conventional oil bases meet the following requirements simultaneously: 1) high compatibility with the skin, 2) good sensation during use, and 3) safety to the skin. Thus, liquid oils which fulfill these criteria are still desired. Under the above circumstances, the present inventors have conducted extensive studies, and have found that the phosphoric triesters represented by the formula (1) described below having certain ester residues have high polarity, excellent compatibility with the skin, low viscosity, and low melting points, and also provide a high degree of safety. The present inventors have also found that compositions containing the phosphoric triesters as liquid oils have excellent compatibility with the skin, good sensation during use, and are very safe. Moreover, in the course of researching of methods for synthesizing these phosphoric triesters, the present inventors have discovered an effective method for preparing asymmetric phosphoric triesters.

M is preferably alkali metal or alkaline earth metal, and particularly preferably alkali metal. The alkyl phosphoric halide of formula (2) which is used in method (i) of the present invention can be obtained by reacting a phosphorus oxyhalide of formula (5) with a first organic hydroxyl compound of formula (6) or with a mixture of the first organic hydroxyl compound and a second organic hydroxyl compound of formula (7) in the presence of an organic amine. However, in order to obtain phosphoric triesters with high purity, method (ii) is recommended, in which phosphorus oxyhalide and an organic hydroxyl compound are first reacted and then a hydrochloric salt of organic amine is removed. The phosphorus oxyhalide of formula (5) used in the present invention is preferably phosphorus oxychloride. Examples of the organic hydroxyl compounds of formula (6) or (7) include alcohols having alkyls or alkenyls represented by R 4 and R 5 . The alkyl phosphoric halide of formula (2) which is used in method (i) of the present invention may be obtained by any known method. For example, 1 mol of phosphorus oxyhalide is reacted with 0.8 to 2.2 mol of an organic hydroxyl compound for 2 to 16 hours at a reaction temperature of 50 to 50 C. Examples of organic amines which can be used in this reaction include triethylamine, tripropylamine, tributylamine, pyridine, and picoline. In order to remove hydrochloric acid salts of amines after reaction of phosphorus oxyhalide and organic hydroxyl compounds, washing, filtration, centrifugal separation, etc. may be suitably applied. In method (ii) of the present invention, the reaction of alkyl phosphoric halide of formula (2) (which is obtained by removing a hydrochloric acid salt of amine after reaction of phosphorus oxyhalide and an organic hydroxyl compound) and a alcohol or alcoholate of formula (3) may be carried out by either adding an alcohol or alcoholate to alkyl phosphoric halide or adding alkyl phosphoric halide to an alcohol or alcoholate. Preferably, alkyl phosphoric halide is added to an alcohol or alcoholate. That is, method (iii) is preferred in which method (i) and method (ii) are combined. The alkyl phosphoric halide of formula (2) of the present invention may be used as is or in a solution form in an organic solvent. The organic solvent is not particularly limited insofar as it is inert to the reaction and is capable of dissolving alkyl phosphoric halides. Examples of proper solvents include aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, and octane; alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and methylcyclohexane; and aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene, and ethers such as tetrahydrofuran. These solvents may be used singly or in combinations of two or more. Although either alcohol or alcoholate of formula (3) may be used interchangeably, alcoholate is more preferred. Commercially available alcoholates may be used. In view of industrial adequacy, an alcoholate in alcohol prepared by adding a hydroxide of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal to an alcohol is recommended. The alcohol preferably has an alkyl or alkenyl group which is identical to that possessed by the alcoholate. Hydroxides of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal are preferably sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, and calcium hydroxide. Particularly, alkali metal hydroxides, in particular sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, are preferred. The amount of alcohol used for preparing an alcohol solution of alcoholate is preferably such an amount that is sufficient for dissolving the alcoholate. Specific amounts can be determined by the kinds of alcohol and alcoholate. For example, alcohol is preferably used in such an amount which falls between the amount (on a weight basis) equivalent to that of alkyl phosphoric halide and the amount 10 times that of the alkyl phosphoric halide. When alcoholate is prepared by adding an alkyl phosphoric halide to an alcohol, water is by-produced. In the case where an alcohol such as butanol which is not miscible with water is used, water is preferably removed from the reaction system by azeotropic distillation. In the reaction of an alkyl phosphoric halide of formula (2) of the present invention and an alcohol or alcoholate of formula (3), 1 mol of an alkyl phosphoric halide is reacted with 1.0 to 5.0 mol of an alcohol or alcoholate. The reaction temperature is not lower than 0 C., but not higher than the boiling point of alcohol, and is preferred to be kept in a range of 10 to 40 C. Although the reaction time is not particularly limited, it is preferably 1 to 5 hours, and more preferably 1 to 2 hours. After completion of reaction, excessive alcohol is distilled off, and inorganic salts are removed by filtration or similar methods. The resulting matter is washed with water, and dried. Thus, an asymmetric phosphoric triester of formula (4) having a high purity can be obtained at a high yield. The amount of the phosphoric triester of formula (1) of the present invention to be incorporated into an external composition is not particularly limited. For example, when emulsion-type compositions are prepared, it is preferred that the triester be incorporated in an amount ranging from 0.001 to 90% by weight, and particularly from 1 to 50% by weight, of the total weight of the composition. The external compositions of the present invention may be water-in-oil emulsions, oil-in-water emulsions, or oilbase preparations. The external compositions of the present invention may be applied to the skin or the hair. Moreover, they may be medicinal compositions or cosmetic compositions. Preferably, the external compositions of the present invention are cosmetic compositions to be applied to the skin or the hair. The forms of the external compositions of the present invention are not particularly limited. Examples of applicable forms include packs, foundations, lipsticks, skin detergents, shampoos, rinses, styling agents, hair nourishers, hair growing agents, and ointments. In addition to the phosphoric triester of formula (1), the external compositions of the invention may also contain optional components which are routinely used as components of external compositions. Examples of such optional components include oils, water, surfactants, humectants, UV-shielding agents, chelating agents, pH regulators, preservatives, thickeners, colorants, perfumes, and medicinal components. The medicinal components are not particularly limited. For example, analgetic/antiphlogistic agents, antipruriginous agents, bactericidal/disinfecting agents, astringents, skin ointments, hormones, and vitamins.

This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser.

The invention relates to novel substituted aminophenyluracils, to a process for their preparation and to their use as herbicides and insecticides. It is known that certain substituted aminophenyluracils have herbicidal properties (cf. EP-408 382/U.S. Pat. No. 5 084 084/U.S. Pat. No. 5 127 935/U.S. Pat. No. 5 154 755, EP-563 384, DE-44 12 079), but they have hitherto not attained any major importance either as herbicides or as insecticides.

USE EXAMPLES Example A Pre-emergence Test Solvent: 5 parts by weight of acetone Emulsifier: 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of emulsifier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration. Seeds of the test plants are sown in normal soil and, after 24 hours, watered or sprayed with the preparation of the active compound. It is advantageous to keep the amount of water per unit area constant. The concentration of the active compound in the preparation is immaterial, only the amount of active compound applied per unit area matters. After three weeks, the degree of damage to the plants is rated in % damage by comparison with the development of the untreated control. The figures denote: 0%no effect (like untreated control) 100%total destruction In this test, very strong activity against weeds such as cyperus (60-100%), lolium (70-90%), panicum (70-95%), abutilon (100%), chenopodium (100%) and datura (100%) is shown, for example, by the compounds of Preparation Examples 1 and 2 at an application rate of 60 g/ha, combined with very good tolerance by crops such as, for example, maize (0%). Example B Post-emergence Test Solvent: 5 parts by weight of acetone Emulsifier: 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of emulsifier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration. Test plants which have a height of 5-15 cm are sprayed with the preparation of the active compound in such a way as to apply the particular amounts of active compound desired per unit area. The concentration of the spray liquor is chosen so that the particular mixed amounts of active compound are applied in 1000 1/ha. After three weeks, the degree of damage to the plants is rated in % damage by comparison with the development of the untreated control. The figures denote: 0%no effect (like untreated control) 100%total destruction In this test, very strong activity against weeds such as echinochloa (95%), sorghum (70-80%), abutilon (100%), chenopodium (100%), datura (100%) and solanum (100%) is shown, for example, by the compounds of Preparation Examples 1 and 2 at an application rate of 30 g/ha, combined with good tolerance by crops such as, for example, barley (0-10%). Example C Phaedon Larvae Test Solvent: 7 parts by weight of dimethylformamide Emulsifier: 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent and the stated amount of emulsifier, and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration. Cabbage leaves ( Brassica oleracea ) are treated by being dipped into the preparation of the active compound of the desired concentration and are infested with mustard beetle larvae ( Phaedon cochleariae ) while the leaves are still moist. After the desired period of time, the destruction in % is determined. 100% means that all the beetle larvae have been killed; 0% means that none of the beetle larvae have been killed. In this test, a destruction of 80 to 100% was caused, after 7 days, for example by the compounds of Preparation Examples 1 and 2 at an active compound concentration of 0,1%. Example D Nephotettix Test Solvent: 7 parts by weight of dimethylformamide Emulsifier: 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent and the stated amount of emulsifier, and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration. Rice seedlings (Oryza sativa) are treated by being dipped into the preparation of the active compound of the desired concentration and are infested with larvae of the green rice leafhopper (Nephotettix cincticeps) while the seedlings are still moist. After the desired period of time, the destruction in % is determined. 100% means that all the leafhoppers have been killed; 0% means that none of the leafhoppers have been killed. In this test, a destruction of 100% was caused, after 6 days, for example by the compounds of Preparation Examples 1 and 2 at an active compound concentration of 0,1%. What is claimed is: 1.

A particularly preferred agent that is useful in practicing the invention is a ValBoroPro. This application claims priority under Title 35 119(e), of U. S. Provisional Application No. 60/084,128, filed May 4, 1998, and entitled HEMATOPOIETIC STIMULATION, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to methods and products for producing increased numbers of hematopoietic cells, of restoring to preselected normal levels numbers of hematopoietic cells, to therapies for treating deficiencies in hematopoietic cells and to in vitro methodologies for culturing hematopoietic cells. PT-100 is a dipeptide consisting of valine-prolineboronic acid (ValboroPro) designed to interact with the cell surface receptor CD26. CD26, a type II transmembrane protein is expressed on the cell surface of a number of cell types, including lymphocytes (Marguet, D. et al., Advances in Neuroimmunol. 3:209-215 (1993)), hematopoietic cells (Vivier, I. et al., J. Immunol. 147:447-454 (1991); Bristol, et al., J. Immunol. 149:367 (1992)) thymocytes (Dang, N. H. et al., J. Immunol. 147:2825-2832 (1991), Tanaka, T. et al., J. Immunol. 149:481-486 (1992), Darmoul, D. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267:4824-4833 (1992)), intestinal brush border membrane and endothelial cells. Cell surface associated CD26 is a sialoglycoprotein, with most of its mass on the outside of the cell. CD26 has been best characterized on peripheral T cells where it functions as a potent costimulatory signal for T cell activation. Its surface expression is upregulated upon T cell activation (Dong, R. P. et al., Cell 9:153-162 (1996), Torimoto, Y. et al., J. Immunol. 147:2514 (1991), Mittrucker, H-W. et al., Eur. J. Immun. 25:295-297 (1995), Hafler, D. A. et al, J. Immunol. 142:2590-2596 (1989), Dang, N. H. et al., J. Immunol. 144:409 (1990)). CD26 has also been identified in rodents as an important regulatory surface receptor in hematopoiesis and lymphoid development (Vivier, I. et al., J. Immunol. 147:447-454 (1991)). The primary structure of CD26 is highly conserved between species (Ogata, S. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264 : 3596 - 3601 (1998)). In humans CD26 seems to be involved in the regulation of thymocyte activation, differentiation and maturation (Dang, N. H. et al., J. Immunol. 147 : 2825 - 2832 (1991); Kameoka, J. et al., Blood 85:1132-1137 (1995)). We have evidence that CD26 is expressed within the human and murine hematopoietic systems. CD26 is an ectoenzyme with activity identical to that of Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV (DPP-IV), a serine type exopeptidase with high substrate specificity. It cleaves N-terminal dipeptides from proteins if the penultimate amino acid is proline, or in some cases alanine (Fleischer, B. Immunol. Today 15:180 (1994)). PT-100 is a potent inhibitor of DPP-IV activity. The prior art PCT published application WO94/03055 teaches methods of producing increased numbers of hematopoietic cells by administering inhibitors of DPP-IV. The teaching of this published application, however, is that dosages of at least 1 mg/kg body weight are necessary to achieve such hematopoietic cell increases. This published application also teaches that inhibitors are administered to mammals which have an established deficiency of hematopoietic cells. The teaching also suggests that cytokines be administered in conjunction with the inhibitors to increase the production of hematopoietic cells in a subject. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is based upon a variety of surprising and unexpected findings. It has been discovered, unexpectedly, that the agents useful according to the invention stimulate growth factor production by stromal cells. It also has been discovered, unexpectedly, that the agents useful according to the invention stimulate proliferation of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells, but do not stimulate directly the differentiation or proliferation of committed progenitor cells. It further has been discovered, unexpectedly, that the agents useful according to the invention can be administered at doses much lower than would have been expected according to the teachings of the prior art. Another unexpected finding is that the agents according to the invention can accelerate the time it takes to achieve hematopoietic cell recovery after treatment with an hematopoietic cell inhibitor. Another unexpected finding is that the agents useful according to the invention can at relatively low doses, restore normal levels of neutrophils at least as fast as the most successful commercially available product used worldwide for this purpose, except that the agents useful according to the invention can be used orally, whereas the commercially available product (which represents more than a billion dollar market) must be injected. These unexpected results have important therapeutic and experimental research implications. According to one aspect of the invention, a method is provided for treating a subject to stimulate hematopoiesis in the subject. The invention involves administering to a subject in need of such treatment an amount of an agent effective to increase the number of hematopoietic cells or mature blood cells in the subject, wherein the amount is less than 1 mg/kg body weight per day and wherein the agent is a compound of Formula I. The agents useful according to the invention are compounds of Formula I: wherein m is an integer between 0 and 10, inclusive; A and A 1 are L-amino acid residues (for glycine there is no such distinction) such that the A in each repeating bracketed unit can be a different amino acid residue; the C bonded to B is in the L-configuration; the bonds between A and N, A 1 and C, and between A 1 and N are peptide bonds; and each X 1 and X 2 is, independently, a hydroxyl group or a group capable of being hydrolysed to a hydroxyl group in aqueous solution at physiological pH. By the C bonded to B is in the L-configuration is meant that the absolute configuration of the C is like that of an L-amino acid. Thus, the group has the same relationship to the C as the COOH group of an L-amino acid has to its carbon. In some embodiments, A and A 1 are independently proline or alanine residues; m is 0; X 1 and X 2 are hydroxyl groups; the inhibitor is L-Ala-L-boroPro; and the inhibitor is L-Pro-L-boropro. In one important aspect of the invention, the subject has an abnormally low level of hematopoietic cells or mature blood cells and the agent is administered in an amount effective to restore levels of a hematopoietic cell-type or mature blood cell-type to a preselected normal or protective level. The agent preferably is administered to the subject in at least 2 doses in an 18 hours period. The invention has particularly important applications in the restoration of normal or protective levels of neutrophils, erythrocytes and platelets. The most preferred agent is ValBoroPro. According to another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for shortening or eliminating the time that a subject has an abnormally low level of hematopoietic or mature blood cells resulting from treatment with a hematopoietic cell inhibitor. An agent is administered to a subject in need of such treatment in an amount effective to increase the number of hematopoietic cells or mature blood cells in the subject, wherein the administration of the agent begins prior to or substantially simultaneous with administration of the hematopoietic cell inhibitor. The agents and the preferred agent are as described above. In one important embodiment, the hematopoietic cell inhibitor causes an abnormally low level of hematopoietic cells or mature blood cells in the subject and the agent is administered in an amount effective to restore levels of a hematopoietic cell type to a preselected normal or protective level. Preferably, the agent is administered to the subject in at least 2 doses in an 18 hour period. In important embodiments, the agent is used to restore in the subject normal or protective levels of neutrophils, erythrocytes or platelets. The preferred effective amount of agent is as described above. According to another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for preparing a subject for treatment with a hematopoietic cell inhibitor. The method involves administering to the subject prior to the subject receiving the hematopoietic cell inhibitor an agent in an amount effective to stimulate in the subject production of growth factors. In one embodiment the agent stimulates stromal cell production of growth factor. The agents and the preferred agent are as described above. In one important embodiment, the growth factor is granulocyte colony stimulating factor. In other embodiments the growth factor is selected from the group consisting of IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-11, IL-17, TPO, EPO, MCSF, GMCSF, FLT-3 Ligand and Stem Cell Factor. Preferably, the amount administered to the subject is less than 1 mg/kg body weight per day. It also is preferred that the administration of the agent be in at least 2 doses of the agent in an 18 hour period. According to another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for treating a subject to increase the number of hematopoietic cells or mature blood cells in the subject.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention involves the stimulation of proliferation, differentiation and mobilization of hematopoietic cells. The invention is useful whenever it is desirable to stimulate the proliferation or differentiation, of or to mobilize, hematopoietic cells. Mobilization of hematopoietic cells is characterized by the enrichment of early progenitor cells in the bone marrow and the recruitment of these cells to the periphery in response to a mobilization agent (e.g. G-CSF, GM-CSF, etc.). The agents useful according to the invention can be used to inhibit hematopoietic cell deficiencies or to restore hematopoietic and mature blood cell count in subjects with such deficiencies. Such agents also may be used in connection with hematopoietic cell transplants, such as bone marrow or peripheral blood transplants, when used to replenish or create an immune system in a subject. The agents further can be used as an immune booster. The agents also are useful in vitro in connection with the culturing of cells for therapeutic and research uses. As used herein, subject means humans, nonhuman primates, dogs, cats, sheep, goats, horses, cows, pigs and rodents. One important aspect of the invention involves restoring or preventing a deficiency in hematopoietic cell number in a subject. Such deficiencies can arise, for example, from genetic abnormalities, from disease, from stress, from chemotherapy (e.g. cytotoxic drug treatment, steroid drug treatment, immunosuppressive drug treatment, etc.) and from radiation treatment. The invention is useful in general to restore deficiencies created by hematopoietic cell inhibitors. A hematopoietic cell inhibitor is an exogenously-applied agent (such as a drug or radiation treatment) which causes a decrease in the subject of hematopoietic cells and/or mature blood cells. Hematopoietic cells as used herein refer to granulocytes (e.g. promyelocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils), erythrocytes, reticulocytes, thrombocytes (e.g. megakaryoblasts, platelet-producing megakaryocytes and platelets), lymphocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages. Mature blood cells consist of mature lymphocytes, platelets, erythrocytes, reticulocytes, granulocytes and macrophages. In certain important aspects of the invention, the agents useful according to the invention increase the number of neutrophils, erythrocytes and platelets. In connection with neutrophils, the agents may be used to treat, inter alia, drug or radiation-induced neutropenia, chronic idiopathic neutropenia and cyclic neutropenia. One important aspect of the invention is restoring in a subject normal or protective hematopoietic cell levels. A normal level as used herein can be a level in a control population, which preferably includes subjects having similar characteristics as the treated individual, such as age. The normal level can also be a range, for example, where a population is used to obtain a baseline range for a particular group into which the subject falls. The population can also be divided into groups, such as into quadrants, with the lowest quadrant being individuals with the lowest levels of hematopoietic cells and the highest quadrant being individuals having the highest levels of hematopoietic cells. Thus, the normal value can depend upon a particular population selected. Preferably, the normal levels are those of apparently healthy subjects which have no prior history of hematopoietic cell disorders. Such normal levels, then can be established as preselected values, taking into account the category in which an individual falls. Appropriate ranges and categories can be selected with no more than routine experimentation by those of ordinary skill in the art. Either the mean or another preselected number within the range can be established as the normal preselected value. Likewise, the level in a subject prior to treatment with a hematopoietic cell inhibitor can be used as the predetermined value. In general, the normal range for neutrophils is about 1800-7250 per l (mean 3650); for basophils 0-150 per l (mean 30); for eosinophils 0-700 per l (mean 150); for macrophages and monocytes 200-950 per l (mean 430); for lymphocytes 1500-4000 per l (mean 2500); for erythrocytes 4.210 6 6.110 6 per l; and for platelets 13310 3 33310 3 l. The foregoing ranges are at the 95% confidence level. In connection with certain conditions, the medical community has established certain preselected values. For example, mild neutropenia is characterized as having a count of between 1000 and 2000 per l, moderate neutropenia at between 500 and 1000 per l and severe neutropenia at below 500 per l. Likewise, in adults, a lymphocyte count at less than 1500 is considered a medically undesirable condition. In children the value is less than 3000. Other preselected values will be readily known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The agents useful according to the invention can be used to establish or to re-establish such preselected values, including normal levels. Protective levels of hematopoietic cells is the number of cells required to confer clinical benefit to the patient. The required levels can be equal to or less than the normal levels. Such levels are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, a protective level of neutrophils is above 1000, preferably, at least 1500. According to another aspect of the invention, the agents useful herein can be applied at doses below those which were described in the prior art. In particular, it has been discovered unexpectedly that the agents of the invention can be administered in doses less than 1 mg/kg body weight per day. In particular, the agents of the invention have been used successfully at levels of 0.1 mg/kg body weight per day, which is 1 order of magnitude below the teachings of the prior art. As will be readily recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, this has advantages in that less material is required for treatment, thereby lessening any risk of side effects. Likewise, this has advantages in connection with the cost of manufacture of the drug products of the invention. According to another aspect of the invention, better therapeutic results can be achieved when the agents are applied in multiple doses per day. This finding is unexpected and, additionally, it has been found that there is no added medically useful effect when the agents useful according to the invention are administered for lengthy periods of time. Thus, it has been discovered, unexpectedly, that only very brief periods of treatment are needed to achieve established therapeutic goals. As described in the examples below, subjects treated with the agents useful according to the invention in 2 doses per day versus 1 dose per day achieved recovery of hematopoietic cells almost 33% faster than subjects receiving only 1 dose per day. Surprisingly, this result did not depend upon the absolute amount of drug given to the subject, but instead related to the number of times the subject was administered the drug. In other words, as shown below, giving twice as much drug, but only once a day, did not speed the recovery of hematopoietic cell number. Thus, an aspect of the invention involves giving the agents useful according to the invention in 2 or 3 doses in an 18 hour period. As used herein, an 18 hour period refers in general to the time during which a subject is awake in any 24 hour period; it is intended to indicate 2 doses per day, 3 doses per day, and the like. According to still another aspect of the invention, it has been discovered unexpectedly that the agents useful according to the invention need be administered for fewer days than expected according to the prior art. In particular, in the mouse models employed, there was very little difference in the speed of recovery of hematopoietic cell count and in the ability to reestablish normal levels of hematopoietic cells when treatment was 3 days, versus 4 days, versus 5 days. It is believed, therefore, that when applied to humans, a complete drug treatment will involve 7 days or less, more preferably 6 days or less, more preferably 5 days or less, more preferably 4 days or less, and even more preferably 3 days or less. As a result, the invention therefore provides kits which contain complete treatment packages for restoring hematopoietic cell count, which kits are described in greater detail below. According to another aspect of the invention, the time that a subject has an abnormally low level of hematopoietic cells resulting from treatment with a hematopoietic cell inhibitor is shortened. It has been discovered, unexpectedly, that the agents used according to the invention stimulate growth factor production by stromal cells. For example, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) production by stromal cells is stimulated. GCSF acts to drive specifically neutrophil-lineage differentiation. It does not affect the differentiation or proliferation of other committed hematopoietic cells, including other granulocytes, such as eosoniphils, basophils, mast cells and macrophages. (It is known to act synergistically, however, in vitro with other cytokines to affect proliferation of pluripotent stem cells, though the in vivo importance of this observation is not known). Because stromal cells are not rapidly dividing cells and are not generally adversely impacted by hematopoietic cell inhibitors, the agents useful according to the invention can be applied to subjects substantially simultaneously with or even prior to treatment with a hematopoietic cell inhibitor in order to stimulate stromal cells to produce growth factor which will be readily abundant and helpful in regenerating the hematopoietic cells after treatment by the hematopoietic cell inhibitor. In the prior art, such treatment has been delayed until substantially after treatment with the hematopoietic cell inhibitor. Substantially simultaneously with, as used herein, means within 24 hours of treatment with the hematopoietic cell inhibitor. Preferably, the agents useful according to the invention are administered within 2 hours of treatment with the hematopoietic cell inhibitor, if they are administered after treatment with the hematopoietic cell inhibitor. If they are administered before treatment with the hematopoietic cell inhibitor, then they are administered close enough in time to the treatment with the inhibitor so that stromal cell production of growth factor is enhanced in the days immediately following treatment with the hematopoietic cell inhibitor. Another aspect of the invention involves treatment of a subject to prepare a subject for subsequent treatment with other agents. It has been discovered, unexpectedly, that the agents useful according to the invention stimulate the proliferation of primitive, noncommitted hematopoietic progenitor cells, but not directly the differentiation of committed progenitor cells. It is known in the art that such cells may or may not include CD34 cells. CD34 cells are immature cells present in blood products, express the CD34 cell surface marker, and are believed to include a subpopulation of cells with the capacity to self-renew and to differentiate into all of the mature blood cell types. Because the agents useful according to the invention stimulate the proliferation of such self-renewing cells, the invention is useful to prepare a subject for treatment with other exogenous growth factors and cytokines which in turn result in the differentiation of such uncommitted progenitor cells into committed progenitor cells. Likewise, the agents useful according to the invention can be administered to a subject to expand in the subject hematopoietic cells and to mobilize such cells, prior to extracting the cells from the subject for transplantation or re-infusion. Such cells may be used for research purposes or can be treated ex vivo or reintroduced into the subject with or without expansion in vitro. The agents useful according to the invention can be administered in conjunction with exogenous growth factors and cytokines which are specifically selected to achieve a particular outcome. For example, if it is desired to stimulate a particular hematopoietic cell type, then growth factors and cytokines which stimulate proliferation and differentiation of such cell type are used. Thus, it is known that interleukins-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 17 are involved in lymphocyte differentiation. Interleukins 3 and 4 are involved in mast cell differentiation. Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF), interleukin-3 and interleukin-5 are involved in the eosinophil differentiation. GMCSF, macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) and IL-3 are involved in macrophage differentiation. GMCSF, GCSF and IL-3 are involved in neutrophil differentiation. GMSCF, IL-3, IL-6, IL-11 and TPO are involved in platelet differentiation. Flt3 Ligand is involved in dendritic cell growth. GMCSF, IL-3, and erythropoietin are involved in erythrocycte differentiation. Finally, the self-renewal of primitive, pluripotent progenitor cells capable of sustaining hematopoiesis requires SCF, Flt3 Ligand, G-CSF, IL-3, IL-6 and IL-11. Various combinations for achieving a desired result will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Because the agents useful according to the invention stimulate primitive, non-committed hematopoietic progenitor cells, they can be used in connection with any of the foregoing categories of agents to stimulate specifically the proliferation of a particular hematopoietic cell type. The foregoing factors are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and most are commercially available. The invention also lends itself to a variety of in vitro uses. Hematopoietic progenitor cells are preserved or expanded, or their colony forming unit potential increased, in vitro. One benefit that can be obtained according to the invention is the stimulation of hematopoietic progenitor cells by the agents useful according to the invention. Another benefit that can be obtained is the effect that the agent can have on stromal cells used in in vitro culturing of hematopoietic progenitor cells. In vitro culturing of hematopoietic cells is often carried out in the presence of stromal cells. Hematopoietic progenitor cells typically will not survive, proliferate or differentiate for very long periods of time in vitro without appropriate growth factor support. Stromal cell layers are used to supply such growth agents to cultured hematopoietic cells, either by culturing the hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro with such stromal cells or by supplying the hematopoietic progenitor cells with stromal cell-conditioned medium. The agents useful according to the present invention can be used to treat such stromal cells to cause the the stromal cells to manufacture and release growth factors. The incubation of stromal cells with the agents useful according to the invention and in medium is for a period of time sufficient to allow the stromal cells to secrete factors into the medium. The medium then can be used to supplement the culture of hematopoietic progenitor cells and other hematopoietic cells. The culture of hematopoietic cells is with media which is conventional for culturing cells. Examples include RPMI, DM, ISCOVES, etc. The conditions for such culturing also are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The conditions typically refer to a combination of parameters (e.g. temperature, CO 2 and O 2 content, nutritive media, etc.). The time sufficient to increase the number of cells is a time that can be easily determined by a person skilled in the art, and can vary depending on the original number of cells seeded and the amount added of growth factors and agents useful according to the invention. The colony forming potential of hematopoietic uncommitted progenitor cells can be increased by in vitro culturing of hematopoietic cells. The cells can be obtained from any blood product or organ containing cells of hematopoietic origin. Crude or unfractionated blood products can be enriched for cells having hematopoietic progenitor cell characteristics in ways well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, prior to or after culture with the agents useful according to the invention. A particularly important aspect of the invention is in the use of the agents for treatment of neutropenia. A combination of unexpected results makes the invention particularly useful in the treatment of neutropenia. Firstly, the agents according to the invention can stimulate the proliferation of uncommitted progenitor cells. Secondly, the agents according to the invention also stimulate stromal cells to make GCSF, which is the growth factor critical in the differentiation and production of neutrophils per se. Thus, the patient has the dual benefit of stimulation of progenitor cells and differentiation of those cells into neutrophils using the agents useful according to the invention. Similar effects are shown with erythrocytes and platelets. Thus, treatment to restore neutrophils, erythrocytes and platelets form an independent and distinct aspect of the invention, based on the unexpected findings described above. The invention also involves kits for housing an entire medicinal course of treatment for a hematopoietic cell deficiency such as neutropenia. As discussed above, it has been discovered surprisingly that the number of doses per day and the number of doses overall affect favorably the recovery of hematopoietic cells after treatment with a hematopoietic cell inhibitor. These unexpected findings lend themselves to the development of a medicinal dispenser which houses an entire medical course of treatment using the agents useful according to the invention. Patient compliance therefore will be enhanced, and an entire prescription can be contained in a single package. Ordinarily, a pharmacist individually fills a dispenser unit with a medicament once the pharmacist receives a doctors prescription. Because the dispenser of the invention includes an entire medicinal course of treatment and can always include a specific number of solid oral dosage forms, the package can be pre-filled with the appropriate number of units of medicament for treatment for a particular medical purpose. The medicinal dispenser is a package defining a plurality of medicinal storage compartments, each compartment for housing an individual unit of medicament. An entire medicinal course of treatment is housed in a plurality of medicinal storage compartments. A package defining a plurality of medicinal storage compartments may be any type of disposable pharmaceutical package or card which holds medicaments in individual compartments. Preferably the package is a blister package constructed from a card, which may be made from stiff paper material, a blister sheet and backing sheet. Such cards are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. FIG. 1 shows a medicinal dispenser (1) for housing a preferred entire medicinal course of treatment for neutropenia. The day indicia (2) indicate which day the individual units of medicament are to be taken. These are marked along a first side of the medicinal package. The dose indicia (3) is marked along a second side of the medicinal package perpendicular to the first side of the medicinal package and indicates the time which the individual unit of medicament should be taken. The unit doses (4) are contained in the dispenser which is a blister pack. This particular package shows a 5 day course of treatment, with 2 doses per day. The pharmaceutical preparations, as described above, are administered in effective amounts. The effective amount will depend upon the mode of administration, the particular condition being treated and the desired outcome. It will also depend upon, as discussed above, the stage of the condition, the age and physical condition of the subject, the nature of concurrent therapy, if any, and like factors well known to the medical practitioner. For therapeutic applications, it is that amount sufficient to achieve a medically desirable result. In some cases this is any increase in hematopoietic cell count or mature blood cell count. In other cases, it will be an increase to a preselected level. The invention is useful in one aspect to ameliorate the effects of treatment with a hematopoietic cell inhibitor. If the agents are used prophylactically, they can decrease the amount of hematopoietic cells that would be lost in the subject versus the amount lost if the subject were treated with the inhibitor but not with the agent. If used prophylactically or acutely, the agents can shorten the time for recovery of a hematopoietic cell-type to at least protective levels, and preferably to normal levels, versus the length of time which would pass before protective or normal levels were achieved if the subject were treated with the inhibitor but not with the agent. Generally, doses of active compounds of the present invention would be from about 0.01 mg/kg per day to less than 1 mg/kg per day. A variety of administration routes are available. The methods of the invention, generally speaking, may be practiced using any mode of administration that is medically acceptable, meaning any mode that produces effective levels of the active compounds without causing clinically unacceptable adverse effects. Such modes of administration include oral, rectal, topical, nasal, interdermal, or parenteral routes. The term parenteral includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or infusion. Intravenous or intramuscular routes are not particularly suitable for long-term therapy and prophylaxis. They could, however, be preferred in emergency situations. Oral administration is preferred for the convenience to the patient as well as the dosing schedule. See Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, 1990, pp 1694-1712; incorporated by reference). Those of skill in the art can readily determine the various parameters and conditions for producing dosages without resort to undue experimentation. Compositions suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units, such as capsules, tablets, lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of the active agent. Other compositions include suspensions in aqueous liquids or non-aqueous liquids such as a syrup, elixir or an emulsion. Preparations for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringers dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringers or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers (such as those based on Ringers dextrose), and the like. Preservatives and other additives may also be present such as, for example, antimicrobials, anti-oxidants, chelating agents, and inert gases and the like. Lower doses will result from other forms of administration, such as intravenous administration. In the event that a response in a subject is insufficient at the initial doses applied, higher doses (or effectively higher doses by a different, more localized delivery route) may be employed to the extent that patient tolerance permits. Multiple doses per day are contemplated. The agents may be combined, optionally, with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. The term pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier as used herein means one or more compatible solid or liquid filler, diluents or encapsulating substances which are suitable for administration into a human. The term carrier denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate the application. The components of the pharmaceutical compositions also are capable of being co-mingled with the molecules of the present invention, and with each other, in a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially impair the desired pharmaceutical efficacy. When administered, the pharmaceutical preparations of the invention are applied in pharmaceutically-acceptable amounts and in pharmaceutically-acceptably compositions. Such preparations may routinely contain salt, buffering agents, preservatives, compatible carriers, and optionally other therapeutic agents. When used in medicine, the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable, but non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof and are not excluded from the scope of the invention. Such pharmacologically and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, those prepared from the following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic, salicylic, citric, formic, malonic, succinic, and the like. Also, pharmaceutically-acceptable salts can be prepared as alkaline metal or alkaline earth salts, such as sodium, potassium or calcium salts. Other delivery systems can include time-release, delayed release or sustained release delivery systems. Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the agent, increasing convenience to the subject and the physician. Many types of release delivery systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art. They include polymer base systems such as poly(lactide-glycolide), copolyoxalates, polycaprolactones, polyesteramides, polyorthoesters, polyhydroxybutyric acid, and polyanhydrides. Microcapsules of the foregoing polymers containing drugs are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,075,109. Delivery systems also include non-polymer systems that are: lipids including sterols such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters and fatty acids or neutral fats such as mono- di- and tri-glycerides; hydrogel release systems; sylastic systems; peptide based systems; wax coatings; compressed tablets using conventional binders and excipients; partially fused implants; and the like. Specific examples include, but are not limited to: (a) erosional systems in which the agent is contained in a form within a matrix such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,452,775, 4,667,014, 4,748,034 and 5,239,660 and (b) difusional systems in which an active component permeates at a controlled rate from a polymer such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,832,253, and 3,854,480. In addition, pump-based hardware delivery systems can be used, some of which are adapted for implantation. Use of a long-term sustained release implant may be particularly suitable for treatment of chronic conditions. Long-term release, are used herein, means that the implant is constructed and arranged to delivery therapeutic levels of the active ingredient for at least 30 days, and preferably 60 days. Long-term sustained release implants are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art and include some of the release systems described above. EXAMPLES We have demonstrated in a series of in vivo studies that the agent ValboroPro (PT- 100), has the ability to shorten myelosuppression caused by chemotherapy in mice. In these studies, mice were injected intraperitoneally with a sublethal dose of 220 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (Day 1). This treatment reproducibly induced a nadir in blood cell counts by Day 4. After 72 hours (Day 3) mice were divided into 3 groups. One group received PT-100, at the concentrations indicated, by gavage or by subcutaneous administration (s.c.), one group received G-CSF by s.c. injections and the third group received saline as a control, either by oral gavage or by s.c. injections. G-CSF was used at 0.04 g/dose (4 g/kg/day) which is the dose frequently used in published reports studying the G-CSF effects in mice and is also the equivalent dose used in cancer patients. All administrations were performed twice daily (b.i.d.) for 5 consecutive days or as indicated. Blood samples were taken from individual mice on Day 4-8, and in some experiments on Days 13 or 17. At each time pont four or five test animals were sampled. Total and differential white blood cell counts of Gimsa-stained blood smears were performed. PT-100 Dose Response for Regeneration of Neutrophil For data presented in FIG. 2 , cyclophosphamide treated mice received 0.1 g, 2 ,g or 5g/b.i.d. of PT-100 or saline by oral gavage twice daily for 5 consecutive days starting on Day 3 post cyclophosphamide treatment and continuing through Day 7. In mice that received 2 or 5 g/b.i.d. PT- 100 recovery of neutrophils reproducibly preceded recovery of saline treated mice by 1 or 2 days, while 0.1 g/b.i.d. of PT-100 did not significantly enhance neutrophil recovery over saline. Normal levels of absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) were reached on Day 5 for mice receiving 2 g or 5 g/b.i.d. of PT-100, while saline treated mice did not reach normal levels until Day 7. On Day 5 mice had received a total of 4 doses of PT-100 (on Days 3 and 4). Additional administration of PT- 100 on Days 5, 6 and 7 caused a further increase in ANC. The effect of PT-100 on neutrophil recovery when administered by s.c. route was very similar to that seen when administered orally. For data shown in FIG. 3 mice were injected s.c. with doses of PT-100 ranging from 1 to 20 g/b.i.d. for 5 days and blood cell counts determined on Days 4 through 8, and on Day 17. For mice receiving 5 g, 10 g, or 20 g/b.i.d. PT-100, neutrophil recovery was accelerated over that observed in the saline treated mice. A dose of 1 g/b.i.d. PT- 100 did not show much effect. After termination of treatment with PT- 100,I n conclusion, PT-100 accelerates neutrophil regeneration in cyclophosphamide treated mice. Comparison of PT-100 and G-SCF Effects on Neutrophil Regeneration G-CSF is currently used to accelerate neutrophil recovery in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The effects of G-CSF in mice are well established and can be used as a reference for elucidating the mechanism by which PT-100 stimulates hematopoiesis in mice. FIG. 4 shows data from an experiment in which the effects of PT-100 and G-CSF on neutrophil regeneration are compared. Cyclophosphamide treated mice were administered 2 g/b.i.d. of PT-100 by gavage or 0.04 g/b.i.d. of G-CSF (the dose equivalent used in patients and most commonly used in published reports for murine studies) by subcutaneous injections for 5 consecutive days starting on Day 3. Blood cell counts were performed on Days 4-8, and on Day 13. PT-100 and G-CSF treated mice stimulated neutrophil regeneration to a similar level during the treatment period. After treatment was stopped, ANC decreased to normal counts by Day 13. Although PT-100 has a very similar effect on neutrophil reconstitution, the mechanism of action is different from that of G-CSF. Not only does PT-100 target a different cellular receptor (CD 26), it also has been shown to stimulate growth of early human hematopoietic progenitor cells which are not affected by G-CSF. Dose Numbering of PT-100 Administration To determine the dose numbering of administration for optimal recovery of neutrophils, PT-100, at indicated doses, was administered s.c. to cyclophosphamide treated mice, either once or twice per day over a five day period, starting on Day 3 post cyclophosphamide treatment. As shown in FIG. 5 , for both doses, a twice daily administration resulted in a faster rate of neutrophil recovery to higher neutrophil levels than once per day administration. Duration of PT-100 Administration In the experiments described above mice had been treated with PT- 100 for 5 consecutive days. To determine whether a shorter period of treatment with PT-100 was sufficient for the recovery of neutrophils 5 g, 2 g, or 1 g/b.i.d. (six hours apart) of PT-100 was administered to cyclophosphamide treated mice by gavage for 1,2,3, or 5 days starting on Day 3 post cyclophosphamide treatment. Blood counts were obtained on days 4 through 8. Administration of PT-100 for one day was sufficient to cause an accelerated reconstitution of neutrophils over saline treated animals. However, additional administrations of PT-100 for 2 or 3 days increased the rate of recovery even further. Data for the 5 g dose are shown in FIG. 6 . Continued administration of PT-100 for a total of 4 or 5 days does not significantly increase the rate of neutrophil recovery or the ANC over that achieved with 3 day administrations (data for 2 g/b.i.d. are shown in FIG. 7 ). Results shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 indicate that the PT-100 effect on the regeneration of neutrophils occurs early during treatment and continues until ANC between 1000 and 1400 are achieved. Repeated administrations affect the kinetics of neutrophil restoration during the early period but does not significantly alter the ANC reached after 3 days of administration. In conclusion, PT- 100 accelerates neutrophil reconstitution over that seen with saline even after a one day of treatment. An accelerated reconstitution of neutrophils is obtained with each additional day of treatment for up to three days. A fourth or fifth day of treatment did not significantly increase ANC or the kinetics of reconstitution. Human Hematopoietic Cell Responses In Vitro Hematopoiesis is sustained by a pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that can self-renew and differentiate into hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). HPCs are committed to specific lineages which can be identified based on their colony morphology when grown in semi-solid media in vitro, typically over a 2 week period. The colonies grown in the semi-solid colony assay are functionally defined as colony- or burst- forming units and include BFU-E and CFU-E (cells committed to the erythroid lineage), CFU-GM (cells committed to the granulocytic/monocytic lineage), BFU-MK and CFU-MK (cells committed to the megakaryocyte lineage) and CFU-GEMM (multipotent progenitors). Although the semi-solid colony assay is a valuable tool to identify factors, such as G-CSF, which affect terminal differentiation, it does not assess the proliferative potential or self renewing properties of the primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells (PHPCs) (Dexter, T. A. et al., Acta Hemat. 62:299-305 (1979); Chen, B. P. et al., Immunological Reviews: 157:41-51 (1997)). An assay to evaluate the effect of a compound or of growth factors on PHPCs was first described by Dexter (Dexter T. M. et al, J. Cell. Physiol. 91:335-344 (1977)), and combines the Long-Term Culture (LTC) with the semi-solid colony assay. LTC is initiated over a pre-formed stromal cell layer which provides the necessary hematopoietic growth factors. It has been used extensively for the in vitro examination of murine and human hematopoiesis and to evaluate the ability of test compounds to generate LTC-ICs. The effect of PT-100 on growth of human hematopoietic cells was examined in the 2 week CFU and the 4 and 5 week LTC assays using human bone marrow, apheresed peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood cells. PT-100 did not stimulate the generation of CFUs in the 2 week semi-solid assay, indicating that PT-100 does not affect the differentiation of committed progenitor cells into mature blood cells. It also suggests, that the mechanism and the cellular targets for PT-100 for the stimulation of neutrophil regeneration in vivo is different from that of G-CSF which has been shown to stimulate CFU formation in this assay. In the LTC assays, which test for effects on early progenitor cells, PT-100 significantly increased the growth of very early progenitor cells from all three cell sources. Moreover, the data suggest that the effect of PT-100 is on PHPCs as increases in LTC-ICs were observed at 4 weeks ( FIG. 8 ) 5 weeks and 6 weeks (data not shown) in culture. At this time less primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells have undergone terminal differentiation and lost the ability to form colonies in semi-solid cultures. For the LTC assays, CD34 cells were isolated by positive selection from human bone marrow cells, apheresed peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood using a MAC separation system. To establish a stromal feeder layer, human bone marrow cells were cultured in Myelocult long term culture medium for 2 weeks. One day prior to use, the adherent stromal cells were cultured overnight with indicated concentrations of PT-100 in LTC medium and irradiated. Isolated CD34 cells were overlaid onto the stromal cell layer and incubated for 30 days in the absence or presence of indicated amounts of PT-100. Medium and PT-100 was exchanged every three days thereafter. At the end of the culture period the culture was assayed for progenitor cells by plating in semi-solid medium (methylcellulose) supplemented with growth factors (Stem Cell Factor, GM-CSF, IL-3 and Erythropoietin). The total number of myeloid, erytliroid, blast forming and multilineage clonogeneic progenitors (colonies CFU-GM, CFU-E, BFU-E and CFU-GEMM, respectively) were determined after 14 days in methylcellulose culture. Data showing in FIG. 8 for a human bone marrow culture indicate that during a 4 week LTC assay, PT-100 increased, in a dose dependent manner, the number of clonogeneic progenitors which are able to form colonies in semi-solid medium. This suggests that PT-100 stimulates growth of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells. In similar fashion CD34 cells purified from apheresed peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood were cultured on irradiated primary stromal cells for 30 days. As had been observed with bone marrow cells, PT-100 increased the number of 4 and 5 week LTC-ICs from peripheral and umbilical cord blood to very similar levels, indicating the PT-100 is able to stimulate primitive hematopoietic progenitor cell growth from these cell sources as well (data not shown). PT-100 Does Not Stimulate Differentiation of Committed Progenitor Cells Human bone marrow cells were enriched for CD34 cells and 200 CD34 cells per well were incubated in serum free x-vivo 15 medium (Biowhittaker) with or without the indicated concentrations of PT-100 for 4 hours at 37 C. The pre-incubated CD34 cells were added to 0.9% methylcellulose in Iscoves MDM containing sub-optimal concentrations of recombinant human growth factors (5 ng/ml Stem Cell Factor, 1 ng/ml GM-CSF, 1 ng/ml IL-3, 0.3 units/ml Erythropoietin (Stem Cell Technologies Vancouver, BC). PT-100 was added to the medium at the same concentrations used for the pre-incubation. The methylcellulose mixture was plated in duplicate in 35 mm dishes and incubated for 14 days at 37 C. Progenitor colonies (CFU-E, CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM and BFU-E) were counted under an inverted microscope. PT-100 did not stimulate differentiation of these committed progenitor cells. Stimulation of Hematopoiesis in the Spleen of Normal Mice 6-8 week old female BALB/c mice were administered either saline or PT-100 twice daily for 5 days at the indicated doses via either subcutaneous injection or oral gavage. On the sixth day the animals were sacrificed and their spleens were excised using sterile procedures. The spleens were disrupted to produce single cell suspensions which were subsequently treated with a solution of Tris ammonium chloride (pH 7.2) to lyse erythrocytes. The resulting splenocyte populations were in a hemocytometer and resuspended at 510 6 cells/mL in Iscoves Modified Eagles medium (IMDM) supplemented with 2% heat inactivated fetal calf serum. 0.3 mL of each splenocyte solution was added to 3 mL of MethocultGF M3434 (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada), a methylcellulose medium containing recombinant cytokines used for colony assays of murine progenitor cells. The medium was vigorously mixed and then 1.1 mL of the mixture was placed in duplicate onto sterile 35 mm diameter culture dishes, resulting in 510 5 splenocytes/plate. The plated cells were incubated at 37 C. under humidified conditions in 95% air/5% CO 2 for 7 days. CFU-E were enumerated as per the manufacturers specifications after 2 days, while BFU-E, CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM were enumerated after 7 days. For each mouse, the absolute CFU/spleen were calculated using the total splenocyte count determined in the hemocytometer. The data shown in FIG. 9 represents the meanSD CFU/spleen from 3 mice in each dosing group. PT-100 stimuated hematopoiesis for all progenitor colony types tested. PT-100 Induces Production of G-CSF From Human Bone Marrow Stromal Cells Mononuclear cells were purified from bone marrow and cultured long-term culture medium, (Stem Cell Technologies, Inc., Vancouver, B.C.) for 2 weeks, with a single feeding of fresh medium after 1 week. The established stromal cells were removed by trypsin-EDTA digest and seeded into a 35 mm tissue culture plate at 10 6 cells per well in 1 ml of medium containing 10 5 M PT-100 or medium alone as control. Culture media were collected on day 1. Supernatants were assayed for human G-CSF using a Quantikine high sensitivity immuno-assay kit (RD Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.). FIG. 10 depicts the effect of PT-100 on the production of G-CSF by cultured human stomal cells. PT-100 stimulates production of G-CSF by such cells.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The preparation of the compounds of the present invention is illustrated in the following Schemes. Unless otherwise indicated, in the following Schemes R 1 through R 20 and X 1 through X 5 are as defined above. This invention uses a variety of macrolide templates as starting materials. They include azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, sporeamicin A, erythromycylamine as well as their analogs. Azithromycin can be prepared according to methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,474,768 and 4,517,359, referred to above. Erythromycin can be prepared, or isolated, according to methods described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,653,899 and 2,823,203. Clarithromycin can be prepared according to methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,331,803. The sporeamicin A template is the compound of formula 1 wherein R 1 is oxo, OH, or NR 9 R 10 , R 2 is O and X 1 is CH(O), and R 2 and X 1 are taken together as follows: The sporeamicin A template may be prepared according to methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,709 and Freiberg et al., Bioorganic Medicinal Letters, vol. 5, pages 1307-1310 (1995). The macrolide template designated M-8 in Table 2 below can be prepared according to methods described in Journal of Organic Chemistry 53, 2340 (1988). The macrolide template designated M-10 in Table 2 below can be prepared according to methods described in PCT international application publication number WO 92/09614 (published Jun. 11, 1992). The macrolide template designated M-11 in Table 2 below can be prepared according to methods described in Japanese patent application publication number 6-247996. The macrolide template designated M-14 in Table 2 below can be prepared according to methods described in Antimicrobial Agents Chemotherapy 35(6), 1116 (1991). All these starting materials require proper functional group protection before various modifications can take place, and deprotection after desired modifications are complete. The most commonly used protecting groups for amino moieties in the macrolide compounds of this invention are benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) groups. Hydroxyl groups are generally protected as acetates or Cbz carbonates. The relative reactivity of various hydroxyl groups in the macrolide molecules of the general type claimed in this invention has been well established. Such differences in reactivity permit selective modification of different parts of the compounds of this invention. To protect amino moieties, in particular the C-9 amino moiety of erythromycylamine, the macrolide is treated with t-butyl dicarbonate in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF), or benzyloxycarbonyl N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Cbz-OSu), to protect the C-9 amino group as its t-butyl or benzyl carbamate. Yields for this step are generally near quantitative. The Boc group is normally removed either by acid treatment or by following a two step procedure as follows: (1) treatment with an excess amount (10 equivalents) of trimethylsilyl triflate in dichloromethane in the presence of 2,6-lutidine, and (2) desilylation with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride in THF. The Cbz groups can be removed by conventional catalytic hydrogenation. The C-2 hydroxyl group is a reactive hydroxyl group among the numerous hydroxyl groups present in macrolide compounds of the type claimed herein. The C-2 hydroxyl group is selectively protected by treating the compound with one equivalent of acetic anhydride in dichloromethane in the absence of external base. This process selectively converts the C-2 hydroxyl group into the corresponding acetate. The hydroxyl protecting group can be removed by treating the compound with methanol at a temperature ranging from about 0 C. to 40 C. to about 65 C. for 10 to 48 hours. Alternatively, where the starting material for the preparation of the compounds of this invention is erythromycylamine, N 9a -desmethyl azithromycin or a macrolide corresponding to M-11 in Table 2 below (wherein Y 1 is H and a hydroxy group is attached at the C-4 carbon), these compounds can be treated with an excess of benzylchloroformate in THF/water at a pH of about 9 to provide N-9,2-bis-Cbz protected erythromycylamine, N 9a -desmethyl azithromycin or M-11 macrolide (wherein a hydroxy group is attached at the C-4 carbon), in high yields. In this process, the amino group and the C-2 hydroxyl group can be protected in one step. The C-2 protected macrolide derivatives will undergo selective acylation reactions at the C-4 position, which is a means of introducing a variety of R 4 groups (wherein R 4 is as defined above). Other hydroxyl groups, such as those at the C-6, C-11 and C-12 positions, can generally be left unprotected. Acylation of the C-4 hydroxyl group offers a direct avenue to esters, carbonates and carbamates at the C-4 position. The C-4 hydroxyl group can be selectively acylated to provide the corresponding esters using a variety of reagents, including carboxylic acids and a coupling agent such as 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), carboxylic anhydrides, mixed anhydrides, chloroformates and acid chlorides. Acylation of the C-4 hydroxyl group is illustrated in Scheme 1 (wherein R 4 is as defined above) which illustrates the general reaction leading to the compounds of the present invention. The C-2 protected starting material in Scheme 1 (the compound of formula 5) (Ac is acetyl) is a useful starting material for the introduction of a variety of C-4 groups as described below. With reference to step 1 of Scheme 2, acylation of the C-4 hydroxyl of the compound of formula 5 can be effected by treating the starting compound with about 1.0 equivalent of a compound of the formula (X(CH 2 ) n C(O)) 2 O (wherein X is chloro, bromo, or iodo, preferably chloro, and n is 1 to 6) in a solvent such as dichloromethane in the presence of pyridine at about 0 C. to provide the corresponding compound of formula 7 (wherein X is chloro, bromo or iodo and n is 1 to 6) in moderate yield. Displacement of the halo group with sodium azide in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at about 0 C. to 80 C. for 3 to 12 hours converts X to N 3 . Reduction of the azide, such as by catalytic hydrogenation, produces the corresponding amino ester (X is NH 2 ). The resulting primary amine can be converted into an alkylated secondary or tertiary amine, as shown in step 3 of Scheme 2, through reductive alkylation. Reductive alkylation of the C-4 primary amine of the compound of formula 7 (X is NH 2 ) with an aldehyde compound, such as a compound of the formula R 8 C(O)R 15 , wherein R 15 is H and R 8 is an alkyl group or substituted alkyl moiety, can be controlled to give either mono- or bis-alkylations, but alkylation with ketones generally yields only mono-alkylated products. For the preparation of symmetric bis-alkylamines, it is preferred to use an excess amount of an aldehyde and sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride in an inert solvent, such as dichloroethane or acetonitrile. The preferred method of controlling alkylation with an aldehyde to give a mono-alkylamine is through a two step sequence: (1) imine formation by reaction with an aldehyde in ethanol or acetonitrile and (2) reduction with sodium borohydride in methanol at about 0 C. Since the excess amount of aldehyde is reduced by sodium borohydride rapidly in methanol, the mono-alkylation is assured. This route is preferred for the synthesis of non-symmetric bis-alkylated products. Reacting the compound of formula 7 with a ketone in ethanol, followed by reduction with sodium borohydride in methanol, provides the mono-alkylated compound of formula 9 wherein R 15 is H and R 8 is an alkyl group or an analogous group. This compound can be further modified through reaction with an aldehyde as described above to provide the compound of the fomula 9 wherein R 15 and R 8 are alkyl groups or analogous groups. Primary amines on the C-4 substituent readily undergo acylation reactions under mild conditions. A variety of reagents can effect this transformation, including carboxylic acid anhydride, acid chloride, and carboxylic acid-DCC-DMAP combination (DMAP is 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine). These acylation reactions are selective for the primary amine. In general, acylation of the macrolide hydroxyl groups does not occur as long as the acylation reaction is carried out at an appropriate temperature and only one equivalent of acylating reagent is used. When the carboxylic acid-DCC-DMAP combination is employed, the acylation is completely specific for the amine. This method of acylation is therefore preferred. Thus, with reference to step 2 of Scheme 2, the compound of formula 7 may be treated with a carboxylic acid, such as a compound of the formula RC(O)OH (wherein R is C 1 -C 10 alkyl, (CH 2 ) q CR 11 R 12 (CH 2 ) r NR 13 R 14 wherein q and r are each independently an integer ranging from 0 to 4 except that q and r are not both be 0, (CH 2 ) t (C 6 -C 10 aryl), (CH 2 ) t (4-10 membered heterocyclic), or one of the foregoing groups that is substituted), in the presence of a coupling agent such as DCC to provide the compound of formula 8. Alternatively, ester formation, as described above with reference to Scheme 2, can be effected using an activated carboxylic acid, such as a RCOOH/DCC/DMAP combination. For example, with reference to step 1 of Scheme 2, the compound of formula 5 can be acylated at the C-4 position in good yields with 4-benzyloxycarbonylaminobutyric acid, DCC and DMAP at about 0 C. to 40 C. for a long period, such as several days, to provide the ester of formula 7 wherein n is 0 to 6 and X is NHCbz. Removal of Cbz group by heterogeneous hydrogenolysis provides the compound of formula 7 wherein X is NH 2 . Conventional methods of effecting such hydrogenolysis are described in J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, (4th edition, 1992, J. Wiley Sons), pages 771-780. Further modification of the primary amine according to methods described above provides substituted amine analogs of formulas 8 and 9, wherein R 8 and R 15 are as defined above. Scheme 3 illustrates the preparation of compounds of the present invention that are C-4 carbamates. A variety of synthetic methods can be used to produce compounds of the present invention that are C-4 carbamates, including (1) reaction of a C-2 protected starting macrolide with an isocyanate and (2) reaction of a C-2 protected starting macrolide with N,N-carbonyldiimidazole to form the acylimidazole intermediate which upon treatment with an amine leads to carbamate derivatives. With reference to step 1 of Scheme 3, the compound of formula 5 can be treated with an isocyanate of the formula R 8 NCO (wherein R 8 is as defined above) in dichloromethane in the presence of DMAP at about 0 C. for about 2 hours to provide the compound of formula 11 wherein R 15 is hydrogen. With reference to step 2 of Scheme 3, the C-4 acylimidazole derivative of formula 10 can be prepared by reacting the compound of formula 5 in toluene with N,N-carbonyldiimidazole in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate at about 0 C. to 40 C. for about 24 hours. The C-4 acylimidazole of the formula 10 can be reacted with an amine of the formula R 8 R 15 NH (wherein R 8 and R 15 are as defined above) in a solvent such as an acetonitrile-THF mixture at about 0 C. to 40 C. to provide the compound of the formula 11. Where, in the compound of formula 11, R 8 and R 15 are both H, this primary amine is a versatile moiety that is readily modified as described above. Guanidino moieties can be introduced at a primary amine on the C-4 substituent as illustrated in Scheme 4. In Scheme 4, the compound of formula 11, wherein R 15 is H and R 8 is (CH 2 ) q CR 11 R 12 (CH 2 ) r NH 2 , may be treated with a thiourea, such as a compound of the formula R 6 R 9 NC(S)NR 10 R 7 (wherein R 9 , R 10 , R 6 and R 7 are as defined above) in a solvent such as DMF in the presence of mercuric chloride at ambient temperature (20-25 C.). In this reaction, condensation takes place and the corresponding guanidine derivative of the formula 12 is formed. In addition, a substituted or unsubstituted thiazolyl group can be introduced at the C-4 primary amine by reacting the compound of the formula 11, wherein R 15 is H and R 8 is (CH 2 ) q CR 11 R 12 (CH 2 ) r NH 2 , according to the following sequence: (1) reacting said compound with N,N-thiocarbonyldiimidazole followed by treatment with NH 3 (l) to give the corresponding thiourea, and (2) treating the thiourea with an -halo ketone in ethanol at about 60 C.

Preparation 30 N-(2-Aminoethyl)-7,8-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline To a solution of 7,8dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (421 mg, 2.2 mmol), 2-phthalimidoacetaldehyde (410 mg, 2.2 mmol) and NaOAc (180 mg, 2.2 mmol) in 27 mL of CH 2 Cl 2 was added 690 mg (3.25 mmol) of NaBH(OAc) 3 in small portions. After stirring 1 hour at room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted with CH 2 Cl 2 and washed with a saturated Na 2 CO 3 solution and brine. The residue obtained after evaporation of CH 2 Cl 2 was dissolved in 25 mL of EtOH and treated with 1.2 mL of hydrazine hydrate overnight. The reaction mixture was then filtered and evaporated to give 510 mg (100%) of the title compound; MS m/e 327 (M1). A solution of N 9 -Cbz-2-acetyl-4-imidazolcarbonylerythromycylamine (the compound of formula 13) (300 mg., 0.31 mmol) and N-(2-aminoethyl)-7,8-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (109 mg, 0.46 mmol) in 5 mL of DMSO containing 47 mg of K 2 CO 3 was warmed to 60 C. for 6 hours then stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc and washed with brine. Drying over MgSO 4 and removal of the solvent gave a slightly yellow solid. This was dissolved in 4 mL of CH 2 Cl 2 and treated with lutidine (0.43 mL, 3.7 mmol) and TMSOTf (0.48 mL, 2.5 mmol) at 0 C. for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was washed with a dilute NaCl solution and dried over MgSO 4 . The residue obtained was then dissolved in 4 mL of THF and treated with 3.1 mL of 1M solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in THF, initially at 0 C. and at room temperature for 24 hours. THF was removed and the residue was dissolved in CH 2 Cl 2 and water. The aqueous layer was acidified to pH 2 and extracted. The aqueous layer was then basified to pH 9 and extracted with CH 2 Cl 2 . This CH 2 Cl 2 layer was washed with brine and dried over MgSO 4 . The residue obtained was dissolved in 4 mL of MeOH and refluxed overnight. A SiO 2 chromatography (4% MeOHCH 2 Cl 2 -0.4% NH 4 OH) of the residue gave 96 mg (31%) of the compound of formula 14; MS m/e 1039 (M1). Preparation 32 N-(N-Boc-Glycyl)-4-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline To a solution of 4-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (5.88 g, 36 mmol) in 100 mL of CH 2 Cl 2 were added Boc-glycine (12.6 g, 72 mmol), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (8.80 g, 72 mmol), and dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (14.9 g, 72 mmol). After stirring overnight, the resulting precipitate was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated. A SiO 2 chromatography (EtOAc:hexane1:1) of the residue gave 4.9 g (43%) of the title compound. Preparation 33 N-(2-Aminoethyl)-4-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline A solution of N-(N-Boc-glycyl)-4-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (4.97 g, 16 mmol) in 30 mL of 3 N HCl and 30 mL of EtOAc was heated to reflux for 0.5 hour. The resulting solution was basified to pH 9 and extracted with EtOAc. The aqueous layer was then extracted with 10% iPrOHCH 2 Cl 2 . Drying over MgSO 4 of the iPrOHCH 2 Cl 2 solution and removal of the solvent gave 2.83 g (89%) of N-glycyl-4-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline. A solution of N-glycyl-4-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline in 25 mL of THF was cooled in an ice bath and 10 M solution of borane-methyl sulfide complex in THF (3.85 mL) was added dropwise. The resulting mixture was warmed to 55 C. and then to reflux for 4 hours. Excess borane was destroyed by addition of 6N HCl. The resulting mixture was heated to 100 C. for 1 hour. The resulting solution was first extracted with EtOAc and then with 10% iPrOHCH 2 Cl 2 . The iPrOHCH 2 Cl 2 extract gave 880 mg (28%) of the title compound. A solution of 2-acetyl-4-imidazolecarbonylclarithromycin-11,12-cyclic carbamate (the compound of formula 15) (200 mg, 0.22 mmol) and N-(2-aminoethyl)-4-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (91 mg, 0.44 mmol) in 2 mL of THF was refluxed for two days. A SiO 2 chromatography (3% MeOHCH 2 Cl 2 -0.5% NH 4 OH) of the residue gave 163 mg of a colorless solid. This material was refluxed overnight in 4 mL of MeOH to give 149 mg (69%) of the compound of formula 16; MS m/e 1005 (M1). Preparation 35 Following the procedure of Preparation 34 and starting with N-(2-aminoethyl)-7,8-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, the compound of formula 16 was obtained with 7,8-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-isoquinoline in place of 4-methoxy-1,2,3,4-isoquinoline, in 81% yield; MS m/e 1035 (M1).

Following the procedure of Preparation 34 and starting with N-(2-aminoethyl)-4-amino-6-fluorochroman and the compound of formula 15, the above compound of formula 19 was obtained in 34% yield; MS m/e 1009 (M1). The compounds of the present invention may have asymmetric carbon atoms. Such diasteromeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. All such isomers, including diastereomer mixtures, are considered as part of the invention. The compounds of the present invention that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate the compound of the present invention from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained. The desired acid salt can also be precipitated from a solution of the free base in an organic solvent by adding to the solution an appropriate mineral or organic acid. Those compounds of the present invention that are acidic in nature, are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. These salts are all prepared by conventional techniques. The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of this invention are those which form non-toxic base salts with the acidic compounds of the present invention. Such non-toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium calcium and magnesium, etc. These salts can easily be prepared by treating the corresponding acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired pharmacologically acceptable cations, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum yields of the desired final product. The antibacterial and antiprotozoal activity of the compounds of the present invention against bacterial and protozoal pathogens is demonstrated by the compounds ability to inhibit growth of defined strains of human (Assay I) or animal (Assays II and III) pathogens. Assay I Assay I, described below, employs conventional methodology and interpretation criteria and is designed to provide direction for chemical modifications that may lead to compounds that circumvent defined mechanisms of macrolide resistance. In Assay I, a panel of bacterial strains is assembled to include a variety of target pathogenic species, including representatives of macrolide resistance mechanisms that have been characterized. Use of this panel enables the chemical structure/activity relationship to be determined with respect to potency, spectrum of activity, and structural elements or modifications that may be necessary to obviate resistance mechanisms. Bacterial pathogens that comprise the screening panel are shown in the table below. In many cases, both the macrolide-susceptible parent strain and the macrolide-resistant strain derived from it are available to provide a more accurate assessment of the compounds ability to circumvent the resistance mechanism. Strains that contain the gene with the designation of ermA/ermB/ermC are resistant to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B antibiotics due to modifications (methylation) of 23S rRNA molecules by an Erm methylase, thereby generally prevent the binding of all three structural classes. Two types of macrolide efflux have been described; msrA encodes a component of an efflux system in staphylococci that prevents the entry of macrolides and streptogramins while mefA/E encodes a transmembrane protein that appears to efflux only macrolides. Inactivation of macrolide antibiotics can occur and can be mediated by either a phosphorylation of the 2-hydroxyl (mph) or by cleavage of the macrocyclic lactone (esterase). The strains may be characterized using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology and/or by sequencing the resistance determinant. The use of PCR technology in this application is described in J. Sutcliffe et al., Detection Of Erythromycin-Resistant Determinants By PCR, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 40(11), 2562-2566 (1996). The assay is performed in microtiter trays and interpreted according to Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Disk Susceptibility TestsSixth Edition; Approved Standard, published by The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines; the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is used to compare strains. Compounds are initially dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as stock solutions.

Assay II This assay is based on the liquid dilution method in microliter format. A single colony of P. multocida (strain 59A067) is inoculated into 5 ml of brain heart infusion (BHI) broth. The test compounds are prepared by solubilizing 1 mg of the compound in 125 l of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Dilutions of the test compound are prepared using uninoculated BHI broth. The concentrations of the test compound used range from 200 g/ml to 0.098 g/ml by two-fold serial dilutions. The P. multocida inoculated BHI is diluted with uninoculated BHI broth to make a 10 4 cell suspension per 200 l. The BHI cell suspensions are mixed with respective serial dilutions of the test compound, and incubated at 37 C. for 18 hours. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is equal to the concentration of the compound exhibiting 100% inhibition of growth of P. multocida as determined by comparison with an uninoculated control. Assay III This assay is based on the agar dilution method using a Steers Replicator. Two to five colonies isolated from an agar plate are inoculated into BHI broth and incubated overnight at 37 C. with shaking (200 rpm). The next morning, 300 l of the fully grown P. haemolytica preculture is inoculated into 3 ml of fresh BHI broth and is incubated at 37 C. with shaking (200 rpm). The appropriate amounts of the test compounds are dissolved in ethanol and a series of two-fold serial dilutions are prepared. Two ml of the respective serial dilution is mixed with 18 ml of molten BHI agar and solidified. When the inoculated P. haemolytica culture reaches 0.5 McFarland standard density, about 5 l of the P. haemolytica culture is inoculated onto BHI agar plates containing the various concentrations of the test compound using a Steers Replicator and incubated for 18 hours at 37 C. Initial concentrations of the test compound range from 100-200 g/ml. The MIC is equal to the concentration of the test compound exhibiting 100% inhibition of growth of P. haemolytica as determined by comparison with an uninoculated control. The in vivo activity of the compounds of the present invention can be determined by conventional animal protection studies well known to those skilled in the art, usually carried out in rodents. According to one in vivo model, mice are allotted to cages upon their arrival, and allowed to acclimate before being used. Animals are inoculated with a bacterial suspension ( P. multocida strain 59A006) intraperitoneally. Each experiment has at least 3 non-medicated control groups including one infected with 0.1 challenge dose and two infected with 1 challenge dose; a 10 challenge data group may also be used. Generally, all mice in a given study can be challenged within 30-90 minutes, especially if a repeating syringe (such as a Cornwall syringe) is used to administer the challenge. Thirty minutes after challenging has begun, the first compound treatment is given. The compounds of the present invention, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof (hereinafter the active compounds), may be adminstered through oral, parenteral, topical, or rectal routes in the treatment of bacterial and protozoal infections. In general, these compounds are most desirably administered in dosages ranging from about 0.2 mg per kg body weight per day (mg/kg/day) to about 200 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses (i.e., from 1 to 4 doses per day), although variations will necessarily occur depending upon the species, weight and condition of the subject being treated and the particular route of administration chosen. However, a dosage level that is in the range of about 4 mg/kg/day to about 50 mg/kg/day is most desirably employed. Variations may nevertheless occur depending upon the species of mammal, fish or bird being treated and its individual response to said medicament, as well as on the type of pharmaceutical formulation chosen and the time period and interval at which such administration is carried out. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effects, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day. In the treatment of cancer, in particular non-small cell lung cancer, the active compounds may be administered as described in European patent application publication number 758,549, published Feb. 2, 1997. The active compounds may be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents by the routes previously indicated, and such administration may be carried out in single or multiple doses. More particularly, the active compounds may be administered in a wide variety of different dosage forms, i.e., they may be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, hard candies, powders, sprays, creams, salves, suppositories, jellies, gels, pastes, lotions, ointments, aqueous suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs, syrups, and the like. Such carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various non-toxic organic solvents, etc. Moreover, oral pharmaceutical compositions can be suitably sweetened and/or flavored. In general, the active compounds are present in such dosage forms at concentration levels ranging from about 5.0% to about 70% by weight. For oral administration, tablets containing various excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and glycine may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch (and preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch), alginic acid and certain complex silicates, together with granulation binders like polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral adinistration, the active compound may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes, and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents as well, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof. For parenteral administration, solutions of an active compound in either sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol may be employed. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably pH greater than 8) if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic. These aqueous solutions are suitable for intravenous injection purposes. The oily solutions are suitable for intraarticular, intramuscular and subcutaneous injection purposes. The preparation of all these solutions under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques will known to those skilled in the art. Additionally, it is also possible to administer the active compounds of the present invention topically and this may be done by way of creams, jellies, gels, pastes, patches, ointments and the like, in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice. For administration to animals other than humans, such as cattle or domestic animals, the active compounds may be administered in the feed of the animals or orally as a drench composition. The active compounds may also be adminstered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines. The active compounds may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide phenyl, polyhydroxyethylaspartamide-phenol, or polyethyleneoxide-polylysine substituted with palmitoylresidues. Furthermore, the active compounds may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, copolymers of polylactic and polyglycolic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.

bearing acidic moieties and their use as herbicides", "abstract": "A compound Wherein x, y, and z are integers from 0 to 3; and the (poly)ethereal amine is at least one selected from compounds of formula II 1 through II 5 : BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Some herbicides bearing acidic moieties are known to be highly effective and commercially important herbicides useful for combating the presence of a wide variety of unwanted vegetation, including agricultural weeds. Since usually, such acidic herbicides have low solubility in water, they are applied as their derivatives such as metal salts or ammonium salts to enhance the solubility, or esters or amides to enhance movement into plant. For example, N-phosphonomethyl-glycine is formulated in commercial compositions in the form of a water-soluble salt. Herbicidal amine salts of N-phosphonomethylglycine are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,799,758, 3,853,530, 4,140,513, 4,315,765, 4,405,531, 4,481,026, and 4,507,250. These salts are claimed to have uses as plant regulators, herbicides and defoliants. Many of these salts have the counter-cation to N-phosphonomethylglycine anion bearing relatively low molecular weight. Typical of such salts are alkali metal, for example sodium and potassium salts; ammonium salt; and numerous salts having an ammonium, sulfonium or sulfoxonium cation with 1-3 organic groups containing in total 1-6 carbon atoms, for example 2-propylammonium (isopropylammonium), ethanolammonium, ethylenediammonium, trimethylsulfonium or trimethylsulfoxonium. Recent Patent WO 99/05914 reveals the herbicidal compositions promoting herbicidal effectiveness of exogeneous chemical substances. The compositions are the amphiphilic salts having anions of the parent exogeneous chemical substances and cations derived by protonation of one or more polyamine(s) or polyamine derivative(s) each having (a) at least two nitrogen-containing groups, of which a number n not less than 1 are amino groups that can be protonated to form cationic primary, secondary, or tertiary ammonium groups, and (b) at least one hydrocarbyl or acyl group having about 6 to 30 carbon atoms. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A preferred group of the acidic herbicide consists of those that are normally applied post-emergence to foliage of plants. An especially preferred group of foliar-applied herbicide consists of those that are systemic in plants, that is, translocated to some extent from their point of entry in the foliage to other parts of the plant where they can usefully exert their herbicidal effect. This invention relates to the enhancement of the activity of acidic herbicides by the formation of salts using (poly)ethereal amine compounds and also to a method of controlling undesirable vegetation by applying a herbicidally effective amount of the (poly)ethereal amine salts to such vegetation when the latter is in a post-emergent state. These (poly)ethereal ammonium salts are thought to aid the penetration and transport of acidic herbicides into and throughout the plant. These salts contain anions derived from parent herbicides and amphiphilic (poly)ethereal ammonium cation(s). These features are proved to enhance the activity of acidic herbicides. The term herbicidally effective amount designates any amount of the compounds disclosed herein, which will kill a plant or any portion thereof. By plants is meant germinating seeds, emerging seedlings, and established vegetation, including roots and above ground-portions. By the term post-emergent as used herein, is meant the application of the herbicide compound to weed pests, after these pests have emerged from the ground. The present invention provides a (poly)ethereal ammonium salt of acidic herbicides of the following formula I: Wherein x, y, and z are integers from 0 to 3 with the proviso that 0xyz3.

After, if necessary, heating for between 0.5 and 2 hours the solution is cooled. Either thus obtained aqueous solution itself or solid salt obtained after evaporation of water to dryness in the presence of an anti foaming agent can be used for the activity tests. Preparation Examples for the compounds of the present invention will be described. All temperatures are measured in C. SYNTHESIS EXAMPLE Example 1 Synthesis of N-(Phosphonomethyl)glycine. 2-(3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridyloxy)-ethyl diethyl amine salt: Compound 6-24 Step-1. Synthesis of the intermediate, 2-(3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridyloxy)-ethyl diethyl amine: Compound 1-36 To the mixture of sodium hydride(528 mg, 22 mmol) in 25 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran was added N,N-diethyl-ethanol amine(2.344 g, 20 mmol) at the room temperature. After generation of hydrogen ceased, 2,3-dichloro-5-trifluoromethyl-pyridine (4.32 g, 20 mmol) was added at the room temperature. After exothermic reaction ceased, the mixture was further stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. Then the content was poured into water and extracted with ethyl acetate. Ethyl acetate layer was washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The evaporation of the solvent gave 5.76 g of oil.

The herbicide can be used for a wide range of applications, for example on crop lands such as paddy fields, upland farms, orchards and mulberry fields, and non-crop lands such as forests, farm roads, playgrounds, and factory sites. The application method may be one suitably selected for foliar application. The compounds of the present invention are capable of controlling noxious weeds including grass (gramineae) such as barnyardgrass ( Echinochloa crus - galli ), large crabgrass ( Digitaria sanguinalis ), green foxtail ( Setaria viridis ), giant foxtail ( Setaria faberi ), goosegrass ( Eleusine indica L.), wild oat ( Avena fatua L.), Johnsongrass ( Sorghum halepense ), quackgrass ( Agropyron repens ), alexandergrass ( Brachiaria plantaginea ), paragrass ( Panicum purpurascen ), sprangletop ( Leptochloa chinensis ) and red sprangletop ( Leptochloa panicea ); sedges (or Cyperaceae) such as rice flatsedge ( Cyperus iria L.), purple nutsedge ( Cyperus rotundus L.), Japanese bulrush ( Scirpus Juncoides ), flatsedge ( Cyperus serotinus ), small-flower umbrellaplant ( Cyperus difformis ), slender spikerush ( Eleocharis acicularis ), and water chestnut ( Eleocharis kuroguwai ); alismataceae such as Japanese ribbon wapato ( Sagittaria pygmaea ), arrow-head ( Sagittaria trifolia ) and narrowleaf waterplantain ( Alisma canaliculatum ); pontederiaceae such as monochoria ( Monochoria vaginalis ) and monochoria species ( Monochoria korsakowii ); scrophulariaceae such as false pimpernel ( Lindernia pyxidaria ) and abunome ( Dopatrium Junceum ); lythraceae such as toothcup ( Rotala indica ) and red stem ( Ammannia multiflora ); and broadleaves such as redroot pigweed ( Amaranthus retroflexus ), velvetleaf ( Abutilon theophrasti ), morningglory ( Ipomoea hederacea ), lambsquarters ( Chenopodium album ), prickly sida ( Sida spinosa L.), common purslane ( Portulaca oleracea L.), common ragweed ( Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. ), slender amaranth ( Amaranthus viridis L.), sicklepod ( Cassia obtusifolia ), black nightshade ( Solanum nigrum L.), pale smartweed ( Polygonum lapathifolium L.), common chickweed ( Stellaria media L.), common cocklebur ( Xanthium strumarium L.), flexuous bittercress ( Cardamine flexuosa WITH.), henbit ( Lamium amplexicaule L.) and threeseeded copperleaf ( Acalypha australis L.). Accordingly, it is useful for controlling noxious weeds non-selectively or selectively in the cultivation of a crop plant such as corn ( Zea mays L.), soybean ( Glycine max Merr.), cotton ( Gossypium spp.), wheat ( Triticum spp.), rice ( Oryza sativa L.), barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.), oat ( Avena sativa L.), sorgo ( Sorghum bicolor Moench), rape ( Brassica napus L.), sunflower ( Helianthus annuus L.), sugar beet ( Beta vulgaris L.), sugar cane ( Saccharum officinarum L.), Japanese lawngrass ( Zoysia Japonica stend), peanut ( Arachis hypogaea L.) or flax ( Linum usitatissimum L.). For use as herbicides, the active ingredients of this invention are formulated into herbicidal compositions by mixing herbicidally active amounts with inert ingredients known to the art to facilitate either the suspension, dissolution or emulsification of the active ingredient for the desired use. The type of formulation prepared recognizes the facts that formulation, crop and use pattern all can influence the activity and utility of the active ingredient in a particular use. Thus for agricultural use the present herbicidal compounds may be formulated as water dispersible granules, granules for direct application to soils, water soluble concentrates, wettable powders, dusts, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates (EC), microemulsion, suspoemulsion, invert emulsion or other types of formulations, depending on the desired weed targets, crops and application methods. These herbicidal formulations may be applied to the target area (where suppression of unwanted vegetation is the objective) as water or solvent diluted sprays. These formulation may contain as little as 0.1% to as much as 97% active ingredient by weight. Wettable powders are composed of finely ground particles which disperse rapidly in water or other spray carriers. Typical carriers include kaolin clays, Fullers earth, silicas and other absorbent, wettable inorganic materials. Wettable powders can be prepared to contain from 1 to 90% active ingredient, depending on the desired use pattern and the absorbability of the carrier. Wettable powders typically contain wetting or dispersing agents to assist dispersion in water or other carriers. Water dispersible granules are granulated solids that freely disperse when mixed in water. This formulation typically consists of the active ingredient (0.1% to 95% active ingredient), a wetting agent (1-15% by weight), a dispersing agent (1 to 15% by weight) and an inert carrier (1-95% by weight). Water dispersible granules can be formed by mixing the ingredients intimately then adding a small amount of water on a rotating disc (said mechanism is commercially available) and collecting the agglomerated granules. Alternatively, the mixture of ingredients may be mixed with an optimal amount of liquid (water or other liquid) and passed through an extruder (said mechanism is commercially available) equipped with passages which allow for the formation of small extruded granules. Alternatively, the mixture of ingredients can be granulated using a high speed mixer (said mechanism is commercially available) by adding a small amount of liquid and mixing at high speeds to affect agglomeration. Alternatively, the mixture of ingredients can be dispersed in water and dried by spraying the dispersion through a heated nozzle in a process known as spray drying (spray drying equipment is conmercially available). After granulation the moisture content of granules is adjusted to an optimal level (generally less than 5%) and the product is sized to the desired mesh size. Emulsifiable concentrates (EC) are homogeneous liquids composed of a solvent or mixture of solvents such as xylenes, heavy aromatic naphthas, isophorone or other proprietary commercial compositions derived from petroleum distillates, the active ingredient and an emulsifying agent or agents. For herbicidal use, the EC is added to water (or other spray carrier) and applied as a spray to the target area. The composition of an EC formulation can contain 0.1% to 95% active ingredient, 5 to 95% solvent or solvent mixture and 1 to 20% emulsifying agent or mixture of emulsifying agents. Solution concentrates are solutions of the active ingredient (1 to 70%) in solvents which have sufficient solvency to dissolve the desired amount of active ingredient. Because they are simple solutions without other inert ingredients such as wetting agents, additional additives are usually added to the spray tank mix before spraying to facilitate proper application. Microemulsions are solutions consisting of the active ingredient (1 to 30%) dissolved in a surfactant or emulsifier, without any additional solvents. There are no additional solvents added to this formulation. Microemulsions are particularly useful when a low odor formulation is required such as in residential turfgrass applications. Suspoemulsions are combinations of two active ingredients. One active ingredient is made as a suspension concentrate (1-50% active ingredient) and the second active is made as a emulsifiable concentrate (0.1-20%). A reason for making this kind of formulation is the inability to make an EC formulation of the first ingredient due to poor solubility in organic solvents. The suspoemulsion formulation allows for the combination of the two active ingredients to be packaged in one container, thereby minimizing packaging waste and giving greater convenience to the product user. The herbicidal compounds of this invention may be formulated or applied with insecticides, fungicides, acaricides, nematicides, fertilizers, plant growth regulators or other agricultural chemicals. Certain tank mix additives, such as spreader stickers, penetration aids, wetting agents, surfactants, emulsifiers, humectants and UV protectants may be added in amounts of 0.01% to 20% to enhance the biological activity, stability, wetting, spreading on foliage or uptake of the active ingredients on the target area or to improve the suspensibility, dispersion, redispersion, emulsifiability, UV stability or other physical or physico-chemical property of the active ingredient in the spray tank, spray system or target area. The compositions of the present invention may be used in admixture with or in combination with other agricultural chemicals, fertilizers, adjuvants, surfactants, emulsifiers, oils, polymers or phytotoxicity-reducing agents such as herbicide safeners. In such a case, they may exhibit even better effects or activities. As other agricultural chemicals, herbicides, fungicides, antibiotics, plant hormones, plant growth regulators, insecticides, or acaricides may, for example, be mentioned. Especially with herbicidal compositions having the compounds of the present invention used in admixture with or in combination with one or more active ingredients of other herbicides, it is possible to improve the herbicidal activities, the range of application time(s) and the range of applicable weed types. Further, the compounds of the present invention and an active ingredient of another herbicide may be separately formulated so they may be mixed for use at the time of application, or both may be formulated together. The present invention covers such herbicidal compositions. The blend ratio of the compounds of the present invention with the active ingredient of other herbicides can not generally be defined, since it varies depending on the time and method of application, weather conditions, soil type and type of formulation. However one active ingredient of other herbicide may be incorporated usually in an amount of 0.01 to 100 parts by weight, per one part by weight of the compounds of the present invention. Further, the total dose of all of the active ingredients is usually from 1 to 10000 g/ha, preferably from 5 to 3000 g/ha. The present invention covers such herbicidal compositions.

Test Example A standard greenhouse herbicide activity screening system was used to evaluate the herbicidal efficacy and crop safety of these test compounds. Four broadleaf weed species, lambsquarters ( Chenopodium album, CHEAL), velvetleaf ( Abutilon theophrasti, ABUTH), common ragweed ( Ambrosia artemisiifolia, AMBEL), and ivyleaf morningglory ( Ipomoea hederacea, IPOHE), and four grass weed species including green foxtail ( Setaria viridis, SETVI), barnyardgrass ( Echinochloa crus - galli, ECHCG), johnsongrass ( Sorghum halepense, SORHA), and large crabgrass ( Digitaria sanguinalis, DIGSA) were used as test species. Because the salts of glyphosate are known to be inactive when applied as a soil treatment, only POST emergent sprays were applied. For the post-emerge tests, seeds were planted 10-28 days prior to the test to allow emergence and good foliage development prior to application of the test substances. At the time of the post-emerge application, plants of all species were usually at the 2-4 leaf stage of development. All test compounds were dissolved in water and applied to the test units in a volume of 187 l/ha. A commercial non-ionic surfactant was also included (0.25% v/v) to enhance wetting of the leaf surfaces of target plants. Test materials were applied at rates ranging from 105 g acid equivalent/ha to 1680 g acid equivalent/ha using a track sprayer equipped with a TJ8001E even flow flat fan spray nozzle. Plants were arranged on a shelf so that the top of the canopy was 40-45 cm below the nozzle. Pressurized air was used to force the test solution through the nozzle as it was mechanically advanced over the top of all test plants. This application simulates a typical commercial field herbicide application. Post-emerge test units were always bottom-watered. At 14 days after application of the test materials, phytotoxicity ratings were recorded. A rating scale of 0-100 was used as previously described in Research Methods in Weed Science, 2nd edition, B. Truelove, Ed., Southern Weed Science Society, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama, 1977. Briefly, 0 corresponds to no damage and 100 corresponds to complete death of all plants in the test unit.

Relative to 1 mole of the active ester compound (16), the compound (13) is preferably added in an amount of 0.5 to 5 moles, particularly 1 to 2 moles, while the compound (8) is preferably added in an amount of 2 to 100 moles, particularly 5 to 50 moles. The reaction temperature is similar to that in Step 2. The reaction times after the addition of the compound (13) and the compound (8) are each preferably 0.1 to 100 hours, particularly 0.5 to 5 hours. The compound (17) synthesized in this reaction can be isolated and purified as needed, but can also be provided for the subsequent step without purification. (Step 12) The compound (17) is reacted with the carboxylic acid (9) or dicarboxylic anhydride (10), whereby the corresponding naphthalimidobenzamide derivative (1-c) can be obtained. When the carboxylic acid (9) is employed in this reaction, it is preferred to add a carboxylic-acid activating agent as in Step 2. When the dicarboxylic anhydride (10) or equivalent thereof is employed in this reaction, on the other hand, the carboxylic-acid activating agent is used if necessary. The activating agent, reaction solvent and base employed in this reaction are similar to those of Step 2. The carboxylic acid (9) or dicarboxylic anhydride (10) is preferably added in an amount of 1 to 50 moles, particularly 1 to 10 moles relative to 1 mole of the compound (17). The reaction temperature and reaction time are similar to those of Step 2. The naphthalimidobenzamide derivatives (1) of the present invention or intermediates thus obtained can be converted into salts, particularly pharmaceutically acceptable salts, in a known manner. These compounds can be isolated and purified by known separating and purifying means, such as concentration, solvent extraction, filtration, recrystallization or various chromatographies. The naphthalimidobenzamide derivatives (1) or salts thereof according to the present invention are compounds synthesized to have a high affinity with DNA and base sequence selectivity. As a result of various investigations, it has been confirmed that the compounds of the present invention each has a high affinity with DNA based on the results of various tests including a test using ethidium bromide displacement assay or the like. It has also been confirmed that they have stronger affinities with respective base sequence regions. For example, the compound of Example 4 has strong interaction with a region abundant in guanine and cytosine, while the compound of Example 30 has strong interaction with a region abundant in adenine and thymine. A compound having interaction with DNA exhibits its biological activity in the following two manners. One is a manner of inhibiting the action of an enzyme on DNA. Examples include functional inhibition of topoisomerase, helicase, DNA repair enzyme or DNA polymerase. The compound of the present invention is confirmed to inhibit the activity of topoisomerase. The other one is a manner of inhibiting the binding of a transcription-related protein to DNA, thereby exhibiting biological activity. In general, a transcription-related protein has selective interaction with a specific region or a specific base sequence in DNA, thereby adjusting transcription and then controlling the production of a specific protein. It is therefore presumed that a compound which binds to a specific region or a specific base sequence can selectively control the synthesis of a limited protein through inhibition of protein-DNA binding. Judging from that diseases including malignant tumor are induced by the abnormal exhibition amount of a specific protein, the compounds of the present invention which are bound to DNA with base-sequence selectivity and high affinity are usable as a remedy for many diseases with high selectivity. Examples of such diseases include malignant tumors, immune.allergic diseases, circulatory diseases, respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, hepatic.biliary diseases, musculoskeletal.connective-tissue diseases, endocrine diseases, neuropathy, psychiatric diseases, urinary.genital diseases, obstetric and gynecologic diseases and skin diseases. The compounds of the present invention can be used as a pharmaceutical for various diseases, more preferably, an antitumor agent, particularly preferably an anti-malignant tumor agent. Examples of the malignant tumor include head and neck cancer, esophageal carcinoma, gastric cancer, colon cancer, rectum cancer, liver cancer, gallbladder.bile duct cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, prostatic cancer, osteosarcoma.soft tissue sarcoma, malignant lymphoma, leukemia, cervical cancer, skin carcinoma and brain tumor. The compounds of the present invention exhibited excellent antitumor effects in a test using a nude mouse to which human cancer cell strains had been subcutaneously transplanted. For example, the compound of Example 46 exhibited inhibitory effects against tumor proliferation by 96.2%, 59.8%, 71.8% and 79.5% in systems to which human skin cancer strains LOX, human pancreatic cancer strains PAN6, human breast cancer strains MX1 and human gastric cancer strains AZ521 had been transplanted, respectively.

The results of the pharmacological test on the anti-tumor effects of the invention compounds will be shown below in order to describe the usefulness of the compounds. Test 1 Cytotoxicity against KB cells After KB cells in the logarithmic growth phase were dispersed by treating with a trypsin/EDTA solution (0.25% trypsin, 2% EDTA in PBS), the trypsin/EDTA solution was removed by centrifugation. The residue was re-suspended in an MEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Then, an equivalent amount of a 0.2% trypan blue solution was added to a portion of the cell suspension, followed by mixing. The number of living cells which had not been dyed with the trypan blue was counted by a hemocytometer and the suspension was diluted and adjusted with the above-described culture medium to give a cell concentration of 110 4 cells/ml. Each well of a 96-well plate was inoculated with a 100-l portion of the resulting suspension, in other words, was inoculated to give a concentration of 110 3 cells/well. To the cells cultured in a CO 2 incubator for 24 hours after the inoculation was added 100 l/well of a medicament solution, followed by culturing for 72 hours. To a control was added 100 l of an MEM medium. The cytotoxicity of the medicament was determined from a change in the number of the cells by using the crystal violet dying method. Described specifically, 25% glutaraldehyde was added to the plate to give a concentration of 25 l/well and the cells were fixed for about 15 minutes. After washing the plate with water, 100 l/well of a 0.05% crystal violet solution dissolved in 20% methanol was added to dye the cells therewith for about 15 minutes. The plate was washed to remove the unbound crystal violet, followed by the addition of 100 l/well of 0.05M NaH 2 PO 4 /ethanol (1:1 v/v), whereby the crystal violet bound to the cellular protein was extracted. The absorbance at 550 nm was measured by Model 3550 Microplate reader (BIO-RAD). From the absorbance of each of medicament-treatment groups relative to the average absorbance of a medicament-treatment-free group which was set at 100, the concentration (IC 50 ) inducing 50% proliferation inhibition was calculated. The results are shown in Table 15.

DESCRIPTION Substituted piperidines, processes for their preparation and their use as pesticides and fungicides. The invention relates to substituted piperidines, to processes for their preparation and to their use as pesticides and fungicides. It has already been disclosed that certain 4-(piperidin-4-ylamino)-pyrimidines have fungicidal, acaricidal and insecticidal activity (DE-A42 08 254). However, the biological action of these compounds is not always satisfactory in all exemplary applications, in particular when low application rates and concentrations are used. There have been found (piperidin-4-ylamino) heterocycles of the formula (I) in which the radicals and groups are as defined below and which are highly suitable for controlling animal pests such as insects, arachnids, nematodes, helminth and mollusks, for controlling endoparasites and ectoparasites in the veterinary medicine field and for controlling harmful fungi, while being well tolerated by plants and having favorable toxicity to warm-blooded species.

or haloalkanoylalkyl radicals such as, for example, the trifluoro- or trichloroacetylmethyl group; or aroylalkyl radicals such as, for example, the benzoyl-, or naphthoylalkyl radicals such as, for example, the phenylacetylmethyl group; or heterocyclylcarbonylalkyl radicals such as, for example, the thienyl- or pyridylacetylmethyl group; or arylalkyl radicals such as, for example, the benzyl, the 2-phenylethyl, the 1-phenylethyl, the 1-methyl-1-phenylethyl group, the 3-phenylpropyl group, the 4-phenylbutyl group, the 2-methyl-2-phenylethyl group or the 1-methyl- or 2-methyl-naphthyl group;

The explanation given above applies correspondingly to homologs or radicals derived from them. The present invention relates to compounds of the formula (I) in the form of the free base or of an acid addition salt. Acids which can be used for salt formation are inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, or organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, malonic acid, oxalic acid, fumaric acid, adipic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid or toluenesulfonic acid. Some of the compounds of the formula (I) have one or more asymmetric carbon atoms or stereoisomers on double bonds. Enantiomers or diastereomers may therefore occur. The invention extends not only to the pure isomers but also to mixtures of these. The diastereomer mixtures can be resolved into the components by customary methods, for example by selective crystallization from suitable solvents or by chromatography. Racemates can be resolved by customary methods to give the enantiomers, for example by salt formation with a chiral enantiomerically pure acid, separation of the diastereomeric salts and liberation of the pure enantiomers by means of a base. The invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of compounds of the formula (I) which comprises reacting a compound of the formula (II) in which A, R 1 , R 2 and R 3 have the meanings given in formula I and L is a leaving group, for example halogen, alkylthio, alkanesulfonyloxy or arylsulfonyloxy, alkylsulfonyl or arylsulfonyl, with a nucleophile of the formula (III) in which X, Y, Z, m, n, R 4 , R 4 and R 5 have the meanings given above under formula I and optionally derivatizing further the pyridine or pyrimidine system or the piperidine side chain in the compounds of the formula (I) obtained thus or in another manner and optionally converting the resulting compounds into their salts. The substitution reaction described above is known in principle. The leaving group L can be varied within wide limits and may be, for example, a halogen atom, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, or alkylthio, such as methyl- or ethylthio, or alkanesulfonyloxy, such as methane-, trifluoromethane- or ethanesulfonyloxy, or arylsulfonyloxy, such as benzenesulfonyloxy or toluenesulfonyloxy, or alkylsulfonyl, such as methyl- or ethylsulfonyl, or arylsulfonyl, such as phenyl- or toluenesulfonyl. The abovementioned reaction is carried out in a temperature range of 20 to 1 50 C., expediently in the presence of a base and, if appropriate, in an inert organic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide, N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, methanol, ethanol, butanol, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, toluene, chlorobenzene or xylene. Mixtures of the abovementioned solvents may also be used. In the event that X is oxygen, examples of suitable bases are carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, amides or hydrides of alkali metal or alkaline earth metals, such as sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium amide or sodium hydride, and in the event that X is NH, examples of suitable bases are carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, hydroxides, amides or hydrides of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, such as sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium amide or sodium hydride, or organic bases such as triethylamine or pyridine. A second equivalent of an amine of the formula (III) may also be employed as auxiliary base. The compounds of the formula (II) required as starting materials are known from the literature in most cases or may be prepared analogously to known methods (cf., for example, EP-A 0 370 391, EP-A 0 470 600, DE-A43 31 179, DE-A44 04 702). To prepare the nucleophiles of the formula (III), suitably substituted compounds of the formula (IV) are preferably used as starting materials, and they are converted into the corresponding amines by reductive amination (H 2 , NH 3 , metal catalyst or ammonium acetate/sodium cyanoborohydride or Leuckart-Wallach reduction) or into the corresponding alcohols by reduction with a complex metal hydride. Starting compounds of the formula (IV) are known in some cases or can be prepared analogously to known processes. The invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of compounds of the formula (I) which comprises reacting a compound of the formula (II) in which A, R 1 , R 2 and R 3 have the meanings given under formula (I) and L is a leaving group, for example halogen, alkylthio, alkanesulfonyloxy or arylsulfonyloxy, alkylsulfonyl or arylsulfonyl, with a nucleophile of the formula (V) in which X, R 4 , R 4 , m and n have the meanings given under formula (I) and Sg is a protective group, eliminating, in the resulting compounds of the formula (VI) in which A, R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , X, m, n, R 4 and R 4 have the meanings given under formula (I) and Sg is a protective group, the protective group Sg and reacting the resulting compound of the formula (VII) in which R 1 , R 2 R 3 , A, X, m, n, R 4 and R 4 have the meanings given above under formula (I) with a compound of the formula (VIII) in which Y, Z and R 5 have the meanings indicated for formula (I) and L is a leaving group, preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine, and optionally further derivatizing the pyridine or pyrimidine system or the piperidine side chain in the compounds of the formula (I) which have been obtained thus or in another manner. Examples of suitable protective groups Sg for formula VI are the trifluoroacetyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, benzyl, methoxybenzyl, dimethoxybenzyl, trityl or the 9-phenylfluorenyl group, each of which can be eliminated under basic, acidic, hydrogenolytic or oxidative conditions (cf., for example, P. J. Kocienski, Protecting Groups, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1994). The reaction of the compounds of the formula (II) with the compounds of the formula (V) to give the compounds of the formula (VI) is totally analogous to the reaction of the compounds of the formula (II) with the compounds of the formula (III). The protective group Sg is elminated from the compounds of the formula (VI) for example by the methods given in the literature for the individual protective groups (cf., for example, P. J. Kocienski, Protecting Groups, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1994). Thus, a tert-butoxycarbonyl protective group is eliminated by treating the compound of formula (VI) with acid in an inert solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane or toluene. The reaction of the compounds of the formula (VII) with the compounds of the formula VII to give the end product of the formula (I) is expediently carried out in the presence of a base such as, for example, triethylamine or pyridine, or in the presence of inorganic acid binders such as, for example, alkali carbonates, alkaline earth metal carbonates, alkali hydrogen carbonates or alkaline earth metal hydrogen carbonates such as, for example, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate or potassium hydrogen carbonate, in an inert solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, benzene, toluene or pyridine. Those compounds of the formula (V) and of the formula (VIII) which are not already known can be prepared analogously to known processes. The intermediates of the formula (VII) are novel and also part of the invention. Collections of compounds of the formula (I) which can be synthesized in accordance with the abovementioned scheme may also be prepared in parallel, which may be effected by the manual, semiautomated or fully automated route. It is possible to automate carrying out the reaction or working up or purifying of the products or intermediates. In total, this is to be understood as a procedure as described, for example, by S. H. DeWitt in Annual Reports in Combinatorial Chemistry and Molecular Diversity: Automated synthesis, Volume 1, Verlag Escom 1997, pages 69 to 77. A series of commercially available apparatuses as they are available from, for example, Stem Corporation, Woodrolfe Road, Tollesbury, Essex, CM9 8SE, England or HP Labortechnik GmbH, Bruckmannring 28, 85764 Oberschleilheim, Germany, may be used for carrying out the reaction and for working-up in parallel. Equipment which are available for the parallel purification of compounds of the formula (I) or of intermediate obtained on preparation are, inter alia, chromatography apparatuses, for example those of ISCO, Inc., 4700 Superior Street, Lincoln, Nebr. 68504, USA. The apparatuses mentioned lead to a modular procedure in which the individual process steps are automated, but manual operations must be carried out between the process steps. This may be avoided by employing partially or fully integrated automation systems in which the automation modules in question are operated, for example, by robots. Such automation systems can be obtained, for example, from Zymark Corporation, Zymark Center, Hopkinton, Mass. 01748, USA. In addition to the procedure described here, the compounds of the formula (I) may be prepared entirely or partially by solid-phase techniques. To this end, individual intermediates or all intermediates of the synthesis or of a synthesis adapted to suit the relevant procedure are bound to a synthetic resin. Solid-phase synthetic techniques are described sufficiently in the specialist literature, for example Barry A. Bunin in The Combinatorial Index, Academic Press, 1998. The use of solid-phase synthetic methods permits the use of a series of protocols known from the literature which, in turn, can be carried out manually or in an automated fashion. For example, the Tea-bag method (Houghten, US 4,631,211; Houghten et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, 1985, 82, 5131-5135), in which products of IRORI, 11149 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, Calif. 92037, USA, are employed, may be partially automated. The automation of solid-phase parallel syntheses is carried out successfully for example using apparatuses of Argonaut Technologies, Inc., 887 Industrial Road, San Carlos, Calif. 94070, USA or MultiSynTech GmbH, Wullener Feld 4, 58454 Witten, Germany. The preparation in accordance with the processes described herein yields compounds of the formula (I) in the form of substance collections termed libraries. The present invention also relates to libraries containing at least two compounds of the formula (I). The active substances of the formula (I) are well tolerated by plants, show favorable toxicity to warm-blooded species and are suitable for controlling animal pests, in particular insects, arachnids, helminths and mollusks, very particularly preferably for controlling insects and arachnids which occur in agriculture, in livestock husbandry, in forests, in the protection of stored products and materials, and in the hygiene sector.

The invention also relates to compositions, in particular insecticidal and acaricidal compositions, which comprise the compounds of the formula (I) in addition to suitable formulation auxiliaries. The compositions according to the invention generally comprise 1 to 95% by weight of the active substances of the formula (1). They may be formulated in various ways, depending on the prevailing biological and/or chemical-physical parameters. Possible formulations which are preferably suitable are: wettable powders (WP), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), aqueous solutions (SL), emulsions, sprayable solutions, oil- or water-based dispersions (SC), suspoemulsions (SE), dusts (DP), seed-dressing materials, granules in the form of microgranules, spray granules, coated granules and adsorption granules, water-dispersible granules (WG), ULV formulations, microcapsules, waxes or baits. These individual types of formulation are known in principle and described, for example, in: Winnacker-Kchler, Chemische Technologie Chemical Technology, Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th Ed. 1986; van Falkenberg, Pesticides Formulations, Marcel Dekker N.Y., 2nd Ed. 1972-73; K. Martens, Spray Drying Handbook, 3rd Ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd. London. The formulation auxiliaries required, such as inert materials, surfactants, solvents and other additives, are also known and described, for example, in Watkins, Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Garriers, 2nd Ed., Darland Books, Caldwell N.J.; H. v. Olphen, Introduction to Clay Colloid Chemistry, 2nd .40 Ed., J. Wiley Sons, N.Y.; Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Interscience, N.Y. 1950; McCutcheons, Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual, MC Publ. Corp., Ridgewood N.J.; Sisley and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents, Chem. Publ. Co. Inc., N.Y. 1964; Schbnfeldt, Grenzflchenaktive thylenoxidaddukte Surface-active ethylene oxide adducts Wiss. Verlagsgesell., Stuttgart 1967; Winnacker-Kchler, Chemische Technologie, Volume 7, C. HauserVerlag Munich, 4th Ed. 1986. Based on these formulations, it is also possible to prepare combinations with other pesticidally active substances, fertilizers and/or growth regulators, for example in the form of a readymix or a tank mix. Wettable powders are products which are uniformly dispersible in water and which, besides the active substance, additionally comprise wetters, for example, polyoxethylated alkylphenols, polyoxyethylated fatty alcohols, alkyl- or alkylphenolsulfonates and dispersants, for example sodium lignosulfonate or sodium 2,2-dinaphthylmethane-6,6-disulfonate, in addition to a diluent or inert substance. Emulsifiable concentrates are prepared by dissolving the active substance in an organic solvent, for example butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, xylene, or else high-boiling aromatics or hydrocarbons, with addition of one or more emulsifiers. The following are examples of emulsifiers which can be used: calcium alkylarylsulfonates such as calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, or non-ionic emulsifiers such as fatty acid polyglycol esters, alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, propylene oxide/ethylene oxide condensates, alkyl polyethers, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters or polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters. Dusts are obtained by grinding the active substance with finely divided solid materials, for example talc, natural clays such as kaolin, bentonite, pyrophyllite, or diatomaceous earth. Granules can be prepared either by spraying the active substance onto adsorptive granulated inert material or by applying active substance concentrates to the surface of carriers such as sand, kaolinites or granulated inert material with the aid of binders, for example polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate or else mineral oils. Suitable active substances may also be granulated in the manner conventionally used for the preparation of fertilizer granules, if desired as a mixture with fertilizers. The active substance concentration in wettable powders is, for example, approximately 10 to 90% by weight, the remainder to 100% being composed of customary formulation components. In the case of emulsifiable concentrates, the active substance concentration can be approximately 5 to 80% by weight. Formulations in the form of dust usually comprise 5 to 20% by weight of active substance, sprayable solutions approximately 2 to 20% by weight. In the case of granules, the active substance content depends partly on whether the active compound is in liquid or solid form and on which granulation auxiliaries, fillers and the like are used. In addition, the active substance formulations mentioned optionally comprise the adhesives, wetters, dispersants, emulsifiers, penetrants, solvents, fillers or carriers which are conventional in each case. For use, the concentrates, which are in commercially available form, are optionally diluted in the customary manner, for example using water in the case of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions and in some cases also microgranules. Preparations in the form of dusts, granulated preparations and sprayable solutions are usually not diluted further with other inert substances prior to use. The application rate required varies with the external conditions such as, inter alia, temperature and humidity. It may vary within wide limits, for example, between 0.0005 and 10.0 kg/ha or more of active ingredient, but it is preferably between 0.001 and 5 kg/ha. The active substances according to the invention may be present in their commercially available formulations, and in the application forms prepared from these formulations, alone or as a mixture with other active substances, such as insecticides, attractants, sterilants, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth regulators or herbicides.

The abovementioned components are known active substances, many of which are described in C.D.S. Tomlin, S.B. Walker, The Pesticide Manual, 11th Edition (1997), British Crop Protection Council. The active substance content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can vary within broad ranges. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0001 to 95% by weight of active substance, preferably between 0.0001 and 1 % by weight. Application is effected in a conventional fashion, matched to the use forms. The active substance content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can be from 0.00000001 to 95% by weight of active substance, preferably between 0.00001 and 1 % by weight. Application is effected in a conventional fashion matched to the use forms. The active substances according to the invention are also suitable in the field of veterinary medicine, preferably for controlling endo- and ectoparasites, or in the field of animal husbandry. The active substances according to the invention are preferably applied in a known fashion, such as by oral application in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, potions or granules, by dermal application in the form of, for example, dipping, spraying, pouring-on and spotting-on and dusting, and also by parenteral application in the form of, for example, injection. The novel compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention can accordingly also be employed particularly advantageously in livestock husbandry (for example cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry such as chickens and geese). In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the compounds of the formula (I), if appropriate in suitable formulations (cf. above) and if appropriate with the drinking water or feed, are administered orally to the animals. Since excretion in the faeces occurs in an effective fashion, the development of insects in the animal faeces can be prevented very simply in this fashion. The dosages and formulations suitable in each case, in particular, depend on the type and developmental stage of the productive animals and also on the severity of infestation and can easily be determined and fixed by conventional methods. In the case of cattle, the compounds can be employed, for example, in dosages of 0.01 to 1 mg/kg of body weight. The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention are also distinguished by an outstanding fungicidal action. Fungal pathogens which have already penetrated plant tissue can successfully be controlled in the curative way. This is particularly important and advantageous in the case of those fungal diseases which, once infection has taken place, can no longer be controlled efficiently with the fungicides normally available. The spectrum of action of the claimed compounds extends to a variety of economically important phytopathogenic fungi such as, for example, Plasmopara viticola, Phytophthora infestans, Erysiphe graminis, Pyricularia oryzae, Pyrenophora teres, Leptosphaerea nodorum and Pellicularia sasakii and Puccinia recondite. In addition, the compounds according to the invention are also suitable for use in industrial fields, for example as wood preservative, as preservative in paints, in cooling lubricants for metal working or as preservative in drilling and cutting oils. The active compounds according to the invention, in their commercially available formulations, can be used either alone or in combination with other fungicides known from the literature. Examples of fungicides which are known from the literature and which can be combined in accordance with the invention with the compounds of the formula (I) are the following products: aldimorph, andoprim, anilazine, BAS 480F, BAS 450F, benalaxyl, benodanil, benomyl, binapacryl, bitertanol, bromuconazole, buthiobate, captafol, captan, carbendazim, carboxin, CGA 173506, cyprofuram, dichlofluanid, dichlomezin, diclobutrazol, diethofencarb, difenconazole (CGA 169374), difluconazole, dimethirimol, dimethomorph, diniconazole, dinocap, dithianon, dodemorph, dodine, edifenfos, ethirimol, etridiazol, fenarimol, fenfuram, fenpiclonil, fenpropidin, fenpropimorph, fentin acetate, fentin hydroxide, ferimzone (TF164), fluazinam, fluobenzimine, fluquinconazole, fluorimide, flusilazole, flutolanil, flutriafol, folpet, fosetyl-aluminum, fuberidazole, fulsulfamide (MT-F 651), furalaxyl, furconazole, furmecyclox, guazatine, hexaconazole, ICI A5504, imazalil, imibenconazole, iprobenfos, iprodione, isoprothiolane, KNF 317, copper compounds such as copper oxychloride, oxine-copper, copper oxide, mancozeb, maneb, mepanipyrim (KIF 3535), metconazole, mepronil, metalaxyl, methasulfocarb, methfuroxam, MON 24000, myclobutanil, nabam, nitrothalidopropyl, nuarimol, ofurace, oxadixyl, oxycarboxin, penconazole, pencycuron, PP 969, probenazole, propineb, prochloraz, procymidon, propamocarb, propiconazole, prothiocarb, pyracarbolid, pyrazophos, pyrifenox, pyroquilon, rabenzazole, RH7592, sulfur, tebuconazole, TF 167, thiabendazole, thicyofen, thiofanate-methyl, thiram, tolclofos-methyl, tolylfluanid, triadimefon, triadimenol, tricyclazole, tridemorph, triflumizole, triforine, validamycin, vinchlozolin, XRD 563, zineb, sodium dodecylsulfonate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium C13/C15-alcohol ether sulfonate, sodium cetostearyl phosphate ester, sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate, sodium isopropyinaphthalenesulfonate, sodium methylenebisnaphthalenesulfonate, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, salts of long-chain primary, secondary or tertiary amines, alkylpropyleneamines, laurylpyrimidinium bromide, ethoxylated quarternized fatty amines, alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride and 1-hydroxylethyl-2-alkylimidazoline. The abovementioned components are known active substances, many of which are described in C. D. S. Tomlin, S. B. Walker, The Pesticide Manual, 11th Edition (1997), British Crop Protection Council. The active substance content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can vary within broad ranges. The active substance concentration of the use forms can be from 0.0001 to 95% by weight of active substance, preferably between 0.0001 and 1 % by weight. Application is effected in a conventional fashion, matched to the use forms. The compounds of the formula (I) can also be employed for controlling harmful organisms in crops of known or genetically engineered plants yet to be developed. As a rule, the transgenic plants are distinguished by particular advantageous properties, for example by resistances to certain crop protection agents, resistances to plant diseases or pathogens of plant diseases such as certain insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other particular properties relate, for example, to the harvested material with regard to quantity, quality, storage properties, composition and specific constituents. Thus, transgenic plants with an elevated starch content or altered starch quality, or those with a different fatty acid spectrum of the harvested material are known. The use in economically important transgenic crops of useful plants and ornamentals, for example, cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet and sorghum, rice, cassava and maize or else crops of sugar beet, cotton, soya, oilseed rape, potatoes, tomatoes, peas and other vegetables is preferred. When using in transgenic crops, in particular those with resistances to insects, effects are frequently found (in addition to the pesticidal effects which can be observed in other crops) which are specific to application in the transgenic crop in question, for example an altered or specifically widened spectrum of pests which can be controlled, or altered application rates which can be used for application. The invention therefore also relates to the use of compounds of the formula (I) for controlling harmful organisms in transgenic crop plants. The contents of german patent application 198 15 026.1, whose priority is claimed by the present application, and the contents of the appended summary are incorporated herein specifically by way of reference; they are considered as part of the present description by way of citation: The examples which follow serve to illustrate the invention without restricting them thereto. A. FORMULATION EXAMPLES 1a) A dust is obtained by mixing 10 parts by weight of active substance and 90 parts by weight of talc as inert substance and comminuting the mixture in a hammer mill. b) A wettable powder which is readily dispersible in water is obtained by mixing 25 parts by weight of active substance, 65 parts by weight of kaolin-containing quartz as inert material, 10 parts by weight of potassium lignosulfonate and 1 part by weight of sodium oleoylmethyltaurinate as wetter and dispersant, and grinding the mixture in a pinned-disk mill. c) A dispersion concentrate which is readily dispersible in water is prepared by mixing 40 parts by weight of active substance with 7 parts by weight of a sulfosuccinic monoester, 2 parts by weight of a sodium lignosulfonate and 51 parts by weight of water, and grinding the mixture in a ball mill to a fineness of below 5 microns. d) An emulsifiable concentrate can be prepared from 15 parts by weight of active substance, 75 parts by weight of cyclohexane as solvent and 10 parts by weight of oxyethylated nonylphenol (10 EO) as emulsifier. e) Granules can be prepared from 2 to 15 parts by weight of active substance and an inert granule carrier material such as attapulgite, pumice granules and/or quartz sand. It is expedient to use a suspension of the wettable powder of Example b) with a solids content of 30%, which is sprayed onto the surface of attapulgite granules, dried and mixed intimately. The wettable powder amounts to approx. 5% by weight and the inert carrier material to approx. 95% of the finished granules. B. PREPARATION EXAMPLES Example A 4-(N-tert-butoxycarbonylpiperidin-1-ylamino)-5-chloro-6-ethylpyrimidine 17.7 g (0.10 mol) of 4,5-dichloro-6-ethylpyrimidine, 20.0 g 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)4-aminopiperidine (0.10 mol) and 15.2 g (0.15 mol) of triethylamine were heated for 8 hours at 80-90. After cooling, the mixture was worked up with water/dichloromethane and the organic phase was dried and concentrated. For purification, the crude product was chromatographed on silica gel (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 1:1). This gave 21.7 g (63.6% of theory) of a colorless oil which solidified gradually. M.p. 78-79 C. Preparation of the starting matererial 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)4-aminopiperidine 100.0 g (0.50 mol) of 1-tert-butoxycarbonyl-4-piperidone were subjected to reductive amination in 300 ml of ammonia-saturated methanol in the presence of 20.0 g of Raney nickel at 100 C. and a hydrogen pressure of 100 bar. After the catalyst had been removed by filtration, the mixture was concentrated. This gave 95.5 g of a brown oil (95.4% of theory). Example B 4-(1-tert-butoxycarbonylpiperidin-4-yloxy)-5-chloro-6-ethylpyrimidine 0.4 g (10 mmol) of sodium hydride (80% dispersion in oil) was added to a solution of 2.0 g (10 mmol) of 1-(tert-butoxycarbonylpiperidin-4-ol and 1.8 g (10 mmol) of 4,5-dichloro-6-ethylpyrimidine in 25 ml of tetrahydrofuran, and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature for 1 hour at reflux. After cooling, the mixture was concentrated, the residue was taken up in water/toluene, and the organic phase was dried and concentrated. For purification, the product was chromatographed on silica gel (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 7:3). This gave 2.5 g (73.5% of theory) of a yellow oil. 1 H NMR (CDCl 3 ): 8.51 (s, 1H, pyrimidinde-H); 5.38 (m, 1H, O CH ); 4.70 (m, 2H, piperidine-H); 3.42 (m, 2H, piperidine-H); 2.90 (q, 2H, CH 2 CH 3 ); 1.98 (m, 2H, piperidine-H); 1.8 (m, 2H, piperidine-H); 1.48 (s, 9H, tert-butyl); 1.39 (tr, 3H, CH 2 CH 3 ) Example C Intermediate 5-chloro-6-ethyl-4-(piperidin-4-ylamino)pyrimidine 20.7 g (0.61 mmol) of 4-(tert-butoxycarbonylpiperidin-4-ylamino)-5-chloro-6-ethylpyrimidine (Example A) were dissolved in 100 ml of dichloroethane and 148.0 g of trifluorocetic acid were added slowly. After the evolution of CO 2 had ceased, stirring was continued for 2 more hours. After the solvent and the trifluoroacetic acid had been stripped off, the mixture was concentrated and the residue was taken up in dichloromethane/water. After the mixture had been rendered weakly alkaline by addition of dilute sodium hydroxide solution, the organic phase was separated off, dried and concentrated. This gave 12.3 g (83.9% of theory) of a yellow solid. M.p.: 150-151 C. Example D 5-chloro-6-ethyl-4-(1 -phenoxycarbonylpiperidin-4-ylamino)pyrimidine 1.2 g (5 mmol) of 5-chloro-6-ethyl-4-(pipderidin-4-ylamino)pyrimidine (Example C) and 0.6 g (6 mmol) of triethylamine were introduced into 20 ml of dichloromethane, and 0.9 g (6 mmol) of phenyl chloroformate was added dropwise at 20-30 C. After the mixture had been left to stand overnight, it was extracted by stirring with water, and the organic phase was dried and concentrated. For purification, the product was chromatographed on silica gel (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 1:1). This gave 1.4 g (77.6% of theory) of product as colorless solid. M.p.: 105-106 C. Other examples which can be prepared analogously to the synthetic examples mentioned above are those of Table 1 given hereinbelow. TABLE 1 Ex.

The compounds are useful for treating or reducing the risk of reversible obstructive airways disease. This invention relates to pharmaceutically useful compounds, processes for their production, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and methods of treatment involving their use. T-cells play an important role in the immune response, however in autoimmune disease T-cells are activated against particular tissues, e.g. causing the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is an essential autocrine growth factor for T-cells and hence inhibition of IL-2 transcription is beneficial in the modulation of autoimmune disease. Formation of a transcriptional complex of the protein nuclear factor of activated T-cells-1 (NFAT-1) on the EL-2 promoter is essential for IL-2 transcription. NFAT-1 mediated transcription has therefore been proposed as appropriate molecular target for immunomodulation, Y. Baine et al., J. Immunol , 1995, 154, 3667-3677. W. F. Michne et al, in J. Med.

Thus, the preparation of the compounds of formula (I) may involve, at an appropriate stage, the removal of one or more protecting groups. The protection and deprotection of functional groups is fully described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, edited by J. W. F.

Enantiomers may be isolated by separation of a racemic or other mixture of the compounds using conventional techniques (e.g. chiral HPLC). Alternatively the desired optical isomers may be made by reaction of the appropriate optically active starting materials under conditions which will not cause racemisation, or by derivatisation, for example with a homochiral acid followed by separation of the diastereomeric derivatives by conventional means (e.g. HPLC, chromatography over silica) or may be made with achiral starting materials and chiral reagents. All stereoisomers are included within the scope of the invention. The compounds of the invention may be isolated from their reaction mixtures using conventional techniques.

The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts and solvates thereof may be used on their own but will generally be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition in which the formula (I) compound/saltisolvate (active ingredient) is in association with a pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Depending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition will preferably comprise from 0.05 to 99% w (per cent by weight), more preferably less than 80% w, e.g. from 0.10 to 70% w, and even more preferably less than 50% w, of active ingredient, all percentages by weight being based on total composition. Thus, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or solvate thereof, as hereinbefore defined, in association with a pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. The invention further provides a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention which comprises mixing a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or solvate thereof, as hereinbefore defined, with a pharmaceutically-acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier.

This application is a national stage filing under 35 USC 371 from PCT/JP99/00657, filed Feb. 16, 1999. DESCRIPTION 1. Technical Field The present invention relates to a heterocyclic compound having substituents containing a consecutive dicarbonyl structure, particularly to a 1-pyrimidinylacetamide compound, an 1-pyrazinylacetamide compound, a 4-triazinylacetamide compound, and relates to an inhibitor for chymotrypsin type proteases. The present compound is useful as a preventive or therapeutic agent for diseases in which chymotrypsin type proteases are generally considered to participate. For example, chymotrypsin type proteases are considered to participate directly or indirectly in diseases such as asthma, allergy, inflammations, rheumatism, hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy, vascular injuries complicated with angiogenesis and atheroma, nephritis and renal failure. The present invention encompasses an intermediate useful for synthesis of the heterocyclic amide compound having a consecutive dicarbonyl structure, a process for producing said heterocyclic amide compound, a pharmaceutical composition containing said heterocyclic amide compound as the active ingredient, and a pharmaceutical use of said heterocyclic amide compound for the treatment of humane diseases, particularly for the treatment of the above diseases. 2. Background Art It is known that chymase belongs to chymotrypsin type proteases among serine proteases and is a cytotoxic protein accumulated in secretory granules in mast cells and released upon stimulation. Further, it is recently reported in Circ. Res., 66, 883 (1994) that chymase possesses the action of converting angiotensin I into angiotensin II involved in blood pressure regulation in vivo. Further, it is also known that a chymase inhibitor inhibits release of histamine from mast cells (J. Cell. Biochem., 38, 291 (1988)) and release of a cytotoxic protein from eosinophils (Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 312, 67, (1994)). That is, it is known generally at present that chymase is involved not only in cytotoxicity but also in release of various mediators in vivo. Further, the action of chymase varies depending on the type of animal, and it is reported that there is a great difference in the action particularly between human or dog and rodent (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84, 364 (1987)). As a compound inhibiting chymase, only an inhibitor for chymotrypsin as a digestive enzyme is known at present and is not satisfactory in inhibitory activity, selectivity of inhibition toward other proteases, stability of the compound in vivo, toxicity etc. and it has not been developed as a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, there is demand for a highly safe chymase inhibitor which at low concentration, selectively inhibits chymase. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION Under these circumstances, the present inventors made extensive studies to find chymase inhibitors in order to solve the above problems, and as a result, they arrived at the present invention. That is, the present invention relates to the following items 1 to 13: 1. A novel acetamide derivative represented by the following Formula 1 or the pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof. wherein R 0 is a phenyl group whose ring may have one or more substituent groups selected from the group consisting of a halogen, a hydroxyl group, a lower alkoxy group, a lower alkyl group, and a halogenomethyl group defined as group A; R 1 is (1) an aryl group, (2) a heteroaryl group or (3) a 1-6C straight-chain, branched or cyclic alkyl group, which may independently have one or more substituent groups defined as group A; or R 1 may have one or more substituent groups selected from the group consisting of OR a , COOR a , CONR b R c , NR b R c , NR b CHO, NR b COR a , SO 2 OR a , SO 2 R a , CONR b SO 2 R a and P(O) (OR a ) 2 as defined as group B on the above groups (1) to (3) (where each R a to R c is independently a hydrogen, a lower or a substituted lower alkyl; or each R a to R c is independently an aryl (1-7C) alkyl group, a heteroaryl (1-7C) alkyl, an aryl and a heteroaryl, among which the aryl or the heteroaryl may have one or more, usually 1 to 3, substituent groups selected from the group of above-defined group A on the ring; or R 1 may have one or more substituent groups defined below as cyclic group G on the above groups (1) to (3) (cyclic group G; cyclic group G represents a heterocyclic group consisting of a 5- or 6-membered ring containing 1 to 3 oxygen or nitrogen atoms and may have substituent groups); R 2 represents a (1-8C)alkyl, an aryl (1-7C) alkyl group, a heteroaryl (1-7C)alkyl, and an aryl; or R 2 represents the above-defined group B or a (1-8C) alkyl having the group B as a substituent group; or a (1-8C) alkyl having the above-defined cyclic group G as a substituent group; X and Y independently represents a nitrogen atom or a carbon atom and may be substituted by groups represented by above-mentioned R a to R c ; Z represents a methylene group or a polymethylene group, and may have substituents; J represents a carbonyl group, or a methylene group whose two hydrogens may be independently substituted by above-mentioned R a or R b ; L represents an amino group as shown by R 3 R a N, or R 3 O where R 3 is a hydrogen; or R 3 is (1) D(CH 2 ) 0-3 .CO, (2) D.CO.E.CO or (3) D.SO 2 .E.CO as an acyl group; or R 3 is D(CH 2 ) 0-3 .SO 2 or D.CO.E.

For example, the compound of Formula 4 or salt thereof can be easily obtained by conventionally deprotection reaction of the protected amino groups in the ketone derivative of the corresponding oxazolidine and ring-opening reaction of the oxazolidine. The ketone derivative of said oxazolidine can be synthesized as shown in the following steps (1) to (4): (1) According to the method reported by R. Nishizawa et al. in J. Med. Chem., 20(4), 510-515, 3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-substituted or unsubstituted phenyl butyric acid can be easily synthesized by using an amino acid as the starting material. The amino acid used as the starting material may be a commercial product, e.g. substituted or unsubstituted phenylalanine. A desired amino acid, if not commercially available, can be obtained by a conventional amino acid synthesis reaction; for example, a substituted phenylalanine with the substituent group introduced on the aromatic ring can be obtained by condensing an available acetamide malonic acid ester with a substituted benzyl halide to give the ester, and then by hydrolysis of the ester and successive by decarboxylation reaction of the resultant compound and deprotection reaction of the amino group of the compound thus obtained. (2) The 3-amino group of the 3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-substituted or unsubstituted phenylbutyric acid thus obtained is protected with a suitable protective group such as t-butyloxycarbonyl group and then the resulting compound is conventionally condensed with N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine or a salt thereof to derive 3-N-protected amino-2-hydroxy-4-substituted or unsubstituted phenylbutyric acid-N,O-dimethylhydroxylamide. (3) The amide thus obtained can be conventionally treated in 2,2-dimethoxypropane with a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid to give easily 3-N-protected-5-(N-methoxy-N-methyl)carbamoyl-2,2-dimethyl-4-substituted or unsubstituted phenylmethyloxazolidine. (4) The amide thus obtained, which is known an activated amide as is apparent to those skilled in the art, can be easily converted to the ketone derivative by the below treatment: for example, according to a method disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 143517/1996, the oxazolidine can be treated with a Grignard reagent corresponding to group R 2 in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran under the atmosphere of inert gas such as argon to substitute the N,O-dimethylhydroxylamino group with the group R 2 , so that the ketone derivative of the oxazolidine having the group R 2 introduced into it can be synthesized.

The compound of Formula 3 wherein X is nitrogen and Y is carbon as an intermediate, can be obtained, according to a available pathway, by synthesizing the compound of Formula 5 wherein X is nitrogen and Y is carbon through the route as shown in the scheme 3, and then treating the synthesized compound in the similar way as described in the above (1) according to the scheme 2. A process for producing the compound of Formula 5 wherein X is nitrogen and Y is carbon will be described below by the scheme 3 where BOC and CBZ represent t-butyloxycarbonyl group and benzyloxycarbonyl group respectively. The aldehyde represented by Formula 10 can be easily synthesized by the synthetic method reported by D. H. Rich et al. in J. Org. Chem. 43(18), 3624-3626 (1978). The aldehyde is treated with a suitable alcohol (methanol in this case) under the presence of an acid catalyst to derive the compound represented by Formula 11, whose benzyloxycarboxyl group is conventionally hydrogenolyzed to convert into the compound represented by Formula 12. The amine of Formula 12 can be conventionally condensed with t-butyloxycarbonylaminomalonic acid monoester to obtain the compound of Formula 13. The compound of Formula 13 can be ring-closed by using the synthetic method reported by H. Taguchi et al. in Peptide Chemistry, 169-172 (1994) to convert into the compound represented by Formula 14. The compound of Formula 14 is treated with a suitable base under the presence of an alkylating agent to obtain the compound of Formula 5 wherein X is nitrogen, Y is carbon, J is carbonyl group and L is ethoxy group. The carboxyl-protecting group of the compound thus obtained can be conventionally removed to derive easily the compound of Formula 5 wherein X is nitrogen, Y is carbon, J is carbonyl group and L is hydroxyl group as a key intermediate. The compound of Formula 3 wherein both X and Y are nitrogen as an intermediate, can be obtained according to a available pathway by synthesizing the compound of Formula 5 wherein both X and Y are nitrogen through the route as shown in the scheme 4, and then treating the synthesized compound in the similar way as described in the above (1) according to the scheme 2.

The amidolazone, without isolation and purification, can be reacted with diethylketomalonate under the presence of a suitable base for cyclizing to derive the compound of Formula 5 wherein X and Y is nitrogen respectively, J is carbonyl group and L is ethoxy group. The carboxyl-protecting group of the compound thus obtained can be conventionally hydrolyzed to convert the compound of Formula 3 wherein X and Y is nitrogen respectively, J is carbonyl group and L is hydroxyl group. The present invention includes the above intermediates and their synthesizing processes used for producing the compound of Formula 1. The compound of Formula 1 can be synthesized by the processes as described in the below (A)-(I). The intermediates having the same groups also can be produced by the analogous methods, as will be described later. The symbols and the groups used here have their respective same meanings as described above. (A) A synthesis by oxidizing the alcohol represented by Formula 2: An unprotected L group, if it is unstable under an oxidation condition, is preferably or necessarily protected in advance of the oxidation by substituting hydrogen atom of its amino group or hydroxyl group with an appropriate R 3 (excluding hydrogen) or R a (excluding hydrogen) which is then removed after oxidation. The simple method for oxidation is to use excess dimethylsulfoxide and water-soluble carbodiimide under the presence of pyridinium trifluoroacetate for a catalyst, for example, in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride around the room temperature, as shown in Example 2(7) mentioned later. The oxidation may be conducted by using oxalyl chloride, dimethylsulfoxide and a tertiary amine or by using pyridinium chlorochromate in methylene chloride. (B) A synthesis of the compound of Formula 1 having a free amino group, which comprises removing an amino-protecting group from the amino-protected compound of the Formula 1: (for example, for a synthesis of the Formula 1 wherein any one of R 3 and R a is hydrogen and the other is an alkyl group, any one of R 3 and R a is substituted with an amino-protecting group such as t-butoxycarbonyl group for the purpose of protection and activation of a primary amino group, and then the introduced amino-protecting group is removed.) Any conventional method for removing an amino-protecting group can be used provided that it gives no cleavage to the amide bonds in the compound of Formula 1. It includes removal of an amino-protecting group by treatment with a strong acid such as hydrogen chloride in an inert solvent such as 1,4-dioxane, or removal of an amino-protecting group by heating treatment in the coexistence of p-toluenesulfonic acid in methanol. (C) A synthesis of the compound of Formula 1 wherein R 3 is an acyl group: This compound can be obtained conventionally by acylating the amino group or the hydroxyl group of compound of Formula 1 wherein R 3 is hydrogen. A simple acylation method is to use an acid halide corresponding to the acyl group in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. Another useful method is to use a coupling agent for condensation reaction with a corresponding carboxylic acid. The coupling agent includes carbodiimides such as 1-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide. 1-hydroxybenzotriazole may be added for an auxiliary to the condensation reaction. (D) The compound of Formula 1 wherein R 1 or R 2 has COOR a or CONR b R c , or R 2 is COOR a or CONR b R c can be obtained by reacting(acylating) the compound of Formula 1 wherein R 1 or R 2 has COOH (or its reactive group) or R 2 is COOH(or its reactive group) with a compound having HOR a or HNR b R c corresponding to R a or R b R c . (E) The compound of Formula 1 wherein R 3 is sulfonyl group can be obtained by sulfonylating(sulfonylation reaction) the compound of Formula 1 having the primary amino group wherein R 3 is hydrogen with a corresponding sulfonyl chloride to said sulfonyl group. This reaction can be carried out at room temperature or under cooling on ice under the presence of a tertiary amine in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. If the desired sulfonyl chloride is not commercially available, it may be synthesized to use by a known method. (F) The compound of Formula 1 wherein R 3 is R a excluding hydrogen can be obtained by reacting (substituting) the compound of Formula 1 having the amine group or the hydroxyl group wherein R 3 is hydrogen with a compound represented by R a -M having an usual leaving group M such as halogen, methylsulfonyloxy group and trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy group. (G) The Formula (1) compound wherein at least one of R 1 , R 2 and L is an aryl group or a heteroaryl group whose ring has hydroxyl group as a substituent group can be obtained by cleaving (cleavage reaction) the corresponding alkyl ether or acyloxy ester bond of the compound of Formula 1 wherein at least one of R 1 , R 2 and L is an aryl group or a heteroaryl group whose ring has a lower alkoxy substituent group or a lower acyloxy substituent group. The simple method includes hydrolysis of the acyloxy group under an acidic or alkaline condition. (H) The compound of Formula 1 wherein R 1 or R 2 has a substituted carboxylic group, or R 2 is carboxylic group (R a in the group COOR a is hydrogen) can be obtained by removing the ester group from a corresponding ester compound which is a compound which said carboxyl group is protected. This reaction includes hydrolysis with an alkali such as sodium hydroxide, hydrogenolysis in the case of benzyl ester, and decomposition of t-butyl ester under an acid condition. (I) The compound of Formula 1 wherein R 3 in L is R b R c NCO or R b R c NCS, and R c is hydrogen can be obtained by reacting(acylating) the compound of Formula 1 having the amino group or the hydroxyl group with the corresponding isocyanate or thioisocyanate represented by R b NCO or R b NCS. The alcohol compound of the Formula 2 used for a material of the above (A) can be obtained by condensing the compound of Formula 3 with the compound of Formula 4 as mentioned above. The above (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (G), (H) and (I), which are the processes for producing the compound of Formula 1, can be similarly applied for producing analogous intermediate compounds having the same groups in Formula 2 or 3. A protective group is desirably in some cases used for all the synthetic steps described above. The protective group can be removed at the stage after the final product or the target compound is synthesized. As is evident to those skilled in the art, a series of processes leading from the starting material through the intermediates to the final product of the present invention may be modified by suitable consideration on a method for condensing or removing a protective group etc. A pharmacologically acceptable salt of the compound of Formula 1 includes: when the compound of Formula 1 is an acidic one, the alkali metal salt, the alkaline earth metal salt, the aluminum salt, the ammonium salt or the salt obtained by reacting with an organic base(such as N-methylpiperazine and morpholine) giving the pharmaceutically acceptable cation; when the compound of Formula 1 is a basic one, the acid-addition salt obtained by reacting with an acid(such as, sulfuric acid, formic acid and acetic acid) giving the pharmacologically acceptable anion.

Test Example Inhibitory activity on chymase It is known that chymase is present in tissues of various animals, and its isolation and purification methods are described in Anal. Biochem., 137, 449 (1984) and FEBS Letters, 323, 119 (1993). In the present invention, chymase was purified by the methods described in these literatures, and the present compounds were examined for inhibitory activity on human chymase or dog chymase. The specific methods are as follows: (A) Preparation of human chymase 60 g human tonsillar gland was finely divided by scissors and a scalpel, suspended in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), and disrupted by a Polytron homogenizer for 5 minutes to prepare a crude chymase enzyme solution. The solution was centrifuged at 22000g for 30 min, and the precipitate was used as a chymase enzyme fraction. The precipitate was washed by repeating the above procedure twice, and then suspended in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2 M sodium chloride and 5% ammonium sulfate. The suspension was centrifuged at 27000g for 20 min to give a supernatant as a chymase fraction. The supernatant was concentrated by ultrafiltration, applied to a G2000SW-XL column (6.0300 mm), and eluted with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). An active fraction decomposing succinyl leucyl leucyl valyl tyrosyl methylcoumarylamide (hereinafter referred to as the synthetic chymase substrate, made by Peptide Kenkyusho) was recovered, concentrated and used as a purified human chymase for the following activity measurement. (B) Preparation of dog chymase 60 g dog heart was finely divided by scissors and a scalpel, suspended in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), and disrupted by a Polytron homogenizer for 5 minutes to prepare a crude chymase enzyme solution. The solution was centrifuged at 22000g for 15 min, and the precipitate was used as a chymase enzyme fraction. The precipitate was washed by repeating the above procedure twice, and suspended in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2 M sodium chloride and 5% ammonium sulfate. The suspension was centrifuged at 27000g for 40 minutes to give a supernatant as a chymase fraction. The chymase fraction was concentrated by ultrafiltration to remove macromolecules, applied to a Superdex 200HR 10/30 column (10300 mm), and eluted with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). An active fraction decomposing the synthetic chymase substrate was recovered, concentrated, and used as a purified dog chymase for the following activity measurement. (C) Measurement of inhibitory activity on chymase The inhibitory activity on the human chymase and dog chymase was measured using angiotensin I (made by Peptide Kenkyusho) for a substrate. 200 l of 0.15 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mM angiotensin I, 0.0002 l of human or dog chymase solution and 2 l of a dimethylsulfoxide solution of the present compound were added into a 1.5 ml test tube and incubated at 37 C. for 15 min. At the end of the reaction, produced angiotensin II was immediately determined by high performance liquid chromatography before measuring the chymase activity to calculate 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50: nM). The test was conducted several times. Chymase was prepared for each test in the manner described above. The compounds prepared in the above-described Examples were used for the test. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50: nM) of each compound on chymase was calculated, and the results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The compounds tested are listed in Table 3.

No. 5,977,128 issued on Nov. 2, 1999), which in turn is a division of application Ser. No. 08/410, 479 filed Mar. 24, 1995 (now U.S. Pat. No. 5,721,236 issued Feb. 24, 1998), which in turn is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/312,030 filed on Sep. 26, 1994 (abandoned), which in turn is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/137,435 filed Oct. 15, 1993 (abandoned). BACKGROUND International Publication Number WO92/11034, published Jul. 9, 1992, discloses a method of increasing the sensitivity of a tumor to an antineoplastic agent, which tumor is resistant to the antineoplastic agent, by the concurrent administration of the antineoplastic agent and a potentiating agent of the formula: wherein the dotted line represents an optional double bond, X is hydrogen or halo, and Y is hydrogen, substituted carboxylate or substituted sulfonyl. For example, Y can be, amongst others, COOR wherein R is C1 to C6 alkyl or substituted alkyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl, C7 to C12 aralkyl or substituted aralkyl or -2, -3, or -4 piperidyl or N-substituted piperidyl. Y can also be, amongst others, SO 2 R wherein R is C1 to C6 alkyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl, C7 to C12 aralkyl or substituted aralkyl. Examples of such potentiating agents include 11-(4-piperidylidene)-5H-benzo5,6cyclohepta1,2-bpyridines such as Loratadine. Oncogenes frequently encode protein components of signal transduction pathways which lead to stimulation of cell growth and mitogenesis. Oncogene expression in cultured cells leads to cellular transformation, characterized by the ability of cells to grow in soft agar and the growth of cells as dense foci lacking the contact inhibition exhibited by non-transformed cells. Mutation and/or overexpression of certain oncogenes is frequently associated with human cancer. To acquire transforming potential, the precursor of the Ras oncoprotein must undergo farnesylation of the cysteine residue located in a carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide. Inhibitors of the enzyme that catalyzes this modification, farnesyl protein transferase, have therefore been suggested as anticancer agents for tumors in which Ras contributes to transformation. Mutated; oncogenic forms of ras are frequently found in many human cancers, most notably in more than 50% of colon and pancreatic carcinomas (Kohl et al., Science, Vol. 260, 1834 to 1837, 1993). In view of the current interest in inhibitors of farnesyl protein transferase, a welcome contribution to the art would be compounds useful for the inhibition of farnesyl protein transferase. Such a contribution is provided by this invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Inhibition of farnesyl protein transferase by tricyclic compounds of this invention has not been reported previously. Thus, this invention provides a method for inhibiting farnesyl protein transferase using tricyclic compounds of this invention which: (i) potently inhibit farnesyl protein transferase, but not geranylgeranyl protein transferase I, in vitro; (ii) block the phenotypic change induced by a form of transforming Ras which is a farnesyl acceptor but not by a form of transforming Ras engineered to be a geranylgeranyl acceptor; (iii) block intracellular processing of Ras which is a farnesyl acceptor but not of Ras engineered to be a geranylgeranyl acceptor; and (iv) block abnormal cell growth in culture induced by transforming Ras. One compound disclosed in this invention has been demonstrated to have anti-tumor activity in animal models. This invention provides a method for inhibiting the abnormal growth of cells, including transformed cells, by administering an effective amount of a compound of this invention. Abnormal growth of cells refers to cell growth independent of normal regulatory mechanisms (e.g., loss of contact inhibition). This includes the abnormal growth of: (1) tumor cells (tumors) expressing an activated Ras oncogene; (2) tumor cells in which the Ras protein is activated as a result of oncogenic mutation in another gene; and (3) benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant Ras activation occurs.

For example, the benign proliferative disorder neurofibromatosis, or tumors in which Ras is activated due to mutation or overexpression of tyrosine kinase oncogenes (e.g., neu, src, abl, lck, lyn, fyn), may be inhibited by the tricyclic compounds described herein. The compounds of this invention inhibit farnesyl protein transferase and the farnesylation of the oncogene protein Ras. This invention further provides a method of inhibiting ras farnesyl protein transferase, in mammals, especially humans, by the administration of an effective amount of the tricyclic compounds described above. The administration of the compounds of this invention to patients, to inhibit farnesyl protein transferase, is useful in the treatment of the cancers described above. The tricyclic compounds useful in the methods of this invention inhibit abnormal cellular growth. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that these compounds may function through the inhibition of G-protein function, such as ras p21, by blocking G-protein isoprenylation, thus making them useful in the treatment of proliferative diseases such as tumor growth and cancer. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that these compounds inhibit ras farnesyl protein transferase, and thus show antiproliferative activity against ras transformed cells.

No. 3,326,924 or alternatively may be prepared by a ring closure reaction, wherein the desired cycloheptene ring is formed by treating compound 425.00 with a super acid. Suitable super acids for this purpose include, for example, HF/BF 3 , CF 3 SO 3 H (triflic acid), CH 3 SO 3 H/BF 3 , etc. The reaction can be performed in the absence of, or with, an inert co-solvent such as CH 2 Cl 2 . The temperature and time of the reaction vary with the acid employed. For example, with HF/BF 3 as the super acid system the temperature may be controlled so as to minimize side reactions, such as HF addition to the exocyclic double bond. For this purpose, the temperature is generally in the range of from about 5 C. to 50 C. With CF 3 SO 3 H as the super acid system, the reaction may be run at elevated temperatures, e.g., from about 25 C. to about 150 C. and at lower temperatures but the reaction then takes longer to complete. Generally the super acid is employed in excess, preferably in amounts of from about 1.5 to about 30 equivalents. A ketone compound of Formula 425.00 may be formed by hydrolysis of 430.00, e.g., such as by reacting a Grignard intermediate of Formula 430.00 with an aqueous acid (e.g., aqueous HCl). I a in Formula 430.00 represents chloro, bromo or iodo. The Grignard intermediate 430.00 is formed by the reaction of the cyano compound 435.00 with an appropriate Grignard reagent 440.00 prepared from 1-alkyl-4halopiperidine. The reaction is generally performed in an inert solvent, such as ether, toluene, or THF, under general Grignard conditions e.g., temperature of from about 0 C. to about 75 C. Alternatively, other organometallic derivatives of the lalkyl-4-halo piperidine can be employed. The cyano compound of Formula 435.00 is produced by converting the tertiary butyl amide of Formula 445.00 with a suitable dehydrating agent, such as POCl 3 , SOCl 2 , P 2 O 5 , toluene sulfonyl chloride in pyridine, oxalyl chloride in pyridine, etc. This reaction can be performed in the absence of or with a co-solvent, such as xylene. The dehydrating agent such as POCl 3 is employed in equivalent amounts or greater and preferably in amounts of from about 2 to about 15 equivalents. Any suitable temperature and time can be employed for performing the reaction, but generally heat is added to accelerate the reaction. Preferably the reaction is performed at or near reflux. The tert-butylamide of Formula 445.00 may be produced by reaction of a compound of Formula 450.00a and 450.00b, in the presence of base, wherein G is chloro, bromo or iodo. The compound of Formula 450.00a may be formed by hydrolysis of the corresponding nitrile wherein the appropriate cyanomethyl pyridine, such as 2-cyano-3-pyridine, is reacted with a tertiary butyl compound in acid, such as concentrated H 2 SO 4 or concentrated H 2 SO 4 in glacial acetic acid. Suitable tertiary butyl compounds include, but are not limited to, t-butyl alcohol, t-butyl chloride, t-butyl bromide, t-butyl iodide, isobutylene or any other compound which under hydrolytic conditions forms t-butyl carboxamides with cyano compounds. The temperature of the reaction will vary depending upon the reactants, but generally the reaction is conducted in the range of from about 50 C. to about 100 C. with t-butyl alcohol. The reaction may be performed with inert solvents, but is usually run neat. An alternative process for the formation of compounds of Formula 400.00a may involve direct cyclization of Compound 455.00 as shown below. Cyclization to form the cycloheptene ring may be accomplished with a strong acid (e.g., triflic, polyphosphoric, HF/BF 3 ), and may be performed in an inert solvent, such as ether, toluene or THF. The temperature and time may vary with the acid employed, as described in process A above. Compounds of Formula 455.00 wherein ZO may be prepared by treating a compound of Formula 425.00 with an appropriate chloroformate (e.g. ethyl chloroformate) of formula 410.00 in the appropriate solvent, such as toluene, dioxane or xylene, and at a temperature ranging from 50-150 C., preferably 100-120 C. A second method of preparing compounds of Formula 455.00 involves reacting an unsubstituted piperidylidene compound of Formula 460.00 with the appropriate chloroformate (e.g., ethyl chloroformate) of Formula 410.00 in the presence of base, such as pyridine or Et 3 N. Compounds of Formula 460.00 may be produced from the corresponding carbamates of Formula 465.00, via acid hydrolysis, using for example, aqueous HCl, or base hydrolysis using for example, KOH. Alternatively, some compounds can be prepared by treating the carbamate, Formula 465.00, with an organometallic reagent, such as methyl lithium or a reductive reagent, such as Zn in acid, etc., depending upon the nature of the R a group. For example, if R a is a simple alkyl group, CO 2 R a may be cleaved by alkaline hydrolysis at 100 C. The carbamate compounds of Formula 465.00 may be prepared from the appropriate alkyl compound of Formula 425.00 by treatment with a chloroformate, preferably in an inert solvent, such as toluene, with warming to approximately 80 C. Other alternative methods are available for the conversion of 425.00 to 455.00 as previously described (e.g. Von Braun reaction conditions). Compounds of Formula 425.00 may be prepared as described above. SUBSTITUTION ON THE PYRIDINE RING Various methods can be used as described in WO 88/03138 to provide compounds which are substituted on the pyridine ring, i.e., in positions 2-, 3- and or 4-positions of the tricyclic ring system. For example, the cyclization methods described on pages 20-30 of WO 88/03138 can already have the appropriate substituents on the pyridine ring in place. A variety of substituted pyridines are known in the literature and can be employed in these syntheses. Alternatively, the azaketone of Formula XIX (from page 27 of WO 88/03138) wherein R 1 and R 2 are both H can be converted to the appropriately substituted azaketone wherein R 1 and R 2 are non-H substitutents. If both R 1 and R 2 are desired to be non-H substitutents the procedure would be repeated. The azaketone is thus reacted with an oxidizing agent such as MCPBA or H 2 O 2 to produce the corresponding compound in which the nitrogen of the pyridine ring is an N-oxide: wherein one of a, b, c or d is NO and the others are CH or CR 1 or CR 2 . This reaction is normally run at temperatures from 15 C. to reflux, more typically at about 0 C. The reaction is preferably conducted in an inert solvent such as CH 2 Cl 2 for MCPBA or acetic acid for hydrogen peroxide. The azaketone N-oxide of Formula 470.00a can then be reacted with a chlorinating agent such as SO 2 Cl 2 or SOCl 2 to form a compound of Formula 470.00b. Typically, this reaction results in monosubstitution of Cl in the ortho or para-position relative to the N atom of the ring. To provide the disubstituted products, steps 1 and 2 above are repeated Typically, the resulting disubstituted compounds have Cl ortho and para relative to the N atom of the pyridine ring. The mono or disubstituted compounds of Formulas 470.00b and 470.00c above can be reacted with various nucleophiles such as alkoxides, amines, thiols, etc. This will result in compounds where one or both of the Cl substituents are replaced by the nucleophile to provide a compound of Formula 470.00d or a compound easily converted to Formula 470.00d. The substituted ketone of Formula 470.00 can then be converted to the desired compound by the methods described above. Formula 405.00, wherein R 1 or R 2 are chlorine, can be made by the following alternate process. The N-oxide of Formula 415.00 can be treated with POCl 3 to form a 10 compound of Formula 415.01. Typically, this reaction results in mono-substitution of Cl in the ortho or para position relative to the N atom of the ring. The N-oxide of Formula 415.00 can be formed by oxidizing Formula 415.00 with a peroxyacid such as 4-chloroperoxybenzoic acid. Alternatively, the Cl substituted azaketones of formula 470.00b or 470.00c above can be converted to the corresponding derivatives of Formula 405.00 above wherein R 1 and/or R 2 is Cl by methods analogous to those described above. At this point the Cl substituent(s) can be displaced by an appropriate nucleophile to provide the desired substituent. Suitable nucleophiles include alkoxide, amines, thiols, etc. This reaction usually requires higher tempertures (e.g., from about 100 to about 200 C.) than the displacement reaction to produce ketone 470.00d above. It is also usually conducted in a sealed vessel in an inert solvent. The compound of Formula 405.00 is then converted to a compound of Formula 400.00 as described above. PREPARATION OF C5-C6-ENE DERIVATIVES Compounds of formula 400.00 with a double bond between C-5 and C-6 can be prepared by heating a compound of Formula 470.00h in acetic acid with SeO 2 to produce a compound of Formula 470.00i. Compounds of Formula 470.00i can be converted to final products according to methods already described. PREPARATION OF PIPERAZINE ANALOGS Compounds having a piperazine ring bound to the C-11 of the tricyclic nucleus, i.e., Formula 1.0 wherein X is N, are best prepared via alkylation of the appropriately substituted piperazine compound of Formula 700.00 with a compound of Formula 705.00. Compounds of Formula 705.00 contain the appropriately substituted halide (such as Cl, Br, or I) or other similar leaving group (e.g., tosyloxy or mesyloxy). The reaction is usually conducted in an inert solvent, such as THF or toluene, optionally with a base such as Et 3 N or K 2 CO 3 , and typically at a temperature range of ambient to reflux to produce a compound of Formula 710.00. In this reaction R g is H or CO 2 R a (wherein R a is a C 1 to C 4 alkyl group). The preparation of compound 705.00 wherein L is Cl is analogous to the procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,409,621. By methods known in the art compounds of Formula 710.00, wherein R g is CO 2 R a , can be converted to Formula 710.00 wherein R g is H, by acid or base hydrolysis as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,853. Compounds of formula 710.00, wherein R g is H, can be converted to compounds of Formula 400.00 by the process used to convert Formula 405.00 to Formula 400.00. Compounds of 410.00, wherein R is 3-pyridyloxy, can be prepared by reacting 3-hydroxy-pyridine with an excess of phosgene in toluene/CH 2 Cl 2 at 0 C. in the presence of a base such as pyridine. An alternate route for generating the compound of Formula 710.00 is by reductive amination of the aza ketone 715.00 with the piperazine 700.00 The reaction is typically carried out in a polar solvent, such as MeOH or EtOH, optionally in the presence of a dehydrating agent, such as 3 molecular sieves. The intermediate Schiff base can be reduced to the compound of Formula 710.00 by employing a variety of reducing agents, such as NaCNBH 3 , or catalytic hydrogenation, for example, hydrogen over Pd/C. When R g is C(Z)R, these are the compounds of the invention. An alternative process for introducing substituents at the C-3 position of pyridine Ring I of Formula 1.0, involves nitrating a compound of Formula 415.00 (except wherein X is nitrogen) or a compound of Formula 470.00d with tetrbutylammonium nitrateTFAA in CH 2 Cl 2 at a temperature of 0 C. to room temperature (about 25 C.). The nitro group may then be reduced to the corresponding amine using iron filings in ethanol, or powdered Zn-HOAc in aqueous THF. By methods known to those skilled in the art, the amine group can be converted to a variety of substituents, such as, halo, cyano, thio, hydroxyl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl and haloalkyl. Compounds of Formulas 1.2 and 1.3, wherein R 30 , R 40 , R 52 and R 70 represent a pyridyl N-oxide, can be produced by reacting compounds of Formulas 1.2, and 1.3, wherein R 30 , R 40 , R 52 and R 70 represent pyridyl, with one molar equivalent of an oxidizing agent (such as oxone). Compounds of Formula 1.1, wherein R 30 or R 70 represent a pyridyl N-oxide, can be produced by reacting a compound of the formula (XI) with phosgene in the presence of a suitable base, such as pyridine, to form a compound of the formula (XII), which is then reacted with the approriate hydroxypyridine N-oxide or mercaptopyridine N-oxide. Alternatively, compounds of Formula 1.1, wherein R 30 or R 70 represent a pyridyl N-oxide, can be produced by reacting a compound of the formula (XI) with carbonyldiimidazole to form a compound of the formula (XIII) which is reacted with the approriate hydroxypyridine N-oxide (or mercaptopyridine N-oxide) in the presence of either ZnBr 2 or NaH. Various electrophilic species can also be added to the pyridine ring from the corresponding halo-substituted pyridine (Formula 405.00 wherein R 1 is halo, preferably bromo or iodo). Transmetallation of the halo derivative using an alkyl lithium (e.g. n-BuLi) provides the lithio derivative, which can then be quenched with the appropriate electrophile (e.g. R 1 L, etc.). Also, the halogens can be displaced with nucleophiles, such as HOBT, to give compounds with substituents in the pyridine ring. In the above processes, it is sometimes desirable and/or necessary to protect certain R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 etc., groups during the reactions. Conventional protecting groups are operable as described in Greene, T. W., Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis, John Wiley Sons, New York, 1981. For example, the groups listed in column 1 of Table 1 may be protected as indicated in column 2 of the table: TABLE 1 PROTECTED GROUPS 1. GROUP TO BE PROTECTED 2. PROTECTED GROUP COOH COOalkyl, COObenzyl, COOphenyl, OH OCH 2 phenyl 2 , OCH 3 , OSi(CH 3 ) 2 (t-Bu), NHR, wherein R is any substituent on an amino group within the scope of the claims NRCOCF 3 , NRCOCH 3 , NH 2 NHC(O)O(t-Bu) Other protecting groups well known in the art also may be used. After the reaction or reactions, the protecting groups may be removed by standard procedures. Compounds useful in this invention are exemplified by the following preparative examples, which should not be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure. Alternative mechanistic pathways and analogous structures within the scope of the invention may be apparent to those skilled in the art. PREPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1 A.

In vitro enzyme assays: Inhibition of farnesyl protein transferase and geranylgeranyl protein transferase. Both farnesyl protein transferase (FPT) and geranylgeranyl protein transferase (GGPT) I were partially purified from rat brain by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia, Inc.) anion exchange chromatography essentially as described by Yokoyama et al (Yokoyama, K., et al., (1991), A protein geranylgeranyltransferase from bovine brain: Implications for protein prenylation specificity, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 88: 5302-5306, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto). Human farnesyl protein transferase was also expressed in E. coli , using cDNA clones encoding both the and subunits. The methods used were similar to those published (Omer, C. et al., (1993), Characterization of recombinant human farnesyl protein transferase: Cloning, expression, farnesyl diphosphate binding, and functional homology with yeast prenyl-protein transferases, Biochemistry 32:5167-5176). Human farnesyl protein transferase was partially-purified from the soluble protein fraction of E. coli as described above the tricyclic farnesyl protein transferase inhibitors disclosed herein inhibited both human and rat enzyme with similar potencies. Two forms of val 12 -Ha-Ras protein were prepared as substrates for these enzymes, differing in their carboxy terminal sequence. One form terminated in cysteine-valine-leucine-serine (Ras-CVLS) the other in cystein-valine-leucine-leucine (Ras-CVLL). Ras-CVLS is a substrate for the farnesyl protein transferase while Ras-CVLL is a substrate for geranylgeranyl protein transferase I. The cDNAs encoding these proteins were constructed so that the proteins contain an amino-terminal extension of 6 histidine residues. Both proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using metal chelate affinity chromatography. The radiolabelled isoprenyl pyrophosphate substrates, 3 Hfarnesyl pyrophosphate and 3 Hgeranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, were purchased from DuPont/New England Nuclear. Several methods for measuring farnesyl protein transferase activity have been described (Reiss et al 1990 , Cell 62: 81; Schaber et al 1990 , J. Biol. Chem . 265: 14701; Manne et al 1990 , PNAS 87: 7541; and Barbacid Manne 1993, U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,248). The activity was assayed by measuring the transfer of 3 Hfarnesyl from 3 Hfarnesyl pyrophosphate to Ras-CVLS using conditions similar to those described by Reiss et al. 1990 ( Cell 62: 81) The reaction mixture contained 40 mM Hepes, pH 7.5; 20 mM MgCl 2 ; 5 mM dithiothreitol; 0.25 M 3 Hfarnesyl pyrophosphate; 10 l Q-Sepharose-purified farnesyl protein transferase; the indicated concentration of tricyclic compound or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle control (5% DMSO final); and 5 M Ras-CVLS in a total volume of 100 l. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 minutes at room temperature and then stopped with 0.5 ml of 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) followed by 0.5 ml of cold 30% trichloracetic acid (TCA). Samples were allowed to sit on ice for 45 minutes and precipitated Ras protein was then collected on GF/C filter paper mats using a Brandel cell harvester. Filter mats were washed once with 6% TCA, 2% SDS and radioactivity was measured in a Wallac 1204 Betaplate BS liquid scintillation counter. Percent inhibition was calculated relative to the DMSO vehicle control. The geranylgeranyl protein transferase I assay was essentially identical to the farnesyl protein transferase assay described above, with two exceptions: 3 Hgeranylgeranylpyrophosphate replaced farnesyl pyrophosphate as the isoprenoid donor and Ras-CVLL was the protein acceptor. This is similar to the assay reported by Casey et al (Casey, P. J., et al., (1991), Enzymatic modification of proteins with a geranylgeranyl 35 isoprenoid, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA 88: 8631-8635, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto). 2. Cell-Based Assay: Transient expression of val 12 -Ha-Ras-CVLS and val 12 -Ha-Ras-CVLL in COS monkey kidney cells: Effect of farnesyl protein transferase inhibitors on Ras processing and on disordered cell growth induced by transforming Ras. COS monkey kidney cells were transfected by electroporation with the plasmid pSV-SPORT (Gibco/BRL) containing a CDNA insert encoding either Ras-CVLS or Ras-CVLL, leading to transient overexpression of a Ras substrate for either farnesyl protein transferase or geranylgeranyl protein transferase I, respectively (see above). Following electroporation, cells were plated into 6-well tissue culture dishes containing 1.5 ml of Dulbeccos-modified Eagles media (GIBCO, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and the appropriate farnesyl protein transferase inhibitors. After 24 hours, media was removed and fresh media containing the appropriate drugs was re-added. 48 hours after electroporation cells were examined under the microscope to monitor disordered cell growth induced by transforming Ras. Cells expressing transforming Ras become more rounded and refractile and overgrow the monolayer, reminiscent of the transformed phenotype. Cells were then photographed, washed twice with 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and removed from the dish by scraping with a rubber policeman into 1 ml of a buffer containing 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0; 1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid; 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 50 M leupeptin; and 0.1 M pepstatin. Cells were lysed by homogenization and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 2000g for 10 min. Cellular protein was precipitated by addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid and redissolved in 100 gl of SDS-electrophoresis sample buffer. Samples (5-10 l) were loaded onto 14% polyacrylamide minigels (Novex, Inc.) and electrophoresed until the tracking dye neared the bottom of the gel. Proteins resolved on the gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes for immunodetection. Membranes were blocked by incubation overnight at 4 C. in PBS containing 2.5% dried milk and 0.5% Tween-20 and then incubated with a Ras-specific monoclonal antibody, Y13-259 (Furth, M. E., et al., (1982), Monoclonal antibodies to the p21 products of the transforming gene of Harvey murine sarcome virus and of the cellular ras gene family, J. Virol . 43: 294-304), in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum for one hour at room temperature. After washing, membranes were incubated for one hour at room temperature with a 1:5000 dilution of secondary antibody, rabbit anti-rat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum. The presence of processed and unprocessed Ras-CVLS or Ras-CVLL was detected using a colorimetric peroxidase reagent (4-chloro-1-naphthol) as described by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). 3. Cell Mat Assay: Normal human HEPM fibroblasts were planted in 3.5 cm dishes at a density of 510 4 cells/dish in 2 ml growth medium, and incubated for 3-5 d to achieve confluence. Medium was aspirated from each dish and the indicator tumor cells, T24-BAG4 human bladder carcinoma cells expressing an activated H-ras gene, were planted on top of the fibroblast monolayer at a density of 210 3 cells/dish in 2 ml growth medium, and allowed to attach overnight. Compound-induced colony inhibition was assayed by addition of serial dilutions of compound directly to the growth medium 24 h after tumor cell planting, and incubating cells for an additional 14 d to allow colony formation. Assays were terminated by rinsing monolayers twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixing the monolayers with a 1% glutaraldehyde solution in PBS, then visualizing tumor cells by staining with X-Gal (Price, J., et al., Lineage analysis in the vertebrate nervous system by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.84, 156-160(1987)). In the colony inhibition assay, compounds were evaluated on the basis of two IC 50 values: the concentration of drug required to prevent the increase in tumor cell number by 50% (tIC 50 ) and the concentration of drug required to reduce the density of cells comprising the cell mat by 50% (mIC 50 ). Both IC 50 values were obtained by determining the density of tumor cells and mat cells by visual inspection and enumeration of cells per colony and the number of colonies under the microscope. The therapeutic index of the compound was quantitatively expressed as the ratio of mIC 50 /tIC 50 , with values greater than one indicative of tumor target specificity.

Enzymology: The data demonstrate that the compounds of the invention are inhibitors of Ras-CVLS farnesylation by partially purified rat and human brain farnesyl protein transferase (FPT). The data also show that there are compounds of the invention which can be considered as potent (IC 50 10 M) inhibitors of Ras-CVLS farnesylation by partially purified rat brain farnesyl protein transferase (FPT)see Table 3. The data also demonstrate that compounds of the invention are poorer inhibitors of geranylgeranyl protein transferase (GGPT) assayed using Ras-CVLL as isoprenoid acceptor. Tested compounds were inactive or weakly active as geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors at 20 g/ml. For example, compound 500.00 inhibits GGPT 7% at 50 M and is at least 31-fold selective for FPT inhibition. For another example, Compound 530.00 is inactive against GGPT at 49 M and is at least 13-fold selective for FPT inhibition. This selectivity is important for the therapeutic potential of the compounds used in the methods of this invention, and increases the potential that the compounds will have selective growth inhibitory properties against Ras-transformed cells. 2. Cell-Based: COS Cell and Cell Mat Assays Immunoblot analysis of the Ras protein expressed in Ras-transfected COS cells indicated that the farnesyl transferase inhibitors of this invention inhibit Ras-CVLS processing, causing accumulation of unprocessed Ras (Table 3). For example, compounds 500.00 and 530.00 inhibit Ras-CVLS processing with IC 50 values of 22 and 15.4 M, respectively. These results show that the compounds inhibit farnesyl protein transferase in intact cells and indicate their potential to block cellular transformation by activated Ras oncogenes. Microscopic and photographic examination of the Ras-transfected COS cells following treatment with compound 530.00 indicated that they also blocked phenotypic changes induced by expression of oncogenic Ras. Cells expressing oncogenicRas-CVLS overgrew the monolayer and formed dense foci of cells. This response to oncogenic Ras-CVLS was inhibited by compound 530.00 at both 20 and 6.6 g/ml. Compounds of this invention also inhibited the growth of Ras-transformed tumor cells in the Mat assay. For example, compound 530.00 inhibited with an IC 50 value of 12.5 M. This compound only displayed cytotoxic activity against the normal cell monolayer at higher concentrations (IC 50 of 100 M). Some compounds tested in this assay had little (515.00, 612.00, 614.00, 618.00 and 642.00) or no (500.00) selective antiproliferative activity against Ras-transformed cells versus normal cells. In Vivo Anti-Tumor Studies: Tumor cells (510 5 to 810 6 of M27 mouse Lewis lung carcinoma, A431 human epidermal carcinoma or SW620 human colon adenocarcinoma (lymph node metastasis)) are innoculated subcutaneously into the flank of 5-6 week old athymic nu/nu female mice. For the C-f-1 mouse fibroblast transformed with c-fos oncogene tumor model, 2 mm 3 tumor fragments are transplanted subcutaneously into the flank of 5-6 week old athymic nu/nu female mice. Tumor bearing animals are selected and randomized when the tumors are established. Animals are treated with vehicle (beta cyclodextran for i.p. or corn oil for p.o.) only or compounds in vehicle twice a day (BID) for 5 (1-5) or 7 (1-7) days per week for 2 (2) or 4 (4) weeks. The percent inhibition of tumor growth relative to vehicle controls are determined by tumor measurements. The results are reported in Table 5. TABLE 5 In-Vivo Anti-Tumor Results s.c.

These compounds are useful in treating or preventing conditions mediated by nuclear receptors, in particular the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPAR). CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 of U.S. provisional application no. 60/106,659 filed Nov. 2, 1998 and Danish application no. PA 1998 01355 filed Oct. 21, 1998, the contents of which are fully incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, methods for preparing the compounds and their use as medicaments. More specifically, compounds of the invention can be utilized in the treatment of conditions mediated by nuclear receptors, in particular the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPAR). The present compounds reduce blood glucose and triglyceride levels and are accordingly useful for the treatment of ailments and disorders such as diabetes and obesity. The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the above said novel compounds, their derivatives, their analogs, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The compounds are useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes), impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, disorders related to Syndrome X such as hypertension, obesity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular disorders. The compounds of the present invention are also useful for the treatment of certain renal diseases including glomerulonephritis, glomerulosclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, hypertensive nephrosclerosis. These compounds may also be useful for improving cognitive functions in dementia, treating diabetic complications, psoriasis, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and prevention and treatment of bone loss, e.g. osteoporosis. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the major cause of death in type 2 diabetic and metabolic syndrome patients (i.e. patients that fall within the deadly quartet category of impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia and/or obesity). The hypolipidemic fibrates and antidiabetic thiazolidinediones separately display moderately effective triglyceride-lowering activities although they are neither potent nor efficacious enough to be a single therapy of choice for the dyslipidemia often observed in type 2 diabetic or metabolic syndrome patients. The thiazolidinediones also potently lower circulating glucose levels of type 2 diabetic animal models and humans. However, the fibrate class of compounds are without beneficial effects on glycemia. Studies on the molecular actions of these compounds indicate that thiazolidinediones and fibrates exert their action by activating distinct transcription factors of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) family, resulting in increased and decreased expression of specific enzymes and apolipoproteins respectively, both key-players in regulation of plasma triglyceride content. Fibrates, on the one hand, are PPAR activators, acting primarily in the liver. Thiazolidinediones, on the other hand, are high affinity ligands for PPAR acting primarily on adipose tissue. Adipose tissue plays a central role in lipid homeostasis and the maintenance of energy balance in vertebrates. Adipocytes store energy in the form of triglycerides during periods of nutritional affluence and release it in the form of free fatty acids at times of nutritional deprivation. The development of white adipose tissue is the result of a continuous differentiation process throughout life. Much evidence points to the central role of PPAR activation in initiating and regulating this cell differentiation. Several highly specialized proteins are induced during adipocyte differentiation, most of them being involved in lipid storage and metabolism. The exact link from activation of PPAR to changes in glucose metabolism, most notably a decrease in insulin resistance in muscle, has not yet been clarified. A possible link is via free fatty acids such that activation of PPAR induces Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL), Fatty Acid Transport Protein (FATP) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase (ACS) in adipose tissue but not in muscle tissue. This, in turn, reduces the concentration of free fatty acids in plasma dramatically, and due to substrate competition at the cellular level, skeletal muscle and other tissues with high metabolic rates eventually switch from fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation with decreased insulin resistance as a consequence. PPAR is involved in stimulating -oxidation of fatty acids. In rodents, a PPAR-mediated change in the expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism lies at the basis of the phenomenon of peroxisome proliferation, a pleiotropic cellular response, mainly limited to liver and kidney and which can lead to hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents. The phenomenon of peroxisome proliferation is not seen in man. In addition to its role in peroxisome proliferation in rodents, PPAR is also involved in the control of HDL cholesterol levels in rodents and humans. This effect is, at least partially, based on a PPAR-mediated transcriptional regulation of the major HDL apolipoproteins, apo A-I and apo A-II. The hypotriglyceridemic action of fibrates and fatty acids also involves PPAR and can be summarized as follows: (I) an increased lipolysis and clearance of remnant particles, due to changes in lipoprotein lipase and apo C-II levels, (II) a stimulation of cellular fatty acid uptake and their subsequent conversion to acyl-CoA derivatives by the induction of fatty acid binding protein and acyl-CoA synthase, (III) an induction of fatty acid b-oxidation pathways, (IV) a reduction in fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis, and finally (V) a decrease in VLDL production. Hence, both enhanced catabolism of triglyceride-rich particles as well as reduced secretion of VLDL particles constitutes mechanisms that contribute to the hypolipidemic effect of fibrates. A number of compounds have been reported to be useful in the treatment of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia (U.S. Pat. No. 5,306,726,PCT Publications nos. WO91/19702, WO 95/03038, WO 96/04260, WO 94/13650, WO 94/01420, WO 97/36579, WO 97/25042, WO 95/17394, WO 99/08501, WO 99/19313 and WO 99/16758). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It seems more and more apparent that glucose lowering as a single approach does not overcome the macrovascular complications associated with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Novel treatments of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome must therefore aim at lowering both the overt hypertriglyceridemia associated with these syndromes as well as alleviation of hyperglycemia. The clinical activity of fibrates and thiazolidinediones indicates that research for compounds displaying combined PPAR and PPAR activation should lead to the discovery of efficacious glucose and triglyceride lowering drugs that have great potential in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome (i.e. impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia and/or obesity).

PHARMACOLOGICAL METHODS In Vitro PPAR Alpha and PPAR Gamma Activation Activity Principle The PPAR gene transcription activation assays were based on transient transfection into human HEK293 cells of two plasmids encoding a chimeric test protein and a reporter protein respectively. The chimeric test protein was a fusion of the DNA binding domain (DBD) from the yeast GAL4 transcription factor to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the human PPAR proteins. The PPAR LBD harbored in addition to the ligand binding pocket also the native activation domain (activating function 2AF2) allowing the fusion protein to function as a PPAR ligand dependent transcription factor. The GAL4 DBD will force the fusion protein to bind only to Gal4 enhancers (of which none existed in HEK293 cells). The reporter plasmid contained a Gal4 enhancer driving the expression of the firefly luciferase protein. After transfection, HEK293 cells expressed the GAL4-DBD-PPAR-LBD fusion protein. The fusion protein will in turn bind to the Gal4 enhancer controlling the luciferase expression, and do nothing in the absence of ligand. Upon addition to the cells of a PPAR ligand, luciferase protein will be produced in amounts corresponding to the activation of the PPAR protein. The amount of luciferase protein is measured by light emission after addition of the appropriate substrate. Methods Cell culture and transfection: HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM10% FCS, 1% PS. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates the day before transfection to give a confluency of 80% at transfection. 0.8 g DNA per well was transfected using FuGene transfection reagent according to the manufacturers instructions (Boehringer-Mannheim). Cells were allowed to express protein for 48 h followed by addition of compound. Plasmids: Human PPAR and was obtained by PCR amplification using cDNA templates from liver, intestine and adipose tissue respectively. Amplified cDNAs were cloned into pCR2.1 and sequenced. The LBD from each isoform PPAR was generated by PCR (PPAR: aa 167-C-term; PPAR: aa 165-C-term) and fused to GAL4-DBD by subcloning fragments in frame into the vector pM1 generating the plasmids pM1LBD and pM1LBD. Ensuing fusions were verified by sequencing. The reporter was constructed by inserting an oligonucleotide encoding five repeats of the Gal4 recognition sequence into the pGL2 vector (Promega). Compounds: All compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted 1:1000 upon addition to the cells. Cells were treated with compound (1:1000 in 200 l growth medium including delipidated serum) for 24 h followed by luciferase assay. Luciferase assay: Medium including test compound was aspirated and 100 l PBS incl. 1 mM Mg and Ca was added to each well. The luciferase assay was performed using the LucLite kit according to the manufacturers instructions (Packard Instruments). Light emission was quantified by counting SPC mode on a Packard Instruments top-counter.

PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE COMPOUNDS OF THE INVENTION EXAMPLE 41 In vitro Proliferation This test makes it possible to measure the anti-proliferative power of a compound in vitro by determining the concentration of product which inhibits cell growth by 50% when compared with untreated control cells (IC 50 ). This is a calorimetric test based on cleavage, by reduction with the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase of live cells, of a soluble tetrazolium salt, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, or MTT, into purple formazan crystals which are insoluble in the culture medium. In order to ensure that they adhere fully, the cells are inoculated at a density of 625 cells per well in 96-well plates, 24 hours before being incubated at 37 C., continuously and in the presence of a range of concentrations of the test product. After four periods of doubling of the cell population (determined after studying the line growth kinetics), the live cells are stained with MTT ({fraction (1/10)}th of the volume of medium is added to the wells, solution containing 5 mg/ml in PBS) for 4 hours at 37 C. At the end of this incubation, a volume equal to that of the well of a solution of SDS is added (20% SDS, 50% dimethylformamide in water, pH 4.7) which, after exposure overnight, dissolves the formazan crystals. The optical density of the medium is then measured at 540 nm by a Titertek multiscan MCC plate reader (Labsystem). Calibration curves were produced for each of the lines from cells inoculated at increasing densities, and made it possible to establish a linear relationship between the number of live cells and the optical density read. The lines used in this test are: the line LLC: Lewis lung carcinoma of murine origin, the line HT-29: colon carcinoma of human origin. The results obtained on these two lines show that the compounds of the invention have very strong anti-proliferative power. By way of example, the IC 50 of the compound of Example 22 is equal to 53.60 nM on the LLC line and equal to 1.4 nM on the HT-29 line. EXAMPLE 42 In vivo Antitumor Activity The antitumor activity of the compounds of the invention was studied in Nude mice. Fragments of human epidermoid carcinoma KB-3-1 were grafted subcutaneously onto 4- to 6-week-old Nude Swiss female mice weighing from 20 to 22 g. When the tumors reach a diameter of about 6 mm, the mice are divided among the corntrol group and the treated group (7 mice per group) so as to obtain an identical average tumor volume in each of the groups. The test product is administered via the i.v. route; 1 injection per day for 5 days. The tumors are measured twice a week and the tumor volume is calculated according to the formula: volume(lengthwidth 2 )/2. The antitumor activity is evaluated by virtue of 2 parameters: the average T/C, expressed as a percentage, and the SGD (specific growth delay). Average T/C (%) at a time t100(Vt/V0) average treated/(Vt/V0) average control with Tt: tumor volume at time t; V0: tumor volume at the start of the treatment. SGD(Td treatedTd control)/Td control with Tdaverage doubling time of the tumor. The results obtained with the products of the invention shovw that they strongly inhibit tumor growth. By way of example, the compound of Example 1, administeL-ed at a dose of 15 mg/kg via the i.v. route for 5 days, gives the following results: 14 days after the start of the treatment, the average T/C is 26% (thus 74% inhibition) and the SGD is 1.3. Furthermore, the treatment does not cause any weight loss and it is thus well tolerated.

The reaction of a corresponding reactive carboxylic or sulphonic acid such as the esters, imidazolides or halides thereof with a corresponding amine is preferably carried out in a corresponding amine as solvent, optionally in the presence of another solvent such as methylene chloride or ether and preferably in the presence of a tertiary organic base such as triethylamine, N-ethyl-diisopropylamine or N-methyl-morpholine at temperatures between 0 and 150 C., preferably at temperatures between 50 and 100 C. In the reactions described hereinbefore, any reactive groups present such as hydroxy, carboxy, amino, alkylamino or imino groups may be protected during the reaction by conventional protecting groups which are cleaved again after the reaction. For example, a protecting group for a hydroxy group may be a trimethylsilyl, acetyl, benzoyl, tert.butyl, trityl, benzyl or tetrahydropyranyl group, protecting groups for a carboxy group may be a trimethylsilyl, methyl, ethyl, tert.butyl, benzyl or tetrahydropyranyl group and protecting groups for an amino, alkylamino or imino group may be an acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzoyl, ethoxycarbonyl, tert.butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, benzyl, methoxybenzyl or 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl group and additionally, for the amino group, a phthalyl group. Any protecting group used is optionally subsequently cleaved for example by hydrolysis in an aqueous solvent, e.g. in water, isopropanol/water, tetrahydrofuran/water or dioxan/water, in the presence of an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid or in the presence of an alkali metal base such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide or by ether splitting, e.g. in the presence of iodotrimethylsilane, at temperatures between 0 and 100 C., preferably at temperatures between 10 and 50 C. However, a benzyl, methoxybenzyl or benzyloxycarbonyl group is cleaved, for example, hydrogenolytically, e.g. with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium/charcoal in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide, dimethylformamide/acetone or glacial acetic acid, optionally with the addition of an acid such as hydrochloric acid at temperatures between 0 and 50 C., but preferably at ambient temperature, and at a hydrogen pressure of 1 to 7 bar, but preferably 3 to 5 bar. A tert.butyl or tert.butyloxycarbonyl group is preferably cleaved by treating with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid or hydrochloric acid, optionally using a solvent such as methylene chloride, dioxan or ether. Moreover, the compounds of general formula I obtained may be resolved into their enantiomers and/or diastereomers. Thus, for example, the compounds of general formula I obtained which occur as racemates may be separated by methods known per se (cf. Allinger N. L. and Eliel E. L. in Topics in Stereochemistry, Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971) into their optical antipodes and compounds of general formula I with at least 2 asymmetric carbon atoms may be resolved into their diastereomers on the basis of their physical-chemical differences using methods known per se, e.g. by chromatography and/or fractional crystallisation, and, if these compounds are obtained in racemic form, they may subsequently be resolved into the enantiomers as mentioned above. The enantiomers are preferably separated by column separation on chiral phases or by recrystallisation from an optically active solvent or by reacting with an optically active substance which forms salts or derivatives such as e.g. esters or amides with the racemic compound, particularly acids and the activated derivatives or alcohols thereof, and separating the diastereomeric mixture of salts or derivatives thus obtained, e.g. on the basis of their differences in solubility, whilst the free antipodes may be released from the pure diastereomeric salts or derivatives by the action of suitable agents. Optically active acids in common use are e.g. the D- and L-forms of tartaric acid or dibenzoyltartaric acid, di-o-to-lyltartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, camphorsulphonic acid, glutamic acid, aspartic acid or quinic acid. An optically active alcohol may be for example () or ()-menthol and an optically active acyl group in amides, for example, may be a ()- or ()-menthyloxycarbonyl. Furthermore, the compounds of formula I may be converted into the salts thereof, particularly for pharmaceutical use into their physiologically acceptable salts with inorganic or organic acids. Acids which may be used for this purpose include for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid or methanesulphonic acid. Moreover, if the new compounds of formula I contain a carboxy group, they may subsequently, if desired, be converted into the salts thereof with inorganic or organic bases, particularly for pharmaceutical use into the physiologically acceptable salts thereof. Suitable bases for this purpose include for example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, arginine, cyclohexylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine. The compounds of general formulae II to XVIII used as starting materials are obtained by methods known from the literature or are known from the literature. Thus, for example, a compound of general formula II may be obtained by hydrogenation of a corresponding unsaturated compound and a starting compound of general formulae V, VII, IX, X, XI and XIV by alkylation or acylation of a compound of general formula II thus obtained. As already mentioned hereinbefore, the new compounds of general formula I and the salts thereof have valuable properties. Thus, the compounds of general formula I wherein R b denotes a hydrogen atom, a nitro or cyano group are valuable intermediate products for preparing the other compounds of general formula I, and the compounds of general formula I wherein R b denotes one of the abovementioned optionally substituted aminomethyl or amidino groups, and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof have valuable pharmacological properties, particularly a thrombin-inhibiting activity and an inhibitory effect on thrombocyte aggregation, an activity which extends the thrombin time and an inhibiting effect on related serine proteases such as, for example, trypsin, plasmin, urokinase factor VIIa, factor Xa, factor IX, factor XI and factor XII. For example, the compounds A1-3-(4-amidinophenyl)propionyl-6-butylsulphonamido-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline-hydrochloride, B1-3-(4-amidino-phenyl)-propionyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline-6-carboxylic acid -methyl-N-phenyl-amide, C1-3-(4-amidino-phenyl)-propionyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline-6-carboxylic acid-diethylamide, DN-benzyl-N-1-3-(4-amidino-phenyl)-propionyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline-6-yl-acetamide, E(1-3-(4-amidino-phenyl)-propionyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline-6-carbonyl-phenyl-amino)-acetic acid, F1-3-(4-amidino-phenyl)propionyl-6-phenylsulphonamido-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline-hydrochloride, G(i) 1-3-(4-amidino-phenyl)propionyl-6-(N-carboxymethyl-phenylsulphonamido)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline, H1-3-(4-amidino-phenyl)-propionyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline-6-yl-(naphthalin-1-sulphonyl)-amino-acetic acid and I1-3-(4-amidino-phenyl)-propionyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline-6-yl-(quinoline-8-sulphonyl)-amino-acetic acid were investigated for their effect on the thrombin time as follows: Material: Plasma, from human citrated blood. Test thrombin (bovine), 30 U/ml, Behring Werke, Marburg Diethylbarbiturate acetate buffer, ORWH 60/61, Behring Werke, Marburg Biomatic B10 coagulometer, Sarstedt Method The thrombin time was determined using a Biomatic B10 coagulometer made by Messrs Sarstedt. The test substance was added to the test vessels prescribed by the manufacturer with 0.1 ml of human citrate plasma and 0.1 ml of diethylbarbiturate buffer (DBA buffer). The mixture was incubated for one minute at 37 C. The clotting reaction was started by the addition of 0.3 U of test thrombin in 0.1 ml of DBA buffer. Because of the design of the apparatus, the time taken for the mixture to clot was measured as the thrombin was added. Mixtures to which 0.1 ml of DBA buffer had been added were used as controls. According to the definition the effective concentration of substance at which the thrombin time was double that of the control was determined by means of a dosage/activity curve. The following Table contains the values found: Thrombin time Substance (ED 200 in M) A 0.08 B 0.02 C 0.10 D 0.05 E 0.04 F 0.04 G 0.03 H 0.02 I 0.03 Moreover, no toxic side effects could be detected in rats when the above compounds were administered in a dosage of 20 mg/kg i.v. or 100 mg/kg p.o. The compounds are therefore well tolerated. In view of their pharmacological properties the new compounds and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof are suitable for the prevention and treatment of venous and arterial thrombotic diseases, such as for example the treatment of deep leg vein thrombosis, for preventing reocclusions after bypass operations or angioplasty (PT(C)A), and occlusion in peripheral arterial diseases such as pulmonary embolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, for preventing coronary thrombosis, stroke and the occlusion of shunts. In addition, the compounds according to the invention are suitable for antithrombotic support in thrombolytic treatment, such as for example with rt-PA or streptokinase, for preventing long-tern restenosis after PT(C)A, for preventing metastasis and the growth of clot-dependent tumours and fibrin-dependent inflammatory processes. The dosage required to achieve such an effect is appropriately 0.1 to 50 mg/kg, preferably 0.5 to 30 mg/kg by intravenous route, and 1 to 100 mg/kg, preferably 0.5 to 50 mg/kg by oral route, in each case administered 1 to 4 times a day. For this purpose, the compounds of formula I prepared according to the invention may be formulated, optionally together with other active substances, with one or more inert conventional carriers and/or diluents, e.g. with corn starch, lactose, glucose, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, citric acid, tartaric acid, water, water/ethanol, water/glycerol, water/sorbitol, water/polyethyleneglycol, propyleneglycol, cetylstearyl alcohol, carboxymethylcellulose or fatty substances such as hard fat or suitable mixtures thereof, to produce conventional galenic preparations such as plain or coated tablets, capsules, powders, suspensions or suppositories.

This application is the national phase of international application PCT/DK98/00199 filed May 15, 1998 now WO98/54,146 which designated the U.S. This invention relates to a hitherto unknown class of compounds which shows strong activity in inhibiting undesirable cell proliferation of e.g. skin cells and cancer cells, to pharmaceutical preparations containing these compounds, to dosage units of such preparations, and to their use in the treatment and prophylaxis of diseases characterized by abnormal cell differentiation and/or cell proliferation such as e.g. psoriasis and cancer. The compounds of the present invention are represented by the general formula I or their tautomeric forms, the attachment to the pyridine ring being in the 3- or 4-position, in which formula R stands for one or more substituents which can be the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of: hydrogen, halogen, trifluoromethyl, C 1 -C 4 alkyl, alkoxy or alkyloxycarbonyl, nitro, amino or cyano and X stands for direct bonding, substituted C 3 -C 7 cydoalkylene, divalent heterocyclic ring (with one or more nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur), arylene, oxygen, one or two sulfur or amino which can be substituted by hydrogen or C 1 -C 4 alkyl; and Q 1 and Q 2 stands for C 1 -C 10 divalent hydrocarbon radical which can be straight, branched, cyclic, saturated or unsaturated. If the present compounds contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms, these compounds may form optical isomers or diastereoisomers. The present invention also comprises such isomers, and mixtures of same. The present salts of the compounds of formula I may be formed with pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic and hydroiodic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, 4-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, benzoic acid and maleic acid and lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts, as well as with ammonia, C1-C6-alikylamines, C1-C6 alkanolamines, procaine, cycloalkylamines, benzylamines and heterocyclic amines. Even if the present compounds are well absorbed after enteral administration, in some cases it can be advantageous to prepare suitable bioreversible derivatives of compounds of the invention, i.e. to prepare so-called prodrugs, preferably derivatives, the physicochemical properties of which leads to improved solubility at physiological pH and/or absorption and/or bioavailability of the compound in question. Such derivatives are for instance pyridyl N-oxide derivatives of compounds of the invention, such compounds being prepared by oxidation of the pyridyl N by a suitable oxidizing agent, e.g. with 3-chloro-perbenzoic acid in an inert solvent, e.g. dichloromethane. Other suitable methods to improve the physicochemical properties and/or solubility of the compounds concerned can be used as well. N-Alkyl-N-cyano-N-pyridylguanidines, described in United Kingdom Patent No. 1,489,879, are potent potassium channel activators with a pronounced effect as pre-capillary vasodilators, reducing the total peripheral resistance in animals and in man, and are thus useful as antihypertensives. As stated in the International Patent No. PCT/DK93/00291, filing date Sep. 13, 1993, Publication No. WO 94/06770 the introduction of aryloxy-containing radicals into the aliphatic groups from the above-cited U.K. Patent has led to structures showing more specific pharmacological effects on isolated tissues and cells and with no or a negligible effect on 86 Rb-efflux from potassium channels, as compared with the established effect of compounds covered by the above-mentioned U.K. Patent. The compounds of the present invention inhibit the proliferation of various tumour cell lines in cultures at lower concentrations than the known compounds, confer Table 1 below, thus making them potentially useful in anfineoplastic chemotherapy. The inhibition of tumour cell proliferation was studied using different types of human cancer cell lines. The cell lines under investigation were small cell lung carcinoma (NYH), non small cell lung carcinoma (NCI-H460), and breast cancer (MCF-7) using the following general procedure: The cells were cultured in vitro for 24 hours in the presence of the compound under investigation. DNA synthesis was measured by incorporation of 3Hthymidine, and the median inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) of the compounds were calculated. TABLE 1 Inhibition of tumour cell proliferation in vitro in human breast cancer (MCF-7), human small cell lung carcinoma (NYH) and human non small cell lung cancer (NCI-H460) cell lines by compounds of the following examples of the present invention.

B: N-Cyano-N-(5-phenoxypentyl)-N-4-pyridylguanidine, in PCT/DK93/00291, example 18. The results show that the compounds of the present invention are able to inhibit the proliferation of tumour cells in vitro at the same or lower concentrations than the compounds A and B from PCT/DK93/00291. The compounds of the invention are well tolerated and non-toxic and are exerting the described beneficial activities with no or minimal effect on the systemic blood pressure. In general, they may be administered by oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal or transdermal routes. The present invention also relates to methods for preparing the desired compounds of the general formula I. The compounds of the formula I may conveniently be prepared by standard procedures detailed in the art. The routes are outlined in the following reaction scheme. The present compounds are intended for use in pharmaceutical compositions which are useful in the treatment of the above mentioned diseases. The amount required of a compound of formula (I) (hereinafter referred to as the active ingredient) for therapeutic effect will, of course, vary both with the particular compound, the route of administration and the mammal under treatment. A suitable dose of a compound of formula (I) for systemic treatment is 0.1 to 400 mg per kilogram bodyweight, the most preferred dosage being 1.0 to 100 mg per kg of mammal bodyweight, for example 5 to 20 mg/kg; administered once or more times daily. A daily dose (for adults) may amount to 1 mg to 10000 mg, preferably from 70-5000 mg, and in the veterinary practice correspondingly, in daily doses from 0.1 to 400 mg/kg bodyweight. While it is possible for an active ingredient to be administered alone as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical formulation. Conveniently, the active ingredient comprises from 0.1% to 99% by weight of the formulation. Conveniently, dosage units of a formulation contain between 0.5 mg and 1 g of the active ingredient. For topical administration, the active ingredient preferably comprises from 1% to 20% by weight of the formulation but the active ingredient may comprise as much as 50% w/w. Formulations suitable for nasal or buccal administration may comprise 0.1% to 20% w/w. for example about 2% w/w of active ingredient. By the term dosage unit is meant a unitary, i.e. a single dose which is capable of being administered to a patient, and which may be readily handled and packed, remaining as a physically and chemically stable unit dose comprising either the active material as such or a mixture of it with solid or liquid pharmaceutical diluents or carriers. The formulations, both for veterinary and for human medical use, of the present invention comprise an active ingredient in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor and optionally other therapeutic ingredient(s). The carrier(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulations and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The formulations include those in a form suitable for oral, rectal, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intraperitoneal) administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in dosage unit form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of discrete units as capsules, sachets, tablets or lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; in the form of a powder or granules; in the form of a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or non-aqueous liquid; or in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion. The active ingredient may also be administered in the form of a bolus, electuary or paste. Formulations for rectal administration may be in the form of a suppository incorporating the active ingredient and a carrier such as cocoa butter, or in the form of an enema. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile oily or aqueous preparation of the active ingredient which is preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. In addition to the aforementioned ingredients, the formulations of this invention may include one or more additional ingredients, such as diluents, buffers, flavouring agents, binders, surface active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives, e.g. methylhydroxybenzoate (including anti-oxidants), emulsifying agents and the like. The compositions may further contain other therapeutically active compounds usually applied in the treatment of the above mentioned pathological conditions, e.g. antineoplastic agents which may result in synergistic effects on tumour cells. The invention will now be further described in the following general procedures and examples: The exemplified compounds I are listed in table 2.

For 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra (300 MHz) chemical shift values () are quoted, unless otherwise specified, for hexadeuterodimethylsulfoxide solutions relative to internal tetramethylsilane ( 0.00). The value for a multiplet (m), either defined (doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q)) or not at the approximate mid point is given unless a range is quoted (s singlet, b broad). The following abbreviations and formulas are used: DCCD (N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide), NH 2 CN (cyanamide), Et 3 N (triethylamine), DMF (dimethylformamide), DMAP (dimethylaminopyridine), MeOH (methanol), CH 2 Cl 2 (methylenechloride) and DMSO-d 6 (hexadeuterodimethylsulfoxide). General Procedure 1: Coupling of Compounds of the General Formula II with Compounds of the General Formula III Resulting in Compounds of the General Formula I. A compound of the general formula II (6 mmol), a compound of the general formula III (3 mmol) and triethylamine (6 mmol) in pyridine (4 ml) were stirred at room temperature. 4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 10 mg) was added and the solution was stirred at 95 C. for 6 hours. To the mixture was added ether (10 ml) and the resulting suspension was filtered and washed with ether to leave the crystalline product of formula I. General Procedure 2: Conversion of Compounds of the General Formula IV into Compounds of the General Formula I. To a compound of the general formula IV (4 mmol) in dimethylformamide (3 ml) was added dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (12 mmol), cyanamide (12 mmol) and triethylamine (0.4 ml). The reaction mixture was kept at room temperature for 4 days, when it was evaporated in vacuo (0.5 mmHg). The residue was triturated with 3 portions of petroleum ether. After decanting, the solid was stirred with acetone (15 ml), and the suspension was filtered and washed with acetone to leave a mixture of the product of general formula I and N,N-dicyclohexylthiourea. Extraction with dilute hydrochloric acid (1 N, 16 ml) and reprecipitation from the filtrate with dilute sodium hydroxide afforded the crude product of the general formula I which was crystallized from ethanol. General Procedure 3: Coupling of Compounds of the General Formula V with Compounds of the General Formula III Resulting in Compounds of the General Formula I. A mixture of a compound of the general formula V (15 mmol), a compound of the general formula III (7.5 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (15 mmol) in dimethylformamide (10 ml) was stirred at room temperature. To the resulting solution was added dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (16.5 mmol). The formed suspension was stirred for 2 days at room temperature and was then evaporated in vacuo (0.5 mmHg). The residue was triturated with 3 portions of petroleum ether (40 ml). After decanting, the solid was stirred with water (100 ml) containing hydrochloric acid (4 N, 6 ml). After filtration, the pH of the aqueous filtrate was adjusted to 7.5 with 2 N. sodium hydroxide. The precipitate was stirred at 0 C. and collected by filtration and washings with water. Recrystallization from aqueous acetone afforded the pure compound of the general formula I. EXAMPLE 1 ,-Bis(N-cyano-N-4-pyridylguanidino)4-xylene (Compound 101) General procedure 1.

Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug esters are those derived from a carboxylic acid, a carbonic acid monoester or a carbamic acid, advantageously esters derived from an optionally substituted lower alkanoic acid or an arylcarboxylic acid. The Compounds of the Invention may also exist in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and as such are included within the scope of the invention. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include acid addition salts with conventional acids, for example, mineral acids, e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric or phosphoric acid, or organic acids, for example, aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic or sulfonic acids, e.g., acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, maleic, fumaric, hydroxymaleic, pyruvic, pamoic, methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic. sulfanilic or cyclohexylsulfamic acid, also amino acids, such as arginine and lysine. For compounds of the invention having acidic groups, for example, a free carboxy group, pharmaceutically acceptable salts also represent metal or ammonium salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, e.g., sodium potassium, magnesium or calcium salts, as well as ammonium salts, which are formed with ammonia or suitable organic amines. Compounds of the Invention of formulae III and IV as defined above may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula VIII wherein R 1 and R 2 are as defined above, with the corresponding aldehyde, ketone, disulfonylamine, disulfide, diselenide, ditelluride or halide and, if required introducing the desired R 3 substituent or further transforming the product obtained and optionally recovering it free or salt form. Thus for example, the compound of formula VIII is treated with the corresponding aldehyde, ketone, disulfonylamine, disulfide, diselenide, ditelluride or halide in the presence of n-BuLi, e.g. in cooled (e.g. 40 C.) THF solution. When the compound of formula VIII is treated with the corresponding aldehyde or ketone, the initial product obtained is 1-hydroxy substituted in the R 4 substituent, e.g. 1-hydroxycyclohexyl when the ketone is cyclohexanone. The corresponding dehydrated compound. e.g. R 4 is 1-cyclohexenyl, may be obtained, e.g. by treatment with pTsOH under reflux in toluene solution. The invention includes a process for the preparation of a Compound of the Invention or salt of formulae III and IV as defined above which comprises reacting a compound of formula VIII wherein R 1 and R 2 are as defined above, with the corresponding aldehyde, ketone, disulfonylamine, disulfide, diselenide, ditelluride or halide and, if required introducing the desired R 3 substituent or further transforming the product obtained and optionally recovering the Compound of the Invention in free or salt form. Compounds of formula VIII may be prepared by treating the corresponding 1H-imidazole of formula I, i.e. the corresponding compound of formula I in which R 4 is H, with 2(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl-halide (e.g. -chloride), e.g. in the presence of potassium bis-(trimethylsilyl)-amide in cooled (e.g. 78 C.) DMF/THF solution. This procedure gives rise to a mixture of the corresponding 1-2(trimethylsilyl)-ethoxymethyl-imidazoles of formulae VIII and IX wherein R 1 and R 2 are as defined above. Compounds of formula VIII are novel intermediates for preparation of other Compounds of the Invention and are included per se within the present invention. Compounds of formula IX are Compounds of the Invention. In an alternative preferred embodiment an alkoxyalkyl nitorogen protecting group, e.g. a dialkoxyalkyl nitrogen protecting group, especially a diethoxymethyl protecting group, is uswed in place of the trimethylsilylethoxymethyl protecting group. Such an alkoxyalkyl protecting group may be introduced by treating the corresponding 1H-imidazole of formula I, i.e. the corresponding compound of formula I in which R 4 is H, with a trialkyl orthoformate, e.g. triethyl orthoformate, for instance as hereinafter described in Example. The synthesis of Compounds of the Invention is further described in the following Examples. EXAMPLES Example 1 and 2 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1-(2-(trimethylsilyl)-ethoxymethyl)-imidazole and 4-(4-pyridyl)-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl)imidazole 4-(4-Fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole (3) (1 g 4.18 mmol) is dissolved in DMF/THF (50 ml/20 ml) and cooled to 78 C. Potassium bis-(trimethylsilyl)-amide (15% in toluene; 6.7 ml 5 mmol) is introduced at 78 C., stirred for 30 min. then 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethylchloride is added and the reaction mixture warmed up to r.t., poured on water after 2 hrs. and extracted 3 with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases are dried over Na 2 SO 4 , evaporated to dryness and chromatographed (SiO 2 acetone/hexane 4/6 to 6/4) to give 1-(2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole, being eluted first as white crystals (218 mg 14%) followed by 4-(4-pyridyl)-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl) imidazole as white crystals (590 mg 38%). The correct assignment of the structures was achieved by ROESY, HSQC and HMBC spectrometry. 1H-NMR (360 MHz CDCl3) of 1-(2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole (Example 1): 0.00 (s, 9H); 0.92 (t, 2H); 3.55 (t, 2H); 5.15 (s, 2H); 6.95 (t, 2H); 7.36 (d, 2H); 7.42 (dd, 2H); 7.72 (s, 1H); 8.68 (d, 2H) 4-(4-pyridyl)-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl)imidazole (Example 2): 0.00 (s, 9H); 0.90 (t, 2H); 3.48 (t, 2H); 5.10 (s, 2H); 7.20 (t, 2H); 7.35-7.45 (m, 4H); 7.75 (s, 1H); 8.45 (d, 2H). Alternatively, the 1H-imidazole starting material may be converted to the corresponding 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1-(1,1-diethoxymethyl)-imidazole and 4-(4-pyridyl)-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(1,1-diethoxymethyl)imidazole products. 1-(1,1-Diethoxymethyl)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridinyl)imidazole and 1-(1,1-diethoxymethyl-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-pyridinyl)imidazole 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridinyl)-imidazole (72.7 g; 0.304 mol) and pTsOH.H 2 O (1,1g; 5 mmol) are dissolved in hot triethyl orthoformate (770 ml) and retluxed, while slowly distilling off ca. 300 ml of triethyl orthoformate and ethanol. After 2 h the reaction mixtureis evaporated to dryness and taken up in tert.butyl methyl ether (500 ml). Hexane (5 l) is slowly added, the precipitate filtered off and washed with tert.butyl methyl ether/hexane (1:9). The filtrate is washed with 1N Na 2 CO 3 , dried over Na 2 SO 4 and evaporated. Xylene is added twice and evaporated again yielding the title compounds as a yellow-brownish viscuous oil (79.3 g; 76%, 1:1 mixture), which is used without further purification. Example 3 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-((RS)-1-hydroxy-4-fluorobenzyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole 1.6M n-BuLi in hexane (0.085 ml 0.13 mmol) is added at 40 C. to a solution of 1-(2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole (Example 2; 50 mg 0.13 mmol) in THF (1.4 ml). After 15 min at 40 C. 4-fluorobenzaldehyde (0.018 ml 0.18 mmol) in THF (0.4 ml) is addded to the reaction mixture, which is warmed to r.t. and after 10 min. poured on water and extracted 3 with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases are dried over Na 2 SO 4 , evaporated to dryness and render the desired is-protected title compound (64 mg). In order to remove the SEM protecting group, the latter material is dissolved in THF (2 ml), treated with Bu4NF (4.3 ml; 1M in THF) for 1 h at 60 C., poured on a saturated solution of NaHCO 3 and extracted 3 with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases are dried over Na 2 SO 4 , evaporated to dryness and chromatographed (SiO 2 toluene/EtOH/NH 3 conc. 90/10/0.6) to yield the title compound as white crystals (32 mg 67% over 2 steps) 1H-NMR (360 MHz DMSO-d6): 5.80 (s, 1H); 6.30 (bs, OH); 7.15 (t, 2H); 7.20-7.30 (bs, 1H); 7.37 (d, 2H); 7.42-7.48 (m, 2H); 7.52-7.58 (m, 2H); 8.38-8.51 (bs, 2H); 12.50-12.60 (bs, NH). In an alternative procedure a mixture of 1-(1,1-diethoxymethyl)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridinyl)imidazole and 3-(1,1-diethoxymethyl)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridinyl)imidazole, prepared as described above may be used in place of 1-(2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyrldyl)imidazole; for example as described below for the preparation of 4-(4-Fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl) 2-(2,3,5,6-tetrafluoropyridinyl)imidazole. 4-(4-Fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl) 2-(2,3,5,6-tetrafluoropyridinyl)imidazole 1.6 M nBuLi (66 ml; 45 mmol) is added at 45 C. to a 1:1 mixture of 1-(1,1-diethoxymethyl)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-pyridinyl)imidazole and 1-(1,1-diethoxymethyl)-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-pyridinyl)imidazole (15 g; 43 mmol) in THF (210 ml). After 15 min. at 45 C. the reaction mixture is cooled to 55 C. and pentafluoropyridine (5.1 ml; 47 mmol) is rapidly introduced. The cooling bath is removed, the reaction mixture allowed to warm to 15 C. and poured on water (1 l), which is then acidified with 2N HCl (100 ml). After stirring for 5 min. the mixture is combined with a saturated solution of Na 2 CO 3 and extracted with ethyl acetate three times. The combined organic phases are dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and evaporated to dryness rendering the title compound as brownish crystals (16.3 g). Chromatography (SiO 2 ; acetone/hexanes 1:1) yields the title compound together with some unreacted and unprotected imidazole starting material, which could be removed by washing with acetone yielding the title compound (8.7 g; 52.4%). 1H-NMR (360 Mhz CDCl3): 7.30-7.40 (bt, 2H); 7.45 (d, 2H); 7.58 (bq; 2H); 8.52 (bs, 2H).

Phosphorylated GST-ATF-2 is then detected by adding: 1. the PhosphoPlus ATF-2 (Thr71) Antibody (50 l/well; 1/1000 final dilution in PBS/2% BSA/0.02% Na Azide; New Enaland Biolabs 9221L) for 90 min at RT. 2. Biotin labelled goat-anti-rabbit IgG (50 l/well; 1/3000 final dilution in PBS/2% BSA/0.02% Na Azide; Sigma B-9642) for 90 min at RT. 3. Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (50 l/well; 1/5000 dilution in PBS/2% BSA/0.02% Na Azide; Jackson Immunoresearch 016-050-084 ) for 30 min at RT. 4. Substrate (100 l/well; Sigma 104 Phosphatase substrate tablets, 5 mg/tablet; 104-105; 1 mg/ml in substrate buffer, Diethanolamine (97 ml/l Merck 803116)MgCl 2 .6H 2 O (100 mg/l; Merck 5833)Na Azide (0.2 g/l)HCl 1M to pH 9.8) 30 min at RT. After step 1,2 and 3 the microtiter plates are washed four times with PBS/0.5% Tween 20/0.02% Na azide. After step 4, the plates are read in a Bio-Rad microplate reader in a dual wavelength mode (measurement filter 405 nm and reference filter 490 nm). The background value (without ATP) is subtracted and IC 50 values are calculated using the Origin computer program (4 parameter logistic function). Agents of the Invention typically have IC 50 s for p38 MAP kinase inhibition in the range from about 1 M to about 10 nM or less when tested in the above assay. For example, the compound of Example 17 has an IC 50 of about 10 nM in this assay. Assay for Inhibition of TNF- release from hPBMCs Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) are prepared from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers using ficoll-hypaque density separation accordinc to the method of Hansel et al., J. Imm. Methods (1991) 145: 105, and used at a concentration of 10 5 cells/well in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FCS. Cells are incubated with serial dilutions of the test compounds for 30 minutes at 37 C. prior to the addition of IFNg (100 U/ml) and LPS (5 mg/ml) and subsequently further incubated for three hours. Incubation is terminated by centrifugation at 1400 RPM for 10 min. TNF- in the supernatant is measured using a commercial ELISA (Innotest hTNFa, available from Innogenetics N.V., Zwijnaarde, Belium). Agents of the Invention are tested at concentrations of from 0 to 10 mM. Exemplified Agents of the Ivention typically suppress TNF release in this assay with an IC 50 of from about 1 M to about 10 nM or less when tested in this assay. For example, the compound of Example 17 has an IC 50 of about 90 nM when tested in this assay. Assay for Inhibition of TNF- Production in LPS Stimulated Mice Injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces a rapid release of soluble tumour necrosis factor (TNF-) into the periphery. This model is be used to analyse prospective blockers of TNF release in vivo. LPS (20 mg/kg) is injected i.v. into OF1 mice (female, 8 week old). One (1) hour later blood is withdrawn from the animals and TNF levels are analysed in the plasma by an ELISA method using an antibody to TNF-. Using 20 mg/kg of LPS levels of up to 15 ng of TNF-/ml plasma are usually induced. Compounds to be evaluated are given either orally or s.c. 1 to 4 hours prior to the LPS injection. Inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-release is taken as the readout. Agents of the Invention typically inhibit TNF production to the extent of from about 50% up to about 90% or more in the above assay when administered at 10 mg/ka p.o. For example the compound of Example 17 inhibits TNF production to the extent of about 80% in this assay. As indicated in the above assays Agents of the Invention are potent inhibitors of TNF- release. Accordingly, the Novel Compounds have pharmaceutical utility as follows: Agents of the Invention are useful for the prophylaxis and treatment of diseases or pathological conditions mediated by cytokines such as TNF and IL-1, e.g. inflammatory conditions, autoimmune diseases, severe infections. and organ or tissue transplant rejection, e.g. for the treatment of recipients of heart, lung, combined heart-lung, liver, kidney, pancreatic, skin or corneal transplants and for the prevention of graft-versus-host disease, such as following bone marrow transplants. Agents of the Invention are particularly useFul for the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of autoimmune disease and of inflammatory conditions, in particular inflammatory conditions with an aetiology including an autoimmune component such as arthritis (for example rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis chronica progrediente and arthritis deformans) and rheumatic diseases. Specific auto-immune diseases for which Agents of the Invention may be employed include autoimmune haematological disorders (including e.g. hemolytic anaemia, aplastic anaemia, pure red cell anaemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenia), systemic lupus erythematosus, polychondritis, sclerodoma, Wegener granulamatosis, dermatomyositis, chronic active hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, psoriasis, Steven-Johnson syndrome, idiopathic sprue, autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease (including e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease), endocrine ophthalmopathy, Graves disease, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, juvenile diabetes (diabetes mellitus type I), uveitis (anterior and posterior), keratoconjunctivitis sicca and vernal keratoconjunctivitis, interstitial lung fibrosis, psoriatic arthritis and glomerulonephritis (with and without nephrotic syndrome, e.g. including idiopathic nephrotic syndrome or minimal change nephropathy). Agents of the Invention are also useful for the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of asthma, bronchitis, pneumoconiosis, pulmonary emphysema, and other obstructive or inflammatory diseases of the airways. Agents of the Invention are useful for treating undesirable acute and hyperacute inflammatory reactions which are mediated by TNF, especially by TNFa, e.g., acute infections, tor example septic shock (e.g., endotoxic shock and adult respiratory distress syndrome), meningitis, pneumonia; and severe burns; and for the treatment of cachexia or wasting syndrome associated with morbid TNF release, consequent to infection, cancer, or organ dysfunction, especially AIDS-related cachexia, e.g., associated with or consequential to HIV infection. Agents of the Invention are particularly useful for treating diseases of bone metabolism including osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and other inflammatory arthritides. For the above indications the appropriate dosage will, of course, vary depending, for example, on the particular Agent of the Invention employed, the subject to be treated, the mode of administration and the nature and severity of the condition being treated. However, in general, satisfactory results in animals are obtained at daily dosages of from about 1 to about 10 mg/kg/day p.o. In larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range of from about 50 to about 750 mg of Agent of the Invention administered orally once or, more suitably, in divided dosages two to four times/day. The Agents of the Invention may be administered by any conventional route, e.g. orally, for example in the form of solutions for drinking, tablets or capsules or parenterally, for example in the form of injectable solutions or suspensions. Normally or systemic administration oral dosage forms are preferred, although for some indications the Agents of the Invention may also be administered topically or dermally, e.g. in the form of a dermal cream or gel or like preparation or, for the purposes of application to the eye, in the form of an ocular cream, gel or eye-drop preparation; or may be administered by inhalation, e.g., for treating asthma. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral adhinistration comprise e.g. from 25 to 250 mg Novel Compound per unit dosage.

salts of said compounds, and hydrates and solvates of the compounds of formula I and the salts thereof can be used in the production of medicaments for treating fungal infections and mycoses. The present invention relates to novel azoles of general formula I, wherein: R 14 , R 15 are each independently hydrogen or fluorine, T is a group of the formula: wherein R 9 is pyrrolidinyl or a group ANHB, A is hydrogen or straight-chain or branched C 1 -C 5 alkyl; B is straight-chain or branched C 1 -C 4 alkylene, CH 2 CONHCH 2 or CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH(NH 2 ); and X is a pharmaceutically acceptable anion. The present invention further relates to processes for the manufacture of said azoles, pharmaceutical compositions, particularly antifungal compositions, containing said azoles, and the use of these azoles for the production of medicaments for the treatment of fungal infections. SUMMARY Several azoles are currently used for systemic mycoses. However, none of them fully satisfies the requirements of the clinical setting, particularly with regard to: broad antifungal spectrum including aspergillus fumigatus; less drug-drug interaction; and appropriate plasma half-life for once a day treatment. Other clinical requirements which are not fulfilled by the azoles currently in use are: efficacy against major systemic mycoses including disseminated aspergillosis; safety; and oral or parenteral formulations. Particularly, the demand for a parenterally administered azoles is increasing for the treatment of serious systemic mycoses. Most of the azoles on the market, as well as under development are highly lipophilic molecules that make the parenteral formulation difficult. The novel azoles of formula I have less metabolic interaction liability which is a clear clinical advantage. Those azoles of formula I, wherein T is a group T 1 , are water soluble compounds useful for the treatment of systemic mycoses and suitable for both oral and particularly parenteral administration. Thus, the invention also relates to a method for the therapy of fungal infections and mycoses, which comprises administering to the infected organism an effective amount of the novel azole compounds. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The novel azoles of the present invention have the formula wherein R 14 , R 15 are each independently hydrogen or fluorine, T is a group of the formula: wherein R 9 is pyrrolidinyl or a group ANHB, A is hydrogen or straight-chain or branched C 1 -C 5 alkyl; B is straight-chain or branched C 1 -C 4 alkylene, CH 2 CONHCH 2 or CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH(NH 2 ); and X is a pharmaceutically acceptable anion; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds, and hydrates and solvates of the compounds of formula I and the salts thereof. Where T is T 1 in the above formula I, the azoles of the invention have the formula wherein R 9 is pyrrolidinyl or a group ANHB, A is hydrogen or straight-chain or branched C 1 -C 5 alkyl; B is straight-chain or branched C 1 -C 4 alkylene, CH 2 CONHCH 2 or CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH(NH 2 ); and R 14 and R 15 are each independently hydrogen or fluorine.

Preferred compounds of formula I (I or II) are those wherein R 14 and R 15 are both H or F; or R 14 is H and R 15 is F. Also preferred among the compounds of formula I are those wherein R 9 is 2-pyrrolidinyl, aminomethyl, (methylamino)methyl or (ethylamino)methyl. The anion X can be derived from a pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic acid, and thus is a chloride, bromide, sulfate or the like. The anion X can also be derived from an organic acid, e.g. an aliphatic, aromatic or araliphatic carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid, and thus is an acetoxy, trifluoroacetoxy, mesyloxy or the like anion.

The following synthetic scheme 1 illustrates the manufacture of one of the compounds of formula I: The novel azole compounds represented by the general formula I as well as salts, hydrates or solvates thereof can be manufactured by reacting an azole compound of the above general formula (II) with a compound of the general formula (III), wherein: R 9 is pyrrolidinyl or a group ANHB, A is hydrogen or straight-chain or branched C 1 -C 5 alkyl; B is straight-chain or branched C 1 -C 4 alkylene, CH 2 CONHCH 2 or CH 2 CH 2 CH 2 CH(NH 2 ) and, an amino group present in R 9 may be in protected form; and L is a leaving group, followed if necessary, by removal of a protecting group and/or by salt formation. The benzylation reactions of the compound of the general formula (II) with the compound of the general formula (III) can be carried out in a solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, benzene, toluene, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, or dimethylformamide, preferably chloroform, acetonitrile, or dimethylformamide. The reaction time of this benzylation reaction may be varied within a relatively wide range. In general, the reaction can be carried out at a temperature between 0 C. and 100 C., preferably between 0 C. and 50 C. Preferably, an amino group present in R 9 in the compound of formula III is protected by a suitable amino protecting group, such as tert.-butoxycarbonyl. The protecting group may, if necessary, be removed after the reaction by procedures known to those skilled in the art. The compounds of formula (I) may contain an amino acid ester substituent R 9 which substituents may form acid addition salts. The term salts of compounds of formula (I) in the present specification, refers to such acid addition salts. These salts may be derived from pharmaceutically acceptable acids as described earlier with reference to the symbol X . The salt formation can be performed when removing a protecting group, or can be performed ad hoc by procedures known per se. The hydration can be effected in the course of the manufacturing process or can occur gradually as a result of hygroscopic properties of an initially anhydrous product. Solvates with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as ethanol can be obtained for example, during crystallization.

The term salts of compounds of the formula (II) in the present specification refers to acid addition salts. These salts may be derived from pharmaceutically acceptable acids such as acetic acid and hydrogen chloride. The salt formation can be performed by procedures well known in the art Hydrates or solvates with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as ethanol can be obtained for example, during crystallization. Fungal infections usually occur in immunocompromised patients with underlying diseases. Antifungal agents are, therefore, often taken with other medications. When co-administered with other drugs, azole antifungals have been reported to increase the blood concentrations of some of the drugs administered concomitantly. Such drug-drug interactions can sometimes result in severe adverse effects and sometimes form a basis for contraindication. This is one of critical issues of azole antifungals such as itraconazole, fluconazole and ketoconazole. The novel azoles represented by the formula (II) as well as hydrates or solvates thereof have less drug-drug interaction than known antimycotic azole compounds (see Table 1). Therefore, these azoles would have a clear clinical advantage. In vitro P450 Inhibitory Activity Each azole compound at different concentrations was incubated with a specific substrate for each CYP, human liver microsomes and NADPH at 37 C. Then, the metabolite formed from the specific substrate was determined by HPLC and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) was calculated. The substrate concentrations and incubation conditions were as follows: (1) substrate for CYP3A4: midazolam (10 M), formation of 1-hydroxymidazolam after incubation for 10 min at 37. (2) substrate for CYP2C9: tolbutamide (100 M), formation of 4-hydroxytolbutamide after incubation for 10 min at 37.

Therefore, the water soluble compounds of the general formula (I) as well as the salts, hydrates or solvates thereof exhibit potent activity against various fungal infections including Aspergillosis in rats over a very wide range of dosages both orally and parenterally and are useful as antifungal agents. The present invention further relates to the pharmaceutical compositions containing an azole compound of the general formula I or a salt, hydrate or solvate thereof. The azole compounds of the formula I as well as salts, hydrates or solvates thereof are very active antimycotic agents. They are active against a variety of fungal species including Candida spp., Cryptotoccus neoformans, Aspergillus spp., Trichophyton spp., Microsporum spp., Exophiala spp., Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Histoplasma capsulatum. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are useful for topical and systemic treatment of mycoses in animals as well as in humans. For example, they are useful in treating topical and mucosal fungal infections caused by, among other genera, Candida, Trichophyton, or Microsporum. They may also be used in the treatment of systemic fungal infections caused by, for example, Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus spp., Paracoccidiodes spp., Sporotrix spp., Exophiala spp., Blastomyces spp., or Histoplasma spp. For clinical use, the azole compound of the formula I as well as salts, hydrates or solvates thereof can be administered alone, but will generally be administered in pharmaceutical admixture formulated as appropriate to the particular use and purpose desired, by mixing excipient, binding agent, lubricant, disintegrating agent, coating material, emulsifier, suspending agent, solvent, stabilizer, absorption enhancer and/or ointment base. The admixture can be used for oral, injectable, rectal or topical administration. Pharmaceutical formulation for oral administration may be granule, tablet, sugar coated tablet, capsule, pill, suspension or emulsion. For parenteral injection, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously, the azoles of formula I may be used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution or in the form of a HPCD complex, which may contain other substances, for example, salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic. The azoles can also be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. The daily dosage level of the azole compounds of the formula I is from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg (in divided doses) when administered in one, two or more dosages by either the oral or parenteral route. Thus, tablets or capsules may contain from about 5 mg to about 0.5 g of active compound for administration. In any event the actual dosage can be determined by the physician and it may be varied upon the age, weight and response of the particular patient. In addition, the azole compounds of the formula I as well as salts, hydrates or solvates thereof have activity against a variety of plant pathogenic fungi, including for example Pyricularia oryzae, Pythium aphanidermatum, Alternaria spp., and Paecilomyces variotii. Thus, they can be applied for agricultural and horticultural purposes preferably in the form of a composition formulated as appropriate to the particular use and purpose desired, for example dusting powders, or granules, seed dressings, aqueous solutions, dispersions or emulsions, dips, sprays or aerosols. Such compositions may contain such conventional carriers, diluents or adjuvants as are known and acceptable in agriculture and horticulture. Other compounds having herbicidal or insecticidal, or additional antiflugals can be incorporated in the compositions. The compounds and compositions can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be applied directly to the plant foliage, stems, branches, seeds or roots or to the soil or other growing medium, and they may be used not only to eradicate the disease, but also prophylactically to protect the plants or seeds from attack.

azabicycloheptane derivatives, production and use thereof", "abstract": "Compounds of the formula I: in which R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 have the meanings stated in the description, are described. The novel compounds are suitable for controlling diseases. This application is a 371 of PCT/EP99/05164 filed Jul. 20, 1999. The invention relates to novel N-substituted azabicycloheptane derivatives, their preparation and use for controlling diseases. Exo-6-phenyl-3-azabicyclo3.2.0heptane derivatives have interesting properties as potential neuroleptics (WO 94/00458, WO 95/15312). In this connection, the observed high affinities for D 4 and 5-HT 2 receptors are particularly important. The most interesting substance from the above classes of compounds with high D 4 /5-HT 2A affinity and good selectivity versus D 2 is ()-(1S,5R,6S)-exo-3-2-6-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo-3.2.0heptan-3-ylethyl-1H,3H-quinazoline-2,4-dione (substance A), which represents a potential neuroleptic. However, there is an upper limit to the dosage of substance A owing to the prolongations occurring in the QT interval in the cardiac sic ECG. Substances with better properties have now been found. The invention relates to N-substituted 3-azabicyclo-3.2.0heptane derivatives of the formula I: in which R 1 is fluorine or chlorine, R 2 and R 3 are hydrogen or C 1 -C 3 -alkyl, and R 4 is chlorine, methyl, nitro or amino, and the salts thereof with physiologically tolerated acids. Preferred compounds are those in which R 1 is chlorine, preferably in the p position, R 2 is hydrogen or methyl, R 3 is hydrogen or methyl and R 4 is hydrogen. The following compounds should be mentioned as particularly preferred: ()-(1S,5R,6S)-exo-2-2-6-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo-3.2.0heptan-3-ylethyl-3,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1,2-benzisothiazole 1, 1-dioxide, ()-(1S,5R,6S)-exo-2-2-6-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo-3.2.0heptan-3-ylethyl-2,3-dihydro-1,2-benzisothiazole 1,1-dioxide, and ()-(1S,5R,6S)-exo-2-2-6-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo-3.2.0-heptan-3-yl-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-1,2 -benzisothiazole-1,1-dioxide. The compounds of the formula I according to the invention can be prepared by reacting a compound of the formula II: in which R 2 , R 3 and R 4 have the abovementioned meanings, and Nu is a nucleofugic leaving group, with a 3-azabicyclo-3.2.0heptane derivative of the formula III as ()-(1S,5R,exo-6S) enantiomer: in which R 1 has the abovementioned meaning, and converting the compound obtained in this way where appropriate into the acid addition salt of a physiologically tolerated acid. Halogen atoms, in particular bromine or chlorine, are suitable and preferred as nucleofugic leaving group for Nu. The reaction is expediently carried out in the presence of an inert base such as triethylamine or potassium carbonate as acid acceptor in an inert solvent such as a cyclic saturated ether, in particular tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, or a benzenoid hydrocarbon such as toluene or xylene. The reaction is generally carried out at temperatures from 20 to 150 C., in particular from 80 to 1400C., and is generally complete within 1 to 10 hours. The compounds of the formula I according to the invention can be either recrystallized by recrystallization sic from conventional organic solvents, preferably from a lower alcohol such as ethanol, or purified by column chromatography. The free 3-azabicyclo3.2.0heptane derivatives of the formula I can be converted in a conventional way into the acid addition salt of a pharmacologically suitable acid, preferably by treating a solution with one equivalent of the appropriate acid. Examples of pharmaceutically suitable acids are hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, sulfamic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid or citric acid. The compounds according to the invention have valuable pharmacological properties. They can be used as neuroleptics (in particular atypical), antidepressants, sedatives, hypnotics, CNS protectives or agents for treating cocaine dependency. It is possible for several of the types of action mentioned to occur in combination in a compound according to the invention. The substances are characterized in particular by a very high and selective affinity for dopamine D 4 and serotonin 2A receptors. The prolongations of the QT interval measured on the model of the guinea pig capillary muscle are negligibly small. The novel substances are therefore well tolerated even at high dosages. The invention accordingly also relates to a therapeutic composition having a content of a compound of the formula I or its pharmacologically suitable acid addition salt as active ingredient in addition to conventional carriers and diluents, and to the use of the novel compounds for controlling diseases. The compounds according to the invention can be administered orally or parenterally, intravenously or intramuscularly, in a conventional way. The dosage depends on the age, condition and weight of the patient and on the mode of administration. As a rule, the daily dose of active ingredient is between about 1 and 100 mg/kg of body weight on oral administration and between 0.1 and 10 mg/kg of body weight on parenteral administration. The novel compounds can be used in conventional solid or liquid pharmaceutical forms, e.g. as uncoated or (film-)coated tablets, capsules, powders, granules, suppositories, solutions, ointments, creams or sprays. These are produced in a conventional way. The active ingredients can for this purpose be processed with conventional pharmaceutical aids such as tablet binders, bulking agents, preservatives, tablet disintegrants, flow regulators, plasticizers, wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, solvents, release-slowing agents, antioxidants and/or propellant gases (cf. H. Sucker et. al.: Pharmazeutische Technologie, Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, 1978). The administration forms obtained in this way normally contain the active ingredient in an amount of from 1 to 99% by weight. The substances of the formula II and III required as starting materials for synthesizing the compounds according to the invention are known, (WO 94/00458; Heterocycles 40 (1), 319-330 (1995), Chimia 1990, 44, 120) or can be synthesized from analogous starting materials by preparation methods described in the literature. The following examples serve to illustrate the invention: A Preparation of the Starting Materials a) 2,3-dihydro-1,2-benzoisothiazole 1,1-dioxide 25.3 g (138 mM sic) of saccharin were added in portions over the course of 90 min to 7.1 g (187 mM sic) of lithium aluminum hydride in 400 ml of absolute tetrahydrofuran with vigorous stirring under nitrogen; during this, the temperature was maintained at room temperature by cooling in ice. After stirring overnight, the mixture was cooled in an ice bath and, while stirring vigorously, water was cautiously added dropwise, followed by 10% strength sulfuric acid. After the precipitated hydroxides had been filtered off with suction, washing with THF, the filtrate was concentrated, the residue was partitioned between methylene chloride and water and, after acidifying with 10% strength sulfuric acid, the organic phase was washed thoroughly with sodium carbonate solution. The organic phase was dried with sodium sulfate and filtered and then concentrated. 12.0 g (52%) of product of adequate purity were isolated. b) 3,3-Dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1,2-benzoisothiazole 1,1-dioxide was prepared in a manner known from the literature (K. Auer, E. Hungerbuhler, R. W. Lang Chimia 1990, 44, 120). 3,3-Diethyl-2,3-dihydro-1,2-benzoisothiazole 1,1-dioxide (m.p.: 174 C.), 3,3-dimethyl-6-nitro-2,3-dihydro-1,2-ben-zoisothiazole 1,1-dioxide (m.p.: 1870) and 3,3-dime-thyl-4-chloro-2,3-dihydro-1,2-benzisothiazole 1,1-dioxide were obtained analogously. c) 2-(2-Chloroethyl)-3,3-dimethyl-2, 3-dihydro-1,2-benzoiso-thiazole 1,1-dioxide 2.1 g (32 mM sic) of 88% KOH powder and 250 mg of benzyltriethylammonium chloride were added to 2.5 g (12.7 mM sic) of 3,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1, 2-benzoisothiazole 1,1-dioxide in 50 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane, and the mixture was refluxed for 1 h. After cooling, the mixture was partitioned between ice-water and methylene chloride and, after making weakly acidic with hydrochloric acid, the organic phase was separated off. After the organic phase had been dried with sodium sulfate and concentrated, 3.2 g (97%) of product were isolated as an oil of adequate purity. 2-(2-Chloroethyl)-3,3-dimethyl-6-nitro-2,3-dihydro-1, 2-benzoisothiazole 1,1-dioxide, 2-(2-chloroethyl)-3, 3-diethyl-2,3-dihydro-1,2-benzoisothiazole 1,1-dioxide and 2-(2-chloroethyl)-4-chloro-3,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1, 2-benzoisothiazole 1,1-dioxide can be prepared in an analogous manner. d) ()-(1S,5R,6S)-Exo-6-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo-3.2.0heptane The ()-enantiomer was isolated by the method in Heterocycles 40 (1), 326 (1995). e) ()-(1S,5R,6S)-Exo-3-(2-chloro) ethyl-6-(4-chloro-phenyl)-3-azabicyclo3.2.0heptane sic 7.3 g (50 mM sic) of 1-bromo-2-chloroethane and 3.5 g (25 mM sic) of finely powdered potassium carbonate were added to 10.0 g (48.2 mM sic) of ()-(1S,5R,6S)-exo-6-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo3.2.0heptane in 200 ml of tetrahydrofuran, and the mixture was refluxed for 15 h. The mixture was then concentrated in a rotary evaporator, and the residue was taken up in 200 ml of methyl tert-butyl ether. The organic phase was washed with water at pH 10 and then the aqueous phase was back-extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether. The combined organic phases were dried with sodium sulfate and then concentrated. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography (silica gel, mobile phase ethyl acetate/n-heptane 1/1). 6.7 g (52%) of product were isolated as an oil with D 91.70 (EtOH). ()-(1S,5R,6S)-Exo-3-(2-chloro)ethyl-6-( 4-fluorophenyl)-3-azabicyclo3.2.0heptane sic was prepared in an analogous manner.

TABLE 1 Compound No. 1 2 3 11 12 15 16 The pharmaceutical utility of compounds of this invention are indicated by the following assay for CRF receptor activity. Assay for CRF Receptor Binding Activity CRF receptor binding was performed using a modified version of the assay described by Grigoriadis and De Souza (Biochemical Pharmacological, and Autoradiographic Methods to Study Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Receptors. Methods in Neurosciences , Vol. 5, 1991). Membrane pellets containing CRF receptors were resuspended in 50 mM Tris buffer pH 7.7 containing 10 mM MgCl 2 and 2 mM EDTA and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 48000 g. Membranes were washed again and brought to a final concentration of 1500 mg/ml in binding buffer (Tris buffer above with 0.1% BSA, 15 mM bacitracin and 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin.). For the binding assay, 100 ml of the membrane preparation was added to 96 well microtube plates containing 100 ml of 125I-CRF (SA 2200 Ci/mmol, final concentration of 100 pM) and 50 ml of drug. Binding was carried out at room temperature for 2 hours. Plates were then harvested on a Brandel 96 well cell harvester and filters were counted for gamma emissions on a Wallac 1205 Betaplate liquid scintillation counter. Non specific binding was defined by 1 mM cold CRF. IC 50 values were calculated with the non-linear curve fitting program RS/1 (BBN Software Products Corp., Cambridge, Mass.). The binding affinity for the compounds of formula I expressed as IC 50 value, generally range from about 0.5 nanomolar (nM) to about 10 micromolar (M) The compounds of general formula I may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation or spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles.

Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol, anhydrides, for example sorbitan monoleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parentally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringers solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. The compounds of general formula I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. Compounds of general formula I may be administered parenterally in a sterile medium. The drug, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants such as local anesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. Dosage levels of the order of from about 0.1 mg to about 140 mg per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions (about 0.5 mg to about 7 g per patient per day). The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is the National Stage filing under 35 U.S.C. 371 based on PCT/IB98/01026, filed internationally on Jul. 3, 1998, which claims priority from PCT/IB97/00917, filed Jul. 23, 1997. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to novel indoles cyclooxygenase inhibitors. The compounds of this invention inhibit the biosynthesis of prostaglandins by intervention of the action of the enzyme cyclooxygenase on arachidonic acid, and are therefore useful in the treatment or alleviation of inflammation and other inflammation associated disorders in mammals. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds. BACKGROUND ART Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in treating pain and the signs and symptoms of arthritis because of their analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. It is accepted that common NSAIDs work by blocking the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX), also known as prostaglandin G/H synthase (PGHS), the enzyme that converts arachidonic acid into prostanoids. Prostaglandins, especially prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), which is the predominant eicosanoid detected in inflammation conditions, are mediators of pain, fever and other symptoms associated with inflammation. Inhibition of the biosynthesis of prostaglandins has been a therapeutic target of anti-inflammatory drug discovery. The therapeutic use of conventional NSAIDs is, however, limited due to drug associated side effects, including life threatening ulceration and renal toxicity. An alternative to NSAIDs is the use of corticosteriods, however, long term therapy can also result in severe side effects. Recently, two forms of COX were identified, a constitutive isoform (COX-1) and an inducible isoform (COX-2) of which expression is upregulated at sites of inflammation (Vane, J. R.; Mitchell, J. A.; Appleton, I.; Tomlinson, A.; Bishop-Bailey, D.; Croxtoll, J.; Willoughby, D. A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1994, 91, 2046). COX-1 is thought to play a physiological role and to be responsible for gastrointestinal and renal protection. On the otherhand, COX-2 appears to play a pathological role and to be the predominant isoform present in inflammation conditions. A pathological role for prostaglandins has been implicated in a number of human disease states including rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, pyrexia, asthma, bone resorption, cardiovascular diseases, nephrotoxicity, atherosclerosis, hypotension, shock, pain, cancer, and Alzheimer disease. The NSAIDs currently on market inhibit both isoforms of COX with little variation for selectivity, explaining their beneficial (inhibition of COX-2) and deleterious effects (inhibition of COX-1). It is believed that compounds that would selectively inhibit the biosynthesis of prostaglandins by intervention of the induction phase of the inducible enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 and/or by intervention of the activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 on arachidonic acid would provide alternate therapy to the use of NSAIDs or corticosteriods in that such compounds would exert anti-inflammatory effects without the adverse side effects associated with COX-1inhibition. A variety of indole compounds are known and are disclosed in several patent applications. Specifically, the International Publication Numbers WO 96/37467 and WO 96/37469 disclose N-benzylindole compounds as cyclooxyenase-2 inhibitors. Also, a variety of indole compounds are disclosed in Khim. Geterotsikl. Soedin. 1990, 11, 1569 by Tolkunov et.al.

General Synthesis A compound of general formula (I) may be prepared by any synthetic procedure applicable to structure-related compounds known to those skilled in the art. The following representative examples as described hereinafter are illustrative of the invention in which, unless otherwise stated, L, Q, X, Y, R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , Z, m, n, p, q and n are as defined herein before. Scheme 1 In one embodiment, a compound of the formula (III) is prepared according to the reaction steps outlined in Scheme 1. The compounds of the formula (III) corresponds to those of the formula (I) wherein R 2 is C(O)R 5 . In the formula (II), B is hydrogen or a suitable protecting group, for example, methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), benzyloxycarbonyl, phenylsulfonyl or p-toluenesulfonyl, or the like. For example, in step 1 of Method A or Method B, a compound of formula (II) is reacted with a compound of formula A 1 C(O)OC(O)A 2 or R 5 C(O)A wherein A 1 and A 2 are independently C 1-4 alkyl, or A 1 and A 2 together form C 1-4 alkylene or C 2-4 alkenylene, and A is defined such that the compound of R 5 C(O)A is, for example, a carboxylic acid halide (ex., chloride and bromide), acyl halide, carboxylic acid, carboxylic acid ester (ex., R 5 C(O)OC 1-4 alkyl and R 5 C(O)O-aryl an example of the aryl is phenyl, naphtyl, furyl and thienyl, a carboxylic acid anhydride, or the like. In the instant example, when a compound of formula R 5 C(O)A is, for example, a carboxylic acid halide (ex., chloride and bromide) or carboxylic acid anhydride the reactants may be heated together in the absence or presence of a reaction inert solvent. Preferred reaction inert solvents include, but are not limited to, benzene, toluene, xylene, o-dichlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, 1,2-dichloroethane, or the like.

Alternatively, when a compound of formula R 5 C(O)A is, for example, a carboxylic acid the intermediate amide obtained from step 1 in either Method A or Method B can be readily prepared by treating the requisite carboxylic acid with a compound of formula (II) in the presence of a coupling reagent such as, but not limited to, 1-(dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (WSC), N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimidazole (DCC), carbonyldiimidazole, cyanophosphonic acid diethyl ester, or the like.

In step 2 of Method B, the intermediate amide (the group B is a suitable protecting group as defined herein above) is reacted with a compound of formula R 1 -D wherein D is a selected from a suitable displaceable group, for example, a halo or sulfonyloxy group, for example, fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy, methanesulfonyloxy, benzenesulfonyloxy or p-toluenesulfonyloxy group. Preferably, the instant reaction is conducted in the presence of a suitable base, for example, an alkali or alkaline earth metal alkoxide, carbonate, or hydride, such as, but not limited to, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydride or potassium hydride.

The compound of formula (IV) (amide) is used for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to limit the scope of the present invention.

A suitable base is, for example, an alkali or alkaline earth metal alkoxide, carbonate, or hydride, such as, but not limited to, sodium tert-butoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydride or potassium hydride.

Commun., 22, 3189 (1992)), or zinc dust or iron in acetic acid (E. Wertheim, Org. Synth. Coll. Vol. 2., 160 (1943)), or by catalytic hydrogenolysis. Preferred catalysts are, for example, palladium-on-charcoal or Raney-Nickel (C. F. H. Allen and J. Vanallan, Org. Synth. Coll. Vol. 3., 63 (1955)). The nitro compound of formula (VIII) is readily accessible by conventional synthetic methods known to those skilled in the art and, of which, are adequately described within the accompanying non-limiting examples.

A number of the compounds of the present invention are capable of forming addition salts with inorganic and organic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid salts of the compounds of the present invention are those which form non-toxic addition salts, such as, but not limited to, the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate or acetate, fumarate, tartrate, succinate, maleate, glucronate, saccharate, benzoate, methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and pamoate (i.e., 1,1-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. The compounds of the invention which have also acidic groups are capable of forming base salts with various pharmaceutically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium or potassium salts. These salts are all prepared by conventional techniques. For example, these salts can be easily prepared by treating the aforementioned compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired pharmaceutically acceptable cation, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferable under reduce pressure. Alternatively, they may be also be prepared by mixing together with a lower alkoxide, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manners as before. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum production of yields of the desired final product. Also included within the scope of this invention are bioprecursors (also called pro-drugs) of the compounds of the formula (I). A bioprecursor of a compound of the formula (I) is a chemical derivative thereof which is readily converted back into the parent compound of the formula (I) in biological systems. In particular, a bioprecursor of a compound of the formula (I) is converted back to the parent compound of the formula (I) after the bioprecursor has been administered to, and absorbed by, a mammalian subject, e.g., a human subject. When the compounds of the formula (I) of this invention may form solvates such as hydrates, such solvates are included within the scope of this invention. The compounds of the formula (I) of this invention can be administered via either the oral, parenteral or topical routes to mammals. In general, these compounds are most desirably administered to humans in doses ranging from 0.01 mg to 100 mg per kg of body weight per day, although variations will necessarily occur depending upon the weight, sex and condition of the subject being treated, the disease state being treated and the particular route of administration chosen. However, a dosage level that is in the range of from 0.1 mg to 10 mg per kg of body weight per day, single or divided dosage is most desirably employed in humans for the treatment of abovementioned diseases. The compounds of the present invention may be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents by either of the above routes previously indicated, and such administration can be carried out in single or multiple doses. More particularly, the novel therapeutic agents of the invention can be administered in a wide variety of different dosage forms, i.e., they may be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, trochees, hard candies, powders, sprays, creams, salves, suppositories, jellies, gels, pastes, lotions, ointments, aqueous suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs, syrups, and the like. Such carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various nontoxic organic solvents, etc. Moreover, oral pharmaceutical compositions can be suitably sweetened and/or flavored. In general, the therapeutically-effective compounds of this invention are present in such dosage forms at concentration levels ranging 5% to 70% by weight, preferably 10% to 50% by weight. For oral administration, tablets containing various excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dipotassium phosphate and glycine may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch and preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates, together with granulation binders like polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatine capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene grycols. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the active ingredient may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes, and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents as well, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various combinations thereof. For parenteral administration, solutions of a compound of the present invention in either sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol may be employed. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably pH8) if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic. These aqueous solutions are suitable for intravenous injection purposes. The oily solutions are suitable for intra-articular, intramuscular and subcutaneous injection purposes. The preparation of all these solutions under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well-known to those skilled in the art. Additionally, it is also possible to administer the compounds of the present invention topically when treating inflammatory conditions of the skin and this may preferably be done by way of creams, jellies, gels, pastes, ointments and the like, in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice. Compounds of the present invention may also be used in co-administration, partially or completely, with other conventional anti-inflammatories, such as, steroids, conventional NSAIDS, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, LTD 4 antagonists, LTB 4 antagonists and LTA 4 hydrolase inhibitors. Suitable conventional anti-inflammatories include but are limited to, for example, indomethacin, diclofenac, piroxicam, nimesulide, tenidap, ebselen, masoprocol, zileuton, pranlukast, zafirlukast, montelukast, tepoxalin, rilopirox, flezelastine hydrochloride, enazadrem phosphate, and bunaprolast. Biological Evaluation The activity of the compounds of the formula (I) of the present invention, is demonstrated by the following assays. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which was characterized by positive staining with von Willibrands factor and an uptake of acetylated low-density lipoproteins, was purchased from Morinaga Bioscience Lab., Yokohama, Japan. HUVEC was maintained in E-GM UV (from Kurashikibouseki Co., Neyagawa, Japan) in 5% CO 2 /95% air at 37 C. PGE 2 , TXB 2 and 6-keto-PGF1 were from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, USA). Recombinant human interleukin-1 (hIL-1) was from RD Systems (Minneapolis, USA). RIA kits for PGE 2 , TXB 2 and 6-keto-PGF1 were from Amersham (Tokyo, Japan). Indomethacin and other reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, USA). Dexamethasone (decadronTrademark) was from Banyu Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). VacutainerTrademark was from Becton Dickinson (Bedford, USA). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River (Hino, Japan). Human Cell Based COX-1 Assay Human peripheral blood obtained from healthy volunteers was diluted to 1/10 volume with 3.8% sodium citrate solution. The platelet-rich plasma immediately obtained was washed with 0.14 M sodium chloride containing 12 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 1.2 mM EDTA. Platelets were then washed with platelet buffer (Hanks buffer (Ca free) containing 0.2% BSA and 20 mM Hepes). Finally, the human washed platelets (HWP) were suspended in platelet buffer at the concentration of 2.8510 7 cells/ml and stored at room temperature until use. The HWP suspension (70 l aliquots, final 2.010 7 cells/ml) was placed in a 96-well U bottom plate and 10 l aliquots of 12.6 mM CaCl2 added. Platelets were incubated with A23187 (final 10 M, Sigma) with test compound (0.1-100 M) dissolved in DMSO (final concentration; less than 0.01%) at 37 C. for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA (final 7.7 mM) and TxB2 in the supernatant quantitated by using a radioimmunoassay kit (Amersham) according to the manufacturers procedure. Human Cell Based COX-2 Assay Inhibition of COX-2 Activity After Induction of COX-2 by hIL-1 The human cell based COX-2 assay was carried out as previously described (Moore et al., 1996). Confluent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, Morinaga) in a 96-well U bottom plate were washed with 100 l of RPMI1640 containing 2% FCS and incubated with hIL-1 (final concentration 300 U/ml, R D Systems) at 37 C. for 24 hr. After washing, the activated HUVECs were stimulated with A23187 (final concentration 30 M) in Hanks buffer containing 0.2% BSA, 20 mM Hepes and test compound (0.1 nM-100 M) dissolved in DMSO (final concentration; less than 0.01%) at 37 C. for 15 min. 6-Keto-PGF1, stable metabolite of PGI2, in the supernatant was quantitated after adequate dilution by using a radioimmunoassay kit (Amersham) according to the manufacturers procedure. Inhibition of COX-2 During the Induction Phase Confluent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, Morinaga) in a 96-well U bottom plate were washed with 100 l of RPMI1640 containing 2% FCS and test compound (0.1 nM-100 M) dissolved in DMSO (final concentration; less than 0.01%), and incubated with hIL-1 (final concentration 300 U/ml, R D Systems) at 37 C. for 24 hr. After washing, the HUVECs were stimulated with A23187 (final concentration 30 M) in Hanks buffer containing 0.2% BSA and 20 mM Hepes at 37 C. for 15 min. 6-Keto-PGF1, a stable metabolite of PGI2, in the supernatant was quantitated after adequate dilution by using a radioimmunoassay kit (Amersham) according to the manufacturers procedure. Carrageenan Induced Foot Edema in Rats Male Sprague-Dawley rats (5 weeks old, Charles River Japan) were fasted overnight. A line was drawn using a marker above the ankle on the right hind paw and the paw volume (V0) was measured by water displacement using a plethysmometer (Muromachi). Animals were given orally either vehicle (0.1% methyl cellulose or 5% Tween 80) or a test compound (2.5 ml per 100 g body weight). One hour later, the animals were then injected intradermally with -carrageenan (0.1 ml of 1% w/v suspension in saline, Zushikagaku) into right hind paw (Winter et al., 1962; Lombardino et al., 1975) and three hours later, the paw volume (V3) was measured and the increase in volume (V3V0) calculated. Since maximum inhibition attainable with classical NSAIDs is 60-70%, ED 30 values were calculated. Gastric Ulceration in Rats The gastric ulcerogenicity of test compound was assessed by a modification by the conventional method (Ezer et al., 1976; Cashin et al., 1977). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (5 weeks old, Charles River Japan), fasted overnight, were given orally either vehicle (0.1% methyl cellulose or 5% Tween 80) or a test compound (1 ml per 100 g body weight). Six hours after, the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The stomachs were removed and inflated with 1% formalin solution (10 ml). Stomachs were opened by cutting along the greater curvature. From the number of rats that showed at least one gastric ulcer or haemorrhaging erosion (including ecchymosis), the incidence of ulceration was calculated. Animals did not have access to either food or water during the experiment. Data Analysis Statistical program packages, SYSTAT (SYSTAT, INC.) and StatView (Abacus Cencepts, Inc.) for Macintosh were used. Differences between test compound treated group and control group were tested for using ANOVA. The IC 50 (ED 30 ) values were calculated from the equation for the log-linear regression line of concentration (dose) versus percent inhibition. Most compounds prepared in the Working Examples as described herein after were tested by these methods, and showed IC 50 values of 0.0001 M to 15 M with respect to inhibition of COX-2. COX-2 selectivity can be determined by ratio in terms of IC 50 value of COX-1 inhibition to COX-2 inhibition. In general, it can be said that a compound showing a COX-2/COX-1 inhibition ratio of more than 2 has good COX-2 selectivity. Some compounds prepared in Examples showed COX-2/COX-1 inhibition ratio of more than 10. The following examples contain detailed descriptions of the methods of the preparation of compounds of formula (I). These detailed descriptions fall within the scope, and serve to exemplify, the above described General Synthetic Procedures which form part of the invention.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel anilide derivatives and antiarrhythmic agents containing them as an active ingredient. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART Cardiac arrhythmia can be divided into two large groups; ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmia. There are many antiarrhythmic agents already in market in order to suppress and prevent these arrhythmia. According to the classification system by Vaughan Williams, these agents can be classified into Class I suppressing the sodium channel in cardiac muscle, Class II being the -blocker, Class III suppressing the potassium channel and Class IV suppressing calcium channel. Ventricular arrhythmia sometimes causes severe blood circulation failure due to the function of ventricle to deliver blood to arteria and thus arrhythmia such as severe ventricular flutter and fibrillation is fatal. Therefore, a large scale clinical trials such as CAST (Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial) with Class I drugs such as Flecainide and Encainide and SWORD (Survival With Oral d-Sotalol Trial) with Class III drugs such as d-Sotalol in order to prove that prevention of ventricular arrhythmia results in decrease in mortality of patients. However, results obtained indicated that treatment with these drugs make worse vital prognosis rather than placebo group and gave a warning for use of antiarrhythmic agents at random. Suppression of cardiac function by antiarrhythmic agents when they acted on ventricle and occurrence of new arrhythmia by effect of drugs so called proarrhythmia have been considered as a cause of such aggravation of vital prognosis. According to mode-of-action of existing antiarrhythmic agents, those belong to Classes I, II and IV essentially act on cardiac function as suppresser and those belong to Classes I and III pose a risk of proarrhythmia, therefore a new type of antiarrhythmic agent has been required. On the other hand, supraventricular arrhythmia is very rare to become directly lethal, but in particular, atrial arrhythmia such as atrial flutter and fibrillation is very high in incidence, causes poor QOL (Quality of Life) problem because of giving strong subjective symptoms such as palpitation, gasping and heart pains, and could move to ventricular arrhythmia which endangers to ones life if it leaves without medical care. For chronic atrial fibrillation, it is well known that blood aggregate as a risk factor of cerebral thrombosis is readily formed due to intra-atrial congestion. Class I drugs are mainly used for atrial arrhythmia, and Class III drugs and Class II drugs may be used for atrial fibrillation associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sympathicotonic atrial fibrillation, respectively. However, antiarrhythmic agent which selectively acts on atria is not available, so that the same antiarrhythmic agents being used for ventricular arrhythmia are used for atrial arrhythmia. Therefore, they also act on ventricle and have potential risks such as suppression of cardiac function, proarrhythmia and moreover aggravation of vital prognosis by chronic administration. These potential risks are serious problems because atrial arrhythmia itself is not lethal arrhythmia. Moreover, due to dose limitation to avoid side effect, suppression and prevention effects of atrial arrhythmia is not satisfactory for existing antiarrhythmic agents (Medicine and Drug Journal, Vol. 30, No. 9, 24-81, 1994). Japanese Patent Laid-Open (Kokai) No. 125032/76 describes 4-2-(isopropylamino) ethoxy acetanilide and 4-2-(cyclohexylamino) ethoxy acetanilide as an example compound which are similar to the anilide derivatives having antiarrhythmic effect in the present invention. This document describes that these compounds act suppressively on ventricular function. In addition, these compounds differ from the anilide derivatives represented by Formula (1) in the present invention in the point that their R 1 is alkyl group. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object to be solved according to the present invention is to provide a new type of antiarrhythmic agent free from ventricular function suppression and proarrhythmia and being highly safe. As the results of active investigation conducted by the present inventors to achieve the above object, the present inventors have found that novel anilide derivatives having specific structure possess following pharmacological characteristics: (1) Exhibit suppression and prevention effects of arrhythmia at dose levels from 0.3 to 10 mg/kg in aconitin-induced atrial fibrillation model and vagal atrial fibrillation model in anaesthetized dogs as well as in sterile pericarditis atrial flutter model in conscious dogs. (2) Many compounds extend the effective refractory period of atria, but do not obviously affect on these of ventricle. (3) Do not obviously affect on action potential in Purkinjes fiber in dogs. (4) Do not obviously affect on cardiac blood circulation behavior and electrocardiogram in both anaesthetized and conscious dogs. (5) Very weak side effect in acute toxicity and in central nervous system except for cardiac system. Based on above findings, the present invention providing new type of antiarrhythmic agents free from effects on ventricular function and having superior effectiveness particularly to atrial arrhythmia has been completed. Thus, the present invention relates to anilide derivatives expressed by formula (1): wherein: R 1 represents a phenyl group (except for monoalkoxy phenyl group) having one or two substituents selected from C 1-3 alkoxy, C 1-3 alkyl, C 1-3 alkanesulfonamido and C 1-3 alkanesulfonyl groups, a furyl group, a 2,3,4,5-tetrahydrofuryl group, a 3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2H-pyranyl group or (HC 2 ) n OR 6 (wherein, n represents an integral number 2 or 3, R 6 represents a C 1-4 alkyl group), R 2 and R 3 represent independently a hydrogen atom, a C 1-3 alkoxy group, a C 1-3 alkyl group, or a C 1-3 alkanesulfonamido group, R 4 and R 5 represent independently a hydrogen atom, a C 1-4 alkyl group, a C 3-6 cycloalkyl group, or (CH 2 ) n OR 6 (wherein, n represents an integral number 2 or 3, R 6 represents a C 1-4 alkyl group), or R 4 and R 5 together form (CH 2 ) 2 W(CH 2 ) 2 (wherein, W represents a direct bond, a methylene bridge or an oxygen atom); or their pharmacologically acceptable salts. The present invention relates also to antiarrhythmic agents containing one or more of the above anilide derivatives and their pharmacologically acceptable salts. The present invention provides antiarrhythmic agents free from any effects on ventricular function. These antiarrhythmic agents are free from any risks such as cardiac function suppression and proarrhythmia, highly safe and particularly useful as therapeutic agent for atrial arrhythmia.

The compound 0.1 g was dissolved into physiological saline 5 ml. The solution obtained was sterilized through filter and filled into ampoules to obtain injectable doses. Pharmacological Trial 1: Evaluation of effectiveness in aconitin-induced atrial fibrillation model (dogs) Evaluation was performed according to K. Hashimoto (Jpn. J. Pharmacol., Vol. 46, 349-358, 1988) as follows: Method: Dog was anesthetized and thoracotomy was made. Persistent atrial fibrillation was induced by placing a piece of filter paper impregnated with 0.5% aconitin solution (20 to 30 l) on the right atrium. Test substance dissolved into physiological saline was intravenously administered to dogs exhibiting atrial fibrillation and the minimum dose level which suppresses atrial fibrillation was determined. Onset and suppression of atrial fibrillation were monitored electrocardiographically by placing AgAgCl bipolar electrode on the right atrial auricle. Results: Each compound in Examples 1 to 87 suppressed atrial fibrillation at least following dose level (all compounds were used in the form of hydrochloride). Compounds suppressed atrial fibrillation at the dose level of 0.3 mg/kg Compounds in Examples 29, 40 and 55 Compounds suppressed atrial fibrillation at the dose level of 10 mg/kg Compounds in Examples 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 24, 25, 26, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 39, 41, 45, 46, 49, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 68, 75, 77, 79, 82, 83 and 87 Compounds suppressed atrial fibrillation at the dose level of 3.0 mg/kg Compounds in Examples 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 19, 22, 23, 27, 28, 34, 37, 38, 42, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 66, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 76, 78, 80, 81 and 86 Compounds suppressed atrial fibrillation at the dose level of 10 mg/kg Compounds in Examples 1, 20, 43, 44, 84 and 85 Pharmacological Trial 2: Evaluation of Effects on Ventricle Method: Purkinjes fiber specimen excised from the right ventricular free wall of dog, perfused with normal Tyrode solution and driven by electrical stimulation (fundamental frequency1 Hz) was used. Standard glass microelectrode was used to record action potential. After measurement of the maximum rate of rise for action potential (Vmax), duration to repolarize 50% (APD50), 75% (APD75) and 90% (APD90), Tyrode solution was replaced by Tyrode solution spiked with test or reference substance and again the same parameter was measured. Results: All compounds in Examples 1 to 87 (used as hydrochloride) did not affect on action potential of Purkinjes fiber with less than 10% of changes at the concentration of 30 M. On the other hand, representative existing antiarrhythmic agents Flecanide (Class Ic) suppressed Vmax by 30% at 3 M and Disopyramido (Class Ia) suppressed Vmax by 33% at 30 M. Dofetilide (Class III) extended APD50, APD75 and APD90 by 57, 45 and 42%, respectively, at the concentration of 10 M. 4-2-(Isopropylamino)ethoxyacetanilide hydrochloride referred here as Reference 1 and disclosed in Tokkai-Sho 51-125032 suppressed Vmax by 15% at concentration of 30 M. Thus, all compounds according to the present invention did not affect on ventricle, unlike existing drugs. Pharmacological Trial 3: Safety evaluation by simple acute toxicity test in mice Method: Groups of three ddY male mice were dosed at single dose level of 50 mg/kg with intravenous injection of test substance solution in saline into caudal vein. Animals were observed for clinical signs for one hour after dosing and mortality was observed 48 hours after dosing. Results: In all groups treated with test substances in Examples 1 to 87 (used as hydrochloride), no death nor any abnormal behavior was observed. What is claimed is: 1.

No. 5,922,618 and a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 08/745,337 filed Nov. 8, 1996, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,965,713. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a dye-labeled protein conjugate prepared by binding an antibody to a protein to form a protein complex or conjugate and labelling the conjugate with a cyanine dye, and further to a method for preparing the same. The dye-labeled antibody, which is obtained by labeling an antibody with a dye, specifically reacts with an antigen included in a sample solution and is readily recognizable with naked eyes. The dye-labeled antibodies are accordingly applied for immunosensors, each of which takes advantage of an immunological antigen-antibody reaction to detect a target substance included in a sample solution, and are used for diagnoses in a variety of medical institutions. Cyanine dyes having the high molar absorption coefficient and the high reactivity are often used to label antibodies (Bioconjugate Chemistry Vol. 4, No. 2, pp105-111, 1993). The functional group of the cyanine dye reacts with and is covalently bound to an amino group or a carboxyl group included in an antibody, and 20 to 50 molecules of the dye are attached to one molecule of the antibody. The cyanine dye-labeled antibody thus prepared generally has high visual recognizability, and is effectively applied for, for example, immunochromatography to detect a small amount of a specific substance, such as human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) that is present only in the urine of pregnant women. The antibody generally includes several hundreds to several thousands of amino group or carboxyl group. The antibody has a three-dimensional steric configuration and thereby has only 50 groups that are related to the reaction. Namely only 50 molecules of the dye are bound to one molecule of the antibody. When the dye-labeled antibody is applied for an immunosensor, it is accordingly difficult to detect a target substance having a low concentration. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is thus to provide a dye-labeled protein conjugate that is labeled with a large number of dye molecules. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing the dye-labeled protein conjugate. The present invention provides a dye-labeled protein conjugate comprising a protein, an antibody bound to the protein via a disulfide bond to form a protein conjugate, and a cyanine dye represented by the formula (1) given below, the protein conjugate being labeled with the cyanine dye. where R 1 and R 2 denote hydrogen or an alkyl group, X denotes a halogen, M denotes hydrogen or an alkali metal, and n represents an integer of 1 to 4. Binding a protein to the antibody extends the area of the antibody that can be linked with the cyanine dye, and thereby increases the number of cyanine dye molecules bound to the protein conjugate, compared with a single body of the antibody. The number of dye molecules bound to one molecule of the antibody in the protein conjugate is, for example, about 10 times that of the antibody in the single body. The dye-labeled protein conjugate accordingly has high visual recognizability. When the dye-labeled protein conjugate of the present invention is applied for, for example, immunochromatography, the immunochromatography can detect a target substance (sample) with high sensitivity even when the sample has a low concentration. Because of the high sensitivity, the dye-labeled protein conjugate of the present invention is applicable for biosensors. In accordance with one preferable application of the dye-labeled protein conjugate of the present invention, a skeleton of the cyanine dye is bound to the protein conjugate via a covalent bond of an acyl carbon originated from a succinimidyl group in the cyanine dye with a nitrogen originated from an amino group in the protein conjugate. The present invention is also directed to a method for preparing a dye-labeled protein conjugate. The method comprises the steps of: reducing a protein in a neutral or weak alkaline phosphate buffer solution; adding an antibody to the buffer solution to prepare a protein conjugate; and adding a cyanine dye represented by the formula (1) given above to the buffer solution to label the protein conjugate with the cyanine dye. The present invention is further directed to another method for preparing a dye-labeled protein conjugate. The method comprises the steps of: reducing a protein in a neutral or weak alkaline phosphate buffer solution; adding a cyanine dye represented by the formula (1) given above to the buffer solution to label the reduced protein with the cyanine dye; and adding an antibody to the buffer solution to make the antibody bound to the reduced protein. In accordance with one preferable application, the method includes the step of labeling the antibody with succinimidyl pyridyl dithiopropionate represented by the formula (2) given below in a neutral or weak alkaline phosphate buffer solution, prior to the step of making the antibody bound to the reduced protein. In any of the above methods, it is preferable that the phosphate buffer solution has a pH value in a range of 7.0 to 8.0. The antibody used to prepare the dye-labeled protein conjugate of the present invention is not specifically restricted, but may have a variety of origins and sub-classes. Available examples of the antibody include immunoglobulins (Ig), such as mouse IgG, mouse IgM, mouse IgA, mouse IgE, rat IgG, rat IgM, rat IgA, rat IgE, rabbit IgG, rabbit IgM, rabbit IgA, rabbit IgE, goat IgG, goat IgM, goat IgE, goat IgA, sheep IgG, sheep IgM, sheep IgA, and sheep IgE. These antibodies may be of commercial origin or directly collected from the corresponding animals. The protein bound to the antibody may be any protein that does not exert the function as the antibody. The protein having high solubility in water is especially preferable. For example, serum-originated albumin that does not inhibit the reaction of the antibody and has high water solubility is preferably used. The cyanine dye represented by the formula (1) is a red dye readily recognizable with naked eyes. The cyanine dye has a less number of conjugated carbons and thereby has the highest solubility in water among a variety of cyanine dyes. The halogen represented by X in the formula (1) may be fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. The metal represented by M may be lithium, sodium, or potassium. While the novel features of the invention are set forth particularly in the appended claims, the invention, both as to organization and content, will be better understood and appreciated, along with other objects and features thereof, from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following describes the mechanism of binding the cyanine dye to the antibody. When the antibody is mixed with the cyanine dye having a succinimidyl group, an amino group in the antibody approaches an ester bond of the succinimidyl group in the dye as shown by the formula (3). The amino group reacts with the ester bond as shown by the formula (4), so that one hydrogen atom is released from the amino group. The hydrogen atom released from the amino group is attached to succinimide in the succinimidyl group. Succinimide is then changed to hydroxysuccinimide, which is released from the succinimidyl group. At the same time, the residue of the succinimidyl group and the hydrogen atom-released amino group combine to form an amide bond, through which the dye is linked with the antibody. The following describes one exemplified process of synthesizing the cyanine dye represented by the formula (1) given above. The process first dissolves hydrazinobenzenesulfonic acid (5) and isopropyl methyl ketone in an acidic solvent and heats the mixture to obtain indoleniumsulfonate (6). The process then adds a metal hydroxide-saturated alcohol solution into an alcohol solution of indoleniumsulfonate (6), so as to yield a metal salt of indoleniumsulfonate (7). The process subsequently adds a halogenized fatty acid to an organic solvent solution of the metal salt (7) and heats the mixture to obtain a metal salt of carboxyalkylindoleniumsulfonate (8). By taking into account the solubility in water, it is preferable that the halogenized fatty acid has one to four carbon atoms. The process then dissolves the metal salt (8) and N-carboxyethyl-3, 3-dimethylindolenine into a basic organic solvent and heats the mixture to prepare a carboxylic acid derivative (9). The process subsequently adds hydroxysuccinimide and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide as a condensing agent to the organic solvent solution of the carboxylic acid derivative (9) and well stirs the mixture to yield the cyanine dye represented by the formula (1). The halogen included in the respective compounds represented by the formula (1), the formula. (8), and the formula (9) may be fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. The metal included in the respective compounds represented by the formula (1) and the formulae (7) through (9) may be lithium, sodium, or potassium. The present invention is described more in detail with concrete examples. EXAMPLE 1 (1) Labeling Mouse IgG with Succinimidyl Pyridyl Dithiopropionate The process first dissolved 5 mg (3.3105 mmol) of mouse IgG (hereinafter simply referred to as IgG) into 2 ml of a phosphate buffer solution(hereinafter referred to as PBS). The process then added dropwise 0.1 ml of an ethanol solution containing succinimidyl pyridyl dithiopropionate (hereinafter referred to as SPDP) with stirring at room temperature. The ethanol solution of SPDP added dropwise contained 0.52 mg (1.6710 3 mmol) of SPDP. After stirring the mixed solution at room temperature for 30 minutes, the process filtered the mixed solution through a Sepharose gel (manufactured by Pharmacia Fine Chemical Inc., Sephadex G25M column). This gave approximately 6 ml of the PBS solution containing SPDP-labeled IgG (hereinafter referred to as IgG-SPDP). The concentration of the PBS solution thus obtained and the number of SPDP molecules bound to the antibody were determined by the process discussed below. The procedure collected 0.5 ml of the PBS solution and measured the absorbance at 280 nm. The observed absorbance was 1.25. The procedure then added 0.025 ml of an aqueous solution containing 100 mM dithiothreitol (hereinafter referred to as DTT) to the PBS solution. After the mixed solution was stood still for one minute, the absorbance was measured at 343 nm. The observed absorbance was 0.39. Since IgG does not have absorption at 343 nm, the observed absorbance at 343 nm is attributed to thiopyridone released by reduction with DTT. The released thiopyridone is obtained by reducing a pyridyldithio group in the SPDP. The concentration of the released thiopyridone is identical with the concentration of the SPDP bound to the antibody. The concentration SPDP of the SPDP is thus determined by the following equation. Here the molar absorption coefficient of thiopyridone at 343 nm is set equal to 8.0810 3 . SPDP0.39/(8.0810 3 )4.8310 5 (M) The observed absorbance at 280 nm is originated from IgG. The bound SPDP, however, also has absorption at 280 nm. The concentration IgG of IgG is accordingly determined by subtracting the effect of this absorption. Here Ab 280,IgG represents the absorbance attributed to IgG at 280 nm, the molar absorption coefficient of SPDP at 280 nm is set equal to 5.110 3 , and the molar absorption coefficient of IgG at 280 nm is 2.1010 5 . Ab 280,IgG 1.25(4.8310 5 5.110 3 )1.00 IgG 1.00/(2.1010 5 )4.7810 6 (M) The number of SPDP molecules bound to one IgG molecule is accordingly given by: SPDP/IgG 4.8310 5 /4.7810 6 10.1 (2) Reducing Bovine Serum Albumin with Dithiothreitol The process dissolved 110 mg of bovine serum albumin (hereinafter referred to as BSA) in 10 ml of PBS, added 77 mg of DTT dissolved in 1 ml of PBS to the serum albumin-PBS solution, and stirred the mixed solution at room temperature for 15 minutes. The process quickly filtered the mixed solution through a gel, Sephadex G25M column. This gave approximately 24 ml of the PBS solution containing BSA (SH-free). (3) Preparing Protein Conjugate (IgG-SPDP-BSA) The (SH-free) BSA solution was quickly mixed with the PBS solution (6 ml) containing IgG-SPDP. After the mixed solution was stood still at 4 C. for 20 hours, the process dialyzed the mixed solution against 20 liters (5 liters4) of a PBS solution containing sodium azide as an antiseptics (hereinafter referred to as PBS.Az), in order to remove unreacted BSA. This gave approximately 25 ml of the PBS solution containing IgG-SPDP-BSA. (4) Labeling Protein Conjugate (IgG-SPDP-BSA) with Dye The process dissolved 122.7 mg of the cyanine dye represented by the formula (1) into 1 ml of PBS (400 equivalents of the total protein quantity) to obtain a dye solution (hereinafter referred to as SLIC1). The cyanine dye included iodine as X, potassium as M, and 2 carbon atoms as n in the formula (1). The process slowly added the SLIC1 dropwise to the IgG-SPDP-BSA solution (total protein quantity: 3.1810 4 mmol) obtained in the process (3). After the mixed solution was stood still at 4 C. for 20 hours, the process dialyzed the mixed solution against 20 liters of the PBS.Az, in order to remove unreacted dye molecules. This gave approximately 26 ml of the PBS solution containing the SLIC1-labeled protein conjugate. The number of SLIC1 molecules bound to one molecule of the protein conjugate in the SLIC1-labeled protein conjugate was determined according to the following procedure. The observed absorbance of the resultant solution was 80 at 430 nm. The IgG-SPDP-BSA does not have absorption at 430 nm, so that the observed absorbance at 430 nm is attributed to the SLIC1 bound to the protein conjugate. The concentrationSLIC1 of the SLIC1 is thus determined by the following equation. Here the molar absorption coefficient of SLIC1 at 430 nm is set equal to 110 5 . SLIC 180/110 5 8.010 4 (M) The number of SLIC1 molecules bound to one molecule of the protein conjugate is calculated by the following equation: SLIC 1/IgG8.010 4 /1.0610 6 755 where the concentration IgG of IgG in the PBS solution containing the SLIC1-labeled protein conjugate is set equal to 1.0610 6 M (on the assumption that there is no loss of IgG in each step after the SPDP labeling). EXAMPLE 2 (1) Labeling IgG with SPDP IgG was labeled with SPDP according to the method discussed in Example 1. The total volume was 6 ml, the concentration of IgG was 4.1010 6 M, and the number of SPDP molecules per one IgG molecule was 11.5. (2) Preparing BSA-SLIC1 The process dissolved 110 mg (1.6210 3 mmol) of BSA into 10 ml of PBS, and slowly added 1 ml of the SLIC1 dropwise to the PBS solution with stirring at room temperature. The SLIC1 added dropwise contained 162.7 mg (0.162 mmol, 100 equivalents) of the dye identical with that of Example 1. After being stirred overnight at 4 C., the mixed solution was dialyzed against 20 liters (5 liters4) of the PBS.Az. This gave 6 ml of the PBS solution containing the SLIC1-labeled BSA. The concentration of the resultant solution and the number of SLIC1 molecules bound to one BSA molecule were determined according to the following procedure. The observed absorbance of the resultant solution was 9.6 at 280 nm and 59.0 at 430 nm. The BSA does not have absorption at 430 nm, so that the observed absorbance at 430 nm is attributed to the SLIC1 bound to the BSA. The concentration SLIC1 of the SLIC1 is thus determined by the following equation. Here the molar absorption coefficient of SLIC1 at 430 nm is set equal to 110 5 . SLIC 159.0/110 5 5.910 4 (M) The observed absorbance at 280 nm is originated from the BSA. The bound SLIC1, however, also has absorption at 280 nm. The concentration BSA of the BSA is accordingly determined by subtracting the effect of this absorption. Here Ab280,BSA represents the absorbance attributed to the BSA at 280 nm, the molar absorption coefficient of the SLIC1 at 280 nm is set equal 9.810 3 , and the molar absorption coefficient of the BSA at 280 nm is 4.3610 4 . Ab 280,BSA 9.6(5.910 4 9.8 10 3 )3.818 BSA 3.818/4.3610 4 8.7610 5 (M) The number of SLIC1 molecules bound to one BSA molecule accordingly given by: SLIC 1/BSA5.910 4 /8.7610 5 6.7 (3) Reducing BSA-SLIC1 with DTT The process added 100 mg of DTT (final concentration: 50 mm dissolved in 1 ml of PBS to the BSA-SLIC1 solution (110 mg, 13 ml) and stirred the mixed solution at room temperature for 15 minutes. The process quickly filtered the mixed solution through a gel, Sephadex G25M column. This gave approximately 24 ml of the PBS solution containing the BSA-SLIC1 (SH-free). (4) Preparing Dye-Labeled Protein Conjugate The (SH-free) BSA-SLIC1 solution and the SPDP-labeled IgG solution were mixed, stirred overnight at 4 C., and dialyzed against 20 liters of the PBS Az in order to remove unreacted BSA-SLIC1. This gave approximately 30 ml of the PBS solution containing the dye-labeled protein conjugate. The number of SLIC1 molecules bound to one molecule of the protein conjugate in the SLIC1-labeled protein conjugate was determined according to the following procedure. The observed absorbance of the resultant solution at 430 nm was 30.2. The IgG does not have absorption at 430 nm, so that the observed absorbance at 430 nm is attributed to the SLIC1 bound to the BSA. The concentration SLIC1 of the SLIC1 is thus determined by the following equation. Here the molar absorption coefficient of SLIC1 at 430 nm is set equal to 110 5 . SLIC 130.2/110 5 3.0210 4 (M) The number of SLIC1 molecules bound to one molecule of the protein conjugate is calculated by the following equation: SLIC 1 /IgG 3.0210 4 /8.2010 7 368 where the concentration IgG of IgG in the PBS solution containing the SLIC1-labeled protein conjugate is set equal to 8.2010 7 M (on the assumption that there is no loss of IgG in each step after the SPDP labeling). As described above, in the dye-labeled protein conjugate of the preset invention, the number of dye molecules bound to one protein molecule is approximately 10 times that in the conventional single body of the antibody.

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to rare-earth complexes, ligands useful for these complexes, optically functional materials comprising the rare-earth complex, and a process for preparing the rare-earth complex. BACKGROUND ART With remarkable advances in developing electronic materials, many developments have been made in optically functional materials in the field of optoelectronics. For example, neodymium-containing glass has been introduced into actual use in laser beam electronic devices, whereas the glass has found only limited use because of the difficulties encountered in producing and working the glass and a high production cost. The dye laser, which can be used in the form of a solution, has the excellent features of being inexpensive, easy to work and cool and continuously usable for a prolonged period of time. However, the dye laser is low in strength and therefore limited in application. On the other hand, organic optical materials such as polyphenylene have the drawback of being short in luminescence life and diminished in the effectiveness of luminescence although superior to inorganic optical materials in workability. It is already known that a complex Nd III (HFA) 3 comprising Nd 3 and three molecules of hexafluoroacetylacetone (HFA) coordinated therewith and having heavy hydrogen substituted for the hydrogen of active methylene luminesces in the state of a solution S. Yanagida et al., J. Phys. Chem., 100, 10201(1996). This complex is short in luminescence life and low in quantum yield and decomposes in the presence of a very small amount of water to lose its optical conversion function. It has therefore been desired to develop complexes having a high luminescence intensity and good stability. An object of the present invention is to provide rare-earth complexes having excellent luminescence characteristics, compounds useful as ligands for these complexes, optically functional materials containing the rare-earth complex and a process for preparing such rare-earth complexes. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows 13 C-NMR spectra of (a) POS and (b) Nd(POS) 3 . FIG. 2 shows an absorption spectrum of Nd(POS) 3 in CD 3 OD. FIG. 3 is a luminescence spectrum of Nd(POS) 3 in acetone-d 6 .

X is one of Group IVA atoms such as Si, Ge, Sn and Pb, Group VA atoms other than N and including P, As, Sb and Bi, and Group VIA atoms other than O and including S, Se, Te and Po, and is preferably S, P or Se. Y is N, P, As, Sb or Bi, and is preferably N or P. n 1 is 2 or 3, preferably 3. n 2 is. 2 to 4, preferably 2 or 3, more preferably 3. n 3 is 0 or 1, preferably 1. n 3 is 1 especially when X is S. The ligand of the formula (III) to be incorporated into the complex of the invention is prepared, for example, in the following manner. wherein R, X, Y and n 3 are as defined above. A compound (2) is reacted with hexamethyldisilazane for trimethylsilylation, and the resulting compound is reacted with a compound (1) to obtain the desired compound of the formula (III). The reaction Eproceeds favorably when effected for about 1 to about 5 hours at room temperature to a temperature generally permitting reflux of the solvent, using about 1 to about 1.1 moles of hexamethyldisilazane and about 1 mole of the compound (1) are used per mole of the compound (2). The complex of the present invention represented by the formula (I) can be prepared by mixing together the compound represented by the formula (III) and at least one rare-earth metal compound selected from the group consisting of a rare-earth metal oxide, rare-earth metal hydroxide, rare-earth metal alkoxide, rare-earth metal amide and rare-earth metal salt, for example, in a solvent. More specifically, the rare-earth complex represented by the formula (I) can be prepared by the process to be described below. The ligand of the formula (III) is dissolved in a solvent, the rare-earth metal compound (particulate, granular or in any other form) is added to the solution, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature to 100 C. for about 1 hour to about 100 hours. The product is then purified as by crystallization or liquid-liquid extraction, whereby the rare-earth complex can be obtained. The complex may further be recrystallized from a solvent such as chloroform or methanol. Examples of rare-earth metal oxides useful as rare-earth metal compounds are trivalent compounds M 2 O 3 (wherein M is a rare-earth atom), while other oxides such as MO and M 4 O 7 are also usable. Similarly, examples of rare-earth metal hydroxides include M(OH)n 1 ; examples of rare-earth metal alkoxides include M(OR 1 )n 1 (wherein R 1 is alkyl); examples of rare-earth metal amides include M(NR a R b ) 3 (wherein R a and R b are the same or different and are each hydrogen, alkyl or phenyl); and examples of rare-earth metal salts include M 3 (Z)n 1 wherein Z is an anion such as chlorine ion, bromine ion, iodine ion, fluorine ion, sulfate ion, nitrate ion, acetate ion or like monocarboxylate ion, (oxalate ion, succinate ion, malonate ion or like dicarboxylate ion), (citrate or like tricarboxylate ion) or phosphate ion. n 1 is as defined above. The solvent to be used in preparing the complex of the formula (I) is not limited specifically but can be any solvent such as a protic solvent or aprotic solvent. Examples of useful protic solvents are water and alcoholic solvents such as methanol and ethanol. Examples of useful aprotic solvents are acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and like ketone solvents, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and like ether solvents, chloroform, methylene chloride and like halogen solvents, DMSO, DMF, etc. Preferable among these is water. The solvent is used in an amount, for example, of about 1 to about 100 parts by weight, preferably about 1 to about 20 parts by weight, relative to the combined amount of the ligand and the rare-earth metal compound (taken as 1 part by weight). The complex of the formula (II) can be obtained by reacting the rare-earth metal compound with an equivalent or excess of RX(O)n 3 1 (OH), which is a known substance, in water. The complex of the formula (II) is susceptible to coordination with H 2 O, loses the properties for use as an optically functional material when having coordinated H 2 O and is therefore less stable to H 2 O than the complex of the formula (I). If incorporating coordinated H 2 O, the complex of the formula (II) can be treated with D 2 O when to be used to remove the H 2 O for use as an optically functional material. The rare-earth metal compound is used for preparing the rare-earth complex of the formula (I) in an amount of 1 to 10 equivalents, preferably 1.05 to 3 equivalents, per equivalent of the ligand of the formula (III). The rare-earth complex of the formula (II) can be prepared from the compounds mentioned as used in a similar mixing ratio. In the case where the rare-earth complex represented by the formula (II) contains coordinated water, the complex is treated, for example, in the following manner. MeOD is added to a sample of the complex, the sample/MeOD mixture is frozen and then allowed to stand in a vacuum at room temperature for about 24 hours, and the methanol is subsequently distilled off to convert the coordinated H 2 O to D 2 O. The complex sample substituted with heavy hydrogen is thereafter dissolved in a dry organic solvent containing no hydrogen atoms (with all hydrogen atoms replaced by heavy hydrogen, halogen atoms or the like) for use as an optically functional material. Organic solvents containing heavy hydrogen, such as DMSO, methanol, acetone, THF, DMF and chloroform which are substituted with heavy hydrogen, or hydrogen-free solvents such as carbon tetrachloride are desirable since these solvents give complex a prolonged luminescence life. The rare-earth complex represented by the formula (I) is especially preferable since the complex is usable as dissolved directly in a dry solvent containing no hydrogen atoms without necessitating any procedure for converting coordinated H 2 O to D 2 O. On the other hand, the rare-earth complex represented by the formula (II) requires the conversion of the coordinated H 2 O to D 2 O. Examples of solvents for use in the luminescence method of the invention for dissolving the complex of the formula (I) are ketone compounds such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone, lower alcohols such as methanol and ethanol, water, ethers such as ether, THF, isopropyl ether, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene, hydrocarbon halides such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and tetrachloroethane, DMF, DMSO, acetamide, formamide and esters such as ethyl acetate, glycols such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, etc. The solvent may be one containing hydrogen atoms such as DMSO or acetone, whereas organic solvents containing heavy hydrogen, such as DMSO, methanol, acetone, THF, DMF and chloroform which are substituted with heavy hydrogen, or hydrogen-free solvents such as carbon tetrachloride are desirable since these solvents give complex a prolonged luminescence life. In place of the organic dye of an organic dye laser, the rare-earth complex of the present invention is usable as an optically functional material (element, electronic device or the like) under the same conditions as the organic dye laser. For example, the rare-earth complex of the invention is usable as dissolved, dispersed or suspended in a solvent under the specified conditions as to concentration (about 0.00001 to about 1 mole/liter, preferably about 0.005 to about 0.5 mole/liter, more preferably about 0.01 to about 0.3 mole/liter) and temperature (50 C. to room temperature). Although usable in the form of a liquid, the complex of the invention can also be used as an optically functional material in a solid state, for example, as dissolved or dispersed in a polymer. The complex of the present invention achieves a high optical conversion efficiency and is useful as a novel laser material for use in optical devices such as CD players, optical disks, facsimile systems, remote controllers, copying machines, laser printers, large-sized displays, medical lasers, laser beam machining and measuring means and devices relating to printing. Stated more specifically, the complex is applicable to laser devices, light-emitting diodes, liquid crystals, optical fibers, optical sensors, solar cells, etc. The complex of the invention can be adapted to alter the wavelength of the laser beam when modified or changed in the structure of ligand and/or in the kind of rare-earth element, affording a laser for giving a beam of desired wavelength. Unlike semiconductors, the complex of the invention can be used for preparing laser materials by a greatly simplified process without necessitating a clean room or the like.

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a pyridone derivative or a salt thereof, which exhibits acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) inhibitory activity, and is useful as an agent for treatment of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis, and a process for preparing the same. PRIOR ART Cerebral vessel disorders such as stroke, and myocardial infarction, which rank in high in causes of death in developed countries, break out with being accompanied by atherosclerosis as basal disease. From the results of epidemiology research, it is pointed out that hypercholesterolemia is one of risk factors for atherosclerosis, and there are mainly used anti-hyperlipidemic agents, which can reduce cholesterol level in blood, in the prophylaxis or treatment thereof. However, there is no sufficiently effective agent in terms of the efficacy thereof. Recently, it is observed that cells derived from macrophage accumulate cholesterol ester droplet within the cells and become foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions, and it is clarified that these foam cells deeply participate in the developments of atherosclerotic lesions (Arteriosclerosis, 10, 164-177, 1990). In addition, it is reported that ACAT activity is increased and cholesterol esters are accumulated in the vascular wall of atherosclerotic lesions (Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 617, 458-471, 1980). Therefore, an inhibitor of ACAT, which catalyses cholesterol esterification, is expected to suppress the formation or the development of atherosclerotic lesions as a result of the inhibition of foam cell formation and of cholesterol ester accumulation in lesions. On the other hand, cholesterol in food is absorbed in the free form at intestinal epidermal cells, and then released in the form of chylomicron esterified by ACAT into the blood. Therefore, an inhibitor of ACAT is expected to reduce the cholesterol level in the blood by the inhibition of absorption of cholesterol in food at the intestine and of reabsorption of cholesterol released into the intestine (J. Lipid. Research, 34, 279-294, 1993). JP-A-3-181465, JP-A-3-223254 and JP-A-6-501025 disclose some kinds of quinoline derivatives having an ACAT inhibitory activity, and JP-A-5-32666 discloses some kinds of thienopyridine derivatives having an ACAT inhibitory activity, and further JP-A-9-48780 discloses some kinds of naphthyridine derivatives having an ACAT inhibitory activity. These patent publications disclose processes for preparation of these compounds, for example, in the above JP-A-9-48780, an ureidonaphthyridine derivative which is a pyridone derivative and its intermediate, an amino derivative are prepared by the following process. wherein Ring A is a substituted or unsubstituted pyridine ring; R 1 is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, a substituted alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, or a substituted cycloalkyl group; Y 1 is an alkyl group, a substituted. alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, a substituted cycloalkyl group, an aromatic group, or a substituted aromatic group; L is an alkyl group, a substituted alkyl group, an alkenyl group, a substituted alkenyl group, a cycloalkyl group, a substituted cycloalkyl group, an aromatic group, or a substituted aromatic group. That is, a carboxy derivative of the formula (11) is azidated with an azidating agent, and subsequently heated to convert into an isocyanate derivative of the formula (12), which is further reacted with an amine derivative of the formula (3) to give an ureido derivative of the formula (13), or alternatively the isocyanate derivative (12) is hydrolyzed to give an amine derivative of the formula (14). DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION However, the present inventors have found that the azidating agents used in the above process and the compounds prepared by azidating the carboxyl derivative of the formula (II) have a risk of explosion and therefore, they are not suitable for large-scale production with respect to safety. An object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing pyridone derivatives and aminopyridone derivatives, especially a preferable process thereof with respect to safety, and to provide a novel pyridone derivative.

In addition, a halogen atom such as bromine, iodine can be converted into a 1-propargyl group having a hydroxy group or an amino group at the 3-position by using a palladium catalyst. Said propargyl group can be further converted into a propyl group by hydrogenation reaction. Such conversion reactions of the substituents can be carried out by a conventional technique which is usually used in the field of the organic chemistry. The alkylation reaction as shown in the following scheme may be carried out as one of these conversion reactions of substituents. wherein G, E, Z, L, R 11 , Y 22 , Y 32 and Q are as defined above, M 2 is an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom or a group of the formula: NR 21 (R 21 is as defined above). The compound (27) is reacted with the alkylating agent (28) in a solvent, and if necessary, followed by deprotection to give the compound (29). The reaction is usually carried out in a solvent at a temperature of from 0 C. to 100 C., preferably at a temperature of from room temperature to 70 C., in the presence of a base. The solvent may be, for example, ethers (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, etc.), aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene, toluene, etc.), ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, etc.), and dimethylformamide. The base may be, for example, sodium hydride, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, triethylamine, etc. When potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate is used, the yield may be improved by addition of sodium iodide or potassium iodide. The leaving group for G is usually a halogen atom (e.g., chlorine, bromine, iodine, etc.) or an aromatic sulfonyloxy group (e.g., p-toluenesulfonyloxy group). The intermediate (2) or (5) of the present invention may be prepared, for example, by the method as disclosed below or a modified method thereof. wherein R 1 , R 11 , Y 1 , Y 2 , Y 3 and G are as defined above, and R 10 is a lower alkyl group. The starting compound (30) may be prepared by the method disclosed in the literature (e.g., JP-A-9-48780; Australian J. Chem., 1983, 36, 1431; J. Chem. Soc., 1908, 1022; J. Chem. Soc., 1904, 1726; J. Chem. Soc., 1915, 792; J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1956, 78, 4683) or a modified method thereof. The lower alkyl group for R 10 is preferably an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, etc. The ester derivative (30) is converted into the compound (15) by alkylation reaction, if necessary. The alkylation reaction is carried out by reacting with the alkylating agent (20) in a solvent at a temperature of from 0 C. to 150 C., preferably at a temperature of from room temperature to 80 C., in the presence of a base. The solvent may be alcohols (e.g. methanol, ethanol, etc.), ethers (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, etc.), ketones (e.g., acetone, 2-butanone, etc.), and dimethylformamide. The base may be sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium t-butoxide, sodium hydride, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, triethylamine, etc. The leaving group for G is usually a halogen atom (e.g. chlorine, bromine, iodine, etc.) or an aromatic sulfonyloxy group (e.g., p-toluenesulfonyloxy group, etc.). Subsequently, the compound (15) is subjected to hydrolysis to give the carboxylic acid derivative (16). The hydrolysis is carried out by a conventional method, for example, by using a hydroxide of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal (e.g., sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, etc.), in a solvent (e.g., methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane, etc.) at a temperature of from 0 C. to 150 C., preferably at a temperature of from 0 C. to 100 C. The carboxylic acid derivative (16) is converted into an acid azide thereof by using an azidating agent (e.g., diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA), etc.) in an amount of 1 to 3 mole equivalents, in a solvent in the presence of a base (e.g., triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, etc.) at a temperature of from 0 C. to 120 C., preferably at a temperature of from room temperature to 80 C., and the resulting acid azide compound is usually heated at a temperature of from 20 C. to 150 C., preferably at a temperature of from 30 C. to 100 C. without isolation from the reaction system, to give the compound (2). Moreover, in the same manner as in the hydrolysis of the compound (15), the compound (2) is subjected to hydrolysis to give the compound (5). The compounds of the present invention prepared by the present methods and the intermediates thereof may be purified by a conventional method, for example, column chromatography, recrystallization, etc. The solvent for recrystallization may properly be selected from alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, etc.), ethers (e.g., diethyl ether, etc.), esters (e.g., ethyl acetate, etc.), aromatic solvents (e.g., toluene, etc.), ketones (e.g., acetone, etc.), hydrocarbons (e.g., hexane, etc.) or a mixture of these solvent.

RIGHTS OF THE GOVERNMENT The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States for all governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to chromophores with very large two-photon absorption cross-sections. The two-photon process, predicted theoretically in 1931 and observed experimentally in the 1960s, has received little consideration for practical application. The lack of the availability of dyes with sufficiently large cross-sections has made many practical applications appear unattainable. Recently, the synthesis of new dyes with increased cross-sections and large upconverted fluorescence has opened up a myriad of new applications. These new applications include two-photon upconverted lasing, two-photon optical power limiting, three-dimensional optical data storage, and photodynamic therapy. Another application which has, unlike the others, received a reasonable amount of attention is three-dimensional imaging using two-photon laser scanning confocal microscopy. Multi-photon microscopy appears to be of great value as an imaging technique for numerous biological systems as well as organic paints and coatings. This technique, like the others, has never reached its full potential due to the lack of dyes which exhibit high intensity upconverted fluorescence. A tremendous improvement in the depth of confocal microscopic imaging can be obtained when the two-photon peak occurs at or near 800 nm, a wavelength at which most organic and biological materials have large optical transparency. It follows that a major molecular design challenge is to increase the molecular two-photon cross-section without shifting the two-photon absorption peak away from 800 nm. The U. S. Air Force currently has a strong interest in the development of two-photon technology as both an imaging tool for the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of aircraft paint and as a useful material for optical power limiting. It is evident that in order for two-photon technology to realize its full potential, major improvements will be necessary in the design and synthesis of more active dye molecules with the necessary solubility and photo-stability. The probability of absorption of two long wavelength photons from the laser source simultaneously is dependent upon the two-photon cross-section of the dye molecule. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,737, Reinhardt et al, issued Jun. 23, 1998, there are described asymmetrical fluorene-containing two-photon chromophores of the formula: DArA wherein the Ar core is wherein R 1 and R 2 are alkyl groups having 8 to 12 carbon atoms, and wherein R 1 and R 2 are the same or different, wherein D is an electron donor moiety selected from the group consisting of and wherein A is an electron acceptor moiety selected from the group consisting of The most active dyes described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,737 incorporate an easily polarizable olefinic double bond in the backbone of the molecule. This olefinic bond, although greatly increasing the two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-section of chromophores, has limited thermal and photochemical stability, thus reducing the range of its utility. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,100,405, issued Aug. 8, 2000, to Reinhardt et al there are disclosed dyes with increased thermal and photochemical stability while maintaining the same level of two-photon activity. These asymmetrical two-photon chromophores have the formula: DArA wherein Ar is selected from the group consisting of Fl, FlC 6 H 4 , FlFl, and FlFlFl, wherein Fl is a fluorene group of the formula: wherein R 1 and R 2 are alkyl groups having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, and wherein R 1 and R 2 are the same or different; wherein D is wherein Q is selected from the group consisting of H, OH and OC x H 2x1 , wherein x has a value of 1 to 10; and wherein A is selected from the group consisting of wherein Z is selected from the group consisting of O and S. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide more active dye molecules with the necessary solubility and photo-stability. Other objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention there are provided multi-armed chromophores with very large two-photon absorption cross-sections. One group of these chromophores have the formula: (TQ) n NPh m wherein Q is a single bond or 1,4-phenylene, Ph is a phenyl group, n has a value of 1-3 and m has a value of 3n, and wherein T is wherein R 1 and R 2 are alkyl groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, provided that when Q is a single bond, the value of n is 2 or 3. Preparation of these chromophores is described in the Examples which follow. Another group of these chromophores have the formula: (TQ) n GPh m wherein T is as defined above, Q is a single bond or 1,4-phenylene, Ph is a phenyl group, n has a value of 1-4 and m has a value of 4n, and wherein G is a core unit selected from the group consisting of Yet another group of these chromophores have the formula: (TQ) n GPh m wherein T is as described previously, Q is a single bond or 1,4-phenylene, Ph is a phenyl group, n has a value of 1-6 and m has a value of 6n, and wherein G is a core unit having the structure The 4-and 6-arm chromophore cores can be synthesized from their respective polybromo compounds following the procedures given in the following Examples. The polybromo cores (G) can be synthesized using a modified Ullmann reaction or palladium-catalyzed amination. For example, the polybromo core can be synthesized from 1,4-phenylenediamine and 1-bromo-4-iodophenylene. The other cores can be synthesized using polyamines including, but not limited to 1,3-phenylenediamine, benzidine, 2,7-diaminofluorene, 2,6-diaminonaphthalene, 1,3,5-triaminobenzene, and 9,9-bis(4-aminophenyl)fluorene.

salt of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid and process for producing the same", "abstract": "An S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt which contains a lactam compound represented by the following general formula (1): wherein M is an ammonium ion or an alkali metal ion, and an ethylenediaminemonosuccinic acid represented by the following general formula (2): wherein M is an ammonium ion or an alkali metal ion, in an amount of 7 wt % or less, respectively. This application is the national phase of international application PCT/JP98104917 filed Oct. 30, 1998 which designated the U.S. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt that is a chelate compound usable as a photographic bleaching agent, a fertilizer or the like and has little undesirable influence on the environment because of its good biodegradability, and a process for producing said salt. BACKGROUND ART The present inventors have disclosed in JP, 8-34764,A that an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron ammonium salt, which is a compound useful for photographic bleaching and the like, has a high biodegradability. However, in a production process for producing the disclosed compound, it was necessary to obtain a highly viscous and highly slurry concentrate because of the very high solubility of the desired compound, in order to obtain the desired compound in high yield. Therefore, there has been a desire for a production process having a higher productivity as an industrial production process. A process for obtaining the desired compound by a concentration to dryness or a continuous hot gas drying has achieved an improvement in the yield but has been disadvantageous in product quality that, for example, powders obtained by said process were so poor in shelf stability that it was colored or was deteriorated in solubility. Unlike a production process using an inorganic salt such as iron sulfate, a production process using iron oxide was expected to make it possible to obtain a desired compound having a relatively high purity by evaporating a reaction solution to dryness as it was, unless starting materials are decomposed. However, when a meso/racemic mixture of ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid was used, a product obtained by such a process had a very high hygroscopicity in some cases and moreover its purity was not sufficient. In addition, also when S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid was used, the resulting solid had a low stability, for example, it was colored or gave an insoluble material with a lapse of time. Furthermore, the solid had a low purity and the mass balance of the S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid used was markedly unsatisfactory. An object of the present invention is to solve such problems and provide an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt having a high storage stability and a process for producing the same in high yield. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present inventors have made extensive studies in order to achieve the above object and consequently found that an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt contains an impurity that is difficult to detect even under HPLC analysis conditions under which a slight amount of a chelate compound can be analyzed, because the impurity has a much lower chelate ability than that of other components. Additionally, the present inventors found that, as a result of various analyses such as mass spectrometry and NMR, the impurity is a compound derived from S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid by a formation of a lactam ring. The present inventors also found that a coloring and a deterioration of a shelf stability of the S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt are due to the presence of a compound of the following general formula (1) or a compound of the following general formula (2) as reaction by-products and due that an iron complexs stability of these compounds is low that the compounds release a chelated iron with a lapse of time. Thus, the present inventors found that a reduction of an amount of the reaction by-products is important. (Wherein M is an ammonium ion or an alkali metal ion.) (Wherein M is an ammonium ion or an alkali metal ion.) In addition, the present inventors found that even if these compounds are contained in the S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt, this salt is not seriously deteriorated in shelf stability when a content of each of the compounds is 7 wt % or less. The present inventors further found the following: a formation of these impurities can be inhibited by properly controlling a reaction temperature, a reaction period of time and pH at the reaction and adding a reducing agent; of the impurities formed, the lactam compound is easily soluble in a lower alcohol while the S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt is insoluble therein, and therefore only the impurity can be dissolved by utilizing a difference in solubility between the impurity and the lactam compound; and when a continuous hot gas drying method is adopted, a decomposition of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid during an oxidation can be minimized, and an oxidation of ferrous iron easily proceeds simultaneously with drying. Thus, the present invention has been accomplished. That is, one aspect of the present invention is directed to an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt which contains a lactam compound represented by the general formula (1) shown below and an ethylenediaminemonosuccinic acid represented by the general formula (2) shown below in an amount of 7 wt % or less, respectively: wherein M is an ammonium ion or an alkali metal ion, wherein M is an ammonium ion or an alkali metal ion. Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a process for producing the above-mentioned S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salts as such are stable at a room temperature and have a very high water-solubility of 60 g/50 g H 2 O or more, and aqueous solutions thereof are weakly acidic substances having a pH of about 5 and can be stably stored. On the other hand, S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-dissuccinic acid, which is used as a starting material in a process for producing an S, S-ethylenediamine-N,N-dissuccinic acid iron alkali salt by an iron chelating reaction, is an unstable compound in an acidic solution. It undergoes a lactam ring formation reaction or is decomposed by an amine elimination reaction. Additionally, this compound has a strong acidity of pH 2 or thereabouts in an aqueous solution. Therefore, the compound is further characterized in that its cyclization gradually proceeds when water is present, without an addition of an acidic substance, even at room temperature. The formation of a cyclization product and a fumaric acid, and an ethylenediaminemonosuccinic acid by an elimination reaction of amine are accelerated by heating. However, a chelating reaction of iron under basic conditions results in an extreme decrease of a reactivity of iron oxide and a formation of a large amount of iron hydroxide and iron ammine complexes. In addition, when the S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt is obtained in the form of powder, an alkali present in excess undesirably caused a moisture absorption to deteriorate a stability of a product. Therefore, the reaction was unavoidably carried out with heating in a weakly acidic pH region of 3 to 6, so that the above-mentioned by-products were formed. Furthermore, since these by-products, i.e. the cyclization product and the by-products produced by the amine elimination reaction, have a lower chelate ability than that of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid, they released iron ions, owing to a pH change, a composition change of liquid caused by additives, and a lapse of time, so that a water-insoluble iron hydrate was formed to cause an appearance of turbidity in an aqueous solution. The present inventors found the following: an appearance of the turbidity can be prevented to such an extent that it does not cause any problem in practice, by reducing a content of each of the above-mentioned by-products to 7 wt % or less; and the content of each of the by-products can be reduced to 7 wt % or less by taking the countermeasure described below. Thus, the present invention has been accomplished. Since a formation of the decomposition products and the cyclization product is dependent on a temperature at a chelating reaction of iron or iron oxide with S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid, a reaction period of time and pH at the reaction, a desired compound containing only a slight amount of the by-products can be obtained by making these conditions suitable and adding a stabilizer. S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid used in the process of the present invention can be synthesized by a known process. For example, this compound can be synthesized either by reacting 1,2-dihaloethane with L-aspartic acid with heating in the presence of an alkali metal hydroxide (Inorganic Chemistry, 7 (11), 2405 (1968)) or by utilizing a microbial enzyme. As an alkali used in the present invention, ammonia and alkali metals conventionally used in S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salts are preferable. Alkaline earth metals and organic monoamines such as alkylamines may be used as the alkali. As an iron oxide used in the process of the present invention, any of magnetite, goethite and hematite and the like may be used in the form of powder, magnetite being the most preferable and hematite being the second most preferable. When hematite is used, hematite having a specific surface area of 10 (m 2 /g) or more, more preferably 15 (m 2 /g) or more, in terms of BET value is preferable. When magnetite is used, magnetite having a specific surface area of 5 (m 2 /g) or more, more preferably 6 (m 2 /g) or more, in terms of BET value is preferable. When goethite is used, goethite having a specific surface area of 85 (m 2 /g) or more, more preferably 95 (m 2 /g) or more, in terms of BET value is preferable. Here, the term BET value means a specific surface area value measured by a low-temperature N 2 gas adsorption. As to the order of charging of starting materials in the process of the present invention, either a method comprising charging an aqueous medium and S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid in a reactor and then adding thereto iron oxide powder, or a method comprising charging an aqueous medium and iron oxide powder in a reactor and then adding thereto S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid may be adopted, the latter being more preferable. As the aqueous medium, either a water or an alcohol-containing water may be used, a water being preferably used. In the method of charging an aqueous medium and iron oxide powder in a reactor and then adding thereto S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid, a dispersion liquid obtained from the aqueous medium and the iron oxide powder is heated at from 70 to 100 C., preferably from 75 to 95 C., more preferably from 80 to 90 C., and S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid or an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid monoalkali salt is continuously or intermittently added thereto in the form of powder or a dispersion or solution in an aqueous medium. In this case, pH of the reaction mixture is preferably maintained at from 4.5 to 7, more preferably from 5 to 6. More particularly, S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid used is mixed with an aqueous alkali solution containing an alkali in an amount of from equivalent to 1.4 moles, preferably from 1.05 to 1.25 moles, per mole of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid, to obtain a dispersion liquid or aqueous solution of an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid alkali salt, which is continuously or intermittently added to the iron oxide dispersion liquid. It is also possible to add the S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid powder and the queous alkali solution to the iron oxide dispersion liquid separately and continuously or intermittently ithout beforehand mixing them, to carry out the reaction. In this case, when an addition rate of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid is rapider than that of the aqueous alkali solution, pH is lowered. Therefore, it is preferable to carry out the reaction while adjusting the pH by adding the aqueous alkali solution so that the pH may be always in a range of 4.5 to 7. Although depending on a reaction temperature, a period of time required for the addition may be properly selected in a range of from 0.2 to 4 hours, preferably from 1 to 3 hours. Furthermore, a formation of a cyclization product can be inhibited by adding a reducing agent at the time of the chelating reaction. Specific examples of the reducing agent are inorganic reducing agents in the form of powder, wire, ribbon or the like of a metal such as iron powder, zinc powder, magnesium powder, aluminum powder, etc.; and organic reducing agents such as ascorbic acid, isoascorbic acid, oxalic acid, etc. Iron is preferable for suppressing a contamination of a product with impurities. The amount of such additives is 0.1-20 mo 1 %, preferably approximately 1-10 mo 1 %, based on the amount of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid. When hematite or goethite is used as the iron oxide, a small amount of a divalent iron exists in a reaction mixture obtained by a dissolution of the iron oxide and a chelation. When magnetite is used, a divalent iron exists in the reaction mixture in an amount of from a few % to over ten % based on the total amount of iron existing in the reaction mixture. For oxidizing the divalent iron into a trivalent iron, a molecular oxygen can be used. When a desired composition is obtained as powder, it is not necessary to introduce a molecular oxygen into the reaction mixture to carry out an oxidation reaction and then dry it which are the conventional procedure. Insoluble materials are removed from the above-mentioned reaction mixture, if necessary, by filtering the reaction mixture and a residue is dried by the use of a continuous hot gas dryer. The divalent iron is effectively oxidized by an air introduced during the drying. Moreover, since a treatment period of time is short, a decomposition of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid, which has Ad occurred when an air blows into, is inhibited. Therefore, powder of a desired composition can be efficiently obtained. The continuous hot gas dryer includes, for example, a spray dryer and a continuous granulation dryer. A temperature of the hot gas used ranges from 70 C. to 200 C. S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt reaction mixture containing of the compounds represented by the above general formula (1) and (2) in an amount of more than 7% is reduced in water content or allowed to assume a dried state, and then the treated reaction mixture is washed with a water-containing lower alcohol, whereby S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt having intended low contents of the compounds of the general formula (1) and (2) can be efficiently obtained. Examples of the lower alcohol described above include lower alcohols of 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Specific examples thereof include methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol, etc. Specifically, a water contained in the S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt reaction mixture containing high contents of the by-products is allowed to evaporate by a concentration under a reduced pressure of the reaction mixture until the water content becomes 60% or less based on the amount of solid components. Then, an absolute or water-containing lower alcohol is added to the residue so as to form a water-containing lower alcohol having a water content of 3 to 35%, preferably 5 to 20%, whereby crystals are dispersed. By separating the crystals by filtration, S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt having a content of each of the above-mentioned by-products of not more than 7% can be easily obtained. Another treatment method is as follows: after the reaction mixture is dried with a continuous hot gas dryer, as in spray drying, dried substances can be washed either by dispersing it in a water-containing alcohol having a water content of 3 to 35%, preferably 5 to 20%, followed by a separation by filtration, or by charging the dried substances into a Buchner funnel or the like and rinsing the dried substances with the water-containing alcohol, whereby an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron alkali salt having a content of each of the above-mentioned by-products of not more than 7% can be easily obtained. The present invention is illustrated in further detail with the following examples and comparative examples, which should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. Iron yield and analysis methods for iron component and a chelate component are as follows. Iron yield(the amount of iron dissolved as determined by a titration)/(the total amount of all iron atoms used in the reaction)100 Analysis Method for Iron Component: All ions of dissolved iron in a sample is converted to ferric iron ions and the thus treated sample is reacted with potassium iodide and then titrated with sodium thiosulfate by using a starch as an indicator. Analysis Method for a Chelate Component: An aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is added to an iron complex to eliminate the iron therefrom, and then the resulting substance is dissolved in a solution containing copper to form a copper complex, which is analyzed by a liquid chromatography (column: ODS-2, wavelength: 254 nm, eluent: a buffer solution containing copper, analysis temperature: 40 C.). EXAMPLE 1 146 g of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid, 300 g of water and 21 g of 98% sodium hydroxide were charged in a reactor equipped with a stirrer and a thermometer, and were stirred and mixed at room temperature. 37.7 g of magnetite having a BET value of 6.5 (m 2 /g) and 1.4 g of iron powder were added thereto, and a reaction was carried out with heating and thorough stirring at 80 C. for 2 hours.

The solution was stored at 50 C. for 1 week and then diluted to 1% and the dissolution state of the resulting diluted solution was observed. When the crystals obtained in any of Comparative Examples were used, insoluble materials were found. In contrast, when the crystals obtained in any of Examples were used, no insoluble material was found. EXAMPLE 16 200 g of water, 40 g of magnetite (iron content: 70.5%) and 3 g of iron powder were charged in a 1-liter cylindrical flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer and a material feed opening, and were heated at 85 C. Then, 146 g of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid was dispersed in 365 g of water containing 10.2 g of ammonia, and the resulting dispersion liquid was added to an iron oxide dispersion liquid, which had been beforehand prepared, over about 2 hours by the use of a slurry pump while maintaining a mixture temperature at 80 to 85 C. During the addition, pH of the reaction mixture gradually decreased from 7 and varied in a range of 5.5 to 6. After a completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was maintained at 80 C. for 30 minutes and then cooled to room temperature. This reaction mixture contained a cyclization product having a lactam ring formed in an amount of only 0.5% based on the amount of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid used and divalent iron ions in an amount of 10% based on the total amount of all iron ions. Subsequently, insoluble components were removed from the obtained reaction mixture by filtration, and 7 g of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid was added to the liquid residue to adjust the amounts of iron ions and S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid to equimolar. Then, the resulting mixture was dried with a spray dryer to obtain 193 g of an S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron ammonium salt containing 0.5% of a compound having a lactam ring and 0.2% of an ethylenediaminemonosuccinic acid, and having a content of divalent iron ions of 0.5% based on all iron ions, and a purity of 98% or more.

Then, 146 g of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid was added thereto with a spoon over 2.5 hours while maintaining a mixture temperature at 80 to 85 C. During the addition, 150 g of an aqueous solution containing 20.4 g of sodium hydroxide was added to the reaction mixture while adjusting pH of the reaction mixture to 5 to 6. After a completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was maintained at 80 C. for 15 minutes and then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture contained a cyclization product having a lactam ring formed in an amount of only 0.4% based on the amount of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid used. After divalent iron ions remained in an amount of about 8% based on the total amount of all iron ions were oxidized by bubbling air into the reaction mixture, insoluble materials were removed by filtration. The amount of a compound having a lactam ring in the S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid iron sodium salt aqueous solution thus obtained was 0.4% based on the amount of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid used. EXAMPLE 18 200 g of water and 40 g of magnetite (iron content: 70.5%) were charged in a 1-liter cylindrical flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer and a material feed opening, and were heated at 85 C. Then, 146 g of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid was dispersed in 365 g of water containing 10.2 g of ammonia, and the resulting dispersion liquid was added to an iron oxide dispersion liquid, which had been beforehand prepared, over 2 hours by the use of a slurry pump while maintaining a mixture temperature at 80 to 85 C. During the addition, the pH of the reaction mixture gradually decreased from 7 and varied in a range of 5.5 to 6. After a completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was maintained at 80 C. for 30 minutes and then cooled to room temperature. Divalent iron ions remained in the reaction mixture in an amount of about 10% based on the total amount of all iron ions were oxidized by bubbling air into the reaction mixture, and then insoluble materials were removed by filtration. In the solution thus obtained, a cyclization product having a lactam ring was formed in an amount of 0.9% based on the amount of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid used. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 5 200 g of water, 40 g of magnetite (iron content: 70.5%) and 3 g of iron powder were charged in a 1-liter cylindrical flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer and a material feed opening, and were heated at 80 C. Then, 146 g of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid was added thereto with a spoon over about 2.5 hours while maintaining a mixture temperature at 80 to 85 C. During the addition, 150 g of an aqueous solution containing 20.4 g of sodium hydroxide was added to the reaction mixture while adjusting pH of the reaction mixture at from 3.0 to 4.0, and the whole aqueous sodium hydroxide solution prepared was added at last. After a completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was maintained at 80 C. for 15 minutes and then cooled to room temperature. In this reaction mixture, a cyclization product having a lactam ring was formed in an amount of 2.1% based on the amount of S,S-ethylenediamine-N,N-disuccinic acid used.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to aryl (sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone) derivatives, processes for the preparation thereof, and matrix metalloproteinases inhibitors containing them as active ingredient. More particularly, this invention relates to matrix metalloproteinases inhibitors containing aryl (sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone) derivatives of the formula (I) (wherein all the symbols are the same meanings as hereinafter described.), non-toxic salts thereof, as active ingredient, and the above-mentioned novel aryl (sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone) derivatives of the formula (I), non-toxic salts thereof, and processes for the preparation thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The matrix metalloproteinases (hereinafter abbreviated as MMP) are neutral metalloproteinases and zinc (hereinafter abbreviated as Zn 2 ) is essential in the active site for their activation They degrade collagen, laminin, proteoglycans, fibronectin, elastin, gelatin etc. under physiological conditions and, therefore, are effective on growth and tissue remodeling of articulation tissue, bone tissue and connective tissue. At least 10 classes of MMP which differ in primary structure are identified. As common characteristics of these enzymes, MMP (1) have Zn 2 in the active site and the activity depends on calcium (Ca 2 ), (2) are secreted as an inactive proenzyme and activated outside of cells, (3) have high homology on amino acid sequence, (4) have an ability to degrade various extracellular matrix components in vivo, (5) are regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP) which are specific to MMP. MMP inhibitors are useful for prevention and/or treatment of various diseases induced by overexpression or excess activation of MMP. Such diseases are, for example, rheumatoid diseases, arthrosteitis, unusual bone resorption, osteoporosis, periodontitis, interstitial nephritis, arteriosclerosis, pulmonary emphysema, cirrhosis, cornea injury, metastasis of, invasion of or growth of tumor cells, autoimmune diseases (e.g. Crohns disease, Sjogrens syndrome), diseases caused by vascular emigration or infiltration of leukocytes, arterialization etc. Some compounds possessing inhibitory activity against matrix metalloproteinases are known. A sequence in the vicinity of the cleavage site of collagen (Gly-Ile-Ala-Gly or Gly-Leu-Ala-Gly) has high affinity for collagenase. Much research and development on substrate analogous matrix metalloproteinases inhibitors, which are chemically modified so as to have zinc affinity groups on a cleavage site of the substrate, has energetically been carried out Inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), Nigel RA Beeley, Phillip R J Ansell, Andrew J P Docherty et al., Curr.

These phosphine ligands are suitable as constituents of metal complexes which can be used as catalysts for reactions to form CC, CH, CN, CSi or CO bonds. The present invention relates to new chiral phosphine ligands containing amino acid groups, a process for preparing them and their use as catalyst constituents. Phosphines have generally found a wide variety of uses in industry. They are suitable, for example, as antioxidants, metal extractants, flame retardant impregnants, stabilizers for olefins and trioxane, as starting compounds for Wittig reagents and as ligands for metal complex catalysts. Owing to their wide variety of forms, they also represent intermediates for the preparation of further organic compounds which may or may not contain phosphorus. Since the phosphines contain a trivalent phosphorus atom in the molecule, they display complexing properties toward numerous metals and metal ions, particularly those from the transition series, which can be utilized for preparing corresponding metal complex catalysts which are employed in industrial processes. Of particular importance is the development of ligands for catalyst systems which are used, for example, in the hydroformylation of olefins. Here, catalyst systems containing tertiary phosphines or phosphites as ligands have been found to be particularly useful. Further phosphines which are of interest are those which are suitable for preparing chiral metal complexes. Examples of known phosphines of this type are the diphosphine S,S-2,4-bisbis-(p-N,N-dimethylamino-phenyl)phosphinopentane (Catalysis Letters 5 (1990) 183-188) and also N,N-dimethyl-2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl-1(R)-ethylamine (Can. J. Chem. 64, (1986), 1930-1935). The Pt and Rh complexes of 2S,4S-(N-tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-diphenylphosphino-2-(di-tert-butylphosphino)methyl-pyrrolidines and the corresponding dibenzophospholyl derivatives are active catalysts for the enantioselective hydroformylation of vinylaromatics and the enantioselective hydrogenation of prochiral olefins (Organometallics, 10 (1991), 1183-1189; J. Org. Chem. 45 (1990), 4728-4739). Rh(l) complexes of amphiphilic bidentate phosphines such as 2,2-bisphenyl(3-pyridyl)phosphinomethyl-1,1-biphenyl have been used for the hydroformylation of 1-octene. Owing to their amphiphilic character, these ligands can be recovered from the reaction mixtures by acid extraction (J. Chem. Soc., Dalton Trans. (1996), 2143-2154). Thiophosphorylprolines, thiophosphorylphenylglycines and thiophosphorylphenylalanines have been used as building blocks for the synthesis of phosphinyl-substituted peptides. Their Rh(l) complexes are of interest as novel bioconjugated and immobilized catalysts (Angew. Chem., 108 (1996), 963-966; J. Org. Chem. 61, (1996), 2922-2923). In view of the particular importance of chiral phosphines, there is interest in preparing new compounds of this group, not only to supplement the range of possible applications but also to enrich and expand the range by varying material properties and structural features. This object is achieved by compounds of the formula I where R 1 is hydrogen, a C 1 -C 7 -alkyl radical, a C 6 -C 10 -aryl radical or a monovalent metal, preferably sodium or potassium, R 2 is hydrogen or a C 1 -C 7 -alkyl radical, R 3 is hydrogen or an NR 5 R 6 radical, where R 5 and R 6 are identical or different and are hydrogen or C 1 -C 7 -alkyl or C 6 -C 10 -aryl radicals, R 4 is a C 1 -C 7 -alkyl or C 6 -C 10 -aryl radical and m is 0 or 1. Preferred compounds of the formula I are phosphinophenyl-substituted amino acids of the formula II based on phenylglycine where R 2 is hydrogen or methyl and R 4 is a C 1 -C 7 -alkyl or phenyl radical and the phosphinophenyl radical PPh(R 4 ) is located in the ortho or para position relative to the amino acid substituent C(NH 2 )(R 2 )(COOH). As compounds of the formula I, preference is also given to phosphinophenyl-substituted amino acids of the formula III based on phenylalanine where R 2 is hydrogen or a C 1 -C 7 -alkyl radical, in particular methyl, and R 4 is a C 1 -C 7 -alkyl or phenyl radical and the phosphinophenyl radical PPh(R 4 ) is located in the ortho or para position relative to the amino acid substituent CH 2 C(NH 2 )(R 2 )(COOH). The invention also provides a process for preparing compounds of the formula I by reaction of fluorophenyl-substituted compounds of the formula IV where R 2 is hydrogen or a C 1 -C 7 -alkyl radical, R 3 is hydrogen or an NR 5 R 6 radical, where R 5 and R 6 are identical or different and are hydrogen or C 1 -C 7 -alkyl or aryl radicals, m is 0 or 1 and M is sodium or potassium, with a phosphide of the formula V Ph(R 4 )PMV where R 4 is a C 1 -C 7 -alkyl or C 6 -C 10 -aryl radical, in particular a phenyl radical, and M is sodium or potassium, and subsequent acid hydrolysis of the reaction mixture. The reaction is usually carried out in an organic polar aprotic solvent such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane or tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of 80-120 C. Preference is given to reacting sodium or potassium salts of 4-fluoro--phenylglycine (IVa), 4-fluoro--phenyl--methylglycine (IVb) and -(4-fluorophenyl)--alanine (IVc) as compounds of the formula IV with the potassium phosphides Ph(R 4 )PK as compounds of the formula V, where R 4 is a C 1 -C 7 -alkyl or phenyl radical. While the sodium and potassium salts of 4-fluoro--phenylglycine (IVa) and -(4-fluorophenyl)--alanine (IVc) are commercially available substances, the sodium or potassium salts of 4-fluoro--phenyl--methylglycine (IVb) can be prepared via a Bucherer reaction by reacting 4-fluoroacetophenone with potassium cyanide and ammonium carbonate to form a hydantoin of the formula VI as intermediate, which is hydrolyzed using aqueous sodium hydroxide. The novel compounds of the formula I are suitable as ligands for metal complexes which can be used as catalysts for reactions to form CC, CH, CN, CSi or CO bonds. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of 2-diphenylphosphino--phenylglycine A solution of 3.07 g (16.5 mmol) of diphenylphosphine in 60 ml of 1,2-dimethoxyethane was admixed with 0.64 g (16.5 mmol) of potassium. After the metallation reaction was complete, 3.0 g (15.7 mmol) of sodium 2-(2-fluorophenyl)glycinate were added and the reaction mixture was heated at 80 C. for 3 hours. Subsequently, 10 ml of methanol were added and the volatile constituents were removed at 80 C. at a pressure of 10 2 bar. The residue obtained was suspended in 500 ml of dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid (pH4) and filtered, and then dried at 20 C. and 10 2 bar. The yield was 4.7 g (89%). For the further work-up, the product was recrystallized from a 3:1 mixture of water and methanol. The 1 H, 13 C 1 H and 31 P 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AC 250 spectrometer; the mass spectra were recorded on a Varian MAT 311 A instrument.

After the metallation reaction was complete, 3.0 g (15.7 mmol) of sodium 2-(2-fluorophenyl)glycinate were added and the reaction mixture was heated at 80 C. for 0.5 hour. Subsequently, excess potassium phenylmethylphosphide was hydrolyzed by addition of 10 ml of methanol and the volatile constituents were taken off from the reaction mixture under reduced pressure (80 C., 0.01 mbar). The residue was extracted with 50 ml of ether, dissolved in 500 ml of water and the pH was adjusted to about 4 by addition of 10% strength hydrochloric acid. The 2-(methylphenyl)phosphino--phenylglycine obtained as colorless precipitate was filtered off and dried under reduced pressure. The yield was 3.46 g (81%).

CROSS-REFERENCE This application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 09/108,681 filed Jul. 1, 1998 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,110,946. The invention relates to heterocyclic azahexane derivatives that can be employed as substrate isosteres of retroviral aspartate proteases, to salts thereof, to processes for the preparation of those compounds and their salts, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising those compounds or their salts, and to the use of those compounds or their salts (alone or in combination with other antiretrovirally active compounds) in the therapeutic or diagnostic treatment of the human or animal body or in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION According to WHO estimates there are clearly more than 20 million people infected by the Human Immuno Deficiency Virus, HIV-1 or HIV-2. With very few exceptions, in infected subjects the disease results, by way of preliminary stages, such as ARDS, in a manifest disease of the immune system which is known as Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome or AIDS. In the overwhelming number of cases the disease sooner or later leads to the death of the infected patients. Hitherto, the treatment of retroviral diseases, such as AIDS, has involved principally the use of inhibitors of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme effective in the conversion of retroviral RNA into DNA, such as 3-azido-3-deoxythymidine (AZT) or dideoxyinosine (DDI), and also trisodium phosphonoformate, ammonium-21-tungstenato-9-antimonate, 1--D-ribofuran-oxyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide and dideoxycytidine and also adriamycin. Attempts have also been made to introduce into the body, for example in the form of a recombinant molecule or molecule fragment, the T4-cell receptor which is present on certain cells of the defence system of the human body and is responsible for the anchoring and introduction of infectious virus particles into those cells and thus for their infection, the objective being that binding sites for the virus will be blocked so that the virions will no longer be able to bind to the cells. Compounds that prevent the virus penetrating the cell membrane in some other way, such as polymannoacetate, are also used. The first inhibitor of so-called retroviral aspartate protease to be approved for combatting the infection was saquinavir, N-tert-butyl-decahydro-2-2(R)-hydroxy-4-phenyl-3(S)-N-2-quinolyl-carbonyl-L-asparaginylaminobutyl-(4aS,8aS)-isoquinoline-3(S)-carboxamide (Ro 31-8959). Since then others have followed (indinavir (Merck) and ritonavir (Abbott)). Also under development are a number of further inhibitors of retroviral aspartate protease, an enzyme the function of which can be characterised as follows: In the AIDS viruses, HIV-1 and HIV-2, and other retroviruses, for example corresponding viruses in cats (FIV) and apes (SIV), the proteolytic maturation of, for example, the core proteins of the virus is brought about by an aspartate protease, such as HIV-protease. Without that proteolytic maturation, infectious virus particles cannot be formed. Owing to the central role of the said aspartate proteases, such as HIV-1- or HIV-2-protease, in the maturation of viruses and on the basis of experimental results, for example on infected cell cultures, it has become plausible that effective suppression of the maturation step brought about by that protease will suppress the assembly of mature virions in vivo. Inhibitors of that protease can therefore be used therapeutically. The aim of the present invention is to provide a novel type of compound that is equipped, especially, with a high degree of inhibitory activity against virus replication in cells, high anti-viral activity against numerous virus strains, including those which are resistant to known compounds, such as saquinavir, ritonavir and indinavir, and especially advantageous pharmacological properties, for example good pharmacokinetics, such as high bioavailability and high blood levels, and/or high selectivity.

The compounds of formula I preferably have the formula Ia, wherein the radicals are as defined. Salts are especially the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I. Such salts are formed, for example, by compounds of formula I having a basic R 4 CH 2 carrying nitrogen atom as acid addition salts, preferably with inorganic acids, for example hydrohalic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid, or with strong organic sulfonic, sulfo or phosphoric acids or N-substituted sulfamic acids (preferably: pKa1). Other salts may be present when basic heterocyclyl radicals, such as pyridyl, are present in R 4 . Those salts includes especially acid addition salts with organic or inorganic acids, especially the pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable inorganic acids are, for example, hydrchalic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid. Suitable organic acids are, for example, carboxylic, phosphonic, sulfonic or sulfamic acids, for example acetic acid, propionic acid, octanoic acid, decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, gluconic acid, glucosemonocarboxylic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, glucaric acid, galactaric acid, amino acids, such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid, N-methylglycine, acetylaminoacetic acid, N-acetylasparagine or N-acetyl-cysteine, pyruvic acid, acetoacetic acid, phosphoserine, 2- or 3-glycerophosphoric acid, glucose-6-phosphoric acid, glucose-1-phosphoric acid, fructose-1,6-bisphosphoric acid, maleic acid, hydroxymaleic acid, methylmaleic acid, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, adamantanecarboxylic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, 1- or 3-hydroxynaphthyl-2-carboxylic acid, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid, 2-phenoxybenzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, 4-amino-salicylic acid, phthalic acid, phenylacetic acid, mandelic acid, cinnamic acid, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, methanesulfonic or ethanesulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, ethane-1,2-disulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonic acid, 2-, 3- or 4-methylbenzenesulfonic acid, methylsulfuric acid, ethylsulfuric acid, dodecylsulfuric acid, N-cyclohexylsulfamic acid, N-methyl-, N-ethyl- or N-propyl-sulfamic acid, or other organic protonic acids, such as ascorbic acid. When negatively charged radicals are present, such as tetrazolyl in R 4 , salts may also be formed with bases, e.g. metal or ammonium salts, such as alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium salts or ammonium salts with ammonia or suitable organic amines, such as tertiary monoamires, e.g. triethylamine or tri-(2-hydroxyethyl)-amine, or heterocyclic bases e.g. N-ethyl-piperidine or N,N-dimethyl-piperazine. For the purposes of isolation or purification it is also possible to use pharmaceutically unsuitable salts, for example picrates or perchlorates. Only the pharmaceutically acceptable salts or the free compounds (optionally in the form of pharmaceutically compositions) are used therapeutically and they are therefore preferred. In view of the close relationship between the novel compounds in free form and in the form of their salts, including those salts that can be used as intermediates, for example in the purification of the novel compounds or for identifying them, hereinbefore and hereinafter any reference to the free compounds should be understood as including the corresponding salts as appropriate and expedient. The compounds of formula I have valuable pharmacological properties. They have anti-retroviral activity, especially against the viruses HIV-1 and HIV-2 which are regarded as causes of AIDS, and may surprisingly exhibit synergistic effects in combination with other compounds that are active against retroviral aspartate proteases. The compounds of formula I are inhibitors of retroviral aspartate proteases, especially inhibitors of the aspartate protease of HIV-1 or also HIV-2 and are therefore suitable for the treatment of retroviral diseases, such as AIDS or its in preliminary stages (e.g. ARDS). Compounds of formula I also exhibit activity against corresponding animal retroviruses, such as SIV (in apes) or FIV (in cats). Compounds of formula I exhibit, surprisingly, especially advantageous and important pharmacological properties, for example a very high antiviral activity in cell tests against various virus strains, including those which are resistant to other protease inhibitors, for example in MT2-cells, good pharmacokinetics, such as high bioavailability, high selectivity and, especially, high blood levels (even in the case of oral administration). The inhibitory action of the compounds of formula I on the proteolytic activity of HIV-1-protease can be shown, for example, according to known procedures (see A. D. Richards et al., J. Biol. Chem. 265(14), 7733-7736 (1990)). In that method the inhibition of the action of HIV-1-protease (preparation: see S. Billich et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263(34), 17905-17908 (1990)) is measured in the presence of the icosapeptide RRSNQVSQNYPIVQNIQGRR (a synthetic substrate of HIV-1-protease, prepared by peptide synthesis in accordance with known procedures (see J. Schneider et al., Cell 54, 363-368 (1988)), which contains as substrate analogue one of the cleavage sites of the gag-precursor protein (natural substrate of HIV-1-protease). That substrate and its cleavage products are analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The test compound is dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. The enzymatic test is carried out by adding suitable dilutions of the inhibitor in 20 mM -morpholinoethanesuifonic acid (MES) buffer pH 6.0 to the test mixture. That mixture consists of the above-mentioned icosapeptide (122 M) in 20 mM MES-buffer pH 6.0. 100 l are used per test batch. The reaction is started by the addition of 10 ml of HIV-1-protease solution and is stopped after one hours incubation at 37 C. by the addition of 10 l of 0.3M HClO 4 . After centrifugation of the sample at 10 000g for 5 minutes, 20 l of the resulting supernatant are applied to a 1254.6 mm Nucleosil C18-5m-HPLC column (reversed-phase material supplied by Macherey Nagel, Dren, FRG, based on silica gel that has been charged with C 18 alkyl chains). The uncleaved icosapeptide and its cleavage products are eluted from the column by means of the following gradient: 100% eluant 150% eluant 150% eluent 2 (eluant 1:10% acetonitrile, 90% H 2 O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); eluant 2:75% acetonitrile, 25% H 2 O, 0.08% TFA) for 15 minutes, throughflow rate 1 ml/min. The quantification of the eluted peptide fragments is carried out by measuring the peak height of the cleavage product at 215 nm. Compounds of formula I exhibit inhibitory actions in the nanomolar range; they preferably exhibit IC 50 values (IC 50 that concentration which brings about a 50% reduction in the activity of HIV-1-protease in comparison with a control without inhibitor) of approximately 210 7 to 510 9 M, preferably 510 8 to 510 9 M. An alternative method (see Matayoshi et al., Science 247, 954-958 (1990), here modified) of determining the inhibitory action against HIV-1-protease may be described briefly as follows: the protease (purification: see Leuthardt et al., FEBS Lett. 326, 275-80 (1993)) is incubated at room temperature in 100 l of assay buffer (20 mM MES pH 6.0; 200 mM NaCl; 1 mM dithiothreitol; 0.01% polyethylene glycol (average molecular weight 6000 to 8000 da) with 10 M fluorogenic substrate SC4400 (4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoyl--aminobutyryl-Ser-Gln-Asn-Tyr-Pro-Ile-Val-Gln-EDANS (EDANS5-(2-aminoethylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid); Neosystem Laboratoire, France). The reaction is discontinued by the addition of 900 l of 0.03M HClO 4 . The HIV-1-protease activity is determined by measuring the increase in fluorescence at ex336, em485 nm. The IC 50 values of compounds of formula I are determined as the concentration of the compound that is necessary to inhibit the protease activity in the assay by 50%. The numerical values are obtained from computer-generated graphs from data relating to at least 5 concentrations of the compound of formula I in question with threefold determination per concentration. In a further test it can be shown that compounds of formula I protect cells normally infected by HIV from such an infection or at least slow down such an infection. For this test, MT-2-cells infected with HIV-1/MN are used. MT-2-cells have been transformed with HTLV-1 (a virus causing leukemia) and a continuous producer thereof; they are therefore especially sensitive to the cytopathogenic effect of HIV. MT-2-cells can be obtained via the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH from Dr. Douglas Richman (see J. Biol. Chem. 263, 5870-5875 (1988) and also Science 229, 563-566 1985)). The MT-2-cells are cultured in RPMI 1640-medium (Gibco, Scotland; RPMI comprises an amino acid mixture without glutamine) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum, glutamine and standard antibiotics. In all cases the cells, and also the virus stock solution used for the infection (HIV-1/MN), are free of mycoplasms. The virus stock solution is prepared as a cell culture supernatant of the permanently infected cell line H9/HIV-1/MN, which can likewise be obtained via the AIDS Research and Reference Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH from Dr. Robert Gallo (see also Science 224, 500-503 (1984) and Science 226, 1165-1170 (1984)). The titre of the HIV-1/MN virus stock solution (determined by titration onto MT-2-cells) is 4.210 5 TCID50/ml (TCID50Tissue Culture Infective Dosedose that infects 50% of the MT-2-cells). In order to measure the infection-inhibiting action of the compounds of formula I, 50 l of the test compound in question in culture medium and 2800 TCID50 of HIV-1/MN in 100 l of culture medium are added to 210 4 exponentially growing MT-2-cells which have been applied in 50 l of culture medium to 96-well microtitre plates (having a round base). After 4 days incubation (at 37 C., 5% CO 2 ) a 10 l sample of the supernatant is taken from each well, transferred to a further 96-well microtitre plate and (if necessary) stored at 20 C. In order to measure the activity of the virus-associated reverse transcriptase, 30 l of reverse transcriptase (RT) cocktail are added to each sample. The reverse transcriptase cocktail consists of 50 mM Tris (,,-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine, Ultra pur, Merck, Germany) pH 7.8; 75 mM KCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl 2 ; 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (detergent; Sigma, Switzerland), 0.8 mM EDTA, 10 g/ml Poly-A (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) and 0.16 g/ml oligo(T) (pdT(12-18), Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) as template primerif desired, the mixture is filtered through a 0.45 mm Acrodisc filter (Gelman Sciences Inc., Ann Arbor, USA). It is stored at 20 C. Prior to the test, 0.1% (v/v) alpha- 32 PdTTP is added to aliquots of the solution in order to establish a radioactivity of 10 Ci/ml. After mixing, the plate is incubated for 2 hours at 37 C. 5 l of the reaction mixture are transferred to DE81 paper (Whatman, one filter per well). The dried filters are washed three times for 5 minutes with 300 mM NaCl/25 mM trisodium citrate and then once with ethanol and again dried in the air. The radioactivity on the filters is measured in a Matrix Packard 96-well counter (Packard, Zurich, Switzerland). The ED 90 values are calculated and are defined as the concentration of the test compound that reduces the RT activity by 90% in comparison with a control without test compound. The preferred compounds of formula I here exhibit an ED 90 , that is to say a 90% inhibition of virus replication, at concentrations of from 10 7 to 10 9 M, especially from 510 9 to 10 9 M. Accordingly, the compounds of formula I are suitable for the highly effective retardation of the replication of HIV-1 in cell cultures. In order to determine their pharmacokinetics, the compounds of formula I are dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in a concentration of 240 mg/ml. The resulting solutions are diluted 1:20 (v/v) with 20% (w/v) aqueous hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin solution in order to obtain a concentration of the test compound in question of 12 mg/ml. The resulting solution is treated briefly with ultrasound and administered orally to female BALB/c mice (Bomholt-garden, Copenhagen, Denmark) by artificial tube feeding at a dose of 120 mg/kg. At fixed times (for example 30, 60, 90, 120 min) after administration, mice are sacrificed and the plasma stored in heparinised test tubes. The blood is centrifuged (12 000g, 5 min) and the plasma removed. The plasma is deproteinised by the addition of an equal volume of acetonitrile. The mixture is mixed using a vortex mixer and and left to stand at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes. The precipitate is pelleted by centrifugation (12 000g, 5 min), and the concentration of the test compound is determined by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The HPLC analysis of the samples obtained in accordance with the method described above is carried out on a 1254.6 mm Nucleosil C 18 -column (reversed-phase material supplied by Macherey Nagel, Dren, Germany, based on silica gel derivatised with carbon radicals having 18 carbon atoms), using a 2 cm long preliminary column of the same column material. The test is carried out with the following linear acetonitrile/water gradient (in each case in the presence of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid): 20% acetonitrile to 100% acetonitriie for 20 min; then 5 min 100% acetonitrile; then returning to the initial conditions for 1 min and 4 min reequilibration. The flow rate is 1 ml/min. Under those conditions the compound of formula I from Example 1, for example, has a retention time of about 15.5 minutes, and its detection limit is 0.1-0.2 M. The test compound is detected by UV absorption measurement at 255 nm. Peaks are identified by the retention time and the UV spectrum between 205 and 400 nm. The concentrations are determined by the external standard method; the peak heights are obtained for determining the concentrations by comparison with standard curves. The standard curves are obtained by analogous HPLC analysis of mouse plasma that contains known concentrations of the test compound in question and that has been worked up in accordance with the method described above. In that experiment compounds of formula I produce plasma concentrations far above the ED 90 determined above in the cell experiment, for example up to 8000 times greater than the ED 90 after 30 minutes and up to 10 500 times greater than the ED 90 after 90 minutes, preferably plasma concentrations of from 0.1 M to 25 M, especially from 1 to 25 M, 30 minutes after oral administration, and plasma concentrations of from 0.5 to 35 M, especially from 1 to 35 M, 90 minutes after oral administration. Analogously, in dogs, the blood level of the compounds of formula I, for example the title compound of Example 46, can be measured, for example, using the formulations according to either Example 63 or Example 64, there being used, for example, from 92 to 100 mg/kg of the compound which is administered by stomach tube, the blood levels then being measured, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours after administration. Here, also, blood levels in the micromolar range can be found. In particular, the combination of high bioavailability (high plasma levels), which is surprising in itself, and unexpectedly excellent ED 90 in the cell experiment renders the compounds of the present invention valuable in an unforeseen way. Activity against inhibitors of retroviral aspartate proteases to which resistance has already developed is also still possible and is a further important advantage of the compounds according to the invention. That can be demonstrated, for example, by the following or analogous tests: Inhibitor-resistant HIV-1 protease variants are cloned as follows: By way of PCR-supported mutagenesis and cloning, HIV-1 protease mutants are generated that are based on the infectious clone pNL4-3 (freely available via the NIH AIDS reference and reagent program, the original reference is A. Adachi et al. J. Virol (1986) 59, 284-91but it can, of course, be any other HIV clone, or even clinical material, provided that comparability is ensured). Those otherwise isogenic point mutants contain only those changes which have been described in publications in connection with viral resistance to various protease inhibitors. The cloned fragments are, for example, only 500 base pairs in length, all of the remainder being unchanged. By using mutations in always the same clone, direct comparability is ensured, which would rot be the case in a direct comparison of clinical samples or of different HIV clones. In the transient DNA transfection assay in human T4-positive cells (HeLaT4), the resulting proviruses also demonstrate the finding of reduced inhibitor activity in comparison with the wild type virus, that is to say increased resistance. That system is used as a transient DNA transfection system for tests: 1) in order to identify possible cross-resistances of protease variants to several protease inhibitors; and 2) in order to establish the potency and resistance profile of novel inhibitor candidates. For example, in the said transfection system 1-4-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl-4(S)-hydroxy-5(S)-2,5-bis-N-(N-methoxycarbonyl-(L)-tert-leucyl)amino-6-phenyl-2-azahexane (Example 46) has an in vitro potency that, with an IC90 of 30 nM, is in practical terms better than that of saquinavir (Hoffmann-LaRoche, see below) and the activity against a resistant variant (45I,76F strain) which has been established against 5(S)-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)-4(S)-hydroxy-6-phenyl-2(R)-(2,3,4-trimethoxyphenylmethyl)-hexanoyl-(L)-valyl-N-(2-methoxy-ethyl)-amide (Lasinavir, see EP 0 708 085, published on Apr. 24, 1996; Novartis AG, originally Ciba-Geigy AG), is comparable with saquinavir and better than that of indinavir (Merck Co., Inc., see below) or ritonavir (Abbott, see below). Compared with other strains (e.g. 46I/47V/50V (VX478)), 1 nM produced an activity that was more potent (not quantified) than that of saquinavir, ritonavir and indinavir. Instead of the strains mentioned, there may be used any human T4-positive cells, such as the HeLa T4 cells, deposited under that name by Richard Axel and Paul Maddon in NIH AIDS reference and reagent program and obtainable via that source. In principle, the relevant mutations for the above test systems for resistances are known (see e.g. relating to the 48V/90M strain (saquinavir resistance): Jacobsen, H., Yasargil, K., Winslow, D. L., Craig, J. C., Krohn, A., Duncan, I. B., Mous, J. Virology 206, 527 (1995); Merck Mutationen (several, e.g. 71V/82T/84V): Condra, J. H., Schleif, W. A., Blahy, O. M., Gabryelski, L. J., Graham, D. J., Quintero, J. C., Rhodes, A., Robbins, H. L., Roth, E., Shivaprakash, M., et al Nature 374, 569 (1995); Abbott 82V/84A strain: Markowitz, M., Mo, H., Kempf, D. J., Norbeck, D. W., Bhat, T. N., Erickson, J. W., Ho, D. D. J. Virol. 69, 701 (1995). In the determination of the anti-enzymatic activity against numerous human aspartate proteases in accordance with known methods (see, for example, Biochem. J. 265, 871-878 (1990)), compounds of formula I exhibit a high selectivity towards the retroviral aspartate protease of HIV, especially HIV-1. For example, the inhibition constant (IC 50 ) for compounds of formula I in the test against cathepsin D is more than 10 M, especially more than 25 M. The IC 50 against human cathepsin D in that test is measured at pH 3.1. The test is carried out in accordance with known procedures using the substrate KPIQF*NphRL (see Jupp, R. A., Dunn, B. M., Jacobs, J. W., Viasuk, G., Arcuri, K. E., Veber, D. F., S. Perow, D. S., Payne, L. S., Boger, J., DeLazio, S., Chakrabarty, P. K., TenBroeke, J., Hangauer, D. G., Ondeyka, D., Greenlee, W.

The compounds of formula I can also be used in the prevention, control and treatment of retrovirus infections, especially HIV, such as HIV-1 or HIV-2, in cell cultures, especially cell cultures of lymphocyte cell lines, from warm-blooded animals, which is advantageous especially in the case of very valuable cell cultures that produce, for example, specific antibodies, vaccines or messenger substances, such as interleukins and the like, and are therefore of great commercial value.

Special preference is given to the compounds of formula I mentioned in the Examples, or to pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof provided that at least one salt-forming group is present. The compounds of formula I and salts of those compounds having at least one salt-forming group are prepared according to processes known per se, for example as follows: a) a hydrazine derivative of formula wherein the radicals R 4 , R 5 and R 6 are as defined for compounds of formula I, is added to an epoxide of formula IV*, especially of formula IV, wherein the radicals R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are as defined for compounds of formula I, free functional groups with the exception of those participating in the reaction being, if necessary, in protected form, and any protecting groups are removed, or b) an amino compound of formula V*, especially of formula V wherein the radicals R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 are as defined for compounds of formula I, is condensed with an acid of formula or with a reactive acid derivative thereof, wherein the radicals R 5 and R 6 are as defined for compounds of formula I, free functional groups with the exception of those participating in the reaction being, if necessary, in protected form, and any protecting groups are removed, or c) an amino compound of formula VII*, especially of formula VII wherein the radicals R 3 , R 4 , R 5 and R 6 are as defined for compounds of formula I, is condensed with an acid of formula or with a reactive acid derivative thereof, wherein R 1 and R 2 are as defined for compounds of formula I, free functional groups with the exception of those participating in the reaction being, if necessary, in protected form, and any protecting groups are removed, or d) to prepare a compound of formula I wherein the pairs of substituents R 1 and R 6 and R 2 and R 5 are in each case two identical radicals, as defined for compounds of formula I, and R 3 and R 4 are as defined for compounds of formula I, a diamino compound of formula IX* especially of formula IX, wherein the radicals are as just defined, is condensed with an acid of formula or with a reactive acid derivative thereof, wherein R 1 and R 2 are as defined for R 1 and R 6 and for R 2 and R 5 respectively, in formula I, the pairs R 1 and R 6 and R 2 and R 5 being in each case two identical radicals, free functional groups with the exception of those participating in the reaction being, if necessary, in protected form, and any protecting groups are removed, or e) an imino compound of formula (I)*, especially of formula I wherein the radicals R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 5 and R 6 are as defined for compounds of formula I, is reacted with a compound of formula X, wherein X is a leaving group and R 4 is as defined for compounds of formula I, free functional groups with the exception of those participating in the reaction being, if necessary, in protected form, and any protecting groups are removed, or f) an imino compound of formula (I)*, especially of formula I wherein the radicals R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 5 and R 6 are as defined for compounds of formula I, is reacted with an aldehyde of formula X*, wherein R 4 is as defined for compounds of formula I, or with a reactive derivative thereof, with reductive alkylation, free functional groups with the exception of those participating in the reaction being, if necessary, in protected form, and any protecting groups are removed, and, if desired, a compound of formula I having at least one salt-forming group obtainable in accordance with any one of processes a) to f) above is converted into its salt or an obtainable salt is converted into the free compound or into a different salt and/or isomeric mixtures which may be obtainable are separated and/or a compound of formula I according to the invention is converted into a different compound of formula I according to the invention. The above processes are described in more detail below with reference to preferred embodiments. In the following description of the individual processes and the preparation of the starting materials, unless otherwise indicated the radicals R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 and R 6 are as defined for compounds of formula I, preference being given in each case to the definitions given as being preferred. Process a) (Addition of an amine to an epoxide): In the hydrazine derivatives of formula III, the amino group participating in the reaction preferably has a free hydrogen atom; it may, however, itself have been derivatised in order to increase the reactivity of the hydrazine derivative. The epoxide of formula IV enables the terminal addition of the hydrazine derivative to proceed preferentially. In starting materials, functional groups the reaction of which is to be avoided, especially carboxy, amino and hydroxy groups, can be protected by suitable protecting groups (conventional protecting groups) which are customarily used in the synthesis of peptide compounds, and also in the synthesis of cephalosporins and penicillins as well as nucleic acid derivatives and sugars. Those protecting groups may already be present in the precursors and are intended to protect the functional groups in question against undesired secondary reactions, such as acylation, etherification, esterification, oxidation, solvolysis and the like. In certain cases the protecting groups can additionally cause reactions to proceed selectively, for example stereoselectively. It is characteristic of protecting groups that they can be removed easily, i.e. without undesired secondary reactions taking place, for example by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis, and also enzymatically, for example also under physiological conditions. Radicals analogous to protecting groups may also be present in the end products, however. Compounds of formula I having protected functional groups may have greater metabolic stability or pharmacodynamic properties that are better in some other way than the corresponding compounds having free functional groups. Hereinabove and hereinbelow, protecting groups are referred to in their true sense when the radicals in question are not present in the end products. The protection of functional groups by such protecting groups, the protecting groups themselves and the reactions for their removal are described, for example, in standard works such as J. F. W. McOmie, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Plenum Press, London and New York 1973, in Th. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley, New York 1981, in The Peptides, Volume 3 (E. Gross and J. Meienhofer, eds.), Academic Press, London and New York 1981, in Methoden der organischen Chemie (Methods of Organic Chemistry), Houben-Weyl, 4th edition, Volume 15/l, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974, in H.-D. Jakubke and H. Jescheit, Aminosuren, Peptide, Proteine (Amino acids, peptides, proteins), Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Deerfield Beach and Basle 1982, and in Jochen Lehmann, Chemie der Kohlenhydrate: Monosaccharide und Derivate (The Chemistry of Carbohydrates: monosaccharides and derivatives), Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974. A carboxy group is protected, for example, in the form of an ester group which can be cleaved selectively under mild conditions. A carboxy group protected in esterified form is esterified especially by a lower alkyl group that is preferably branched in the 1-position of the lower alkyl group or substituted in the 1- or 2-position of the lower alkyl group by suitable substituents. A protected carboxy group esterified by a lower alkyl group is, for example, methoxycarbonyl or ethoxycarbonyl. A protected carboxy group esterified by a lower alkyl group that is branched in the 1-position of the lower alkyl group is, for example, tert-lower alkoxycarbonyl, for example tert-butoxycarbonyl. A protected carboxy group esterified by a lower alkyl group that is substituted in the 1- or 2-position of the lower alkyl group by suitable substituents is, for example, arylmethoxycarbonyl having one or two aryl radicals, wherein aryl is phenyl that is unsubstituted or mono-, di- or tri-substituted, for example, by lower alkyl, for example tert-lower alkyl, such as tert-butyl, lower alkoxy, for example methoxy, hydroxy, halogen, for example chlorine, and/or by nitro, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl substituted by the mentioned substituents, for example 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl or 4-methoxybenzyloxy-carbonyl, diphenylmethoxycarbonyl or diphenylmethoxycarbonyl substituted by the mentioned substituents, for example di(4-methoxyphenyl)methoxycarbonyl, and also carboxy esterified by a lower alkyl group, the lower alkyl group being substituted in the 1- or 2-position by suitable substituents, such as 1-lower alkoxy-lower alkoxycarbonyl, for example methoxymethoxycarbonyl, 1-methoxyethoxycarbonyl or 1-ethoxyethoxycarbonyl, 1-lower alkylthio-lower alkoxycarbonyl, for example 1-methylthiomethoxycarbonyl or 1-ethylthioethoxycarbonyl, aroylmethoxycarbonyl wherein the aroyl group is benzoyl that is unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by halogen, such as bromine, for example phenacyloxycarbonyl, 2-halo-lower alkoxycarbonyl, for example 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, 2-bromoethoxycarbonyl or 2-iodoethoxycarbonyl, as well as 2-(tri-substituted silyl)-lower alkoxycarbonyl wherein the substituents are each independently of the others an aliphatic, araliphatic, cycloaliptatic or aromatic hydrocarbon raodical that is unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, aryl, halogen and/or by nitro, for example lower alkyl, phenyl-lower alkyl, cycloalkyl or phenyl each of which is unsubstituted or substituted as above, for example 2-tri-lower alkylsilyl-lower alkoxycarbonyl, such as 2-tri-lower alkylsilylethoxycarbonyl, for example 2-trimethylsilylethoxycarbonyl or 2-(di-n-butyl-methyl-silyl)-ethoxycarbonyl, or 2-triarylsilylethoxycarbonyl, such as triphenylsilylethoxycarbonyl. A carboxy group may also be protected in the form of an organic silyloxycarbonyl group. An organic silyloxycarbonyl group is, for example, a tri-lower alkylsilyloxycarbonyl group, for example trimethylsilyloxycarbonyl. A protected carboxy group is preferably tert-lower alkoxycarbonyl, for example tert-butoxy-carbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl or diphenylmethoxycarbonyl. A protected amino group may be protected by an amino-protecting group, for example in the form of an acylamino, arylmethylamino, etherified mercaptoamino, 2-acyl-lower alk-1-enylamino or silylamino group, or in the form of an azido group. In a corresponding acylamino group, acyl is, for example, the acyl radical of an organic carboxylic acid having, for example, up to 18 carbon atoms, especially an unsubstituted or substituted, for example halo- or aryl-substituted, lower alkanecarboxylic acid or an unsubstituted or substituted, for example halo-, lower alkoxy- or nitro-substituted, benzoic acid, or, preferably, of a carbonic acid semiester. Such acyl groups are, for example, lower alkanoyl, such as formyl, acetyl, propionyl or pivaloyl, halo-lower alkanoyl, for example 2-haloacetyl, such as 2-chloro-, 2-bromo-, 2-iodo-, 2,2,2-trifluoro- or 2,2,2-trichloro-acetyl, unsubstituted or substituted, for example halo-, lower alkoxy- or nitro-substituted, benzoyl, such as benzoyl, 4-chlorobenzoyl, 4-methoxybenzoyl or 4-nitrobenzoyl, lower alkoxycarbonyl, preferably lower alkoxycarbonyl that is branched in the 1-position of the lower alkyl radical or suitably substituted in the 1- or 2-position, for example tert-lower alkoxycarbonyl, such as tert-butoxycarbonyl, arylmethoxycarbonyl having one, two or three aryl radicals which are phenyl that is unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted, for example, by lower alkyl, especially tert-lower alkyl, such as tert-butyl, lower alkoxy, such as methoxy, hydroxy, halogen, such as chlorine, and/or by nitro, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, diphenylmethoxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl or di(4-methoxyphenyl)methoxycarbonyl, aroylmethoxycarbonyl wherein the aroyl group is preferably benzoyl that is unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by halogen, such as bromine, for example phenacyloxycarbonyl, 2-halo-lower alkoxycarbonyl, for example 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, 2-bromoethoxycarbonyl or 2-iodoethoxycarbonyl, 2-(tri-substituted silyl)-lower alkoxycarbonyl, for example 2-tri-lower alkylsilyl-lower alkoxycarbonyl, such as 2-trimethylsilylethoxycarbonyl or 2-(di-n-butyl-methyl-silyl)-ethoxycarbonyl, or triarylsilyl-lower alkoxycarbonyl, for example 2-triphenylsilylethoxycarbonyl. In an arylmethylamino group, for example a mono-, di- or especially tri-arylmethylamino group, the aryl radicals are especially unsubstituted or substituted phenyl radicals. Such groups are, for example, benzyl-, diphenylmethyl- or especially trityl-amino, or very especially 1-aryl-lower alkylmethylamino wherein the lower alkyl radical is preferably branched in the 1-position, such as in 1-methyl-1-phenyl-ethylamino. In an etherified mercaptoamino group the mercapto group is especially in the form of substituted arylthio or aryl-lower alkylthio wherein aryl is, for example, phenyl that is unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by lower alkyl, such as methyl or tert-butyl, lower alkoxy, such as methexy, halogen, such as chlorine, and/or by nitro, for example 4-nitrophenylthio. In a 2-acyl-lower alk-1-enyl radical that can be used as an amino-protecting group, acyl is, for example, the corresponding radical of a lower alkanecarboxylic acid, of a benzoic acid that is unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by lower alkyl, such as methyl or tert-butyl, lower alkoxy, such as methoxy, halogen, such as chlorine, and/or by nitro, or especially of a carbonic acid semiester, such as a carbonic acid lower alkyl semiester. Corresponding protecting groups are especially 1-lower alkanoyl-lower alk-1-en-2-yl, for example 1-lower alkanoyl-prop-1-en-2-yl, such as 1-acetyl-prop-1-en-2-yl, or lower alkoxycarbonyl-lower alk-1-en-2-yl, for example lower alkoxycarbonyl-prop-1-en-2-yl, such as 1-ethoxycarbonyl-prop-1-en-2-yl. A silylamino group is, for example, a tri-lower alkylsilylamino group, for example trimethylsilylamino or tert-butyl-dimethylsilylamino. The silicon atom of the silylamino group can also be substituted by only two lower alkyl groups, for example methyl groups, and by the amino group or carboxy group of a second molecule of formula I. Compounds having such protecting groups can be prepared, for example, using the corresponding chlorosilanes, such as dimethylchlorosilane, as silylating agents. An amino group can also be protected by conversion into the protonated form; suitable corresponding anions are especially those of strong inorganic acids, such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or hydrohalic acids, for example the chlorine or bromine anion, or of organic sulfonic acids, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid. Preferred amino-protecting groups are lower alkoxycarbonyl, phenyl-lower alkoxycarbonyl, fluorenyl-lower alkoxycarbonyl, 2-lower alkanoyl-lower alk-1-en-2-yl, 1-methyl-1-phenyl-ethyl and lower alkoxycarbonyl-lower alk-1-en-2-yl. A hydroxy group can be protected, for example, by an acyl group, for example lower alkanoyl that is substituted by halogen, such as chlorine, such as 2,2-dichloroacetyl, or especially by an acyl radical of a carbonic acid semiester mentioned for protected amino groups. A preferred hydroxy-protecting group is, for example, 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, diphenylmethoxycarbonyl or trityl. A hydroxy group can also be protected by tri-lower alkylsilyl, for example trimethylsilyl, triisopropylsilyl or tert-butyl-di-methylsilyl, a readily removable etherifying group, for example an alkyl group, such as tert-lower alkyl, for example tert-butyl, an oxa- or a thia-aliphatic or -cycloaliphatic, especially 2-oxa- or 2-thia-aliphatic or -cycloaliphatic, hydrocarbon radical, for example 1-lower alkoxy-lower alkyl or 1-lower alkylthio-lower alkyl, such as methoxymethyl, 1-methoxyethyl, 1-ethoxyethyl, methylthiomethyl, 1-methylthioethyl or 1-ethylthioethyl, or 2-oxa- or 2-thia-cycloalkyl having from 5 to 7 ring atoms, such as 2-tetrahydrofuryl or 2-tetrahydropyranyl, or a corresponding thia analogue, and also by 1-phenyl-lower alkyl, such as benzyl, diphenylmethyl or trityl, wherein the phenyl radicals can be substituted, for example, by halogen, for example chlorine, lower alkoxy, for example methoxy, and/or by nitro. A hydroxy group and an amino group that are adjacent to one another in a molecule can be protected, for example, by bivalent protecting groups, such as a methylene group that is preferably substituted, for example by one or two lower alkyl radicals or by oxo, for example unsubstituted or substituted alkylidene, for example lower alkylidene, such as isopropylidene, cycloalkylidene, such as cyclohexylidene, a carbonyl group or benzylidene. In the context of this disclosure, a protecting group, for example a carboxy-protecting group, is to be understood as being expressly also a polymeric carrier that is bonded in a readily removable maiiner to the functional group, for example the carboxy group, to be protected, for example a carrier suitable for the Merrifield synthesis. Such a suitable polymeric carrier is, for example, a polystyrene resin weakly cross-linked by copolymerisation with divinylbenzene and carrying bridge members suitable for reversible bonding. The addition of the compounds of formula III to the epoxides of formula IV is carried out preferably under the reaction conditions customarily used for the addition of nucleophiles to epoxides. The addition is carried out especially in aqueous solution and/or in the presence of polar solvents, such as alcohols, for example methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or ethylene glycol, ethers, such as dioxane, amides, such as dimethylformamide, or phenols, such as phenol, and also under anhydrous conditions, in non-polar solvents, such as benzene or toluene, or in benzene/water emulsions, optionally in the presence of acidic or basic catalysts, for example alkali hydroxide solutions, such as sodium hydroxide solution, or in the presence of solid phase catalysts doped with the hydrazine, such as aluminium oxide, in ethers, for example diethyl ether, generally at temperatures of from approximately 0 C. to the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture in question, preferably from 20 C. to reflux temperature, optionally under elevated pressure, for example in a bomb tube, in which case it is also possible to exceed the boiling temperature measurable at normal pressure, and/or under an inert gas, such as nitrogen or argon, it being possible for each of the two compounds of formulae III and IV to be present in excess, for example in a molar ratio of from 1:1 to 1:100, especially in a molar ratio of from 1:1 to 1:10, more especially in a ratio of from 1:1 to 1:3. The freeing of protected groups may be effected in accordance with the methods described below under the heading Removal of protecting groups. Process b) (Formation of an amide bond) In starting materials of formulae V and VI, functional groups, with the exception of groups that are to participate in the reaction or that do not react under the reaction conditions, are protected independently of one another by one of the protecting groups mentioned under Process a). The compounds of formula VI either contain a free carboxy group or are in the form of a reactive acid derivative thereof, for example in the form of a derived activated ester or reactive anhydride, or in the form of a reactive cyclic amide. The reactive acid derivatives may also be formed in situ. Activated esters of compounds of formula VI having a terminal carboxy group are especially esters unsaturated at the carbon atom linking the radical to be esterified, for example esters of the vinyl ester type, such as vinyl esters (obtainable, for example, by transesterification of a corresponding ester with vinyl acetate; activated vinyl ester method), carbamoyl esters (obtainable, for example, by treatment of the corresponding acid with an isoxazolium reagent; 1,2-oxazolium or Woodward method), or 1-lower alkoxyvinyl esters (obtainable, for example, by treatment of the corresponding acid with a lower alkoxyacetylene; ethoxyacetylene method), or esters of the amidino type, such as N,N-disubstituted amidino esters (obtainable, for example, by treatment of the corresponding acid with a suitable N,N-di-substituted carbodiimide, for example N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or especially N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide; carbodiimide method), or N,N-disubstituted amidino esters (obtainable, for example, by treatment of the corresponding acid with an N,N-disubstituted cyanamide; cyanamide method), suitable aryl esters, especially phenyl esters suitably substituted by electron-attracting substituents (obtainable, for example, by treatment of the corresponding acid with a suitably substituted phenol, for example 4-nitro-phenol, 4-methylsulfonylphenol, 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, 2,3,4,5,6-pentachlorophenol or 4-phenyldiazophenol, in the presence of a condensation agent, such as N,N-dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide; activated aryl esters method), cyanomethyl esters (obtainable, for example, by treatment of the corresponding acid with chloroacetonitrile in the presence of a base; cyanomethyl esters method), thio esters, especially unsubstituted or substituted, for example nitro-substituted, phenylthio esters (obtainable, for example, by treatment of the corresponding acid with unsubstituted or substituted, for example nitro-substituted, thio-phenols, inter alia by the anhydride or carbodiimide method; activated thiol esters method), or especially amino or amido esters (obtainable, for example, by treatment of the corresponding acid with an N-hydroxyamino or N-hydroxyamido compound, for example N-hydroxysuccinimide, N-hydroxypiperidine, N-hydroxyphthalimide, N-hydroxy-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxylicacid imide, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole or 3-hydroxy-3,4-dihydro-1,2,3-benzo-triazin-4-one, for example by the anhydride or carbodiimide method; activated N-hydroxy esters method). Internal esters, for example -lactones, can also be used. Anhydrides of acids may be symmetric or preferably mixed anhydrides of those acids, for example anhydrides with inorganic acids, such as acid halides, especially acid chlorides (obtainable, for example, by treatment of the corresponding acid with thionyl chloride, phosphorus pentachloride, phosgene or oxalyl chloride; acid chloride method), azides (obtainable, for example, from a corresponding acid ester via the corresponding hydrazide and treatment thereof with nitrous acid; azide method), anhydrides with carbonic acid semi-esters, for example carbonic acid lower alkyl semesters (especially chloroformic acid methyl esters) (obtainable, for example, by treatment of the corresponding acid with chloroformic acid lower alkyl esters or with a 1-lower alkoxycarbonyl-2-lower alkoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline; mixed O-alkylcarbonic acid anhydrides method), or anhydrides with dihalogenated, especially dichlorinated, phosphoric acid (obtainable, for example, by treatment of the corresponding acid with phosphorus oxychloride; phosphorus oxychloride method), anhydrides with other phosphoric acid derivatives (for example those obtainable with phenyl-N-phenyl-phosphoramidochloridate or by reaction of alkylphosphoric acid amides in the presence of sulfonic acid anhydrides and/or racemisation-reducing additives, such as N-hydroxybenzotriazole, or in the presence of cyanophQsphonic acid diethyl ester) or with phosphorous acid derivatives, or anhydrides with organic acids, such as mixed anhydrides with organic carboxylic acids (obtainable, for example, by treatment of the corresponding acid with an unsubstituted or substituted lower alkane- or phenyl-lower alkane-carboxylic acid halide, for example phenylacetic acid chloride, pivalic acid chloride or trifluoroacetic acid chloride; mixed carboxylic acid anhydrides method) or with organic sulfonic acids (obtainable, for example, by treatment of a salt, such as an alkali metal salt, of the corresponding acid with a suitable organic sulfonic acid halide, such as a lower alkane- or aryl-, for example methane- or p-toluene-sulfonic acid chloride; mixed sulfonic acid anhydrides method) and symmetric anhydrides (obtainable, for example, by condensation of the corresponding acid in the presence of a carbodiimide or 1-diethylaminopropyne; symmetric anhydrides method). Suitable cyclic amides are especially amides with five-membered diazacycles of aromatic character, such as amides with imidazoles, for example imidazole (obtainable, for example, by treatment of the corresponding acid with N,N-carbonyldiimidazole; imidazole method), or pyrazole, for example 3,5-dimethylpyrazole (obtainable, for example, via the acid hydrazide by treatment with acetylacetone; pyrazolide method). As mentioned, derivatives of carboxylic acids used as acylating agents may also be formed in situ. For example, N,N-disubstituted amidino esters may be formed in situ by reacting a mixture of the starting material of formula V and the acid used as acylating agent in the presence of a suitable N,N-disubstituted carbodiimide, for example N,N-cyclohexylcarbodiimide or especially N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide. In addition, amino or amido esters of the acids used as acylating agents may be formed in the presence of the starting material of formula V to be acylated, by reacting a mixture of the corresponding acid and amino starting materials in the presence of an N,N-disubstituted carbodiimide, for example N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and of an N-hydroxyamine or N-hydroxyamide, for example N-hydroxysuccinimide, where appropriate in the presence of a suitable base, for example 4-dimethylamino-pyridine. Furthermore, activation in situ can be achieved by reaction with N,N,N,N-tetraalkyluronium compounds, such as O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N,N-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, O-(1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-1-pyridyl)-N,N,N,N-tetra-methyluronium tetrafluoroborate (in the presence or absence of 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0-undec-7-ene(1,5-5)) or O-(3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,2,3-benzotriazolin-3-yl)-N,N,N,N-tetra-methyluronium tetrafluoroborate. Finally, phosphoric acid anhydrides of the carboxylic acids of formula VI can be prepared in siftu by reacting an alkylphosphoric acid amide, such as hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide, in the presence of a sulfonic acid anhydride, such as 4-toluenesulfonic acid anhydride, with a salt, such as a tetrafluoroborate, for example sodium tetrafluoroborate, or with another derivative of hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide, such as benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluoride, preferably in the presence of a racemisation-reducing additive, such as N-hydroxybenzotriazole. The amino group of compounds of formula V that participates in the reaction preferably carries at least one reactive hydrogen atom, especially when the carboxy, sulfonyl or phosphoryl group reacting therewith is present in reactive form; it may, however, itself have been derivatised, for example by reaction with a phosphite, such as diethylchlorophosphite, 1,2-phenylene chlorophosphite, ethyldichlorophosphite, ethylene chlorophosphite or tetra-ethylpyrophosphite. A derivative of such a compound having an amino group is, for example, also a carbamic acid halide or an isocyanate, the amino group that participates in the reaction being substituted by halocarbonyl, for example chlorocarbonyl, or modified in the form of an isocyanate group, respectively. Condensation to form an amide bond can be carried out in a manner known per se, for example as described in standard works, such as Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, 4th edition, Volume 15/II (1974), Volume IX (1955), Volume E11 (1985), Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, The Peptides (E. Gross and J. Meienhofer, eds.), Volumes 1 and 2, Academic Press, London and New York, 1979/1980, or M.Bodansky, Principles of Peptide Synthesis, Springer-Verlag, Berlin 1984. The condensation of a free carboxylic acid with the appropriate amine can be carried out preferably in the presence of one of the customary condensation agents, or using carboxylic acid anhydrides or carboxylic acid halides, such as chlorides, or activated carboxylic acid esters, such as p-nitrophenyl esters. Customary condensation agents are, for example, carbodiimides, for example diethyl-, dipropyl- or dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide or especially N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide, also suitable carbonyl compounds, for example carbonylimidazole, 1,2-oxazolium compounds, for example 2-ethyl-5-phenyl-1,2-oxazolium-3-sulfonate and 2-tert-butyl-5-methylisoxazolium perchlorate, or a suitable acylamino compound, for example 2-ethoxy-1-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-dihydro-quinoline, N,N,N,N,N-tetraaakyluronium compounds, such as O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N,N-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate or especially O-(1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-1-pyridyl)-N,N,N,N-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (in the presence or absence of 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene-(1,5-5)), also activated phosphoric acid derivatives, for example diphenylphosphorylazide, diethylphosphorylcyanide, phenyl-N-phenylphosphoro-amidochloridate, bis(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)phosphinic acid chloride or 1-benzotriazolyloxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate. If desired, an organic base is added, preferably a tertiary amine, for example a tri-lower alkylamine, especially ethyldiisopropylamine or more especially triethylamine, and/or a heterocyclic base, for example 4-dimethylaminopyridine or preferably N-methylmorpholine or pyridine. The condensation of activated esters, reactive anhydrides or reactive cyclic amides with the corresponding amines is customarily carried out in the presence of an organic base, for example simple tri-lower alkylamines, for example triethylamine or tributylamine, or one of the above-mentioned organic bases. If desired, a condensation agent is additionally used, for example as described for free carboxylic acids. The condensation of acid anhydrides with amines can be effected, for example, in the presence of inorganic carbonates, for example ammonium or alkali metal carbonates or hydrogen carbonates, such as sodium or potassium carbonate or hydrogen carbonate (if desired together with a sulfate). Carboxylic acid chlorides, for example the chlorocarbonic acid derivatives derived from the acid of formula VI, are condensed with the corresponding amines preferably in the presence of an organic amine, for example the above-mentioned tri-lower alkylamines or heterocyclic bases, where appropriate in the presence of a hydrogen sulfate or a hydroxide, preferably an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide. The condensation is preferably carried out in an inert, aprotic, preferably anhydrous, solvent or solvent mixture, for example in a carboxylic acid amide, for example formamide or dimethylformamide, a halogenated hydrocarbon, for example methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride or chlorobenzene, a ketone, for example acetone, a cyclic ether, for example tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, an ester, for example ethyl acetate, or a nitrile, for example acetonitrile, or in a mixture thereof, as appropriate at reduced or elevated temperature, for example in a temperature range of from approximately 40 to approximately 100 C., preferably from approximately 10 to approximately 70 C., and when arylsulfonyl esters are used also at approximately from 100 to 200 C., especially at temperatures of from 10 to 30 C., and if necessary under an inert gas atmosphere, for example a nitrogen or argon atmosphere. Aqueous, for example alcoholic, solvents, for example ethanol, or aromatic solvents, for example benzene or toluene, may also be used. When alkali metal hydroxides are present as bases, acetone may also be added where appropriate. The condensation can also be carried out in accordance with the technique known as solid-phase synthesis which originates from R. Merrifield and is described, for example, in Angew. Chem 97, 801-812 (1985), Naturwissenschaften 71, 252-258 (1984) or in R. A. Houghten, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 5131-5135 (1985). The freeing of protected groups may be effected in accordance with the methods described below under the heading Removal of protecting groups. Process c) (Formation of an amide bond) In starting materials of formulae VII and VIII, functional groups, with the exception of groups that are to participate in the reaction or that do not react under the reaction conditions, are protected independently of one another by one of the protecting groups mentioned under Process a). The process is entirely analogous to that given under Process b) but compounds of formula VII are used instead of those of formula V and compounds of formula VIII are used instead of those of formula VI. The freeing of protected groups may be effected in accordance with the methods described below under the heading Removal of protecting groups. Process d) (Formation of an amide bond) In starting materials of formula IX and in the acid of formula VIIIa suitable for the introduction of tne identical acyl radicals, or in reactive derivatives thereof, functional groups that are not to participate in the reaction or that do not react under the reaction conditions, are protected independently of one another by one of the protecting groups mentioned under Process a). Preferred starting compounds of formula IX, which may be protected by protecting groups, are those of formula II described below in the section relating to starting compounds. The process is entirely analogous to that given under Process b) but compounds of formula IX are used instead of those of formula V and compounds of formula VIIIa are used instead of those of formula VI. The freeing of protected groups may be effected in accordance with the methods described below under the heading Removal of protecting groups. Process e) (Alkylation of a secondary nitrogen atom) In starting materials of formula I and formula X or in reactive derivatives thereof, functional groups that are not to participate in the reaction or that do not react under the reaction conditions, are protected independently of one another by one of the protecting groups mentioned under Process a). A leaving group X is especially a nucleofugal leaving group selected from hydroxy esterified by a strong inorganic or organic acid, such as hydroxy esterified by a mineral acid, for example a hydrohalic acid, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic or hydriodic acid, hydroxy esterified by a strong organic sulfonic acid, such as a lower alkanesulfonic acid that is unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by halogen, such as fluorine, or by an aromatic sulfonic acid, for example benzenesulfonic acid that is unsubstituted or substituted by lower alkyl, such as methyl, halogen, such as bromine, and/or by nitro, for example a methanesulfonic, p-bromotoluenesulfonic or p-toluenesulfonic acid, and hydroxy esterified by hydrazoic acid. The substitution can take place under the conditions of a first or second order nucleophilic substitution. For example, one of the compounds of formula X wherein X is a leaving group having high polarisability of the electron shell, for example iodine, can be used in a polar aprotic solvent, for example acetone, acetonitrile, nitromethane, dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethylformamide. The reaction can also be carried out in water, optionally in admixture with an organic solvent, for example ethanol, tetrahydrofuran or acetone, as solubiliser. The substitution reaction is carried out, as appropriate, at reduced or elevated temperature, for example in a temperature range of from approximately 40 to approximately 100 C., preferably from approximately 10 to approximately 50 C., and if necessary under an inert gas, for example under a nitrogen or argon atmosphere. Process e) is not successful in all cases, is often possible only under special conditions and is therefore a less preferred process. The freeing of protected groups may be effected in accordance with the methods described below under the heading Removal of protecting groups. Process f) (Reductive alkylation of a secondary amino group) In starting materials of formula I and formula X* or in reactive derivatives thereof, functional groups that are not to participate in the reaction or that do not react under the reaction conditions, are protected independently of one another by one of the protecting groups mentioned under Process a). Reactive derivatives of the compounds of formula I are, for example, corresponding bisulfite adducts or especially semiacetals or ketals of compounds of formula X* with alcohols, for example lower alkanols; or thioacetals of compounds of formula X* with mercaptans, for example lower alkanesulfides. The free aldehydes of formula X* are preferred. The reductive alkylation is preferably carried out with hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst, especially a noble metal catalyst, such as platinum or especially palladium, which is preferably bonded to a carrier material, such as carbon, or a heavy metal catalyst, such as Raney nickel, at normal pressure or at pressures of from 0.1 to 10 MegaPascal (MPa), or with reduction by means of complex hydrides, such as borohydrides, especially alkali metal cyanoborohydrides, for example sodium cyanoborohydride, in the presence of a suitable acid, preferably relatively weak acids, such as lower alkanecarboxylic acids or especially a sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid; in customary solvents, for example alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, or ethers, for example cyclic ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, in the presence or absence of water. The freeing of protected groups may be effected in accordance with the methods described below under the heading Removal of protecting groups. Removal of Protecting Groups The removal of protecting groups that are not constituents of the desired end product of formula I, for example carboxy-, amino- and hydroxy-protecting groups, is effected in a manner known per se, for example by means of solvolysis, especially hydrolysis, alcoholysis or acidolysis, or by means of reduction, especially hydrogenolysis or chemical reduction, and also photolysis, stepwise or simultaneously as appropriate, it being possible also to use enzymatic methods. The removal of the protecting groups is described, for example, in the standard works mentioned hereinabove in the section relating to protecting groups. For example, protected carboxy, for example tert-lower alkoxycarbonyl, lower alkoxycarbonyl substituted in the 2-position by a trisubstituted silyl group or in the 1-position by lower alkoxy or by lower alkylthio, or unsubstituted or substituted diphenylmethoxycarbonyl can be converted into free carboxy by treatment with a suitable acid, such as formic acid, hydrogen chloride or trifluoroacetic acid, where appropriate with the addition of a nucleophilic compound, such as phenol or anisole. Carboxy can be freed from lower alkoxycarbonyl also by bases, such as hydroxides, for example alkali metal hydroxides, such as NaOH or KOH. Unsubstituted or substituted benzyloxycarbonyl can be cleaved, for example. by means of hydrogenolysis, i.e. by treatment with hydrogen in the presence of a metal hydrogenation catalyst, such as a palladium catalyst. In addition, suitably substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, such as 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, can be converted into free carboxy also by reduction, for example by treatment with an alkali metal dithionite, such as sodium dithionite, or with a reducing metal, for example zinc, or a reducing metal salt, such as a chromium(II) salt, for example chromium(II) chloride, customarily in the presence of a hydrogen-yielding agent that, together with the metal, is capable of producing nascent hydrogen, such as an acid, especially a suitable carboxylic acid, such as an unsubstituted or substituted, for example hydroxy-substituted, lower alkanecarboxylic acid, for example acetic acid, formic acid, glycolic acid, diphenylglycolic acid, lactic acid, mandelic acid, 4-chloromandelic acid or tartaric acid, or in the presence of an alcohol or thiol, water preferably being added. By treatment with a reducing metal or metal salt, as described above, 2-halo-lower alkoxycarbonyl (where appropriate after conversion of a 2-bromo-lower alkoxycarbonyl group into a corresponding 2-iodo-lower alkoxycarbonyl group) or aroylmethoxycarbonyl can also be converted into free carboxy. Aroylmethoxycarbonyl can be cleaved also by treatment with a nucleophilic, preferably salt-forming, reagent, such as sodium thiophenolate or sodium iodide. 2-(Tri-substituted silyl)-lower alkoxycarbonyl, such as 2-tri-lower alkylsilyl-lower alkoxycarbonyl, can also be converted into free carboxy by treatment with a salt of hydrofluoric acid that yields the fluoride anion, such as an alkali metal fluoride, for example sodium or potassium fluoride, where appropriate in the presence of a macrocyclic polyether (crown ether), or with a fluoride of an organic quaternary base, such as tetra-lower alkylammonium fluoride or tri-lower alkylaryl-lower alkylammonium fluoride, for example tetraethylammonium fluoride or tetrabutylammonium fluoride, in the presence of an aprotic, polar solvent, such as dimethyl sulfoxide or N,N-dimethylacetamide. Carboxy protected in the form of organic silyloxycarbonyl, such as tri-lower alkylsilyloxycarbonyl, for example trimethylsilyloxycarbonyl, can be freed in customary manner by solvolysis, for example by treatment with water, an alcohol or an acid, or, furthermore, a fluoride, as described above. Esterified carboxy can also be cleaved enzymatically, for example by means of esterases or suitable peptidases, for example using trypsin. A protected amino group is freed in a manner known per se and, according to the nature of the protecting groups, in various ways, preferably by solvolysis or reduction. Lower alkoxycarbonylamino, such as tert-butoxycarbonylamino, can be cleaved in the presence of acids, for example mineral acids, for example a hydrogen halide, such as hydrogen chloride or hydrogen bromide, or sulfuric or phosphoric acid, but preferably hydrogen chloride, or in the presence of strong organic acids, such as a trihaloacetic acid, for example trifluoroacetic acid, or formic acid, in the presence or absence of polar solvents, such as water, or ethers, preferably cyclic ethers, such as dioxane; or nitrites, such as acetonitrile, 2-halo-lower alkoxycarbonylamino (where appropriate after conversion of a 2-bromo-lower alkoxycarbonylamino group into a 2-iodo-lower alkoxycarbonylamino group), or, dissolved directly in a liquid organic carboxylic acid, such as formic acid, aroylmethoxycarbonylamino or 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonylamino can be cleaved, for example, by treatment with a suitable reducing agent, such as zinc in the presence of a suitable carboxylic acid, such as aqueous acetic acid. Aroylmethoxycarbonylamino can be cleaved also by treatment with a nucleophilic, preferably salt-forming, reagent, such as sodium thiophenolate, and 4-nitrobenzyloxycarbonylamino also by treatment with an alkali metal dithionite, for example sodium dithionite. Unsubstituted or substituted diphenylmethoxycarbonylamino, tert-lower alkoxycarbonylamino or 2-(tri-substituted silyl)-lower alkoxycarbonylamino, such as 2-tri-lower alkylsilyl-lower alkoxycarbonylamino, can be cleaved by treatment with a suitable acid, for example formic acid or trifluoroacetic acid; unsubstituted or substituted benzyloxycarbonylamino can be cleaved, for example, by means of hydrogenolysis, i.e. by treatment with hydrogen in the presence of a suitable hydrogenation catalyst, such as a platinum or palladium catalyst; unsubstituted or substituted triarylmethylamino or formylamino can be cleaved, for example, by treatment with an acid, such as a mineral acid, for example hydrochloric acid, or an organic acid, for example formic, acetic or trifluoroacetic acid, where appropriate in the presence of water, and an amino group protected in the form of silylamino can be freed, for example, by means of hydrolysis or alcoholysis. An amino group protected by 2-haloacetyl, for example 2-chloroacetyl, can be freed by treatment with thiourea in the presence of a base, or with a thiolate salt, such as an alkali metal thiolate of thiourea, and subsequent solvolysis; such as. alcoholysis or hydrolysis, of the resulting substitution product. Amino is freed from trifluoroacetylamino, for example, by hydrogenolysis with bases, such as alkali metal hydroxides or carbonates, such as Na 2 CO 3 or K 2 CO 3 , in polar solvents, for example alcohols, such as methanol, in the presence or absence of water, at temperatures of from 0 to 100 C., especially at reflux temperature. An amino group protected by 2-(tri-substituted silyl)-lower alkoxycarbonyl, such as 2-tri-lower alkylsilyl-lower alkoxycarbonyl, can be converted into the free amino group also by treatment with a salt of hydrofluoric acid that yields fluoride anions, as indicated above in connection with the freeing of a correspondingly protected carboxy group. A 1-aryl-lower alkylmethyl protecting group wherein the lower alkyl radical is preferably branched in the 1-position, such as 1-methyl-1-phenyl-ethyl, can be removed especially in the presence of a strong acid, such as sulfuric acid (e.g. 80% sulfuric acid) in aqueous solution, at preferred temperatures of from 10 to 30 C., especially at approximately 0 C. Likewise, silyl, such as trimethylsilyl, bonded directly to a hetero atom, such as nitrogen, can be removed using fluoride ions. Amino protected in the form of an azido group is converted into free amino, for example, by reduction, for example by catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst, such as platinum oxide, palladium or Raney nickel, by reduction using mercapto compounds, such as dithiothreitol or mercaptoethanol, or by treatment with zinc in the presence of an acid, such as acetic acid. The catalytic hydrogenation is preferably carried out in an inert solvent, such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, for example methylene chloride, or in water or in a mixture of water and an organic solvent, such as an alcohol or dioxane, at approximately from 20 C. to 25 C., or with cooling or heating. A hydroxy group protected by a suitable acyl group, by a tri-lower alkylsilyl group or by unsubstituted or substituted 1-phenyl-lower alkyl is freed analogously to a correspondingly protected amino group. A hydroxy group protected by 2,2-dichloroacetyl is freed, for example, by basic hydrolysis, and a hydroxy group protected by tert-lower alkyl or by a 2-oxa- or 2-thia-aliphatic or -cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon radical is freed by acidolysis, for example by treatment with a mineral acid or a strong carboxylic acid, for example trifluoroacetic acid. Adjacent hydroxy and amino groups that are protected together by a bivalent protecting group, preferably, for example, by a methylene group mono- or di-substituted by lower alkyl, such as by lower alkylidene, for example isopropylidene, cycloalkylidene, for example cyclohexylidene, or benzylidene, can be freed by acid solvolysis, especially in the presence of a mineral acid or a strong organic acid. A tri-lower alkylsilyl group is likewise removed by acidolysis, for example by a mineral acid, preferably hydrofluoric acid, or a strong carboxylic acid. 2-Halo-lower alkoxycarbonyl is removed using the above-mentioned reducing agents, for example a reducing metal, such as zinc, reducing metal salts, such as chromium(II) salts, or using sulfur compounds, for example sodium dithionite or especially sodium sulfide and carbon disulfide. When several protected functional groups are present, if desired the protecting groups can be so selected that more than one such group can be removed simultaneously, for example by removal of trifluoroacetyl as amino-protecting group by base catalysis, for example with K 2 CO 3 in methanol/water, and later removal of tert-butoxycarbonyl as amino-protecting group, for example with HCl in dioxane or acetonitrile (in the presence or absence of water) or with formic acid, or selective removal of 1-methyl-1-phenyl-ethyl as amino-protecting group using sulfuric acid; or generally by acidolysis, such as by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid, or with hydrogen and a hydrogenation catalyst, such as a palladium-on-carbon catalyst. Conversely, the groups can also be so selected that they cannot all be removed simultaneously, but rather in a desired sequence, the corresponding intermediates being obtained. Additional Process Steps In the additional process steps, which are optional, functional groups of the starting compounds that are not to participate in the reaction may be unprotected or may be in protected form, for example they may be protected by one or more of the protecting groups mentioned above under Process a). The protecting groups may be retained in the end products or some or all of them may be removed in accordance with one of the methods mentioned under the heading Removal of protecting groups. Salts of compounds of formula I having a salt-forming group can be prepared in a manner known per se. For example, acid addition salts of compounds of formula I can be obtained, for example, by treatment with an acid or a suitable anion exchange reagent. Salts can be converted into the free compounds in customary manner, for example by treatment with a suitable basic agent. Stereoisomeric mixtures, for example mixtures of diastereoisomers, can be separated into the corresponding isomers in a manner known per se by suitable separating procedures. For example, mixtures of diastereoisomers can be separated into the individual diastereo-isomers by fractional crystallisation, chromatography, solvent partitioning and the like. Such separation can be carried out either at the stage of one of the starting materials or with the compounds of formula I themselves. In a compound of formula I wherein R 2 is phenyl, that phenyl radical can be hydrogenated, for example by catalytic hydrogenation, especially in the presence of heavy metal oxides, such as rhodium/platinum mixed oxides, for example with the Nishimura catalyst, preferably in a polar solvent, such as an alcohol, for example methanol or ethanol, at temperatures of from 0 to 80 C., especially from 10 to 40 C., and at a preferred hydrogen pressure of from 1 to 10 atm, preferably at about normal pressure. In a compound of formula I wherein R 4 is 4-tetrazol-5-ylphenyl, a lower alkyl group, for example methyl, can be converted by reaction with a lower alkyl halide or a lower alkylarylsulfonate, such as a lower alkyl iodide or a lower alkyltoluenesulfonate, for example methyl iodide or tert-butyl iodide, preferably in the presence of caesium carbonate in a mixture of a cyclic ether, such as dioxane, and an N,N-di-lower alkyl-lower alkanecarboxylic acid amide, such as dimethylformamide, at preferred temperatures of from 10 to 40 C., especially from 0 to about 30 C. In a compound of formula I wherein R 4 is 4-(1- or 2-phenyl-lower alkyl, such as 1- or 2-(1-methyl-1-phenylethyl)-tetrazol-5-yl)phenyl, the phenyl-lower alkyl radical (preferably 1-methyl-1-phenylethyl) can be removed by treatment with a strong mineral acid, such as sulfuric acid, in aqueous solution, preferably at temperatures of from 20 to 30 C., for example at 0 C. General Process Conditions All the process steps given in this text can be carried out under reaction conditions known per se, but preferably under those specifically mentioned, in the absence or usually in the presence of solvents or diluents, preferably those solvents or diluents that are inert towards the reagents used and are solvents therefor, in the absence or presence of catalysts, condensation agents or neutralising agents, for example ion exchangers, such as cation exchangers, for example in the H form, depending upon the nature of the reaction and/or the reactants at reduced, normal or elevated temperature, for example in a temperature range of from approximately 100 to approximately 190 C., preferably from approximately 80 to approximately 150 C., for example from 80 to 60 C., at room temperature, at from 20 to 40 C. or at the boiling point of the solvent used, under atmospheric pressure or in a closed vessel, optionally under pressure, and/or in an inert atmosphere, for example under an argon or nitrogen atmosphere. In the case of all starting materials and intermediates, salts may be present when salt-forming groups are present. Salts may also be present during the reaction of such compounds, provided that the reaction will not be affected. In all reaction steps, any isomeric mixtures that are formed can be separated into the individual isomers, for example diastereoisomers or enantiomers, or into any desired mixtures of isomers, for example racemates or diastereoisomeric mixtures, for example analogously to the methods described under the heading Additional process steps. In certain cases, for example in the case of hydrogenation, it is possible to carry out stereo-selective reactions so that, for example, individual isomers may be obtained more easily.

The starting materials used and the reaction conditions selected are preferably those which result in the compounds described as being preferred. In the preparation of all starting materials, free functional groups that are not to participate in the reaction in question may be unprotected or may be in protected form, for example they may be protected by the protecting groups mentioned above under Process a). Those protecting groups can be removed at suitable times by the reactions described under the heading Removal of protecting groups,. The starting materials of Process a) are known or, if novel, can be prepared in accordance with processes known per se, for example the compounds of formula III can be prepared from hydrazine or suitable derivatives thereof, and the compounds of formula IV can be prepared from suitable amino acids or analogues thereof, for example having one of the mentioned side chains R 3 . The compounds of formula III can be obtained, for example, from compounds of formula H 2 NNHR 7 (XI), which are known per se or can be prepared from hydrazine by the introduction of protecting groups as described under Process a) and in which R 7 is hydrogen or an amino-protecting group as described above under Process b), especially tert-lower alkoxycarbonyl, such as tert-butoxycarbonyl, aryl-lower alkoxycarbonyl, such as benzyloxycarbonyl or 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl, or one of the above-mentioned acylamino-protecting groups, especially trifluoroacetyl, by alkylation with a compound of formula X as described above under Process e), or by reaction of the radical of sub-formula R 4 (A) wherein R 4 is as defined or compounds of formula I, by reaction of a suitable carbonyl compound of formula X*, or a reactive derivative thereof, both as defined under Process f), with the free amino group of the compound of formula XI or or an acylated derivative thereof and subsequent reduction of the resulting hydrazone to form a hydrazine derivative of formula the radicals in all the mentioned compounds being as defined above and functional groups in the reagents involved that are not to participate in the reaction being protected as necessary, and removal of the protecting group R 7 as necessary and by condensation under the conditions mentioned above under Process b) with an acid of formula VI, or an acid derivative thereof mentioned under Process b). The carbonyl compounds of formula X*, or reactive derivatives thereof, suitable for the introduction of the radical of sub-formula A that are used for the preparation of the compounds of formula XII, as defined above under Process f), are aldehydes or reactive derivatives thereof, the reactive carbonyl group of which, after the reaction with compounds of formula XI and the subsequent reduction, is a constituent of one of the mentioned radicals of sub-formula A. The reaction of the carbonyl compounds with the compounds of formula XI to form the corresponding hydrazones is carried out under the conditions customarily used for the reaction of carbonyl compounds with amines, preferably in polar organic solvents, for example ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether, alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, carboxylic acid amides, such as dimethylformamide, or esters, such as ethyl acetate, or in aqueous solution, preferably in methanol, and also in the presence or absence of acid catalysts, for example carboxylic acids, such as formic acid or acetic acid, or sulfonic acids, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, at temperatures of from 0 C. to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture, preferably at temperatures of from 20 C. to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. Compounds of formula wherein R 4 and R 7 are as defined for compounds of formula XII are obtained. The reduction of the resulting hydrazones of formula XII* is preferably carried out by hydrogenation in the presence of a suitable catalyst or with complex hydrides in the presence of acids. As catalysts suitable for hydrogenation there are used metals, such as nickel, iron, cobalt or ruthenium, or noble metals or oxides thereof, such as palladium or rhodium or oxides thereof, optionally, for example, applied to a suitable carrier, such as barium sulfate, aluminium oxide or carbon (active carbon) or in the form of skeleton catalysts, such as Raney nickel. Solvents customarily used for the catalytic hydrogenation are, for example, water, alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, esters, such as ethyl acetate, ethers, such as dioxane, chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane, carboxylic acid amides, such as dimethylformamide, or carboxylic acids, such as glacial acetic acid, or mixtures of those solvents. The hydrogenation is carried out preferably at temperatures of from 10 to 250 C., especially from room temperature to 100 C., and preferably at hydrogen pressures of from 1 to 200 bar, especially from 1 to 10 bar, in the customary apparatus. For the reduction with complex hydrides, especially borohydrides, such as alkali metal cyanoborohydrides, for example sodium cyanoborohydride, it is preferable to add weak acids, such as sulfonic acids, for example p-toluenesulfonic acid, or carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, preferably in alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, or mixtures thereof with water (see, for example, Tetrahedron 49, 8605-8628 (1993)). It is also possible for compounds of formula XI to be alkylated by reduction directly with compounds of formula X*, or reactive derivatives thereof, as defined under Process f), under conditions analogous to those mentioned in Process f). Also especially preferred for the preparation of compounds of formula XI are reaction conditions analogous to those described in J. Chem. Soc. Perkin I, 1712 (1975). Compounds of formula III can also be obtained, for example, by reacting a compound of formula XII*, as defined above, wherein R 7 is hydrogen (obtainable, for example, by the removal of protecting groups when R 7 is a protecting group), directly, with condensation under the conditions mentioned above under Process b) with acids of formula VI, or the acid derivatives thereof mentioned under Process b), to form compounds of formula wherein the radicals are as defined for compounds of formula I, which are then converted into compounds of formula III by reduction under conditions analogous to the conditions mentioned for the reduction of hydrazones of formula XII*. Compounds to formula III* can also be obtained from the corresponding compounds of formula III, which are as defined as described below, by reacting the latter with compounds of formula X*, as defined above, to form the hydrazones of formula III* under conditions analogous to those described above for the reaction of carbonyl compounds of formula X* with hydrazines of formula XI. A compound of formula IV can be obtained, for example, by reduction of an amino acid of formula wherein R 8 is hydrogen or especially one of the amino-protecting groups mentioned under Process a), especially tert-lower alkoxycarbonyl, such as tert-butoxycarbonyl, aryl-lower alkoxycarbonyl, such as benzyloxycarbonyl or 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl, or one of the acylamino-protecting groups mentioned under Process a), especially trifluoroacetyl, and R 3 is as defined for compounds of formula I, to form an aldehyde of formula wherein the radicals are as last defined, subsequent reaction of that aldehyde with a ylid compound, preferably a sulfur ylid compound, to form an epoxide of formula wherein the radicals are as last defined, removal of the protecting group R 8 (the resulting free amino compound wherein R 8 hydrogen may be stable, for example in the form of an acid addition salt) and finally acylation of the amino group of the resulting compound with an acid of formula VIII, wherein the radicals are as defined for formula VIII, under suitable conditions analogous to the conditions described for Process b). The reduction of amino acids of formula XIII to the corresponding aldehydes of formula XIV is carried out, for example, by reduction to the corresponding alcohols and subsequent oxidation to the mentioned aldehydes. The reduction to the alcohols (a free compound or (if necessary after the introduction of protecting groups, as described under Process a)) a compound N-protected by R 8 , having the formula wherein the radicals are as defined for compounds of formula XIII) is carried out, for example, by hydrogenation of the acid halides or other activated carboxylic acid derivatives mentioned under Process b) under the conditions mentioned for the hydrogenation of hydrazones obtained from compounds of formula XII, with diborane or with complex hydrides, such as sodium borohydride. The subsequent oxidation of the resulting alcohols is possible, for example, by oxidation of the hydroxy group with a sulfoxide, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, in the presence of a reagent that activates the hydroxy group, such as a carboxylic acid chloride, for example oxalyl chloride, in inert solvents, for example a halogenated hydrocarbon, such as dichloromethane, and/or an acyclic or cyclic ether, such as tetrahydrofuran, at from 80 to 0 C., for example from 78 to 50 C., or by oxidation, for example, with chromic acid or a derivative thereof, such as pyridinium chromate or tert-butyl chromate, dichromate/sulfuric acid, sulfur trioxide in the presence of heterocyclic bases, such as pyridine/SO 3 , and also nitric acid, pyrolusite or selenium dioxide, in water, organic solvents, such as halogenated solvents, for example methylene chloride, carboxylic acid amides, such as dimethylformamide, or di-lower alkylsulfoxides, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, in the presence or absence of basic amines, for example tri-lower alkylamines, such as triethylamine, at temperatures of from 50 to 100 C., preferably at from 10 to 50 C., or by catalytic dehydrogenation, for example in the presence of metallic silver, copper, copper chromium oxide or zinc oxide at approximately from 200 to 400 C. (in the contact tube) with subsequent rapid cooling. Oxidation with 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-1-oxyl in the presence of NaOCl is also possible (see Anelli et al., Org. Synth. 69, 212 (1990)). The direct reduction of the amino acids to the aldehydes is also possible, for example by hydrogenation in the presence of a partially poisoned palladium catalyst or by reduction of the corresponding amino acid esters, for example the lower alkyl esters, such as the ethyl ester, with complex hydrides, for example borohydrides, such as sodium borohydride, or preferably aluminium hydrides, for example lithium aluminium hydride, lithium tri(tert-butoxy)aluminium hydride or especially diisobutylaluminium hydride, in non-polar solvents, for example in hydrocarbons or aromatic solvents, such as toluene, at from 100 to 0 C., preferably from 70 to 30 C., and subsequent reaction to form the corresponding semicarbazones, for example with the corresponding acid salts of semicarbazones, such as semicarbazide hydrochloride, in aqueous solvent systems, such as alcohol/water, for example ethanol/water, at temperatures of from 20 to 60 C., preferably from 10 to 30 C., and reaction of the resulting semicarbazone with a reactive aldehyde, for example formaldehyde, in an inert solvent, for example a polar organic solvent, for example a carboxylic acid amide, such as dimethylformamide, at temperatures of from 30 to 60 C., preferably from 0 to 30 C., and then with an acid, for example a strong mineral acid, such as a hydrogen halide, in aqueous solution, optionally in the presence of the solvent used previously, at temperatures of from 40 to 50 C., preferably from 10 to 30 C. The corresponding esters are obtained by reaction of the amino acids with the corresponding carboxylic acids, for example ethanol, analogously to the conditions employed in the condensation under Process b), for example by reaction with inorganic acid halides, such as thionyl chloride, in organic solvent mixtures, such as mixtures of aromatic and alcoholic solvents, for example toluene and ethanol, at temperatures of from 50 to 50 C., preferably from 10 to 20 C. The preparation of the compounds of formula XIV is carried out in an especially preferred manner under conditions analogous to the reaction conditions mentioned in J. Org. Chem. 47, 3016 (1982) or J. Org. Chem. 43, 3624 (1978).

Compounds of formula X* are known, can be prepared in accordance with processes known per se or can be prepared, for example, as follows: Using a compound of formula XXI, wherein Hal is halogen, especially bromine or chlorine, and reacting it with an unsaturated heterocycle that has from 5 to 8 ring atoms, contains from 1 to 4 hetero atoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, sulfinyl (SO) and sulfonyl (SO 2 ) and is unsubstituted or substituted by lower alkyl or by phenyl-lower alkyl, especially with thiazole or thiophene, in the presence of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium as catalyst and in the presence of an alkali metal lower alkanoate, such as potassium acetate, in a suitable solvent, especially a N,N-di-lower alkyl-lower alkanoyl-amide, such as dimethyl acetamide, at preferred temperatures of from 80 C. to the boiling temperature of the mixture, for example at approximately 150 C., the corresponding compound of formula X*, especially 4-(thiazol-5-yl)-benzaldehyde or 4-(thiopen-2-yl)-benzaldehyde, can be obtained. Alternatively, it is possible, starting with a compound of formula XXI, as last defined, to obtain the corresponding di-lower alkylacetal (see for example J. Org. Chem. 56, 4280 (1991)), for example the bromobenzaldehyde dimethylacetal (obtainable, for example, by reaction of 4-bromobenzaldehyde with orthoformic acid trimethyl ester in an alcohol, such as methanol, in the presence of an acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid (can also be used in the form of the hydrate)). The resulting 4-halo-benzaldehyde di-lower alkylacetal is then converted, by reaction with magnesium in the presence of a catalytic amount of iodine in a suitable solvent, such as an ether, for example tetrahydrofuran, at preferred temperatures of from 0 to 70 C., into the corresponding Grignard reagent of formula XXII, wherein Hal is halogen, especially chlorine or bromine, and Z is lower alkyl, which is then reacted, in the presence of 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane nickel(II) chloride as catalyst in a suitable solvent, such as ether, for example tetrahydrofuran, there being added in an especially preferred process variant a suitable complex hydride, especially diisobutylaluminium hydride, (for example dissolved in a hydrocarbon, such as hexane), at preferred temperatures of from 0 to 60 C., with a compound of formula XXIII, R 9 -Hal(XXIII) wherein R 9 is an unsaturated heterocycle that has from 5 to 8 ring atoms, contains from 1 to 4 hetero atoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, sulfinyl (SO) and sulfonyl (SO 2 ) and is unsubstituted or substituted by lower alkyl or by phenyl-lower alkyl, and wherein Hal is chlorine or especially bromine, with subsequent acid hydrolysis of the acetal (for example with hydrogen chloride in water), to form the corresponding aldehyde compound of formula X*. Especially preferred as compounds of formula XXIII are 2-bromothiazole, 2- or 3-bromopyridine or 2-chloropyrazine in the preparation of the following compounds of formula X*: 4-(thiazol-2-yl)-benzaldehyde, 4-(pyridin-2-yl or -3-yl)-benzaldehyde or 4-(pyrazin-2-yl)-benzaldehyde.

By reaction with phenyl-lower alkyl halides or preferably with phenyl-lower alkenes, such as 2-phenylpropene, in a suitable solvent, such as toluene, and a suitable acid, such as methanesulfonic acid, preferably under reflux, the corresponding 1- or 2-phenyl-lower alkyl compounds of formula X* are obtained. By reaction with a lower alkyl halide, such as the iodide or bromide, for example methyl iodide, in the presence of alkali metal carbonates, such as potassium or especially caesium carbonate, and suitable solvents, such as dioxane, at preferred temperatures of from approximately 0 to approximately 30 C., compounds of formula X* substituted in the tetrazolyl ring by lower alkyl or by phenyl-lower alkyl, especially 4-(1-methyl-tetrazol-5-yl)-benzaldehyde, are obtained. Compounds of formula X may be obtained from the corresponding compounds of formula X* by reduction of the aldehyde function to a hydroxymethyl group (for example with complex hydrides, such as lithium aluminium hydride in ethanol, disiamylborane in tetrahydrofuran, sodium borohydride in the presence of lithium chloride in diglycol or sodium borohydride in ethanol) and subsequent introduction of the radical X by esterification by a strong inorganic or organic acid, such as by a mineral acid, for example a hydrohalic acid, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic or hydriodic acid, or by a strong organic sulfonic acid, such as an unsubstituted or substituted, for example halo-substituted, for example fluoro-substituted, lower alkanesulfonic acid or an aromatic sulfonic acid, for example a benzenesulforic acid that is unsubstituted or substituted by lower alkyl, such as methyl, halogen, such as bromine, and/or by nitro, for example methanesulfonic acid, p-bromotoluenesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid, or hydrazoic acid, in accordance with standard methods. For example, by reaction with inorganic acid halides, such as thionyl or phosphoryl halides (for example the chlorides, bromides or iodides), halogen radicals X can be introduced, or the remaining compounds of formula X can be obtained by reaction with other suitable organic or inorganic acids, such as strong organic sulfonic acids (used for example as acid chlorides).

halophenones", "abstract": "A process is provided for the preparation of compounds of Formula (1): wherein X 1 and X 2 are each independently H, Cl or F, provided that at least one of X 1 and X 2 is Cl or F; one of R 1 and R 2 is H and the other is OH; and R 5 is an unsubstituted alkyl, preferably a C 1-6 alkyl, group. The process comprises condensing a 2-chloroalkanoic acid with an optionally substituted benzyl alcohol to form a 2-(optionally substituted benzyloxy) alkanoic acid, converting the condensation product to the corresponding acid chloride and then either reacting the acid chloride with a compound of the Formula (2) in the presence of a source of copper (I) to give a compound of Formula (3) wherein one of R 3 and R 4 is H and the other is optionally substituted benzyloxy; or reacting the acid chloride with a compound of Formula (4): ANHB wherein A and B independently represent substituted alkyl, alkoxy, aryl or oxyaryl groups, or are linked to form a heterocyclic ring to form an amide, and then reacting the amide with a compound of Formula (2) to give a compound of Formula (3). The optionally substituted benzyl group from the compound of Formula (3) can removed by hydrogenation. This invention relates to processes for the preparation of certain chiral compounds and to novel compounds used in the processes. 1(2,4-dihalophenyl)-2-hydroxy-1-propanones are key intermediates for the synthesis of a variety of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, particularly antifungal compounds and medicines used in the treatment of AIDS. For example Sch 42427/SM9164 and ER-30346 are made from these intermediates. The chiral 2-hydroxy group in these compounds has been prepared by chiral -hydroxylation of the corresponding 2,4-difluoropropiophenone. One such method is described in Tetrahedron Letters, Vol 37, No. 45, pp8117-8120 (1996). An alternative method involves the regioselective ring opening of a 2,4-fluorophenyl propylene oxide, as described in Tetrahedron Letters, Vol 35, No. 45, pp8299-8302 (1994). We have now devised a process for preparing 2,4-dihalo-2-hydroxypropiophenones with good enantiomeric purity from readily available L- or D-2-chloropropionic acid. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a compound of Formula (1): wherein: X 1 and X 2 are each independently H, Cl or F, provided that at least one of X 1 and X 2 is Cl or F; one of R 1 and R 2 is H and the other is OH; and R 5 is an unsubstituted alkyl, preferably a C 1-6 alkyl, group comprising the steps: (a) condensing a 2-chloroalkanoic acid with an optionally substituted benzyl alcohol to form a 2-(optionally substituted benzyloxy) alkanoic acid; (b) converting the product from step (a) to the corresponding acid chloride; then either: (c) reacting the product of step (b) with a compound of the Formula (2) in the presence of a source of copper (I) to give a compound of Formula (3) wherein one of R 3 and R 4 is H and the other is optionally substituted benzyloxy; or (d) reacting the product of step (b) with a compound of Formula (4): ANHB wherein A and B independently represent substituted alkyl, alkoxy, aryl or oxyaryl groups, or are linked to form a heterocyclic ring to form an amide, and then reacting the amide with a compound of Formula (2) to give a compound of Formula (3); and (e) removing the optionally substituted benzyl group from the compound of Formula (3) by hydrogenation, thereby giving the compound of Formula (1). The process steps a) to d) above for the production of a compound of Formula (3) form another aspect of the present invention. In step (a) the reaction of the 2-chloroalkanoic acid with an optionally substituted benzyl alcohol proceeds with an inversion of configuration. Accordingly, the choice of which enantiomer of the 2-chloroalkanoic acid will be made on the basis of the desired configuration of the desired compound of Formula (1) or Formula (3). 2-chloroalkanoic acids which can be employed in the present invention have the general formula: R 5 CR 6 R 7 CO 2 H, wherein R 5 is an alkyl group, preferably a C 1-6 alkyl group, and most preferably a methyl group, and one of R 6 or R 7 is Cl, the other being H. The most preferred 2-chloroalkanoic acids are L- and D-2-chloropropionic acid. The optionally substituted benzyl alcohol is preferably benzyl alcohol or a benzyl alcohol having from 1 to 5 substituents, often selected from the group consisting of halo, preferably F, Cl or Br; nitro; C 1-4 -alkyl, preferably methyl or ethyl; C 1-4 -alkoxy, preferably methoxy or ethoxy; carboxy; sulpho and amino. Benzyl alcohol is most preferred. The condensation in step (a) is preferably performed in the presence of a strong base, preferably an inorganic base. Examples of suitable organic bases include alkyl lithium salts such as butyl lithium, and alkali metal, especially lithium, alkylamide salts such as lithium diisopropylamide. Examples of suitable inorganic bases include alkali metals, especially lithium, sodium and potassium metal, alkali metal hydrides such as lithium, sodium or potassium hydride, alkali metal hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates, especially sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and mixtures thereof. The condensation of step (a) is preferably performed at an elevated temperature, more preferably 30 C. to 150 C., especially 40 C. to 120 C. Condensation step (a) can be performed in the presence of an organic solvent which is unreactive towards the reagents employed. Examples of suitable solvents include halocarbons, especially chlorocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, and ethers, particularly C 1-6 alkylethers such as t-butyl methyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. It is preferred that the benzyl alcohol serves as its own solvent, and in many embodiments, a molar excess of benzyl alcohol over the chloropropionic acid is employed, such as a mole ratio of benzyl alcohol to 2-chloroalkanoic acid of from 2:1 to 15:1, and commonly from 5:1 to 10:1. Conversion of the product of step (a) to the corresponding acid chloride (i.e. COCl) is preferably performed using oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride, or a phosphorus halide, such as PCL 3 or PCL 5 . Elevated temperatures are preferred, especially 30 C. to 110 C., more preferably 35 C. to 90 C. The reaction is commonly carried out neat, but an organic solvent which is unreactive towards the reagents may be employed. Examples of suitable solvents include halocarbons, especially chlorocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane, chlorobenzene; ethers, particularly C 1-6 alkylethers such as t-butyl methyl ether and tetrahydrofuran; and aromatic solvents such as toluene. The source of copper (I) used in step (c) is preferably a Cu (I) salt, such as CuNO 3 , CuCN or a copper (I) halide, especially CuCl, CuBr or Cul. The amount of copper (I) source used is preferably between 80 and 200 mole % relative to the number of moles of the acid chloride product of step (b), more preferably from 85 to 150 mole %, especially 90 to140 mole %. Step (c) is commonly carried out in the presence of an organic solvent which is unreactive towards the reagents is commonly employed. Examples of suitable organic solvents include ethers, particularly C 1-6 alkylethers such as t-butyl methyl ether and tetrahydrofuran; and aromatic solvents such as toluene. The reaction temperature of step (c) is commonly in the range of from 78 C. to 30 C., and preferably from 40 C. to 0 C. The compound of Formula (2) is commonly prepared by reacting the appropriately substituted phenyl bromide with magnesium metal in the presence of a suitable solvent, often the solvent employed in step (c). Preferably, a stoichiometric ratio or moderate molar excess of phenyl bromide to magnesium is employed, often a molar ratio of from 1:1 to 2:1, and advantageously from 1.25:1 to 1.75:1. The preparation often takes place at a temperature of from ambient temperature (20-25 C.) to about 35 C. It will be recognised that the preparation of compounds of Formula (2) can be exothermic, and so appropriate cooling is advantageously provided to control such exotherms. In the amine compound of Formula (4) employed in step (d), when A or B represents an alkyl or alkoxy group, it is preferably a C 1-4 alkyl or alkoxy group, and particularly a methyl or methoxy group. When A or B represents an aryl or aryloxy group, it is preferably a phenyl or phenoxy group. When A and B are linked to form a ring, the ring preferably contains from 5 to 8 members, and 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms. In addition to the amine nitrogen, other heteroatoms, especially oxygen may be present in the ring. Examples of preferred amines include morpholine, pyrrolidine and N-methoxy-N-methylamine. The amine can be employed as a free amine or in the form of a salt, especially a hydrochloride salt. The mole ratio of amine to acid chloride is commonly from 1:1 to 2:1. Step (d) is commonly carried out in the presence of an organic solvent which is unreactive towards the reagents is commonly employed. Advantageously, the solvent employed is substantially water insoluble. Examples of suitable organic solvents include halocarbons, especially chlorocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane, chlorobenzene; ethers, particularly C 1-6 alkylethers such as t-butyl methyl ether and tetrahydrofuran; and aromatic solvents such as toluene. Step (d) is commonly carried out a temperature of from 0 to 30 C. In step (e) the optionally substituted benzyl group can be removed by methods known in the art, and is preferably removed from the compound of Formula (3) by hydrogenation using a transition metal catalyst and hydrogen gas. Preferred transition metal catalysts are in group VIII of the periodic table, more preferably palladium, nickel and platinum, and especially palladium on carbon, often on activated carbon. Loadings of metal on carbon are commonly in the range of from 1 to 20% w/w, and preferably from about 5% to about 10% w/w. Degussa-type palladium on activated carbon has been found to be advantageous in certain embodiments of the present invention. Solvents that can be employed in the removal of the optionally substituted benzyl group by hydrogenation include alcohols, particularly C 1-4 alkyl alcohols; esters, particularly esters of C 1-4 carboxylic acids with C 1-4 alcohols, preferably ethyl acetate; and aromatic solvents such as toluene. Step (e) is commonly carried out a temperature of from about 10 to 30 C., commonly at ambient temperature, such as 15 to 25 C. The compounds of Formula (3) are valuable intermediates in their own right and generally have useful crystalline properties. This enables the compound of Formula (3) to be crystallised thereby greatly enhancing the purity, both chemical and particularly optical, of the desired compound of Formula (1) and downstream pharmaceutical and agrochemical products. Furthermore, the compounds of Formula (3) are much more stable than the corresponding free hydroxy compounds and are therefore more readily transportable. They can also be stored for extended periods, with conversion to the corresponding free hydroxy compound being necessary only immediately prior to its use. Thus in a preferred embodiment the product of step (c) or (d) is purified by recrystallisation before step (e) is performed. Recrystallisation is preferably performed in an organic solvent, more preferably in hydrocarbon solvent, especially a linear of branched aliphatic hydrocarbon, such as n- or iso-pentane, n- or iso-hexane, cyclohexane and petroleum fractions. Accordingly the present invention also provides compounds of Formula (3) wherein X 1 and X 2 are each independently H, Cl or F, provided that at least one of X 1 and X 2 is Cl or F; one of R 3 and R 4 is H and the other is optionally substituted benzyloxy; and R 5 is an unsubstituted alkyl, preferably a C 1-6 alkyl, group. Preferably, both of X 1 and X 2 represent Cl or F, and especially both are F. The benzyloxy group is often unsubstituted. R 5 is most commonly a methyl group. The process for the production of compounds of Formula (3) preferably comprises the further step of purifying the compound of Formula (3) by recrystallisation from an organic solvent, more preferably from one of the organic solvents mentioned above in the recrystallisation process for purifying the products of steps (c) and (d). The invention is further illustrated without limitation by the following examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless specified otherwise and % Str. is percent strength. EXAMPLE 1 L-2-chloropropionic acid D-2-(benzyloxy)propionic acid Sodium metal (34.5 g, 1.5 moles) was added in small portions with cooling to benzyl alcohol (440 g, 4.1 moles). The mixture was stirred at 80-90 C. for 2 hours, cooled to 55 C. and L-2-chloropropionic acid (68.6 g, 0.63 moles) was added over about 1 hour. The mixture was stirred at 55 C. until gas chromatography indicated that the condensation was complete (about 2 hours). Water (350ml) was added and the pH was adjusted to 6.5 using concentrated HCl. Tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME, 250 ml) was added, the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes and then allowed to settle. Water (150 ml) and TBME (250 ml) were added. The aqueous layer was removed and washed with TBME (500 ml and 3250 ml washings). The washed, aqueous layer was then acidified to pH 1.5 using concentrated HCl to liberate the desired product and the product was extracted with TBME (2250 ml). The combined 500 ml of TBME was washed with water (200 ml) and the solvent removed in vacuo at 50 C., 300 mmHg pressure to give the desired D-2-(benzyloxy)propionic acid (96.1 g, 84%). D-2-(benzyloxy)propionic acid D-2-(benzyloxy)propionyl chloride Oxalyl chloride (112 g, 0.88 moles) was added dropwise at 20 C. to the product of stage (a) (102.86 g, 0.57 moles). The temperature rose rapidly to 35 C. When the exotherm had ceased the mixture was heated to 45-50 C. and the remainder of the oxalyl chloride was added at this temperature over 45 minutes. After stirring the mixture at 50-55 C. for 1.5 hours the temperature was increased to 105 C. with a nitrogen sparge to remove any residual oxalyl chloride. The desired D-2-(benzyloxy)propionyl chloride was obtained as an oil (109.7 g, 94.9%). An aliquot (ca. 5-10 ml) of a solution of 2,4-Difluorobromobenzene (98.49 g, 0.5 moles) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (75 ml) was added to a stirred mixture of Mg turnings (12.25 g, 0.51 moles) in THF (340 ml) at ambient temperature. After 35 minutes stirring at ambient temperature the reaction initiated. When the temperature reached 27 C. an ice/water bath was used to cool the reaction mixture but the temperature still reached 50 C. before the exotherm subsided. The mixture was cooled to 25 C. and the remainder of the solution of bromodifluorobenzene/THF solution added to the Mg/THF solution with cooling over 0.5 h at 20-30 C. The mixture was stirred for a further 1.5 hours, CuCl (56.5 g, 0.57 moles, dried at 110 C. for 17 hours) was added over 20 minutes at 20-30 C. (ice bath cooling) and the mixture stirred for a further 1.5 hours at 20-300 C. The mixture was cooled to 30 C. and the acid chloride added over 20 minutes at 25 to 30 C. The mixture was then allowed to warm to room temperature and monitored by GC. After stirring overnight (17 hours), 5% GC area of the acid chloride still remained. 200 ml of 18% HCl was added, keeping the temperature below 30 C. This acid dissolved almost all the solids apart from some residual CuCl. TBME (250 ml) was added and the mixture stirred for 10 mins. The two dark phases separated well and the aqueous phase was removed (120 ml). To the organic was added further TBME (100 ml) and the organic-washed with 18% HCl (100 ml). Water (100 ml) was added and an emulsion was produced. The mixture was shaken and allowed to settle. A good separation then resulted. The aqueous was removed (240 ml). The organic extract was sequentially washed with 318% HCl (200 ml) (in each case more than 200 ml aqueous was removed) washes and then a water wash (200 ml). The water wash resulted in a precipitate in the organic phase. To the mixture (containing the water wash) was added conc. HCl (50 ml). The mixture was shaken then settled to give 2 phases. The aqueous was removed and the organic diluted with further TBME (250 ml) was washed with water (150 ml). An emulsion resulted and conc. HCl (50 ml) was added. The emulsion cleared to give two phases. The aqueous was removed and the organic washed with water (2500 ml). Some solids were apparent in the aqueous phase and these were removed with the aqueous washings. The organic was then washed with 9% HCl (200 ml), water (200 ml), 5% sodium carbonate (200 ml) and water (200 ml). The solvent was removed in vacuo at 60 C./20 mmHg to give the above product (3) as a brown oil. Hydrogen gas was bubbled through a solution of (3) (2 g, 0.0072 moles) in methanol (50 ml) in the presence of a catalyst (5% Pd on carbon, 0.2 g at 50% water content, Degussa Type E101). When gas chromatography showed the reaction had gone to completion the catalyst was removed by filtration under nitrogen and methanol removed in vacuo to give (1) as an oil (1.3 g, 95%).

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention is directed to the use of C-substituted-amino cyclic nitroxides, especially 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, to inhibit the polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers, especially, vinyl aromatic monomers and acrylic monomers. 2. Description of Related Art Many ethylenically unsaturated monomers undesirably polymerize at various stages of their manufacture, processing, handling, storage, and use. A particularly troublesome problem is equipment fouling caused by polymerization in the purification stages of the production processes of such monomers. Polymerization, such as thermal polymerization, during their purification results in the loss of the monomer and a loss in production efficiency owing to the deposition of polymer in or on the equipment being used in the purification, deposits of which must be removed from time to time. A wide variety of compounds has been proposed and used for inhibiting uncontrolled and undesired polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers. However, these compounds have not been fully satisfactory. Accordingly, there has been a substantial need in the art for improved compositions for inhibiting the polymerization of such monomers during the distillation process for purifying or separating them from impurities, as well as during transport and storage. Additionally, the formation of soluble polymer leads to loss of monomer, i.e., a lower yield, and an increase in the viscosity of any tars that may be produced. The processing of the tars then requires higher temperature and work (energy cost) to remove residual monomer. Hindered nitroxyl compounds are known to be very active inhibitors of free radical polymerizations of unsaturated monomers such as styrene, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and the like. U.S. Pat. No 3,163,677 discloses N,N,O-trisubstituted hydroxylamines and N,N-disubstituted nitroxides of the formulae: wherein R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 are each an alkyl radical having 1 to 15 carbon atoms. (As used herein, the designation N-O* denotes a stable free radical wherein the asterisk is an unpaired electron.) The N,N,O-trisubstituted hydroxylamines can be used to make the N,N-disubstituted nitroxides, which are stable free radicals and are said to be useful as polymerization inhibitors. U.S. Pat. No. 3,334,103 discloses that nitroxides can be prepared from the corresponding heterocyclic amine wherein the nitrogen atom of the nitroxide group is attached to other than a tertiary carbon of an aliphatic group (i.e., the nitrogen atom forms a part of a heterocyclic nucleus). These nitroxides are said to have useful properties similar to those described for the N,N-disubstituted nitroxides of U.S. Pat. No. 3,163,677. U.S. Pat. No. 3,372,182 discloses that a great variety of N,N-disubstituted, stable, free radical nitroxides not otherwise readily available can be prepared by a simple and convenient process that comprises pyrolyzing in an inert reaction medium virtually any hydroxylamine that is susceptible to cleavage of the OC bond (e.g., tri-t-butylhydroxylamine). U.K. Patent Number 1,127,127 discloses that acrylic acid can be stabilized against polymerization by the addition thereto of a nitroxide having the essential skeletal structure: wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , and R 4 are alkyl groups and no hydrogen is bound to the remaining valencies on the carbon atoms bound to the nitrogen. The two remaining valencies that are not satisfied by R 1 to R 4 or nitrogen can also form part of a ring (e.g., 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-hydroxy-piperidine-1-oxyl). U.S. Pat. No. 3,422,144 discloses stable, free radical nitroxides of the formula: wherein R is selected from the group consisting of tertiary alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, haloaryl, carboxyaryl, alkoxyaryl, alkylthioaryl, pyridyl, and dialkylaminoaryl, and R is tertiary alkyl. These nitroxides are said to be useful as traps for reactive free radicals both in the counting of free radicals and for inhibiting oxidation and free radical polymerization. U.S. Pat. No. 3,494,930 discloses free radicals of the nitroxide type for use as initiators of free radical reactions, collectors of free radicals, polymerization inhibitors or antioxidants. They are constituted by nitrogenous bicyclic compounds in which one of the bridges comprises solely the nitroxide radical group and, in particular, by aza-9-bicyclo (3,3,1) nonanone-3-oxyl-9, and by aza-9-bicyclo (3,3,1) nonane oxyl-9. U.S. Pat. No. 3,873,564 discloses compounds and a method for assaying enzymes by adding to a medium containing an enzyme a stable free radical compound having a stable free radical functionality which, when subjected to an enzyme catalyzed reaction, changes the environment of the free radical functionality. By following the change in the electron spin resonance spectrum as affected by the change in environment, the type of enzyme and the activity of the enzyme can be determined. The compounds found useful are normally stable nitroxide radicals. Particularly nitronyl nitroxides, with the nitrogens in an imidazoline ring, are employed, having a methylene group joining the 2 position of the imidazoline ring with an asymmetric carbon atom. One of the groups bonded to the asymmetric carbon atoms has an enzyme labile functionality. Other compounds include two cyclic nitroxide containing rings joined by a chain having an enzyme labile functionality. U.S. Pat. No. 3,966,711 teaches that 2,2,7,7-tetraalkyl- and 2,7-dispiroalkylene-5-oxo-1,4-diazacycloheptanes substituted in the 4-position by mono- or tetravalent radicals are powerful light-stabilizers for organic polymers. They are said to possess higher compatibility than their 4-unsubstituted homologues, from which they can be synthesized by reactions known for N-alkylation. Preferred substituents in the 4-position are alkyl, alkylene, alkenyl, aralkyl, and esteralkyl groups. The 1-nitroxyls derived from the imidazolidines by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide or percarboxylic acids are also said to be good light stabilizers. U.S. Pat. No 4,182,658 discloses a method for preventing the polymerization of a readily polymerizable vinyl aromatic compound during distillation at elevated temperatures within a distillation apparatus that is subject to an emergency condition, such as a power outage. This method comprises force-feeding a supplemental polymerization inhibitor having a high solubility in the vinyl aromatic compound and a long duration of efficiency, into each of the distillation vessels of a conventional distillation apparatus in an amount sufficient to prevent polymerization therein. European Patent Application 0 178 168 A2 discloses a method for inhibiting the polymerization of an ,-ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid during its recovery by distillation by using a nitroxide free radical. U.S. Pat. No 4,665,185 discloses a process for the efficient preparation of nitroxyls of sterically hindered amines by the oxidation of the amine using a hydroperoxide, in the presence of a small amount of a metal ion catalyst, at moderate temperature, for a short period of time to give the nitroxyl in high yield and purity. U.S. Pat. No. 5,254,760 teaches that the polymerization of a vinyl aromatic compound, such as styrene, during distillation or purification, is very effectively inhibited by the presence of at least one stable nitroxyl compound together with at least one aromatic nitro compound. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,782 and 5,545,786 disclose that nitroxyl inhibitors in combination with some oxygen reduce the premature polymerization of vinyl aromatic monomers during the manufacturing processes for such monomers. Even small quantities of air used in combination with the nitroxyl inhibitors are said to result in vastly prolonged inhibition times for the monomers. European Patent Application 0 765 856 A1 discloses a stabilized acrylic acid composition in which the polymerization of the acrylic acid is inhibited during the distillation process for purifying or separating the acrylic acid as well as during transport and storage. The compositions comprise three components: (a) acrylic acid, (b) a stable nitroxyl radical, and (c) a dihetero-substituted benzene compound having at least one transferable hydrogen (e.g., a quinone derivative such as the monomethyl ether of hydroquinone (MEHQ)). During the distillation process, transport and storage, components (b) and (c) are present in a polymerization-inhibiting amount. During the distillation process, oxygen (d) is preferably added with components (b) and (c). According to the specification, examples of suitable nitroxide free radical compounds include di-t-butylnitroxide; di-t-amylnitroxide; 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidinyloxy; 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidinyloxy; 4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidinyloxy; 4-dimethylamino-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidinyloxy; 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidinyloxy; 4-ethanoyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidinyloxy; 2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidinyloxy; 3-amino-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidinyloxy; 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-oxa-3-azacyclopentyl-3-oxy; 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-oxa-3-pyrrolinyl-1-oxy-3-carboxylic acid; and 2,2,3,3,5,5,6,6-octamethyl-1,4-diazacyclohexyl-1,4-dioxy. WO 98/14416 discloses that the polymerization of vinyl aromatic monomers such as styrene is inhibited by the addition of a composition of a stable hindered nitroxyl radical and an oxime compound. CS-260755 B1 is directed to the preparation of 4-substituted-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine nitroxyls as olefin stabilizers. SU-334845 A1 is directed to the inhibition of the radical polymerization of oligoester acrylates using iminoxyl radical inhibitors of a given formula. SU-478838 is directed to the inhibition of the radical polymerization of oligoester acrylates and the prevention of oligomeric peroxides using a binary polymerization inhibitor comprising quinone. The foregoing are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION As used herein, the abbreviation TEMPO stands for 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy. Thus, 4-amino-TEMPO is 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy; 4-hydroxy-TEMPO is 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (also known in the art as HTEMPO); 4-oxo-TEMPO is 4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy; and so on. As mentioned above, hindered nitroxyl compounds are known to be very active inhibitors of free radical polymerizations of unsaturated monomers such as styrene, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and the like. The present invention is based upon the discovery that 4-amino-TEMPO has an unusual characteristic when used in a test that simulates a manufacturing plants loss of inhibitor feed to the distillation train. Under these conditions, most nitroxyl compounds permit the polymer to form at similar rates. But 4-amino-TEMPO permits polymer to form at significantly slower rates, as indicated by a lesser slope of a percent polymer versus time curve. This is advantageous in that it provides additional time for remedying a plant upset situation before an unacceptable amount of polymer is formed in the distillation train. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a method for inhibiting the premature polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising adding to said monomers an effective amount of an inhibitor having the structural formula: wherein R 1 and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and the portion represents the atoms necessary to form a five-, six-, or seven-membered heterocyclic ring, at least one of said atoms being a carbon atom substituted with a primary, secondary, or tertiary amino group. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method for inhibiting the premature polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising adding to said monomers an effective amount of an inhibitor having the structural formula wherein R 1 and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and heteroatom-substituted alkyl, R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and R 5 and R 6 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, and acyl. It is most preferred that the inhibitor be 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (i.e., 4-amino-TEMPO). The effective amount of the nitroxyl compound is typically about 1 to 2,000 ppm, based on the weight of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer, although amounts outside this range may be appropriate depending upon the conditions of use. The amount of the nitroxyl compound is preferably about 5 to about 1,000 ppm, based on the weight of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer. In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a composition comprising: (a) a ethylenically unsaturated monomer, and (b) an effective inhibiting amount, to prevent premature polymerization of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer, of an inhibitor having the structural formula: wherein R 1 and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and heteroatom-substituted alkyl portion represents the atoms necessary to form a five-, six-, or seven-membered heterocyclic ring, at least one of said atoms being a carbon atom substituted with a primary, secondary, or tertiary amino group. In another preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to a composition comprising: (a) a ethylenically unsaturated monomer, and (b) an effective inhibiting amount, to prevent premature polymerization of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer, of an inhibitor having the structural formula: wherein wherein R 1 and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and heteroatom-substituted alkyl, R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and R 5 and R 6 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, and acyl. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIG. 1 is a graph showing the slow rate of polymerization of compositions of the present invention after the shutoff of reboiler feed in a steady state dynamic testing system, as compared with the rates provided by other species. In the FIGURE, A is 4-amino-TEMPO, B is 4-oxo-TEMPO, C is 4-hydroxy-TEMPO, and D is TEMPO. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS As stated above, in one aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for inhibiting the premature polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising adding to said monomers an effective amount of an inhibitor having the structural formula: wherein R 1 and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and the portion represents the atoms necessary to form a five-, six-, or seven-membered heterocyclic ring, at least one of said atoms being a carbon atom substituted with a primary, secondary, or tertiary amino group. Such ring-completing atoms are preferably carbon atoms, but heteroatoms, such as O, N, or S, can also be present. The inhibitor employed in the practice of the present invention preferably has the structural formula wherein R 1 and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and heteroatom-substituted alkyl, R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and heteroatom-substituted alkyl, and R 5 and R 6 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, and acyl. Where R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , or R 4 are alkyl, they are preferably of 1 to 15 carbon atoms (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, and the like) and isomers thereof (e.g., t-butyl, 2-ethylhexyl, and the like). Where R 5 and/or R 6 are alkyl, it is preferred that they be a lower alkyl (i.e., one having one to four carbon atoms, e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and isomers thereof). Where R 5 and/or R 6 are aryl, it is preferred that they be aryl of from 6 to 10 carbon atoms, e.g., phenyl or naphthyl, which, in addition, may be substituted with non-interfering substituents, e.g., lower alkyl groups, halogens, and the like. Where R 5 and/or R 6 are acyl, it is preferred that they be acyl of the structure where R 7 is alkyl, aryl, OR 8 , or NR 8 R 9 and where R 8 and R 9 , are alkyl, aryl, or where R 10 is alkyl or aryl. Where R 7 , R 8 , R 9 , or R 10 are alkyl, they are preferably alkyl of from 1 to 15 carbon atoms, more preferably lower alkyl of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, as described above. Where R 7 , R 8 , R 9 , or R 10 are aryl, they are preferably aryl of from 6 to 10 carbon atoms, as described above. The inhibitor is preferably 4-amino-TEMPO. Although the above structural formula indicates that the cyclic nitroxides employed in the practice of the present invention are saturated piperidine derivatives, they can also be unsaturated piperidine derivatives of the formula: wherein Z 1 is C(NR 5 R 6 ). The cyclic nitroxides employed in the practice of the present invention can also be derived from five-membered rings, i.e., pyrrolidines. These compounds are of the structure: wherein Z 2 and Z 3 are substituted or unsubstituted carbon atoms, provided that at least one of Z 2 and Z 3 is CNR 5 R 6 . The other of Z 2 and Z 3 can be the same or different and can be oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, CH 2 , CHCH 3 , CO, C(CH 3 ) 2 , CHBr, CHCl, CHI, CHF, CHOH, CHCN, C(OH)CN, CHCOOH, CHCOOCH 3 , CHCOOC 2 H 5 , C(OH)COOC 2 H 5 , C(OH)COOCH 3 , C(OH)CHOHC 2 H 5 , CNR 5 R 6 , CCONR 5 R 6, CHNOH, CCHC 6 H 5 , CF 2 , CCl 2 , CBr 2 , CI 2 , and the like, where R 5 and R 6 are as described above. The cyclic nitroxides employed in the practice of the present invention can also be derived from pyrrolines and have the structure: wherein Z 4 is C(NR 7 R 8 ) where R 5 and R 6 are as described above. Another class of cyclic nitroxides that can be employed in the practice of the present invention is of the structure: wherein Z 2 and Z 3 are as described above. As stated above, R 1 and R 4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and heteroatom-substituted alkyl and R 2 and R 3 are independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and heteroatom-substituted alkyl. The alkyl (or heteroatom-substituted alkyl) groups R 1 through R 4 can be the same or different and preferably contain 1 to 15 carbon atoms. It is more preferred that R 1 through R 4 be lower alkyl (or heteroatom-substituted lower alkyl) of 1 to 4 carbon atoms (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, and isomers thereof). Where heteroatom substituents are present, they can, for example, include halogen, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and the like. It is most preferred that all of R 1 through R 4 be methyl. Such stable nitroxide free radical compounds can be prepared by known methods. (See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,163,677; 3,334,103; 3,372,182; 3,422,144; 3,494,930; 3,502,692; 3,873,564; 3,966,711; and 4,665,185.) They are suitable for use over a wide range of temperatures. But distillation temperatures employed with the ethylenically unsaturated monomers that are stabilized by the process of the present invention typically range from about 60 C. to about 180 C., preferably from about 70 C. to about 165 C., and, more preferably, from about 80 C. to about 150 C. Such distillations are generally performed at an absolute pressure in the range of about 10 to about 1,200 mm of Hg. The ethylenically unsaturated monomer, the premature polymerization of which is an object of the present invention, can be any such monomer for which unintended polymerization during its manufacture, storage, and/or distribution is a problem. Among those monomers that will benefit from the practice of the present invention can be listed: styrene, -methylstyrene, styrene sulfonic acid, vinyltoluene, divinylbenzenes, polyvinylbenzenes, alkylated styrene, 2-vinylpyridine, and the like. The ethylenically unsaturated monomers will not necessarily be stabilized indefinitely by the presence of the nitroxide, especially when the monomers are heated as in distillation, but they can be considered to be stabilized as long as there is a measurable increase in the time for which they can be heated before the onset of polymerization. Those skilled in the art will understand that additional free radical scavengers can, if desired, be included in the stabilized compositions and the methods for preparing them that are the subject of the present invention. For example, air or O 2 , as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,782 and 5,545,786, can be added, as can the aromatic nitro compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No 5,254,760, the dihetero-substituted benzene compounds having at least one transferable hydrogen, e.g., a quinone derivative such as the mono-methyl-ether of hydroquinone disclosed in European Patent Application 0 765 856 A1, and other inhibitors, e.g., phenolics and certain inorganic salts, well-known to those skilled in the art. The polymerization inhibitor can be introduced into the monomer to be protected by any conventional method. It can be added as a concentrated solution in suitable solvents just upstream from the point of desired application by any suitable means. In addition, the inhibitor can be injected separately into the distillation train along with the incoming feed, or through separate entry points provided there is an efficient distribution of the inhibitor. Since the inhibitor is gradually depleted during the distillation operation, it is generally necessary to maintain the appropriate amount of the inhibitor in the distillation apparatus by adding additional amounts during the course of the distillation process. Adding inhibitor can be carried out either on a generally continuous basis or intermittently in order to maintain the concentration above the minimum required level. The advantages and the important features of the present invention will be more apparent from the following examples. EXAMPLES Procedure for Dynamic Reboiler Test with Feed Shut-Off Preparation of Feed Solution T-Butylcatechol (TBC) is removed from commercially available styrene by distillation under vacuum. Removal of TBC is verified by caustic titration. The desired amount of inhibitor is added to this TBC-free styrene either directly or by first making a concentrated solution of the inhibitor in TBC-free styrene followed by further dilution with TBC-free styrene. Procedure for Dynamic Reboiler Test A quantity of the Feed Solution containing inhibitor (blend) at the desired charge (stated as a wt/wt total inhibitor to styrene) is added to a round-bottom flask (the Pot) and heated to the desired temperature (usually 116 C.) and brought to reflux by adjusting the pressure/vacuum. Once the Pot contents are at temperature, a continuous stream of fresh Feed Solution is begun at a rate that will add the volume of the initial Pot solution to the Pot over a period of time called the residence time (typically one hour). At the same time that the fresh Feed Solution flow is begun, the Bottoms Stream flow is also begun. The Bottoms Stream is solution in the Pot that is removed at the same rate as the fresh Feed Solution is added. The equal flows of Feed and Bottoms streams cause the quantity in the Pot to remain constant over the time of the experiment while allowing continuous replenishment of inhibitor. This procedure simulates the way inhibitors are used in a distillation train of a plant producing vinyl monomers. The experiment continues with flow in and out of the Pot for a specified period of time, typically seven hours. Samples are collected hourly from the Bottoms Stream. These samples are analyzed for polymer content via the methanol turbidity method. The amount of polymer in the samples is an indication of effectiveness of the inhibitor being tested. Procedure for Feed Shut-Off At the end of the Reboiler Test Run (typically seven hours), a sample is collected from the Bottoms Stream. This sample corresponds to Feed Shut-Off Time0 minutes. The flows of fresh Feed Solution and Bottoms Stream are stopped. The vacuum and temperature are monitored and adjusted to maintain boiling at the desired temperature of the experiment. Samples are periodically removed from the Pot (typically every five minutes). These samples are analyzed for polymer content via the methanol turbidity method. Data during this time is used to generate the Feed Shut-Off Curve for the run. A less steep slope in the Feed Shut-Off Curve (slower rate of polymer production over time) indicates a more effective inhibiting system in the event of a loss of feed in the plant. A longer period of time before initiation of significant polymer formation is also an indication of a more effective inhibiting system in the event of a loss of feed in the plant. A preferred system will have a long delay prior to initiation of polymer formation followed by a slow rate of polymer production once initiated. The above procedure is carried out using 4-amino-TEMPO, 4-oxo-TEMPO, 4-hydroxy-TEMPO, and TEMPO as the inhibitors. The results are shown in FIG. 1 and clearly indicate the improvement that is realized by employing 4-amino-TEMPO, as opposed to equal quantities of any of the other three nitroxide inhibitors.

BACKGROUND ART A mixture comprising an o-ethyldiphenylalkane and a m-ethyldiphenylalkane can be industrially produced in low cost utilizing an alkylation reaction, a disproportionation reaction, a condensation reaction and the like in the presence of an acid catalyst from a raw material such as an alkylbenzene. Hereby, -(m-benzoylphenyl)propionic acid (tradename: Ketoprofen) of a profen analgesic is obtained by a reaction such as a carbonylation from 1-(m-vinylphenyl)-1-phenylethane in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 2-101041. In addition, -(m-benzoylphenyl)propionic acid of a profen analgesic is obtained from 1-(m-vinylphenyl)-1-phenylethylene in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 3-31221. Further, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,922,052 (m-vinylphenyl)phenylmethane or the like is produced using a Grignard reagent, and -(m-benzoylphenyl)propionic acid (tradename: Ketoprofen) of a profen analgesic is obtained therefrom. Any of the processes for producing -(m-benzoylphenyl)propionic acid (tradename: Ketoprofen) of a profen analgesic from the above-mentioned 1-(m-vinylphenyl)-1-phenylethane, 1-(m-vinylphenyl)-1-phenylethylene, (m-vinylphenyl)phenylmethane is according to a cheap and simple process such as carbonylation or the like. Accordingly, it should be said that 1-(m-vinylphenyl)-1-phenylethane, 1-(m-vinylphenyl)-1-phenylethylene, (m-vinylphenyl)phenylmethane and the like are useful as a raw material for -(m-benzoylphenyl)propionic acid (tradename: Ketoprofen) of a profen analgesic. Hereby, as already described, the mixture comprising the o-ethyldiphenylalkane and the m-ethyldiphenylalkane can be industrially produced in low cost utilizing an alkylation reaction, a disproportionation reaction, a condensation reaction and the like in the presence of an acid catalyst from an alkylbenzene and the like. Therefore, if 1-(m-vinylphenyl)-1-phenylethane, 1-(m-vinylphenyl)-1-phenylethylene, (m-vinylphenyl)phenylmethane and the like can be obtained utilizing the mixture, it is industrially advantageous. However, anethyldiphenylalkane is obtained as a mixture comprising an o-ethyldiphenylalkane, a m-ethyldiphenylalkane and a p-ethyldiphenylalkane by the process utilizing an alkylation reaction, a disproportionation reaction, a condensation reaction and the like in the presence of an acid catalyst from a raw material such as an alkylbenzene or the like. The boiling points of o-, m- and p-(ethylphenyl)phenylmethane are 290.9 C., 291.5 C. and 297.0 respectively. In addition, the boiling points of o-, m- and p-1-(ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane are 285 C., 284 C. and 293 C. Accordingly, in case of a p-ethyldiphenylalkane, the p-ethyldiphenylalkane can be separated by a usual separation method of distillation from a mixture of ethyldiphenylalkanes containing thereof. However, it is practically difficult to separate a m-ethyldiphenylalkane from a mixture comprising an o-ethyldiphenylalkane and a m-ethyldiphenylalkane by distillation. Therefore, it is considered the process of using the mixture comprising the above-mentioned o-ethyldiphenylalkane, m-ethyldiphenylalkane and p-ethyldiphenylalkane as a raw material is difficult to be industrially adopted. In fact, such proposal is not proposed yet. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a process for selectively producing (m-vinylphenyl)phenylmethane, 1-(m-vinylphenyl)-1-phenylethane, 1-(m-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethylene, or 1-(m-vinylphenyl)-1-phenylethylene which is a useful compound as a synthetic raw material of -(m-benzoylphenyl)propionic acid (tradename: Ketoprofen) of a profen analgesic, utilizing a mixture of an o-ethyldiphenylalkane and a m-ethyldiphenylalkane which are difficult to be separated by an industrial distillation and whose ingredients are difficult to be utilized, as a raw material. Namely, the present invention is a process for producing hydrocarbons, wherein a mono-olefin hydrocarbon and/or a di-olefin hydrocarbon represented by the following general formula (3) is selectively produced by dehydrogenating or oxidative-dehydrogenating a mixture of any one of hydrocarbons among the hydrocarbons represented by the following general formula (1) and any one of hydrocarbons among the hydrocarbons represented by the following general formula (2), to be distilled. and R 1 is a vinyl group or an ethyl group) According to the process for producing hydrocarbons of the present invention, a mixture of an o-ethyldiphenylalkane and a m-ethyldiphenylalkane which are difficult to be separated by an industrial distillation and whose ingredients are difficult to be utilized as a mixture in the prior art can be used as a raw material. When a dehydrogenation reaction is carried out using the raw material, the o-ethyldiphenylalkane in the mixture is a cyclo-dehydrogenated compound having a higher boiling point than the dehydrogenating compound of the m-ethyldiphenylalkane, a solid cyclo-dehydrogenated compound, and a compound obtained by eliminating an ethyl group which was substituted at a phenyl group, i.e., a compound having a lower boiling point than the dehydrogenated compound of the m-ethyldiphenylalkane. Accordingly, the dehydrogenated compound of the o-ethyldiphenylalkane can be easily separated from the dehydrogenated compound of the m-ethyldiphenylalkane by usually distilling a mixture of the dehydrogenation reaction after reaction. As a result, the dehydrogenated compound of the m-ethyldiphenylalkane which is the objective product of the present invention can be easily obtained in high purity. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The content of the present invention is illustrated in more detail below. The hydrocarbon represented by the aforementioned general formula (1) is specifically (m-ethylphenyl)phenylmethane or 1-(m-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane. The hydrocarbon represented by the aforementioned general formula (2) is specifically (o-ethylphenyl)phenylmethane or 1-(o-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane. The mono-olefin hydrocarbon or the di-olefin hydrocarbon represented by the aforementioned general formula (3) is specifically (m-vinylphenyl)phenylmethane (mono-olefin hydrocarbon) obtained by dehydrogenating an ethyl group which is substituted at the m-position of a phenyl group of (m-ethylphenyl)phenylmethane, 1- (m-vinylphenyl) -1-phenylethane (mono-olefin hydrocarbon) obtained by dehydrogenating an ethyl group which is substituted at the m-position of a phenyl group of 1-(m-ethylphenyl)phenylethane, 1-(m-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethylene (mono-olefin hydrocarbon) obtained by dehydrogenating an ethyl group to which two phenyl groups of 1-(m-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane are substituted, and 1-(m-vinylphenyl)-1-phenylethylene (di-olefin hydrocarbon) obtained by dehydrogenating both an ethyl group which is substituted at the m-position of a phenyl group of 1-(m-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane and an ethyl group to which two phenyl groups are substituted. The dehydrogenated compound of an o-ethyldiphenylalkane is merely prepared by a dehydrogenation reaction of the o-ethyldiphenylalkane represented by the general formula (2), and the dehydrogenated compounds of the o-ethyldiphenylalkane are mainly a cyclo-dehydrogenated compound shown as described below and a compound from which an ethyl group substituted at a phenyl group is eliminated. Namely, the cyclo-dehydrogenated compound prepared from the o-ethyldiphenylalkane is as follow. 1-Phenylindene and the like are prepared from (o-ethylphenyl)phenylmethane. 1-Phenylnaphthalene (boiling point: 324-325 C.), 9,10-dimethylanthracene (melting point: 182-184 C.), and 9-methylanthracene obtained by elimination of a methyl group of 9,10-dimethylanthracene, anthracene (melting point: 216-218 C., boiling point: 342 C.) and the like are prepared from 1-(o-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane. These cyclo-dehydrogenated compounds are liquids having a high boiling point in comparison with the dehydrogenated compound of the m-ethyldiphenylalkane or solids, and can be easily separated by distillation. 9,10-Dimethylanthracene, 9-methylanthracene and anthracene being solids at normal temperature can be easily separated by also depositing crystals by cooling and the like to be filtered. Concerning the compound obtained by elimination of an ethyl group substituted at a phenyl group of the o-ethyldiphenylalkane, diphenylmethane (boiling point: 264.5 C.) is prepared from (o-ethylphenyl)phenylmethane, and diphenylmethane and 1,1-diphenylethylene (boiling point: 277.0 C.) and the like are prepared from 1-(o-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane. These are compounds having a low boiling point in comparison with the dehydrogenated compound of the m-ethyldiphenylalkane, and can be easily separated by usual distillation. Therefore, the aforementioned cyclo-dehydrogenated compound prepared from the o-ethyldiphenylalkane and the aforementioned compound obtained by elimination of an ethyl group substituted at a phenyl group can be industrially and easily separated from the dehydrogenated compound prepared from the m-ethyldiphenylalkane which is the objective product of the present invention. The ethyldiphenylalkane which is the starting raw material of dehydrogenation or oxidative-dehydrogenation reaction in the present invention is a mixture of the m-ethyldiphenylalkane and the o-ethyldiphenylalkane, and the proportion of the m-ethyldiphenylalkane or the o-ethyldiphenylalkane in the mixture is not specifically limited. However, it is usually preferable to use a mixture raw material in which the content of the o-ethyldiphenylalkane (the total weight of the hydrocarbon represented by the general formula (2)) is in a range of 1-40% by weight (based on the total weight of the m-ethyldiphenylalkane represented by the general formula (1) and the o-ethyldiphenylalkane represented by the general formula (2)). When the content is less than 1% by weight, it is difficult to reveal the effect of the present invention because the content of the o-ethyldiphenylalkane is too little. In addition, it is difficult to obtain a mixture having such low content of the o-ethyldiphenylalkane by an alkylation reaction, a disproportionation reaction, a condensation reaction and the like using alkyl benzene and the like as a raw material. As a result, it is not preferable that such mixture becomes expensive. It is not preferable that as the mixture in which the content of the o-ethyldiphenylalkane exceeds 40% by weight has too much o-ethyldiphenylalkane, the burden caused by the successive purification operation becomes large. (Ethylphenyl)phenylmethaneor 1-(ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane of the raw material may be those produced by any of processes such as a known alkylation reaction, a disproportionation reaction, a condensation reaction and the like. When it is produced by these processes, a mixture containing at least the m-ethyldiphenylalkane and the o-ethyldiphenylalkane is usually obtained. Next, the process for producing the mixture containing the m-ethyldiphenylalkane and the o-ethyldiphenylalkane which is used in the present invention is illustrated according to the above-mentioned processes such as a known alkylation reaction, a disproportionation reaction, a condensation reaction and the like. (Alkylation Reaction) The process according to the alkylation reaction is a process in which an aromatic hydrocarbon reacts with an alkylating agent in the presence of an alkylating catalyst. As the aromatic hydrocarbon there are mentioned diphenylmethane, ethylbenzene, 1,1-diphenylethane and the like. As the alkylating agent there are mentioned halides such as ethyl chloride, benzyl chloride, and -methylbenzyl chloride; alkenes such as ethylene; aromatic olefins such as styrene; alcohols such as ethyl alcohol, etc. The halides as the alkylating agent can be any one of fluoride, chloride, bromide and iodide. In order to obtain (ethylphenyl)phenylmethane by an alkylation reaction, specifically, there may be a process of reacting diphenylmethane with, for example, ethyl chloride, ethylene, ethyl alcohol or the like as the alkylating agent in the presence of an alkylating catalyst, a process of reacting ethylbenzene with benzyl chloride, etc. In order to obtain 1-(ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane by analkylation reaction, there may be a process of reacting 1,1-diphenylethane with ethyl chloride, ethylene, ethyl alcohol or the like as the alkylating agent, a process of reacting ethylbenzene with styrene as the alkylating agent, a process of reacting ethylbenzene with -methylbenzyl chloride as the alkylating agent, etc. As the alkylating agent in the above-mentioned alkylation reaction there are mentioned acid catalysts such as a Lewis acid (Friedel-Crafts catalyst) such as AlCl 3 , AlBr 3 , AlI 3 , BF 3 , FeCl 3 , TiCl 4 , ZrCl 4 , ZnCl 2 or the like, a protonic acid such as HF, H 2 SO 4 , HCl, H 3 PO 4 or the like, etc. The alkylating agent may be also the above-mentioned catalyst alone or those combining 2 or more of catalysts. In addition, an amorphous metal oxide such as silica-alumina and a solid acid such as crystalline aluminosilicate or the like such as zeolite become the alkylating agent. For the amorphous metal oxide, there are mentioned silica-magnesia, silica-calcia in addition to silica-alumina, and further, there are mentioned silica-alumina treated with alkaline, silica-alumina supporting W 2 O 5 and the like. For the zeolite catalyst, there are mentioned an A type zeolite, an X type zeolite, a Y type zeolite, mordenite, ZSM-5 and the like. In addition, there are may be also mentioned those ion-exchanged with cations of an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, and a transition metal such as a rare-earth metal or the like in addition to those in which the cation of zeolite is proton. Any of them can be used as the alkylating agent. Further, a heteropolyacid is utilized in an alkylation reaction by an alkyl halide as an acid catalyst, and can be also used for producing the ethyldiphenylalkane. Examples of the heteropolyacid include 12-tungstophosphoric acid (H 3 PW 12 O 40 ), 12-tungstosilicic acid (H 3 SiW 12 O 40 ), 12-molybdophosphoric acid (H 3 PMo 12 O 40 ) and the like, and can be used as a homogeneous catalyst or a heterogeneous catalyst supported with a carrier such as silica or the like. In case of reacting by a continuous flow type, the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of the reaction raw material is selected from a range of 0.01-10. Concerning the proportion of the aromatic hydrocarbon to the alkylating agent in the alkylation reaction, when the alkylating agent exists excessively against the aromatic hydrocarbon, a poly-alkylated aromatic hydrocarbon in which the aromatic ring of the aromatic hydrocarbon is substituted with many alkyl groups is apt to be produced. Accordingly, it is preferable to carry out the alkylation reaction under a condition in which the aromatic hydrocarbon exists excessively against the alkylating agent. The reaction temperature can be made different according to the activity of alkylating catalyst and the like. It is preferable to react those having a highly alkylating activity at a lower temperature than room temperature in order to suppress the production of a poly-alkylated aromatic hydrocarbon and other by-products. In addition, when using a low activity alkylating agent, a process of reacting them by raising the temperature of the alkylation reaction near to the boiling point of the aromatic hydrocarbon of a raw material, and the like, can be adopted. The reaction temperature can be suitably selected according to the activity of the alkylation reaction. At all events, the temperature can be selected from a temperature range from a low temperature of room temperature or less near to the boiling point of the aromatic hydrocarbon of a raw material. The alkylation reaction can be carried out using the aromatic hydrocarbon of a raw material as a solvent without another solvent, but other solvent can be used. The solvent used includes C 6 H 5 NO 2 , nitro alkanes such as CH 3 NO 2 , chloroalkanes such as CH 2 Cl 2 , CH 3 CN, CS 2 and the like. When these solvents are utilized, a complex is formed with a catalyst such as a Lewis acid catalyst or the like, thereby the alkylating activity can also be suppressed. There are advantages that various side reactions can be suppressed thereby and the amount of a catalyst used can be reduced because the solubility of the catalyst is increased. In addition, an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as hexane, heptane or the like can be also used as the solvent. (Disproportionation Reaction) The process of obtaining (ethylphenyl)phenylmethane by the disproportionation reaction is a process of reacting diphenylmethane and ethylbenzene. The reaction is a reaction of transferring the ethyl group of ethylbenzene to the phenyl group of diphenylmethane (transalkylation). The process of producing 1-(ethylphenyl)-l-phenylethane by the disproportionation reaction is a process of reacting 1,1-diphenylethane and ethylbenzene. The reaction is a reaction of transalkylating the ethyl group of ethylbenzene to the phenyl group of diphenylmethane. As the catalyst of the disproportionation reaction, acid catalysts such as a Friedel-Crafts catalyst, a solid acid catalyst and the like in like manner as the aforementioned alkylation reaction can be used. The reaction temperature can be selected from a temperature range from a low temperature of room temperature or less near to the boiling point of the aromatic hydrocarbon of a raw material. Further, for the raw material fed, diphenylmethane or 1,1-diphenylethane and ethylbenzene are fed at about equal mole. In case of reacting by a continuous flow type, the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of the reaction raw material is selected from a range of 0.01-10. (Condensation Reaction) Production process by the condensation reaction is a process of condensing the aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, ethylbenzene and the like in the presence of an acid catalyst using a condensing agent. The condensing agent includes aldehydes such as formaldehyde, trioxane, paraformaldehyde, dimethoxymethane, acetaldehyde, paraldehyde, or their derivatives, halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, dichloroethane, etc. More specifically, the process for obtaining (ethylphenyl)phenylmethane by the condensation reaction is a process of condensing benzene with ethylbenzene in the presence of an acid catalyst using formaldehyde, trioxane, paraformaldehyde, dimethoxymethane, or methylenechloride or the like as a condensing agent. The process for obtaining 1-(ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane by the condensation reaction is a process of condensing benzene with ethylbenzene using acetaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, or 1,1-dichloroethane or the like as a condensing agent. As the catalyst of the condensation, acid catalysts such as a Friedel-Crafts catalyst, a solid acid catalyst and the like in like manner as the aforementioned alkylation reaction can be used. Mineral acids such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, various type zeolites such as A type, X type, Y type, mordenite type, L type, T type, ZSM type and the like, cation-type ion-exchange resins such as amberist and the like, and acid catalysts such as a Friedel-Crafts catalyst such as AlCl 3 , AlBr 3 , AlI 3 , BF 3 , FeCl 3 , TiCl 4 , ZrCl 4 , ZnCl 2 and the like, etc. can be preferably used. The reaction temperature can be selected from a temperature range from a low temperature of room temperature or less near to the boiling point of the aromatic hydrocarbon of a raw material. Further, benzene, ethylbenzene and the condensing agent for the fed raw material are fed at about equal mole to be condensed. In case of reacting by a continuous flow type, the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of the reaction raw material is selected from a range of 0.01-10. As the condensation reaction, water, an alcohol and the like are produced as by-product. Accordingly, processes such as reaction-distillation and the like can be adopted at the condensation reaction. When reactions such as the alkylation reaction, the disproportionation reaction, the condensation reaction and the like are carried out using alkylbenzene and the like as the raw material as mentioned above, a mixture containing at least the m-ethyldiphenylalkane and the o-ethyldiphenylalkane which are the raw material of the present invention is usually obtained. (Dehydrogenation Reaction) In the present invention, the dehydrogenation reaction is carried out using the above-mentioned mixture containing at least the m-ethyldiphenylalkane and the o-ethyldiphenylalkane as the raw material. The process can be carried out by a known liquid phase reaction or a gas phase reaction, but the gas phase reaction is usually preferable. For the dehydrogenating catalyst used in the present invention, a dehydrogenating catalyst at production of styrene from ethylbenzene can be used. As the dehydrogenating catalyst, for example, a catalyst having iron oxide, chromium oxide or a mixture of these oxides as main components are mentioned. Specifically, there are mentioned a transition metal oxide such as Cr 2 O 3 Fe 2 O 3 K 2 O series, a solid acid such as silica-alumina, a Pd-KBr/-Al 2 O 3 catalyst, a thermally decomposed product of a polyacrylonitrile, and the like. As an auxiliary catalyst, oxides of molybdenum, vanadium, manganese, zinc, copper and the like may be contained. Further, in order to improve the dehydrogenation efficiency, a catalyst to which oxides of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, barium and the like of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals are added may be used. Further, a supported catalyst supported on carriers such as alumina, silica, silica-alumina and the like, may be used. As the dehydrogenation reaction is an equilibrium reaction and a reaction in which the number of mole increases, a low reaction pressure is advantageous. Further, as the dehydrogenation reaction is an intensive endothermic reaction, a high reaction temperature is advantageous. Therefore, the reaction pressure is a reduced pressure to 0.5 MPa, and preferably a reduced pressure to about 0.3 MPa. The degree of reduced pressure can be suitably set from the tolerance of a reaction equipment against the reduced pressure, and the like. The reaction temperature is within a range of 500 C. to 700 C., and preferably a range of 550 C. to 650 C. When a temperature is less than 500 C., the dehydrogenation reaction hardly proceeds, and when it exceeds 700 C., it is not preferable to cause a side reaction such as decomposition or the like. In case of reacting by a continuous flow type, the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of the reaction raw material is selected from range of 0.01-10. It is preferable to carry out the dehydrogenation reaction by diluting in the presence of an inert gas. The inert gas which does not inhibit the dehydrogenation reaction can be suitably selected. For example, as the inert gas there are mentioned an organic gas such as methane in addition to an inorganic gas such as nitrogen, hydrogen, helium, argon, steam or the like. Considering the practicability of treatment, steam is preferably used. Steam can be coexisted within a range of a volume % of 0.01 to 10% in the reaction system. In the dehydrogenation reaction, there are a simple dehydrogenation reaction of dehydrogenating as a hydrogen molecule which was described hitherto and an oxidative-dehydrogenation reaction using molecular oxygen as a hydrogen acceptor. In the oxidative-dehydrogenation reaction, as exothermic reaction heat between hydrogen and the hydrogen acceptor is generated, it does not require a high temperature of 500 C. to 700 C. in like manner as the simple dehydrogenation reaction and can lower the reaction temperature. In addition, as it does not require a lot of steam which is a diluting gas and thermal medium (or can reduce), there is an advantage of effectively utilizing the reaction heat. In addition, there are many advantages on a process that an equilibrium constant becomes big and high conversion rate can be obtained. Accordingly, the oxidative-dehydrogenation reaction can be utilized also in the production of the dehydrogenated compound of the m-ethyldiphenylalkane of the present invention. As the oxidative-dehydrogenation reaction, for example, the catalyst for dehydrogenation of preparing styrene from ethylbenzene can be used as it is, and accordingly, the catalyst aforementioned as a dehydrogenation catalyst can be used. As the specifically preferable oxidative-dehydrogenation catalyst, for example, a transition metal oxide such as Cr 2 O 3 Fe 2 O 3 K 2 O series, a solid acid such as silica-alumina, a Pd-KBr/-Al 2 O 3 catalyst, a thermally decomposed product of apolyacrylonitrile, and the like are mentioned. As molecular oxygen being the hydrogen acceptor, air or pure oxygen can be used as it is, and further, these can be used together with an inert gas. The reaction can be carried out in the presence of molecular oxygen in the reaction system within a volume % range of molecular oxygen of 0.01 to 10%. The reaction temperature is nearly the same as the case of the dehydrogenation reaction, and specifically in a range of 500 C. to 700 C. and preferably 500 C. to 600 C. Other reaction conditions can be the same as in the aforementioned dehydrogenation reaction. Although an oxygen-containing compound as an oxidation product is occasionally contained, the product is nearly similar as the product of the dehydrogenation reaction. After the dehydrogenation reaction or the oxidative-dehydrogenation reaction, (m-vinylphenyl)phenylmethane a product obtained by dehydrogenating an ethyl group which is substituted at a phenyl group of (m-ethylphenyl)phenylmethane, 1-(m-vinylphenyl)-1-phenylethane (a product obtained by dehydrogenating an ethyl group which is substituted at a phenyl group of 1-(m-ethylphenyl)-l-phenylethane), 1-(m-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethylene (a product obtained by dehydrogenating an ethyl group which is substituted at two phenyl groups of 1-(m-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane), 1-(m-vinylphenyl)-1-phenylethylene (a product obtained by dehydrogenating both an ethyl group which is substituted at a phenyl group of 1- (m-ethylphenyl) -1-phenylethane and an ethyl group to which two phenyl groups are substituted) and the like, which are the hydrocarbon represented by the aforementioned general formula (3) of the objective product, are obtained by distilling the reaction mixture according to a suitable purification. The above-mentioned distillation does not require a special distillation, and can be carried out by a usual distillation which is industrially operated. In addition, a known purification operation can be suitably carried out. EXAMPLE 1 The present invention is further illustrated in detail according to Examples below, and the present invention is not limited to Examples unless the purport of the present invention is deviated. REFERENCE EXAMPLE 1 Ethylbenzene and a HY type zeolite of a catalyst (ZC-50, manufactured by Shokubai-Kasei Kougyou Co., Ltd.) were charged in a reactor, and a mixture of ethylbenzene and styrene (molar ratio1:1) was added dropwise over 2 hours while stirring at a reaction temperature of 130 to 140 C. After completion of the dropwise addition, the stirring was continued and the reaction was carried out at a reaction temperature of 130 to 140 C. for 3 hours. The total molar ratio of ethylbenzene to styrene was 4:1 and the HY type zeolite was used by 10% by weight of styrene. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was precipitated and separated, and the supernatant liquid was filtered to obtain a reaction solution. The greater part of the reaction solution was ethylbenzene. Ethylbenzene was removed by reduced distillation, and the product was analyzed by chromatography. The composition was 2.3% by weight of 1-(o-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane, 33.0% by weight of 1-(m-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane and 47.7% by weight of 1-(p-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane. EXAMPLE 1 The rectification distillation of the reaction solution obtained in Reference Example 1 was carried out, and a fraction at a distillate temperature of 125 to 129 C. and a vacuum degree of 0.53 kPa (4 mmHg) was analyzed. As a result, 1-(o-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane was 7.1% by weight and 1-(m-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane was 92.3% by weight. The dehydrogenation reaction was carried out by using the fraction as a raw material, and flowing the raw material (feeding speed of 5 ml/h) together with water (feeding speed of 200 ml/h) at a reaction temperature of 600 C. under atmospheric pressure through a continuous flow type reaction tube in which 20 ml of iron oxide type dehydrogenation catalyst (G-84C, manufactured by NISSAN GIRDLER CATALYST Co., Ltd.) having a particle size of 16 to 20 mesh in arrangement was filled. The liquid hourly space velocity LHSV of the reaction raw material at this time was 0.25. The reaction solution was cooled at the exit of the reaction tube, and gas and water were separated. Then, an oil layer of the reaction solution till 3 hours after starting the reaction was analyzed by gas chromatography. The composition of the oil layer of the reaction solution is shown in Table 1.

The dehydrogenation reaction was carried out by flowing the raw material (feeding speed of 20 ml/h) and water (feeding speed of 200 ml/h) at a reaction temperature of 600 C. under atmospheric pressure through a continuous flow type reaction tube in which 20 ml of the dehydrogenation catalyst was filled. The liquid hourly space velocity LHSV was 1.00 which was larger than that in Example 1. An oil layer of the reaction solution till 3 hours after starting the reaction was analyzed. The composition of the oil layer of the reaction solution is shown in Table 1. EXAMPLE 3 A raw material which is the same as in Example 1 was used. The dehydrogenation reaction was carried out by flowing the raw material (feeding speed of 70 ml/h) and water (feeding speed of 675ml/h) at a reaction temperature of 600 C. under atmospheric pressure through a continuous flow type reaction tube in which 70 ml of the dehydrogenation catalyst was filled. The liquid hourly space velocity LHSV was 1.00. An oil layer of the reaction solution till 30 hours after starting the reaction was analyzed. The composition of the oil layer of the reaction solution is shown in Table 1. EXAMPLE 4 A raw material having a composition of 9.2% by weight of 1-(o-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane and 90.5% by weight of 1-(m-ethylphenyl)-1-phenylethane which has a higher proportion of o-isomer in comparison with Example 1, was used as the raw material. The dehydrogenation reaction was carried out by flowing the raw material (feeding speed of 70 ml/h) and water (feeding speed of 675 ml/h) at a reaction temperature of 620 C. under atmospheric pressure through a continuous flow type reaction tube in which 70 ml of the dehydrogenation catalyst was filled. The liquid hourly space velocity LHSV was 1.00. An oil layer of the reaction solution till 48 hours after starting the reaction was analyzed. The composition of the oil layer of the reaction solution is shown in Table 1.

When a dehydrogenating reaction is carried out using the raw material, the o-ethyldiphenylalkane in the mixture becomes a cyclo-dehydrogenated compound having a higher boiling point than the dehydrogenated compound of the m-ethyldiphenylalkane, a solid cyclo-dehydrogenated compound, and a compound obtained by eliminating an ethyl group which was substituted at a phenyl group, i.e., a compound having a lower boiling point than the dehydrogenated compound of the m-ethyldiphenylalkane. Accordingly, the dehydrogenated compound of the o-ethyldiphenylalkane can be easily separated from the dehydrogenated compound of the m-ethyldiphenylalkane by usually distilling a mixture of the dehydrogenation reaction after reaction. As a result, the dehydrogenating compound of the m-ethyldiphenylalkane which is the objective product of the present invention can be easily obtained in high purity. The dehydrogenating compound of the m-ethyldiphenylalkane of the objective product of the present invention is useful as a synthetic raw material of -(m-benzoylphenyl)propionic acid (tradename: Ketoprofen) of a profen analgesic.
