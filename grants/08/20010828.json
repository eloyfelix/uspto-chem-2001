Rhodium and iridium complexes with these ligands are suitable for use as homogeneous enantioselective catalysts for the hydrogenation of prochiral compounds, containing carbon double bonds or carbon/hetero atom double bonds. The present invention relates to 1-2-(diphenylphosphino)ferrocenylalkylidene phosphines in the form of racemates and stereoisomers, to a process for their preparation, to iridium and rhodium complexes containing these ligands, and to the use thereof as enantioselective hydrogenation catalysts for the homogeneous hydrogenation of prochiral unsaturated compounds.

Our investigations have revealed that homogeneous hydrogenation of prochiral compounds with rhodium complexes, which contain these ligands give only low optical yields.

In another of its aspects, the invention provides a process for the preparation of compounds of formula I, which comprises reacting a compound of formula III in the presence of an inert solvent at room temperature or at elevated temperature, with a phosphine of formula IV HPR 2 R 3 (IV). The reaction is known per se and is described by T. Hayashi et al. im Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 53, pp. 1136-1151. The preparation of compounds of formula III is also described in this reference or can be carried out in analogous manner. The phosphines of formula IV are known or are obtainable by known methods in analogous manner. The reaction temperature may be in the range from 20 to 150 C., preferably from 40 to 100 C. Suitable solvents are polar protic and aprotic solvents which may be used singly or as mixtures of two or more solvents. Typical examples of solvents are alkanols such as methanol and ethanol, and carboxylic acids such as formic acid and acetic acid. The compounds of formula I are obtained as racemates, mixtures of stereoisomers or as stereoisomers, depending on whether the compounds of formula III are used as racemates, mixtures of stereoisomers or as stereoisomers. Mixtures of stereoisomers can be separated by known methods into the stereoisomers, preferably as a rule by chromatographic methods. The compounds of formula I are isolated and purified by per se known methods, typically by distillation, extraction, crystallisation and/or chromatographic methods. The compounds of formula I are suitable for use as ligands for rhodium and iridium complexes. In another of its aspects, the invention relates to complexes of formulae V and VI, X 1 M 1 YZ(V), X 1 M 1 Y A 1 (VI) wherein X 1 is two C 2 -C 12 olefins or a C 5 -C 12 diene, Z is Cl, Br or I, A 1 is the anion of an oxyacid or complex acid, M 1 is Rh or Ir, and Y is a diphosphine of formula I. The complexes of formula VI are preferred. With respect to the diphosphines of formula I, the same preferences and exemplifications apply as stated previously. X 1 as olefin preferably contains 2 to 6 and, most preferably, 2 to 4, carbon atoms. Ethylene is particularly preferred. Further examples are propene and 1-butene, X 1 as diene preferably contains 5 to 8 carbon atoms. The diene may be an open-chain or mono- or bicyclic diene. The two olefinic groups of the diene are preferably linked through one or two CH 2 groups. Typical examples are 1,3-pentadiene, cyclopentadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, 1,4- or 1,5-heptadiene, 1,4- or 1,5-cycloheptadiene, 1,4- or 1,5-octadiene, 1,4- or 1,5-cyclooctadiene, norbornadiene.

Typical examples of A 1 in formula VI are ClO 4 , FSO 3 , CH 3 SO 3 , CF 3 SO 3 , BF 4 , PF 6 , SbCl 6 , AsF 6 and SbF 6 . Preferably A 1 is ClO 4 , CF 3 SO 3 , BF 4 , PF 6 and SbF 6 . The novel complexes are obtained in per se known manner by the reaction of equimolar amounts of a compound of formula I with a metal complex of formula M 1 (X 1 )Z 2 or M 1 (X 1 ) 2 A 1 , wherein M 1 , X 1 , Z and A 1 have the meanings previously assigned to them. The metal complexes are known, q.v. inter alia EP-A-0 302 021 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,995. The reaction is conveniently carried out under an inert gas atmosphere, typically argon, and expediently in the temperature range from 0 to 40 C., preferably at room temperature. The concurrent use of a solvent or mixture of solvents is advantageous, conveniently selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene), halogenated hydrocarbons (methylene chloride, chloroform, chlorobenzene), alkanols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether), and ethers (diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane) or mixture thereof. The novel complexes can be isolated and purified by conventional methods, or they can be prepared in situ prior to hydrogenation and then used in dissolved from direct as hydrogenation catalyst. The novel complexes are preeminently suitable for use as homogeneous catalysts for the enantioselective hydrogenation of prochiral compounds containing carbon double bonds and carbon/hetero atom double bonds, typically compounds that contain a group selected from CC, CN, CO, CCN and CCO q.v. inter alia K. E. Knig, The Applicability of Asymmetric Homogeneous Catalysis, in James D. Morrison (ed.), Asymmetric Synthesis, Vol. 5, Academic Press, 1985. Examples of such compounds are prochiral olefins, enamines, imines and ketones. Surprisingly high yields are obtained, normally even a quantitative chemical conversion, in short reaction times. Particularly surprising are the very high optical yields which are obtained with the novel complexes. The enantiomer excess (ee) may be more than 90%. It is possible to use racemates, mixtures of stereoisomers or stereoisomers of the complexes of formulae V and VI, mixtures of stereoisomers or stereoisomers being preferred. In another of its aspects, the invention relates to the use of the novel complexes of formulae V and VI as homogeneous catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral compounds containing carbon double bonds or carbon/hetero atom double bonds, especially those containing a CC, CN, CO, CCN or CCO group. The preferred utility is for hydrogenation unsymmetric carbon double bonds, ketimines and ketones. The iridium complex of formulae V and VI is also preferred as catalyst for hydrogenating prochiral N-arylketimines to optically active secondary amines. The rhodium complex of formulae V and VI is preferably used as catalyst for hydrogenating carbon double bonds, for example prochiral carbon double bonds. In yet another of its aspects, the invention provides a process for the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral compounds containing carbon double bonds or carbon/hetero atom double bonds under homogeneous reaction conditions, which process comprises hydrogenating said compounds in the temperature range from 20 to 80 C., and under a hydrogen pressure of 10 4 to 10 7 Pa, in the presence of a catalytic amount of a complex of formula V and VI. Preferred prochiral compounds are those previously mentioned. Unsymmetric ketimines and ketones are known. Suitable N-arylketimines are disclosed, inter alia, in EP-A-0 256 982. N-Aliphatic ketimines are disclosed, inter alia, in EP-A-0 301 457. Such imines can be prepared from the corresponding unsymmetric ketones, which are known and commercially available or obtainable by known methods. Suitable substituted alkenes are described in the publication of K. E. Knig referred to above. The process is preferably carried out in the temperature range from 10 to 50 C. and preferably under a hydrogen pressure of 1.10 5 to 6.10 6 Pa. The amount of catalyst is preferably chosen such that the molar ratio of compound to be hydrogenated (substrate) to the complex of formula V or VI is preferably 10000 to 20, more preferably 5000 to 20, especially 2000 to 40 and, most preferably, 1000 to 50. A preferred mode of carrying out the process comprises the additional concurrent use of an ammonium or alkali metal chloride, bromide or iodide, especially when using the novel iridium catalysts. The amount may typically be 0.1 to 100, preferably 1 to 50 and, most preferably, 2 to 20, equivalents, based on the complex of formula V or VI. The addition of iodides is preferred. Ammonium is preferably tetraalkylammonium containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl groups, and the preferred alkali metal is lithium, sodium and potassium. The hydrogenation can be carried out without, or in the presence of, a solvent. Suitable solvents, which may be used alone or in admixture, are typically: aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene), alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanel and butanol; ethers such as diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane; halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane and chlorobenzene; esters and lactones such as ethyl acetate, butyrolactone or valerolactone; carboxamides and lactams such as dimethyl formamide, dimethyl acetamide and N-methylpyrrolidone. Preferred mixtures are those of alcohols and aromatic hydrocarbons, typically methanol/benzene or methanol/toluene. The preferred solvents is methanol by itself or in admixture with benzene or toluene. The novel hydrogenation process makes it possible to obtain optically pure compounds which are useful intermediates for the synthesis of biologically active compounds, especially in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical sectors. Thus, for example, herbicidally active 5-imidazolecarboxylic acid derivatives which can be used for weed control (EP-A-0 207 563) can be prepared from secondary amines, especially N-carbalkoxymethylamines. The optically pure -aminocarboxylates are suitable for peptide syntheses. Optically pure aminocarboxylic acids which are useful synthesis components can be obtained from unsaturated aminocarboxylic acids. The following Examples illustrate the invention in more detail. The reactions are carried out under argon. The chemical conversion is determined by gas chromatography column DB 17/30 W (15 m), supplier: JCW Scientific INC., USA, temperature program: 60/1 min up to 220 C., T: 10.min 1 . The determination of the optical yield, enantiomer excess ee) is likewise made by gas chromatography column Chirasil-Val, 50 m, supplier: Alltech, USA, T: 150 C., isotherm).

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a cosmetic composition notably useful for the skin whitening, containing a compound of the general formula (I) as described hereafter, in association with any suitable excipient, the present invention relates also to a melanogenesis inhibiting agent containing such a cosmetic composition. The compounds (I) according to the invention have the general formula: wherein R 1 represents a hydrogen atom, a linear or branched alkyl group or a thiazoline group, R 2 represents a hydrogen atom, a linear or branched alkyl group or a linear or branched alkyl group substituted by a carboxyl, a hydroxyl, an amine or a thiol group, R 3 represents a hydrogen atom, a linear or branched alkyl group, an arylalkyl group, an acyl group or an acyloxy group, R 4 represents a hydrogen atom or a linear or branched alkyl group, R 5 represents a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group or a linear or branched alkyl group. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION For several years, there has been a growing interest, in the field of cosmetics, for depigmenting products: age spots (lentigo senile), chloasma, freckles, pigmentation spots that appear on mature skins after a prolonged exposure to the sun, are badly tolerated by affected people. Fashion phenomena favouring light complexions in Asia and Africa are also factors in favour of the development of depigmenting products. Melanin is a pigment synthesized by melanocytes which are specific cells of the epidermal basal layer. Hyperpigmentations are often caused by hyperactivity of the melanocytes, eventually associated to an increase of their number. Within melanocytes, oxidation reactions that lead to the formation of melanin are mainly catalyzed by tyrosinase. Resulting pigments are uniformly distributed over the epidermis surface, except when the mechanism is disrupted: melanin is then anarchically accumulated in some areas. The depigmenting properties of some substances have been known for long: as soon as 1936, Oettel noticed a decrease of pigmentation among black cats hair which had been given hydroquinone (Hemsworth B. N. , J.Soc Cosmet. Chem., 1973, 24, 727-733). Some substances showed a depigmenting action but cannot be used in cosmetic because of their toxicity (for example, mercury salts), of the cutaneous irritation they induce (mercaptoamines, oxidizing products such as hydrogen peroxide) or because of the excessive slowness of their action (ascorbic acid or ascorbic acid derivatives). Other compounds such as phenolic derivatives, corticosteroids, analogs of vitamin A, some vegetal extracts are used as components in many depigmenting preparations now on the market. However, these compounds show some side-effects: among phenolic derivatives, hydroquinone, which is an inhibitor of tyrosinase, induces quite a few secondary reactions (inflammatory reactions, burns, prickling sensations, irreversible dyschromia in spots); corticosteroids induce such secondary reactions and cannot be used in cosmetic; analogs of vitamin A (beta carotene, canthaxanthine) are able to block the melanocyte activity but the problem with these substances is making them to penetrate into the cells without being metabolized by the cell enzymes. Plant extracts, containing either arbutin (glucose hydroquinone) or flavonoids or also cinnamic derivatives, are also used as depigmenting agents but have a very slow action. Generally speaking, the problem with these depigmenting agents of the prior art is that it will take at least a two months treatment before seeing the first results in vivo. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION To notably remedy these drawbacks, one purpose of the present invention is to suggest the use, for skin whitening, of compounds whose structure and manufacturing process are known, but have a surprising effect in skin whitening. One purpose of the present invention is to propose a cosmetic composition useful notably in the skin whitening, characterized in that it contains, in association with any suitable excipient, at least one compound of the following general formula (I): wherein R 1 represents a hydrogen atom, a linear or branched alkyl group or a thiazoline group, R 2 represents a hydrogen atom, a linear or branched alkyl group or a linear or branched alkyl group substituted by a carboxyl, a hydroxyl, an amine or a thiol group, R 3 represents a hydrogen atom, a linear or branched alkyl group, an arylalkyl group, an acyl group or an acyloxy group, R 4 represents a hydrogen atom or a linear or branched alkyl group, R 5 represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group or a linear or branched alkyl group. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Preferably, the compound of formula (I) is such as R 1 represents a hydrogen atom, a (C 1 -C 4 ) alkyl group or a thiazoline group, R 2 and R 3 represent each one a hydrogen atom, and R 5 represents a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group. Advantageously, the compound of formula (I) is such as R 1 represents a (C 1 -C 4 ) alkyl group, R 2 and R 3 represent each one a hydrogen atom, and R 5 represents a hydrogen atom. According to a preferred embodiment, the compound of formula (I) is the 1-amino-ethylphosphinic acid. According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the compound of formula (I) is the 1-amino-3-methylbutylphosphinic acid. Preferably, the cosmetic composition according to the invention contains, in addition to compounds of general formula (I), anti-inflammatory agents, other skin whitening agents and/or antioxidants. Advantageously, the content of compound of general formula (I) is included between 0.1 and 20% in weight in relation to the total weight of the composition and preferably between 0.5 and 5% in weight in relation with the total weight of the composition. According to a special embodiment, the composition according to the invention contains in addition an organo-silicon compound of the following general formula: wherein: at least one of the radicals R 6 , R 7 , R 8 or R 9 represents a hydroxyl group or an alkoxy, acyloxy, aryloxy or amine group, or a halogen atom, and at least one other of said radicals R 6 , R 7 , R 8 or R 9 represents an alkyl group. According to a special embodiment of the invention, the cosmetic composition contains in addition a pseudo-dipeptide such as one of the type obtained by the coupling between histamine and an aminoacid. Preferably, this pseudo-dipeptide is the -alanyl-histamine. Preferably, the excipient used in the cosmetic composition according to the invention, is a micro-dispersion without surfactant. Advantageously, the cosmetic composition according to the invention is in the form of liposomes, microparticles or nanoparticles. According to an advantageous alternative of the invention, the cosmetic composition is in the form of a cream, a milk, a lotion, or a gel. Another purpose of the invention is to propose a melanogenesis inhibiting agent, characterized in that it contains a cosmetic composition as described above. The present invention will be better understood through the following description and examples, which illustrate the invention in a non restrictive way. The compounds of general formula (I) are commercially available or can be prepared according to the methods described in the prior art, notably according to the procedure described in J. Chem. Perkin. trans. I, 1984 by BAYLIS and al. The compounds of formula (I) preferred are those in which R 1 represents a hydrogen atom, a (C 1 -C 4 ) alkyl group or a thiazoline group, R 2 and R 3 represent each one a hydrogen atom, and R 5 represents a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group. Among these compounds, aminophosphinic acids, that is to say compounds of formula (I) in which R 5 represents a hydrogen atom are particularly preferred. The compounds according to the invention are alpha-amino phosphonic or alpha-amino phosphinic acids and have thus a structure close to the structure of a natural alpha-amino acid. The compounds used for compositions according to the invention have in themselves an inhibiting action on melanogenesis. The mechanisms of this action are not precisely known, and it is possible that the observed activity is the consequence of several mechanisms working simultaneously and eventually in a synergetic way. Thus, compounds according to the invention can be useful for skin whitening because they inhibit tyrosinase, and/or because they act at other levels. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, in the cosmetic compositions according to the invention, at least one other compound useful for the skin whitening is added to the compound of general formula (I). Advantageously, the other compound(s) useful in the skin whitening contain at least one inhibitor of tyrosinase. Preferably, said other compound(s) effective in the skin whitening are ascorbic acid and/or its derivatives; particularly its stearate or palmitate salts or the ascorbic acid combined with a stabilizer, such as notably the compound known on the market under the trademark ASCORBOSILANE C and marketed by the Applicant. Said other compound(s) useful in the skin whitening can also be kojic acid or its derivatives. According to an advantageous alternative of the invention, said other compound(s) useful for the skin whitening are natural plant extracts, and more particularly the extract of white mulberry ( Morus alba ), green tea ( Thea sinensis ), matriarca ( Chamomilla recutica ) Green tea is known for its properties of inhibiting the transfer of mature melanocytes to keratinocytes. It is also an inhibitor of tyrosinase. Matriarca is an endotheline agonist, that inhibits melanogenesis induced by UV irradiation. According to an other special embodiment of the invention, at least one anti-inflammatory agent is added in cosmetic compositions according to the invention, notably substances with a soothing action. Advantageously, this anti-inflammatory agent has a natural origin. It is preferably licorice phytosterol. It is known, for example, that some dyschromia, such as age spots, appears with ageing. The inventors have noticed that when fighting the ageing process, notably with anti-ageing cosmetic compositions, skin marks connected with ageing decrease and, particularly, the apparition of age spots is prevented. Thus, according to a first special embodiment of the invention, the compound of general formula (I) is associated to a cosmetic active known for its anti-ageing action. Preferably, the anti-ageing cosmetic active is an organo-silicon compound, biologically active, like the silanols marketed by the Applicant. Advantageously, this organo-silicon compound corresponds to the following general formula (II): wherein: one at least of the R 6 , R 7 , R 8 or R 9 radicals represents a hydroxyl group or a hydrolyzable group containing at least one oxygen atom in such a way there is a SiO bond and at least one other of said radicals R 6 , R 7 , R 8 or R 9 represents an alkyl group. In addition, it has been shown that glycation phenomena, lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress situations can cause the appearance of an excessive pigmentation of the skin. For instance, it is shown that the synthesis of a compound like lipofuscin, an aldehyde-derivatives polymer known to be an age pigment, is regulated by pro and anti-oxidation reactions. This is the reason why, according to a special embodiment, the cosmetic compositions according to the invention are carried out by adding at least one compound of general formula (I) with at least one antioxidant. Besides, it is known that DNA destruction and/or its repair induces melanization. According to a second special embodiment of the invention, the cosmetic composition contains, in addition to the compound of formula (I) and eventually but not necessarily an organo-silicon compound, a compound particularly known for its DNA protecting and/or repairing properties. Preferably, this DNA protecting compound is a pseudo-dipeptide of one of the type obtained in combining histamine to an amino acid as detailed in the application for international patent WO94/19325. This pseudo-dipeptide is preferably the -alanyl-histamine, also known for its anti-oxidative properties and for its ability to reduce fatty acids hydroperoxides. The proportions of the compound of general formula (I) in the compositions according to the invention depend of the ingredients used in these compositions and can vary from 0.1% to 20% in weight. Nevertheless, the preferred proportions vary between 0.5% and 5% in weight. In all cosmetic compositions according to the invention, the excipient can be any excipient suitable in the field of cosmetics. Advantageously, the excipient is a micro-dispersion with no surfactant. According to a special embodiment of the invention, the cosmetic compositions according to the invention are under the form of liposomes, microparticles or nanoparticles. Cosmetic compositions according to the invention can also be in any form cosmetically suitable, and notably in any form suitable for topical use such as cream, milk, lotion or gel. The invention relates also to a melanogenesis inhibiting agent containing one of the cosmetic compositions described above. The following examples illustrate, in a non restrictive way, the inhibiting action on melanin of the compounds of formula (I) used for compositions according to the invention: EXAMPLE 1 The inhibiting activity on melanin of the 1-amino-ethylphosphinic acid of the following developed formula (Ia) is tested, in vitro: The reference used is the ascorbic acid in solution at 0.3.10 3 mole l 1 . 2 ml of a L-DOPA solution, 1.25 ml of tyrosinase (2500 units/ml), 2 ml of product (Ia) diluted at 1.10 3 mole.l 1 are mixed together, and the mixture is completed with 20 ml of phosphate buffer (NaH 2 PO 4 0.1 mole l 1 Na 2 HPO 4 0.1 mole.l 1 , pH6.8). The mixture is stirred for 4 hours at 37 C., then allowed to cool at room temperature for one night, shielded from light. 1 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added and the mixture is centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet is washed with 10 ml of distilled water then centrifuged a second time. A reflux is made on the pellet with concentrated acid HCL 6N for 48 hours. The dried pellet is dissolved in 10 ml of toluene, exposed to ultrasounds for 2 min, put 2 hours at 37 C. then exposed to ultrasounds again for 5 min. The optical density is measured at 400 nm. The percentage of inhibition of melanin by the 1-amino-ethylphosphinic acid is 46%. EXAMPLE 2 The inhibiting activity on melanin of the 1-amino-3-methylbutylphosphinic acid, of the following developed formula (Ib): is tested in vitro using the procedure of example 1. The percentage of inhibition of melanin by the 1-amino-3-methylbutylphosphinic acid is 44%. EXAMPLE 3 The inhibiting activity on melanin, of the 1-amino-ethylphosphinic acid (Ia) is studied on S91 melanoma cells cultures. The model of study was finalized by Gilchrest (1987). The cultured cells are purchased from a Cloudman melanom. As ordinary melanocytes, they respond to UV stimuli by an increase of melanogenesis. The melanogenesis evaluation is made through the melanin content and the activity of enzymes involved in this metabolism: tyrosinase and dopa-tautomerase. S91 cells are plated in P60 dishes at a density of 2.10 5 cells per dish and maintained in Dubelccos modified Eagles medium and provided with 10% of calf serum. When the cells have reached about 50% of confluence, they are exposed to a UV irradiation of 10 mJ/cm 2 at 2855 nm. During irradiation, the medium is replaced with a salin phosphate solution (PBS) to eliminate the forming of toxical derivatives. Immediately after irradiation, the PBS is replaced with fresh medium/7% of calf serum with or without the active agent. After a 16 hours incubation, the medium is replaced with ordinary medium with or without the active agent. Evaluation of the result is done 24 or 48 hours after irradiation. The control culture, which have not been irradiated, is subjected to the same process but left in dark during irradiation. The melanin content is then determined: melanocytes are trypsinized, twice washed with PBS and dissolved in 0.8 ml of NaOH 1N, when strongly vortexed for 10-15 min and heated at 60-80 C. The melanin concentration is determined based on the absorbance at 475 nm. The reference, kojic acid, is used at a concentration of 3.3.10 3 mole.l 1 ; at such concentration, it decreases the melanin content of 45.2%. The (Ia) compound, at a concentration of 0.5.10 3 mole.l 1 , that is much less concentrated than the reference, produces a 47.2% decrease of melanin rate in the cells.

Preferably, the fatty acid uninterrupted by a methylene group is 20:3(5,11,14). The fatty acid uninterrupted by a methylene group is also used for preparing a composition for modulating the metabolism of lipids in the superficial tissue of mammals. This application is a 371 of PCT/FR98/02584 filed Dec. 1, 1998. The present invention relates to the new use of a non-methylene interrupted fatty acid in the prevention and/or the treatment of inflammation in superficial mammalian tissues. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The use of fatty acids for preventing and/or treating inflammation in superficial tissues has been described in the literature. For example, EP 5 472 705 (Prospa B. V.) discloses new pharmaceutical compositions for topical use containing esters of -3 polyunsaturated acids in a high concentration and intended for treating psoriasis, phlebitis and related pathologies. EP 582 239 (Rhne-Poulenc Rorer) discloses topical pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions containing linoleic acid or derivatives thereof as active ingredients, and a carrier for transporting the active ingredient into the skin. These compositions are used for the prophylaxis and treatment of impure skin, e.g. skin affected by pimples, pustules, urticaria or comedones, of acne and of acne-associated skin disorders. Furthermore, EP 5 312 834 (Woobang Land Co.) discloses a pharmaceutical composition for treating acne comprising eicosapentaenoic acid and (-linolenic acid, in a weight ratio of 1:0.1 to 20:0.1 of eicosapentaenoic acid to -linolenic acid respectively. These fatty acids may be extracted from natural substances such as fish oil and/or perilla oil, for example. The term non-methylene-interrupted fatty acid, the acronym for which is NMIFA, refers to a fatty acid with a series of double bonds in which at least one adjacent pair of double bonds is separated by at least two carbon atoms, i.e., by a group other than a single methylene group. NMIFAs have been the subject of only a few studies with the aim of developing an understanding of their incorporation into mammalian tissues and their potential role in the treatment of certain diseases. For example, JP 61 058 536 (Nippon Oil) discloses a method for purifying pine nut oil containing at least 10% by weight of 5,9,12-cis-octadecatrienoic acid which exhibits a curative effect against arterial hypertension. WO 96 05 164 (Broadben Nominees Pty) discloses an anti-inflammatory preparation comprising a purified active fraction, for example 5,11,14,17-eicosatetraenoic acid, isolated from a lipid extract of Perna canalicullus or Mytilus edulis. WO 95 17 987 (The Regents of the University of California) shows that broad class of NMIFAs, including 5,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid, may be used in an effective amount for suppressing autoimmune diseases in general, for example rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythmatosis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, and about 30 other diseases currently known. Incorporation of dietary 5,11,14-eicosatrienoate into various mouse phospolipid classes and tissues has been studied. Results show that feeding the mice 5,11,14-eicosatrienoate resulted in lower levels of 20:4n-6 in the hepatic phosphatidylinositol pool. Because leukotrienes and prostaglandins cannot be formed from 5,11,14-eicosatrienoate due to the lack of an internal 8 double bond, and because 20:4n-6 was dramatically reduced in some phosphatidylinositol pools, it was expected that dietary intake of 5,11,14-eicosatrienate may alter eicosanoid metabolism, thus reducing potential inflammation in the hepatic system (Biochemica et Biophysica Acta, 1085, 371-376, 1991; J. Nutr. Biochem., 4, 409-420,1993). So far, the following class of NMIFAs, especially 5,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid has not been reported as being capable of being incorporated into the lipid fraction of superficial mammalian tissues. Neither has an anti-inflammatory effect in superficial mammalian tissues been expected. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it has been found that the NMIFAs having the following formula, wherein the NMIFA is an acid, a salt or an ester, and R 1 is a C 1 -C 5 alkyl group and R 2 is a C 2 -C 6 alkyl group, may be advantageously used for the preparation of a composition intended to modulate the metabolism of lipids in superficial mammalian tissues. Particularly preferred NMIFAs are those in which R 1 is a C 3 alkyl group and R 2 is a C 2 -C 6 alkyl group, or in which R 2 is a C 4 alkyl group and R 1 is a C 1 -C 5 alkyl group. The most preferred is that in which R 1 is an n-propyl group and R 2 is an n-butyl group (5,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid, also called 20:3(5,11,14)). The NMIFAs of the invention may also be used in this context for the preparation of a composition intended to treat or prevent inflammations is superficial mammalian tissues by modulating the metabolism of the lipids. The invention also relates to topical pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions comprising the NMIFAs of the invention as active ingredient. In a last aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical, food or cosmetic composition comprising a combination of fish oil and the NMIFAs of the invention. The NMIFAs of the invention offer similar advantages as fish oils known to one skilled in the art. However, they provide the advantage of being less oxidizable than fish oil, since they have only two methylene interrupted bonds as compared to docosahexaenoic acid contained in fish oil having 6 methylene interrupted bonds. In addition the NMIFAs of the invention are not a substrate for prostaglandin and leukotriene production, whereas prostaglandin and leukotriene can be formed from the fatty acids found in fish oil, such as 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3. A further advantage over fish oil preparation is the lack of fishy odour. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Modulation of the metabolism of lipids is understood as meaning more particularly catabolism of the lipid mediators associated with inflammation, differentiation, proliferation and/or barrier function of superficial tissues. Furthermore, inflammation of superficial tissues must be understood as the physiological phenomenon involving the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as cachectin (TNF), by the cells of superficial tissues, for example the keratinocytes and the epithelial cells of the cornea, and the cells of the immune system which are contained in these tissues (lymphocytes, Langerhans cells and the like). The inflammation may result, for example, from an infection, an allergy, a wound and an exposure to radiation and/or irritating agents and/or sensitizing agents. The fatty acid which is the subject of this invention is a polyunsaturated fatty acid which is linear and monocarboxylic, with all double bonds being cis-double bonds. Several types of nomenclature are used in this specification, and these are as follows. a) Nomenclature for individual compounds indicating number of carbon atoms and number and position of double bonds, a typical example being 20:4(5,8,11,14) for arachidonic acid: the number preceding the colon is the total number of carbon atoms, the number immediately following the colon is the number of double bonds, and the numbers in parentheses are the positions of the double bonds, starting from the end of the chain bearing the carboxylic acid group. In all compounds represented in this manner, except where otherwise indicated, all double bonds are cis. b) Nomenclature for classes of compounds indicating the location of the double bond closest to the methyl end group, a typical example being n-3 or n-6: the number following the dash denotes the position of the double bond closest to the methyl end of the molecule, counting from the methyl end. Thus, arachidonic acid is in the n-6 class, as is 5,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid (20:3(5,11,14,)), whereas 5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5(5,8,11,14,17)) is in the n-3 class. This nomenclature is equivalent to nomenclature in the literature, and n being interchangeable. Some of the NMIFAs of the invention are naturally occurring substances. Others may be synthesized according to well known published methodology (see for example Evans et al., Chem. Phys. Lipids, 38, 327-342, 1995). For example, 20:3(5,11,14) is a naturally occurring substance which generally occurs as one fatty acid in a mixture of fatty acids. This NMIFA is found in a wide variety of plants as minor or major fraction of the total fatty acid composition. Both the extraction of the mixture of fatty acid from their natural sources and the extraction of the 20:3(5,11,14) from the resulting fatty acids can be achieved by conventional extraction and purification methods well known among those skilled in the art. The natural sources of fatty acids containing 20:3(5,11,14) are primarily plant seeds, and prominent among these are conifers and ornamental shrubs. The seed oils from these plants are similar to normal edible oils, containing largely oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids, but also containing useful amounts of NMIFAs. Table 1 lists examples of seeds whose lipid contents contain significant amounts of 20:3(5,11,14).

Biophys Acta 70: 417, 1963); (3) conventional degumming and decolouring methods; (4) preparing methyl esters with 2% methanolic sulphuric acid according to the method of Christie (p. 52-53, in Lipid Analysis, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1982); (5) eluting 20:3(5,11,14) methyl ester from a silver nitrate impregnated acid-washed Florisil column with a hexane:ether mixture ranging from 9:1 to 8:2 (volume/volume) according to Carroll, J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 40: 413, 1963; Wilner, Chem. Ind (Lond) October, 30: 1839, 1965; Merck ChromNews 4(1): 1995; Anderson, J. Lipid Res. 6: 577, 1965; and Teshima, Bull. Jap. Soc. Scien. Fish. 44: 927, 1978); (6) removing contaminating silver ions by the method of Akesson (Eur. J. Biochem. 9:463, 1969); and (7) optionally converting the methyl ester back to the free acid form by saponification in 1 M potassium hydroxide in 95% ethanol according to Christie (p. 51-52, in Lipid Analysis, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1982). In the context of the present invention, the NMIFAs of the invention may be used in acid, salt or ester form, for example in methyl ester, ethyl ester, mono-, di-, tri-glyceride or phospholipid ester form. The NMIFAs of the invention may be used in a purified form, or else in the form of a mixture of fatty acids present in an oil extracted from one of the plants described above, for example. Administration of the NMIFAs may be achieved by methods known to one skilled in the art, to any kind of superficial mammalian tissues, that is to say to cells which make up the skin, the scalp, the eye, or the oral, buccal, nasal and vaginal mucosa, for example. The NMIFAs may be used for the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases of the skin or of the scalp, in particular against inflammations associated with, for example, psoriasis, erythema (sunburn), eczema, seborrhoeic dermatitis, alopecia areata, mycosis, acne and other dermatoses. A composition of the invention, intended for topical applications, may thus comprise an effective amount of the NMIFAs as active ingredient, and a carrier for transporting the active ingredient into superficial mammalian tissues. The carrier may be any kind of carrier known to one skilled in the art for cosmetic or pharmaceutical formulations. Liposomes may thus be one of the carriers used in this context. These molecules include one or more types of diverse substances including nonpolar lipids, polar lipids, mono- and diglycerides, sulphatides, lysolecithin, phospholipids, saponin, bile acids and salts. Liposomes can exist in the form of emulsions and foams, micelles, insoluble monolayers, liquid crystals, phospolipid dispersions and lamellar layers. The NMIFAs can be incorporated in the liposome, optionally in conjunction with an appropriate ligand or mimetic agent which binds to specific cell receptors. Liposomes are generally formed from standard vesicle forming lipids, which generally include neutral or negatively charged phospholipids and a sterol, such as cholesterol. The selection of lipids is generally guided by consideration of various factors, such as for example the desired liposome size and the need for stability of the liposomes in the bloodstream. Typically, the major lipid component in the liposomes is phosphatidylcholine. Partially hydrogenated egg phospatidylcholine is a typical example. Liposomes typically contain about 5-15 mole per cent of negatively charged phospholipids, such as phospatidylglycerol, phospatidylserine or phospatidylinositol. Negatively charged phospholipids help prevent spontaneous aggregation of the liposomes and thus lower the incidence of aggregates formed from undersized liposomes. Membrane rigidifying agents, such as sphingomyelin or a saturated neutral phospholipid, at a concentration of at least about 50 mole per cent, and 5-15 mole per cent of monosialylganglioside, may also by included to provide increased circulation of the liposome preparation in the bloodstream. Liposome suspensions may also include lipid-protective agents to protect the lipids from free-radical and lipid-peroxidative damage during storage. Examples of these agents are lipophilic free-radical scavengers such as -tocopherol, and water-soluble iron-specific chelators such as ferrioxyamine. Liposomes can be prepared by a variety of methods known among those skilled in the art. The liposomes can then be sized within a desired particle size range and a relatively narrow particle size distribution. A size range which permits the liposome suspension to be sterilized by filtration through a conventional filter, for example, is about 0.2-0.4 microns. Formulations for administration will generally comprise a solution of the compound dissolved or suspended in an acceptable vehicle, the appropriate choices of which will readily occur to those skilled in the art. The formulations may further contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, and wetting agents. The formulations may also advantageously include antioxidants, preferably fat-soluble antioxidants, such as especially tocopherol, tocopherol acetate, butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, ascorbyl palmitate and mixtures thereof. The cosmetic or pharmaceutical composition may be applied directly to the superficial tissues such that the NMIFAs diffuse through the cells and are administered there. This composition can also be injected underneath the superficial tissues, for example by means of a subcutaneous injection. In both cases, the application is regarded as topical, that is to say it is applied directly onto or underneath the superficial tissues. Application of the NMIFAs can also be extended to inflammations of the eye, more particularly of the cornea, and also of the mucosa, more particularly of the oral, nasal, buccal, anal and vaginal mucosa. Compositions administered orally may affect directly the buccal, oesophageal, gastric and intestinal mucosa, and/or may pass into the bloodstream and be carried directly, for example, to the cells of the skin, the eye or the mucosa. This composition can also by applied into the nasal passages by means of a diffuser, a gel and/or a physiological liquid for conventional flushing of the nasal passages. It should be pointed out that, depending on the galenical forms usually used for topical or oral application, that is to say depending on the dietary, cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical form, the amount of NMIFAs sufficient and necessary to observe an anti-inflammatory effect or an effect as a modulator of the metabolism of lipids may vary considerably. The invention thus relates to the use of the NMIFAs in an amount sufficient for treatment or prevention of inflammations and/or for modulations of the metabolism of lipids of the superficial tissues. The NMIFAs will thus be administered to a human or an animal, for example, as a food material to treat oral mucosa. They may thus be used as replacement for the oils normally used in food formulations or recipes, or as part of a mixture of oils used in this manner. This composition can be, for example, a sauce, such as a salad sauce, a table oil, a mayonnaise, an ice cream, a confectionery composition or a filling paste or spreading paste. The compound can also be administered as part of a nutritional supplement, such as a tablet or as a capsule taken orally on a daily basis. Binders, matrices and other conventional adjuvants normally found in supplements of these types will generally be included here as well. Typical dosages for such methods may vary widely, but will most often fall within the range of about 2 mg per kg of body weight to about 2000 mg per kg, and more often within the range of about 5 to about 500 mg per kg. The food composition may preferably comprise a carrier to transport the NMIFAs to the large intestine or other region of the gastrointestinal tract. The carrier may be a resistant starch incorporated at a level of 2 to 20% by weight. Incorporation can be achieved while drying together the food components, by freeze drying, for example. Incorporation can also be achieved by microencapsulation. A typical process for microencapsulation requires the preheating of a low melting point oil above its melting point (40 C.), the NMIFAs are then added to the mixture, resistant starch is also added together with other ingredients and binding agents such as gelatin and gums, and the dispersion is sprayed into the head of a cooling tower to allow uniform particles to form with an average size typically in the range 20-200 microns. A preferred form of resistant starch is a high amylose starch, for example those disclosed in WO 94/03 049 and WO 94/14 342. In the field of human and animal cosmetics, the invention also relates to the use of the NMIFAs for the preparation of a galenical form usually used for topical or oral hygiene application, and in particular in the form of oily, alcoholic or aqueous-alcoholic solutions, gels, water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsions having the appearance of a cream or a gel, if necessary capable of foaming, in the form of an aerosol, or also in the form of vesicular dispersions comprising ionic and/or non-ionic lipids. These galenical forms are in all cases prepared by the usual methods in the cosmetic field under consideration. This composition can be, for example, in particular, a composition for cleansing, protecting, treating or caring for the scalp, for the face, for the neck, for the hands, or for the body (for example in the form of vanishing creams, night creams, make-up remover creams, suncreams or oils, oils for the body or the face, cleansing milks, make-up remover milks or body milks), a make-up composition (for example a foundation), an artificial tanning composition, a composition for bathing, a shampoo composition (treatment of the scalp) or a composition for buccal hygiene (mouthwash, toothpaste or chewing gum). In the field of human or animal pharmacy, in particular dermatology, oto-rhinolaryngology, ophthalmology, gastroenterology and gynaecology, this composition can be, for example, a capsule, a soft gelatin capsule, an emulsion, a pomade, a composition which can be injected underneath the skin, an ointment, a syrup, a diffuser, an eyewash, a shampoo or a mouthwash comprising the NMIFAs for treatment or prophylaxis of the skin, the eyes or the mucosa. The various possible galenical forms are in all cases prepared by the usual methods of the pharmaceutical field under consideration. The present invention is described in more detail by the examples given below. It goes without saying, however, that these examples are given only by way of illustration of the subject matter of the invention, of which they constitute no limitation in any manner. The percentages are given by weight, unless indicated otherwise. EXAMPLE 1 Metabolism of 20:3(5,11,14) Determination of the profile of 5,11,14 in the human immortalized keratinocyte line DK2-NR (described in the patent PCT/EP96/05812) was achieved as follows. Confluent cultures of DK2-NR are incubated for 4 days in NR-2 medium (Biofluids Inc. Rockville, Md., USA) with an increased Ca 2 -concentration (CaCl 2 :1.5 mM). Then, the keratinocytes are incubated twice in 2 days (medium change with fatty acids after 2 days) in NR-2 containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA, fatty acid free, Sigma Inc. St. Louis, USA) and 15 mM of 5,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid methyl ester (5,11,14-ester) and/or arachidonic acid methyl ester (20;4n-6-ester). Furthermore, the cells are preincubated for two days with 15 mM 20:4n-6-ester (see table No 6-9) and subsequently for 22 days with 5,11,14-ester and with a mixture of 20:4n-6-ester and 5,11,14-ester. At the end of the incubation time the cells are washed in HBSS (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution) (Gibco, Life Technologies) containing 0.1% BSA and twice in HBSS. The cells are harvested by scraping (cell scraper, Costar Inc.) the cells from the culture dishes. The cells are centrifuged in 1 ml HBSS (1000 rpm). The cell extraction is carried out in a mixture of hexane and isopropanol (2:1 v/v) containing 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol. The phospholipids are separated by chromatography (silica gel 60) with the eluent chloroform/acetone (96:4 v/v). The fatty acid fraction of the phospholipids is then esterified by heating (100 C.) in a solution containing 10% BF 3 -methanol (Supelco, Bellefonte, Pa., USA). The methyl esters are separated. The fatty acids are quantified according to internal standards. The results listed in table 2 below show that 5,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid is integrated into the total lipids (3.34%).

After reaching confluency the Ca 2 -concentration in NR-2 medium is shifted to 1.5 mM. After 4 days, the cells are incubated 22 days in NR-2 without hydrocortisone, with a high concentration of Ca 2 (1.5 mM) and various fatty acids (i.e. 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, 20:3(5,11,14)). At the end of the incubation period the NR-2 medium is removed and stored at 37 C. to re-feed the cells after the UVB-treatment (conditioned NR-2 medium). The cell cultures are washed twice with HBSS. For the UVB-treatment the cells are incubated in 0.5 ml HBSS. The cell cultures are treated with 1.5 kJ UVB (Philips, TL100, maximum emission at 313 nm). Then, HBSS is replaced with the corresponding conditioned NR-2 medium. The supernatant is collected after 24 hours and is stored at 20 C. The secreted TNF concentration in the supernatant is quantified by ELISA (Pelikine Compact, CLB Amsterdam, The Netherlands). As listed in table 3 it could be shown that 5,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid inhibits the secretion of TNF (9 pg/ml) in UVB-treated human immortalized keratinocytes compared to controls (11.6 pg/ml).

The results show that anti-inflammatory effects are exhibited. EXAMPLE 4 Anti-inflammatory Activity of Podocarpus nagi Methyl Ester Following Topical Administration to the Mouse The anti-inflammatory activity of Podocarpus nagi methyl ester (containing 26% of C20:3 5,11,14; and containing 0.5% of -tocopherol and 0.2% of ascorbyl palmitate) was evaluated in the arachidonic acid-induced aural oedema test in the mouse. Podocarpus nagi methyl ester corresponds to the oil extracted from seeds of Podocarpus nagi , the extraction being carried out in accordance with the method described in the two paragraphs following Table 1 of the description. The exact protocol is as follows: Podocarpus nagi methyl ester or the Podocarpus nagi control oil is administered topically to the right ear of mice at a concentration of 20% (4 micrograms in 20 microliters of acetone) once a day for 5 days. Each group contains 5 mice and one group receives only acetone. Arachidonic acid at a concentration of 2% in acetone is administered 1 hour after the final application of the treatments, and the thickness of the ear is measured with the aid of a micrometer (oditest) 1 hour after the administration of the arachidonic acid. The Podocarpus nagi control oil corresponds to Podocarpus nagi methyl ester as described above in which the C20:3 5,11,14 has been essentially replaced by oleic acid (C18: 1n-9). Results The aural oedema corresponds to the increase in the thickness of the ear in relation to the group having received acetone only.

Podocarpus nagi methyl ester at a concentration of 20% provides 57% inhibition of the arachidonic acid-induced oedema. These results show that Podocarpus nagi methyl ester exhibits an anti-inflammatory activity when it is administered topically to the skin of mice. EXAMPLE 5 Analysis of the Lipids in the Skin Following Topical Administration of Podocarpus nagi Ethyl Ester to the Mouse Podocarpus nagi ethyl ester corresponds to the oil extracted from seeds of Podocarpus nagi , the extraction being carried out in accordance with the method described in the two paragraphs following Table 1 of the description. The exact protocol is as follows: Podocarpus nagi ethyl ester (with antioxidants) or the control mixture (with the same composition as Podocarpus nagi ethyl ester but in which the C20: 3 5,11,14 is essentially replaced by C18: 1n-9) is administered topically to the right ear of mice at a concentration of 20% (4 micrograms in 20 microliters of acetone) once a day for 5 days. Each group contains 4 mice. On the left ear, the mice receive only acetone. 2 hours after the final administration, the mice are sacrificed and biopsies are carried out on the ears thus treated for analysis of the cutaneous lipids. The incorporation of C20: 3 5,11,14 into the phospholipids of the skin of the ear of mice was analysed as follows: Extraction of the lipids: 20 mg of each biopsy is extracted with 0.8 ml of H 2 O, 1 ml of CHCl 3 and 2 ml of MeOH. Following centrifugation (3 minutes at 1000 g) the residue is re-extracted with 1 ml of CHCl 3 , the supernatant is filtered through a glass frit and washed with 1 ml of 0.88% KCl. The organic phase is extracted and concentrated under nitrogen and redissolved in 2 ml of CHCl 3 . Separation of the phospholipids (PL) and the neutral lipids (NL): the different classes of lipids were separated by solid-phase chromatography on 3 ml columns containing 500 mg of silica (Supelco 57010). The samples as described above (in 2 ml of CHCl 3 ) were introduced into these washed columns. The NL were obtained with 2 ml of CHCl 3 and the PL with 4 ml of CHCl 3 /MeOH (2/1) and 4 ml of MeOH. The samples are concentrated under nitrogen and redissolved in 10 ml of CHCl 3 . Thin-layer chromatography of the phospholipids: the samples of PL obtained above are introduced onto 1010 thin-layer chromatography plates (Merck 1.13727) and the PL are separated in CHCl 3 /MeOH/acetic acid/H 2 O (50/37.5/3.5/2.9). The PL are identified using reference samples. Methylation of the phospholipids: the samples are subsequently methylated with 200 l of methanolic HCl/hexane (4/1) containing 0.4 g of C17:0 for 16 hours at 65 C. The reaction is subsequently neutralized with 0.5 ml of 6% K2CO3. The methyl esters (ME) are extracted twice with 300 l of hexane, concentrated under nitrogen and redissolved in 5 l of isooctane for analysis by gas chromatography. Gas chromatography of the phospholipids: the ME are injected into the instrument Hewlett Packard GC Model 6890, equipped with a sample collector and a capillary column.

These results show that C20:3 5,11,14 is incorporated into the skin phospholipids following topical application to the mouse. The replacement of 20:4n-6 by C20:3 5,11,14 seems to correlate to the anti-inflammatory properties of C20:3 5,11,14 evidenced after topical application in the model of arachidonic acid-induced aural oedema in the mouse (Example 4).

This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/023,718 filed Feb. 13, 1998, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,110,447 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The present invention relates to novel cosmetic compositions. More particularly, the invention relates to cosmetic and care compositions comprising at least one film-forming polymer. These novel compositions exhibit improved properties with respect to the prior art, in particular with regard to the fluidity of the composition, the ease of application, the homogeneity of the film, the speed of drying, the resistance of the film to wear, the gloss, the resistance to yellowing, the stability to light and the stability to heat. Film-forming polymers are essential constituents of numerous cosmetic forms, such as, for example, nail varnishes, lacquers and mascaras. They make it possible to deposit the make-up in the form of a film on the surface of the skin, the hair and/or the nails. Normally, at least one so-called plasticizing compound is added to the film-forming polymer, the role of this plasticizing compound being to confer flexibility on the make-up film. This is because the use of a film-forming polymer alone gives a stiff, brittle and fragile film which rapidly wears away. However, the addition of a plasticizer can sometimes lead to other disadvantages, such as yellowing, instability of the composition towards light and/or towards heat, lack of gloss or lack of fluidity. Indeed, nail varnish compositions comprising N-ethyl-o,p-toluenesulphonamide (mixture of the ortho and para isomers) as the plasticizing agent, in combination with a film-forming polymer, are known, in particular from European Patent Application EP-154,679. However, such a combination exhibits the disadvantage of rapidly yellowing and of being unstable when it is exposed to light and/or to heat. The use of a citrate, such as, for example, tributyl acetylcitrate, as a plasticizing agent in combination with a film-forming polymer is also known. To this end, reference may be made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,227,155. However, such compositions lack gloss and fluidity and are difficult to apply. The present invention is targeted at providing a make-up composition exhibiting improved properties with respect to the prior art. The inventors have discovered, surprisingly, that the combination of a film-forming polymer with an ester of citric acid corresponding to the formula (I) (hereinbelow) and of a plasticizing compound of formula (II) (hereinbelow) makes it possible to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art. The present invention relates to a novel composition comprising the combination of: (a) at least one film-forming polymer; (b) at least one citric acid ester of formula (I): in which: R 1 , R 2 and R 3 independently represent H or a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched C 1 -C 30 alkyl chain or a saturated or unsaturated cyclic C 3 -C 30 alkyl chain, wherein at least one of R 1 , R 2 and R 3 is not a hydrogen atom, and R 4 represents a hydrogen atom or an R 4 CO group in which R 4 represents a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched C 1 -C 8 alkyl group or a saturated or unsaturated cyclic C 3 -C 8 alkyl group; and (c) at least one compound of formula (II): in which: represents an ortho or para position of the phenyl group and R and R independently represent a hydrogen atom or a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched C 1 -C 6 alkyl group or a saturated or unsaturated cyclic C 3 -C 6 alkyl group. The combination according to the invention, when it is incorporated in a cosmetically acceptable vehicle, spreads over the skin, mucous membranes, eyelashes, eyebrows, hair or nails with great ease and makes it possible to obtain a homogeneous film which rapidly dries and which exhibits improved resistance and improved gloss with respect to the compositions of the prior art. Such a composition withstands yellowing and is stable towards light and towards heat. The film-forming polymers that can be used in accordance with the present invention can be selected from: keratin derivatives, such as keratin hydrolysates and sulphonic keratins; anionic, cationic, amphoteric or non-ionic chitosan or chitin derivatives; cellulose derivatives, such as hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, methylcellulose, ethyl-hydroxyethylcellulose or carboxymethylcellulose, as well as quaternized cellulose derivatives; mention may in particular be made of nitrocelluloses of the RS or SS type and in particular nitrocellulose type RS, nitrocellulose type RS, nitrocellulose type SS and nitrocellulose type RS; acrylic polymers or copolymers, such as polyacrylates or polymethacrylates; resins of the acrylic, styrene, acrylate-styrene and vinyl type; polyvinylpyrrolidones and vinyl copolymers, such as copolymers of methyl vinyl ether and of maleic anhydride or the copolymer of vinyl acetate and of crotonic acid; polyester polymers, alkyd resins and/or anionic polyester amides which are dispersible in water comprising monomers carrying an SO 3 M functional group, with M representing a hydrogen atom, an ammonium ion NH 4 or a metal ion, such as, for example, an Na , Li , K , Mg 2 , Ca 2 , Cu 2 , Fe 2 or Fe 3 ion.

The varnishes according to the invention can also comprise a resin generally present at a concentration ranging from 0 to 15% by weight with respect to the total weight of the varnish. Mention may in particular be made, among the resins which can be used, of resins of the acrylic, styrene, acrylate-styrene and vinyl type. The anhydrous or aqueous nail varnishes according to the invention can also contain adjuvants commonly used in nail varnishes, such as, for example, U.V. 10% , screening agents. The invention is illustrated in more detail in the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 Nail Varnish Composition A composition according to the invention was prepared comprising: nitrocellulose 19% N-ethyl-o,p-toluenesulphonamide 6% tributyl acetylcitrate 6% pigments 1% hectorite 1.2% isopropyl alcohol 8% ethyl acetate, butyl acetate q.s. for 100% EXAMPLE 2 Comparative Tests Formulae tested: Formula A Formula B Formula C Nitrocellulose 20% 20% 20% N-ethyl-o,p- 12% 6% toluenesulphonamide Tributyl acetylcitrate 12% 6% Ethyl acetate/Butyl q.s. for 100% q.s. for 100% q.s. for 100% acetate (50/50) AStudy of Yellowing: The yellowing after storage for 1 to 4 weeks at 45 C. was evaluated visually. A grade from 0 to 10 was attributed to each sample: 0no coloration 10 very yellow The results are given in the table below: Formula A Formula B Formula C 1 week 1 1 1 2 weeks 2 1 1 3 weeks 3 2 2 4 weeks 4 2 2 It was thus found that the combination of the two plasticizers has very good resistance to yellowing, whereas N-ethyl-o,p-toluenesulphonamide employed alone gave a composition which rapidly yellowed. BMeasurement of the Gloss: Gloss measurements were carried out, using a Micro Tri Gloss Glossmeter sold by the company Byk Gardner, at an angle of 60. These measurements were carried out on the formulae A, B and C described above, and on the formulae A, B and C which derive from the formulae A, B and C by addition of 1% by weight of red pigment. The results are given in the table below: Formula A Formula B Formula C Gloss 80.9 69.8 80.1 Formula A Formula B Formula C Gloss 81.7 75.1 80.3 It was found, from these tests, that the mixture of the two plasticizers made it possible to obtain an excellent gloss, whereas tributyl acetylcitrate employed alone only made it possible to obtain an average result.

BACKGROUND ART The 5-pyrrolyl-2-pyridylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazole derivative of formula (1), as defined above, is a novel compound developed by the present inventors, and applications for approval as a product patent are presently pending or granted in 17 countries including Korea, Japan, the United States, etc. It acts as a proton pump inhibitor like the widely known omeprazole, lansoprazole, etc., but is very unstable under acidic or neutral conditions, which may cause several problems in formulation processes. The 5-pyrrolyl-2-pyridylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazole derivative (in the present specification, it is referred to as the active ingredient of the present invention) is very stable under alkali conditions of pH 7.6 or more, and yet it has a half time of 40 minutes or less under acidic conditions (about pH 4.0) and has a half time of 35 hours at neutral conditions (pH 7.0). Therefore, it has been recognized as more unstable under acidic or neutral conditions than omeprazole or lansoprazole which is also unstable under the same condition. Such unstability may cause many problems during storage or distribution. Particularly, it is desired to adjust the ambient circumstance to a low temperature of 4 C. or less, anhydrous and alkaline condition since the degradation of the active ingredient of the present invention is highly facilitated by the moisture and acidic conditions when the storage or distribution temperature becomes 40 C. or more. The general way for stabilizing the acid-unstable substances is to make an alkaline environment as well as to intercept the influx of moisture from the ambient. But, the present inventors have found that the desired stabilizing effect can hardly be obtained by simply mixing the acid-unstable active ingredient of the present invention with an alkali compound. Thus, the present inventors have extensively studied to establish a method through which the active ingredient of the present invention can be stablized in a form of microgranule. As a result, we found that such a microgranule can be prepared by combining an alkali compound with the active ingredient of the present invention in a specific mole ratio to adjust the acidity and simultaneously by using a water-soluble polymer as a binding agent in a specific content, and then completed the present invention. Particularly, we have noticed as a result of intensive researches that a certain alkaline salt, that is magnesium hydroxide, among the known alkali compounds, is highly appropriate for stabilizing the active ingredient of the present invention. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION Therefore, the present invention provides a microgranule comprising a 5-pyrrolyl-2-pyridylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazole derivative which is optimally stabilized. More specifically, the present invention provides a microgranule prepared by combining a 5-pyrrolyl-2-pyridylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazole derivative of formula (1) with an alkali compound in 0.2 to 7.0 times molar amount with respect to the active ingredient, and by using a water-soluble polymer as a binding agent in 0.1 to 50% by weight with respect to the granule. In the present specification, the term microgranule is used in a meaning that it is not the conventional granule having an average diameter of 1.5 mm or more. Such a microgranule form can be advantageously used when the active ingredient of the present invention is stored or distributed as a medicinal stuff. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The alkali compounds which can be used for stabilizing the active ingredient of the present invention in the microgranule according to the present invention include magnesium oxide, sodium phosphate (dibasic), potassium phosphate (dibasic), magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, aluminum carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate, aluminum phosphate, calcium phosphate, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, aluminum citrate, calcium citrate, sodium citrate, potassium citrate, complexed aluminum/magnesium compound (Al 2 O 3 .6MgO.12H 2 O or MgO.Al 2 O 3 .2SiO 2 .nH 2 O), arginine, lysine and histidine. These stabilizers contribute to the stability of the acid-unstable active ingredient by maintaining the ambient pH of 7 to 13. However, their contribution degrees to the stability are different from each other depending on their solubility, alkaline reaction efficiency, compatability with the active ingredient, etc. Unexpectedly, it has been identified that magnesium hydroxide exhibits a superior stabilizing effect upon the active ingredient of the present invention compared with the other stabilizers (see, Examples 1 and 2). In contrast, aluminum hydroxide, lysine, etc. have a much less stabilizing effect than magnesium hydroxide although they also have a considerable effect when compared with the control. The present inventors have tested the stabilizing effect for the active ingredient of the present invention using omeprazole, which similarly has an acid-unstable property, as a comparative substance. As a result, it has been recognized that the difference in stabilizing effect depending on the kind of stabilizer is more conspicuous in the active ingredient of the present invention than in omeprazole. The alkali compound as a stabilizer may be used in 0.2 to 7.0 times molar amount with respect to the active ingredient of the present invention. Although there are some differences according to the kind of stabilizer, this is because the stabilizing effect is trivial in an amount of less than 0.2 times molar amount, and the increased hygroscopicity of the stabilizer may act as an obstacle for the formulation in an amount of more than 7.0 times molar amount. More preferably, the stabilizer is used in an amount of 0.5 to 5.0 times molar amount for convenience sake in formulation and for excellent stabilizing effect. The stabilizer may be combined with the active ingredient using a binding agent to prepare the microgranule according to the present invention. The binding agent used herein should be water-soluble and represent neutral to weak acidic property in a solution. Some other coating materials or binding agents may produce acidic conditions, and use of them may cause the decomposition of the active ingredient of the present invention. Therefore, it is required to carefully select the binding agent. As the binding agent which can be preferably used in the present invention, water-soluble polymers, such as for example, hydroxy-methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, alginic acid, carbopols R (carbomer, carboxyvinyl polymer), carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, agar, carrageenan, pectin, guar gum, locust bean gum, xanthan gum, gellan gum, arabic gum, etc. are mentioned. The binding agent is suitably used in an amount of 0.1 to 50% by weight with respect to the total granule since the granule formation becomes impossible when the binding agent is used in an amount of less than 0.1% by weight, and since the content of the active ingredient in the final formulation becomes too small and substantial coating effect, which is not desired by the present inventors, may be produced in an amount of more than 50% by weight. The preparation of the microgranule may be carried out by using a conventional granulator, CF-granulator or fluidized-bed granulator. The conventional granulator has several problems, however, that it requires much time for granulation, dryness, etc.; color change of the granule surface is observed due to the continuous contact with the moisture during the dryness; and the like. Therefore, it is more advantageous to use a fluidized-bed granulator or a CF-granulator in view of the stability of the active ingredient or of the prevention of color change, decomposition and content decrease. Particularly, a stable granule can be obtained by using the fluidized-bed granulator since the moisture contained in the binding agent can be eliminated in a short time, and thus it is possible to produce a uniform particle. The microgranule obtained according to the present invention has been identified as having an excellent stability during the storage and distribution under hot and humid conditions. The present invention will be more specifically explained by the following examples. However, it should be understood that the examples are intended to illustrate but not to in any manner limit the scope of the present invention. In the following examples, IY-81149 represents the compound of formula (1) wherein X is sulfinyl(SO), each of R 1 , R 2 and R 5 is hydrogen, R 3 is methoxy, and R 4 is methyl (see, the following formula): EXAMPLE 1 Stability of the Active Ingredient Depending on the Stabilizer Each of the active ingredient of the present invention (IY-81149) and the known omeprazole was mixed with the alkali compound shown in the following Table 1 in a mole ratio of 1:1, respectively. That is, 159.2 mg of Mg(OH) 2 , 387.7 mg of Na 2 HPO 4 , 475.6 mg of K 2 HPO 4 , 229.3 mg of NaHCO 3 , 289.4 mg of Na 2 CO 3 , 377.3 mg of K 2 CO 3 , 273.3 mg of KHCO 3 , 212.9 mg of Al(OH) 3 , 475.6 mg of arginine, 423.7 mg of histidine or 399.1 mg of lysine was mixed with 1.0 g of the active ingredient, and then stored for 15 days under an accelerative condition (40 C., relative humidity of 75%). Then, the content of the active ingredient not decomposed was analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatography. The sample containing only the active ingredient without a stabilizer was used as a control. The analyzing conditions were represented in the following, and the results are shown in Table 1. Conditions for High Performance Liquid Chromatography Column: -Bondapak C18 (4.6250 mm) or the like Detector: Absorption photometer in ultraviolet part (wavelength: 280 nm) Mobile Phase: acetonitrile/phosphate buffer (pH 7.8){fraction (45/55)}, v/v Flow Rate: 1.0 ml/min Injection Amount: 20 l TABLE 1 Stability of the active ingredient depending on the stabilizer Content of Content of the Active the Active Ingredient Ingredient (%) Molecu- Water- (%) (IY-81149) (Omeprazole) lar Mole Solubility After After Stabilizer Weight Ratio (g/ml) Initial 15 days Initial 15 days not used 100.1 12.6 99.3 26.7 Mg(OH) 2 58.3 1:1 1/80,000 99.8 93.5 100.2 86.1 Na 2 HPO 4 142.0 1:1 1/8 99.2 82.1 99.8 94.0 K 2 HPO 4 174.2 1:1 1/0.67 100.0 74.2 99.4 70.7 NaHCO 3 84.0 1:1 1/10 98.9 78.0 99.7 87.5 Na 2 CO 3 106.0 1:1 1/3.5 99.4 79.9 100.1 75.3 K 2 CO 3 138.2 1:1 1/1 100.5 63.4 100.0 63.9 KHCO 3 100.1 1:1 1/2.8 100.3 65.3 99.9 59.4 Al(OH) 3 78.0 1:1 1/10,000 99.6 50.7 99.6 67.6 Arginine 174.2 1:1 1/6.67 99.2 75.5 99.1 76.0 Histidine 155.2 1:1 1/23.9 100.6 66.2 99.7 67.1 Lysine 146.2 1:1 less than 100.6 58.8 99.2 60.3 1/1 The results of the above Table 1 provide a very important information which can be referred to in selecting the alkali compound as a stabilizer for the active ingredient of the present invention. The data let us know that the tested stabilizers show a stabilizing effect with respect to the active ingredient of the present invention in the order of Mg(OH) 2 Na 2 HPO 4 Na 2 CO 3 NaHCO 3 arginineK 2 HPO 4 histidineKHCO 3 K 2 CO 3 lysineAl(OH) 3 when compared with the control group. Particularly, since magnesium hydroxide shows a 11% more excellent stabilizing effect than Na 2 HPO 4 , the secondary effective stabilizer, it is recognized that magnesium hydroxide is a selectively excellent stabilizer for the active ingredient of the present invention. On the other hand, in the case of the known omeprazole, the tested stabilizers show a stabilizing effect in the order of Na 2 HPO 4 NaHCO 3 Mg(OH) 2 arginineNa 2 CO 3 K 2 HPO 4 Al(OH) 3 histidineK 2 CO 3 lysineKHCO 3 . Therefore, such results suggest that the same alkali compound may exhibit a different stabilizing effect depending on the active ingredient to be stabilized and that magnesium hydroxide is particularly suitable for the active ingredient of the present invention. Further, the results represented in Table 1 suggest that the water-solubility (i.e., hygroscopicity) and alkalizing ability of the stabilizers have some close relation with the stabilizing ability thereof. Thus, it can be seen that one of the essential aspects to be considered when a stabilizer for a certain compound is selected is the water-solubility of the stabilizer. EXAMPLE 2 Determination of Suitable Amount of the Stabilizer After the stabilizer is selected based on the results of Table 1, the suitable amount to be used should be determined. Therefore, in order to determine the suitable amount, the present inventors mixed the active ingredient of the present invention (IY-81149) with the respective stabilizers in ratios represented below, and then stored the mixtures for 15 days under an accelerative condition (40 C., relative humidity of 75%).

That is, the water-solubility of a stabilizer is related to the hygroscopic property of the stabilizer, which in turn exerts a considerable influence on the stability of the active ingredient since the ingredient is very sensitive to the ambient moisture. Therefore, the amount of the stabilizer to be used should be determined upon considering the hygroscopicity of the stabilizer. From the results of Table 2, it can be seen that the suitable amount of the stabilizer based on its water-solubility ranges from 0.2 to 7.0 times molar amount with respect to the active ingredient of the present invention since the desired stabilizing effect cannot be obtained in an amount of less than 0.2 times molar amount, and the increased hygroscopicity of the stabilizer may act as an obstacle for the formulation in an amount of more than 7.0 times molar amount. EXAMPLE 3 Preparation of Microgranule Using Water-Soluble Polymer as a Binding Agent Microgranules were prepared according to the information represented in the following Table 3 using the stabilizers in a mole ratio of 1:1 with respect to the active ingredient (IY-81149) and using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose as a binding agent. A fluidized-bed granulator (SFC-MINI, FREUND. CO., LTD., Japan) by which the contact with the ambient moisture can be excluded and preparation and dryness of the granule can be simultaneously carried out in a short time was used. That is, the active ingredient and stabilizer were introduced into a chamber of the fluidized-bed granulator in the amounts shown in Table 3. Then, the binding agent-containing solution was sprayed under the influx air temperature (65 C.) of the chamber, during which the mixture of the active ingredient and stabilizer in the chamber was maintained at a temperature of 40 C. or less. The binding agent was used in an amount of 7% by weight with respect to the granule finally obtained, and the solvent water was used in an amount to dilute the binding agent by 15 times. Also, the total amount of the active ingredient and stabilizer to be introduced into the chamber was adjusted to 300 g. The average particle diameter of the microgranule prepared by appropriately controlling the spray rate and temperature was 0.8 mm. This granule was stored for 15 days and 8 weeks, respectively, under an accelerative condition (40 C., relative humidity of 75%). Then, the content of the active ingredient was analyzed according to the same manner as Example 1. The results are shown in the following Table 3.

Also, the binding agent is proven to exhibit a kind of coating effect, which optimizes the stability of the active ingredient. Therefore, it is expected that such a granule form through which the stability of the active ingredient of the present invention is optimized may be utilized very advantageously when it is industrially stored or distributed at room temperature.

PRIOR ART An EL device using an organic substance is expected to have a great promise as a solid light-emitting inexpensive large-screen, full-color display device, and developments thereof are being made in many ways. Generally, an EL device is composed of a light-emitting layer and a pair of facing electrodes sandwiching the light-emitting layer. The light emission of an EL device is the following phenomenon. When an electric field is applied between the two electrodes, the cathode injects electrons into the light-emitting layer, and the anode injects holes into the light-emitting layer. When the electrons recombine with the holes in the light-emitting layer, their energy level shifts back to a valence bond band to release energy as light. As compared with inorganic EL devices, conventional organic EL devices require high voltage, and their light emission brightness and light emission efficiency are low. Further, conventional organic EL devices deteriorate in properties to a great extent, and no organic EL device has been put to practical use. There has been recently proposed an organic EL device which is produced by laminating a thin film containing an organic compound having a fluorescent quantum effect of emitting light at a low voltage as low as less than 10 V, and it attracts attention (Appl. Phy. Lett., Vol. 51, page 913, 1987). The above organic EL device has a light-emitting layer containing a metal chelate complex and a hole-injecting layer containing an amine-based compound, and emits green light having a high brightness. The above organic EL device achieves nearly practically usable performance, since it accomplishes a brightness of 1,000 cd/m 2 and a maximum light emission efficiency of 1.5 lm/W at a direct current voltage of 6 or 7V. However, conventional organic EL devices including the above organic EL device are not yet satisfactory in brightness although these organic EL devices are improved in brightness to some extent. Further, they have a serious problem that their stability is insufficient in their continuous operation for a long period of time. That is because, for example, a metal chelate complex such as a tris(8-hydroxyquinolinate)-aluminum complex, or the like, is chemically unstable when an electric field is applied for light emission, is poor in adhesion to a cathode and extremely deteriorates in a short period of emission. For the above reasons, it is desired to develop a light-emitting material having an excellent light emission capacity and durability for developing an organic EL device which has a high light emission brightness and a high light emission efficiency and can perform a light emission in its continuous operation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide an organic EL device having a high light emission brightness and having excellent stability in the continuous operation. The present inventors have made diligent studies for achieving the above object, and have found that an organic EL device having a light-emitting layer for which the material of any one of the formulae 1, 4 and 5 is adapted has a high light emission brightness and a high light emission efficiency and has excellent stability in the continuous operation. On the basis of the above finding, the present invention has been completed.

The following Table 3 specifically shows typical examples of the light-emitting material of the present invention, while the present invention shall not be limited by these Examples. TABLE 3 compound Chemical structure (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) (59) (60) (61) (62) (63) (64) (65) (66) (67) (68) (69) (70) (71) (72) (73) (74) (75) (76) (77) (78) (79) (80) (81) (82) (83) (84) The light-emitting material of the present invention (compounds of the present invention) is a compound having intense fluorescence in a solid state, and is excellent in electric-field-applied light emission characteristic. Further, the light-emitting material of the present invention is excellent in the characteristic of injection of holes from a metal electrode and the property of transportation of holes, and it is also excellent in the characteristics of injection of electrons from a metal electrode and the property of transportation of electrons. It can be therefore effectively used as a light-emitting material, and further, it can be used in combination with other hole-transporting material, an electron-transporting material or a dopant without any problem. An organic EL device is a device having a structure in which a mono- or multi-layered organic thin layer is formed between an anode and a cathode. In a mono-layered device, a light-emitting layer is formed between the anode and the cathode. The light-emitting layer contains a light-emitting material, and in addition thereto, it may contain a hole-injecting material for transporting holes injected from the anode to the light-emitting material, or an electron-injecting material for transporting electrons injected from the cathode to the light-emitting material. The light-emitting material of the present invention has a remarkably high light emission quantum efficiency, high capability of transporting holes and high capability of transporting electrons and can form a uniform thin film. The light-emitting layer can be therefore formed of the light-emitting material of the present invention alone. A multi-layered organic EL device has one of laminated-layer structures, for example, of (anode/hole-injecting zone/light-emitting layer/cathode), (anode/light-emitting layer/electron-injecting layer/zone) and (anode/hole-injecting zone/light-emitting layer/electron-injecting zone/cathode). The light-emitting material of the present invention (compounds of the present invention) can be used in a light-emitting layer due to its characteristic of high light emission, property of injecting holes, capability of transporting holes and property of injecting electrons and capability of transporting electrons. In addition to the material of the present invention, the light-emitting layer may contain a known light-emitting material, a known dopant, a known hole-injecting material or a known electron-injecting material as required. In the organic EL device, a decrease in the brightness and life caused by quenching can be prevented by forming it as a multi-layered structure. The light-emitting material, a dopant, a hole-injecting material and an electron-injecting material may be used in combination as required. Further, a dopant can improve the light emission brightness and the light emission efficiency, and can attain the red or blue light emission. Further, each of the hole-injecting zone, the light-emitting layer and the electron-injecting zone may have the layer structure of at least two layers. In the hole-injecting zone in this case, a layer to which holes are injected from an electrode is called hole-injecting layer, and a layer which receives holes from the hole-injecting layer and transport the holes to a light-emitting layer is called hole-transporting layer. In the electron-injecting zone, a layer to which electrons are injected from an electrode is called electron-injecting layer, and a layer which receives electrons from the electron-injecting layer and transports the electrons to a light-emitting layer is called electron-transporting layer. These layers are selected and used depending upon factors such as the energy level and heat resistance of materials and adhesion to an organic layer or metal electrode. The light-emitting material or the dopant which may be used in the light-emitting layer together with the light-emitting material of the present invention includes anthracene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, tetracene, coronene, chrysene, fluorescein, perylene, phthaloperylene, naphthaloperylene, perinone, phthaoperinone, naphthaloperinone, diphenylbutadiene, tetraphenylbutadiene, coumarine, oxadiazole, aldazine, bisbenzoxazoline, bisstyryl, pyrazine, cyclopentadiene, quinoline metal complex, aminoquinoline metal complex, benzoquinoline metal complex, imine, diphenylethylene, vinyl anthracene, diaminocarbazole, pyran, thiopyran, polymethine, merocyanine, an imidazole-chelated oxynoid compound, quinacridone, rubrene, and fluorescent dyestuffs for a dyestuff laser or for brightening, although the above material shall not be limited to these.

In the organic EL device of the present invention, the light-emitting layer may contain, in addition to the light-emitting material of the present invention, at least one of other light-emitting material, other dopant, other hole-injecting material and other electron-injecting material. For improving the organic EL device of the present invention in the stability against temperature, humidity and ambient atmosphere, a protective layer may be formed on the surface of the device, or the device as a whole may be sealed with a silicone oil, or the like. The electrically conductive material used for the anode of the organic EL device is suitably selected from those materials having a work function of greater than 4 eV. The electrically conductive material includes carbon, aluminum, vanadium, iron, cobalt, nickel, tungsten, silver, gold, platinum, palladium, alloys of these, metal oxides such as tin oxide and indium oxide used for ITO substrates or NESA substrates, and organic electroconducting polymers such as polythiophene and polypyrrole. The electrically conductive material used for the cathode is suitably selected from those having a work function of smaller than 4 eV. The electrically conductive material includes magnesium, calcium, tin, lead, titanium, yttrium, lithium, ruthenium, manganese, aluminum and alloys of these, while the electrically condutive material shall not be limited to these. Examples of the alloys include magnesium/silver, magnesium/indium and lithium/aluminum, while the alloys shall not be limited to these. Each of the anode and the cathode may have a layer structure formed of two layers or more as required. For the effective light emission of the organic EL device, at least one of the electrodes is desirably sufficiently transparent in the light emission wavelength region of the device. Further, the substrate is desirably transparent as well. The transparent electrode is produced from the above electrically conductive material by a deposition method or a sputtering method such that a predetermined light transmittance is secured. The electrode on the light emission surface side preferably has a light transmittance of at least 10%. The substrate is not specially limited so long as it has adequate mechanical and thermal strength and has transparency. For example, it is selected from glass substrates and substrates of transparent resins such as a polyethylene substrate, a polyethylene terephthalate substrate, a polyether sulfone substrate and a polypropylene substrate. In the organic EL device of the present invention, each layer can be formed by any one of dry film forming methods such as a vacuum deposition method, a sputtering method, a plasma method and an ion plating method and wet film forming methods such as a spin coating method, a dipping method and a flow coating method. The thickness of each layer is not specially limited, while each layer is required to have a proper thickness. When the layer thickness is too large, inefficiently, a high voltage is required to achieve predetermined emission of light. When the layer thickness is too small, the layer is liable to have a pinhole, etc., so that sufficient light emission brightness is hard to obtain when an electric field is applied. Generally, the thickness of each layer is preferably in the range of from 5 nm to 10 m, more preferably 10 nm to 0.2 m. In the wet film forming method, a material for forming an intended layer is dissolved or dispersed in a proper solvent such as ethanol, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, and a thin film is formed from the solution or dispersion. The solvent shall not be limited to the above solvents. For improving the film formability and preventing the occurrence of pinholes in any layer, the above solution or dispersion for forming the layer may contain a proper resin and a proper additive. The resin that can be used includes insulating resins such as polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyarylate, polyester, polyamide, polyurethane, polysulfone, polymethyl methacrylate, polymethyl acrylate and cellulose, copolymers of these, photoconductive resins such as poly-N-vinylcarbozole and polysilane, and electroconducting polymers such as polythiophene and polypyrrole. The above additive includes an antioxidant, an ultraviolet absorbent and a plasticizer. When the light-emitting material of the present invention is used in a light-emitting layer of an organic EL device, an organic EL device can be improved in organic EL device characteristics such as light emission efficiency and maximum light emission brightness. Further, the organic EL device of the present invention is remarkably stable against heat and electric current and gives a practically usable light emission brightness at a low actuation voltage. The deterioration which is a big problem of conventional devices can be remarkably decreased. The organic EL device of the present invention has significant industrial values since it can be adapted for a flat panel display of an on-wall television set, a flat light-emitting device, a light source for a copying machine or a printer, a light source for a liquid crystal display or counter, a display signboard and a signal light. The material of the present invention can be used in the fields of an organic EL device, an electrophotographic photoreceptor, a photoelectric converter, a solar cell, an image sensor, and the like.

When the organic EL devices obtained in the above Examples were allowed to continuously emit light at 3 (mA/cm 2 ), all the organic EL devices stably emitted light for more than 1,000 hours, and almost no dark spots were observed. Since the light-emitting materials of the present invention had a very high fluorescence quantum efficiency, the organic EL devices using the light-emitting materials achieved light emission with a high brightness in a low electric current applied region, and when the light-emitting layer used a doping material in addition to the compound of the formula 1, 4 or 5, the organic EL devices were improved in maximum light emission brightness and maximum light emission efficiency. Further, by adding a doping material having a different fluorescent color to the light-emitting material of the present invention, there were obtained light-emitting devices having a different light emission color. The organic EL device of the present invention accomplishes improvements in light emission efficiency and light emission brightness and a longer device life, and does not impose any limitations on a light-emitting material, a dopant, a hole-injecting material, an electron-injecting material, a sensitizer, a resin and an electrode material used in combination and the method of producing the device. The organic EL device using the material of the present invention as a light-emitting material achieves light emission having a high brightness with a high light emission efficiency and a longer life as compared with conventional devices.

The polymer is used as a base resin to formulate a resist composition having a high sensitivity, resolution and etching resistance. This invention relates to (1) a compound having a specific lactone-containing structure, (2) a polymer comprising units of the compound which is blended as a base resin to formulate a resist composition having improved substrate adhesion, adequate penetration of developer, and high etching resistance, and especially suited as micropatterning material for VLSI fabrication, (3) a method for preparing the polymer, (4) a resist composition comprising the polymer, and (5) a patterning method using the resist composition. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION While a number of recent efforts are being made to achieve a finer pattern rule in the drive for higher integration and operating speeds in LSI devices, deep-ultraviolet lithography is thought to hold particular promise as the next generation in microfabrication technology. In particular, photolithography using a KrF or ArF excimer laser as the light source is strongly desired to reach the practical level as the micropatterning technique capable of achieving a feature size of 0.3 m or less. As the base resin in a resist material having high transmittance to light of an excimer laser, especially ArF excimer laser having a wavelength of 193 nm, polyacrylic or polymethacrylic acid derivatives and polymers comprising aliphatic cyclic compounds such as norbornene-maleic anhydride copolymers in the backbone are used. For the base resin used in chemical amplification type resist compositions, not only an acid liability closely related to resolution, but also etching resistance and substrate adhesion are required. In the above-described resins, it is intended to accomplish such distinct characteristics by using a plurality of monomers having different properties to form a complex copolymer. However, these resins are not yet satisfactory on the practical level. More particularly, monomers having as suspending groups polycyclic hydrocarbon groups such as adamantyl, tricyclodecyl and norbornyl are used for imparting etching resistance, and monomers having as suspending groups polar groups such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups are used for imparting substrate adhesion. However, in a system where an extremely hydrophobic monomer for imparting etching resistance and an extremely hydrophilic monomer for imparting substrate adhesion are admixed, it is difficult to effect uniform polymerization reaction. Due to side reaction, homopolymers and undesired block copolymers can form. If the polymer product thus obtained is blended in a resist composition, this resist suffers from drawbacks including uneven dissolution due to in-film delamination, pattern collapse due to peeling of highly hydrophobic sites, and swelling due to random penetration of a liquid developer to highly hydrophilic sites. Even though the etching resistance is improved, the resolution of the resist is extremely reduced. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the invention is to provide (1) a lactone-containing compound capable of forming a polymer possessing a well-balanced profile of etching resistance and substrate adhesion, (2) a polymer comprising units of the compound which is blended as a base resin to formulate a resist composition having significantly improved resolution and etching resistance over prior art compositions, (3) a method for preparing the polymer, (4) a resist composition comprising the polymer as a base resin, and (5) a patterning method using the resist composition. We have found that a novel lactone-containing compound of the general formula (1) obtained by a method to be described later is useful as a starting reactant from which a polymer possessing both etching resistance and substrate adhesion is prepared; that a resist composition using as the base resin a novel polymer obtained from the compound and having a weight average molecular weight of 1,000 to 500,000 is improved in resolution and etching resistance; and that the resist composition is very useful in precise microfabrication. In a first aspect, the invention provides a lactone-containing compound of the following general formula (1): wherein R 1 is hydrogen, methyl or CH 2 CO 2 R 5 , R 2 is hydrogen, methyl or CO 2 R 5 , R 3 is a straight, branched or cyclic alkyl group of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, R 4 is hydrogen or CO 2 R 5 , R 5 is a straight, branched or cyclic alkyl group of 1 to 15 carbon atoms, and X is CH 2 , CH 2 CH 2 , O or S. In a second aspect, the invention provides a polymer comprising units of the following general formula (1a) and having a weight average molecular weight of 1,000 to 500,000, wherein R 1 to R 4 and X are as defined above. The polymer may further include units of at least one of the following general formulae (2a) to (10a). Herein, R 1 and R 2 are as defined above, R 6 is hydrogen or a carboxyl or hydroxyl-containing monovalent hydrocarbon group of 1 to 15 carbon atoms, at least one of R 7 to R 10 is a carboxyl or hydroxyl-containing monovalent hydrocarbon group of 1 to 15 carbon atoms, and the remainder are independently hydrogen or a straight, branched or cyclic alkyl group of 1 to 15 carbon atoms, or R 7 to R 10 , taken together, may form a ring, and when they form a ring, at least one of R 7 to R 10 is a carboxyl or hydroxyl-containing divalent hydrocarbon group of 1 to 15 carbon atoms, and the remainder are independently a single bond or a straight, branched or cyclic alkylene group of 1 to 15 carbon atoms, R 11 is a monovalent hydrocarbon group of 3 to 15 carbon atoms containing a CO 2 partial structure, at least one of R 12 to R 15 is a monovalent hydrocarbon group of 2 to 15 carbon atoms containing a CO 2 partial structure, and the remainder are independently hydrogen or a straight, branched or cyclic alkyl group of 1 to 15 carbon atoms, or R 12 to R 15 , taken together, may form a ring, and when they form a ring, at least one of R 12 to R 15 is a divalent hydrocarbon group of 1 to 15 carbon atoms containing a CO 2 partial structure, and the remainder are independently a single bond or a straight, branched or cyclic alkylene group of 1 to 15 carbon atoms, R 16 is a polycyclic hydrocarbon group of 7 to 15 carbon atoms or an alkyl group containing such a polycyclic hydrocarbon group, R 17 is an acid labile group, and k is equal to 0 or 1. In a third aspect, the invention provides a method for preparing a polymer, comprising effecting radical or anionic polymerization between a lactone-containing compound of the general formula (1) and another compound having a carbon-to-carbon double bond. In a fourth aspect, the invention provides a resist composition comprising the polymer defined above. Preferably, the resist composition further includes a photoacid generator capable of generating an acid upon exposure to high-energy radiation or electron beams, and an organic solvent. In a fifth aspect, the invention provides a method for forming a resist pattern comprising the steps of (i) applying the resist composition onto a substrate to form a film, (ii) heat treating the film and then exposing it to high-energy radiation or electron beams through a photo mask, and (iii) optionally heat treating the exposed film and developing it with a developer. The polymer or high molecular weight compound comprising units of the lactone-containing compound of formula (1) has a high etching resistance and sufficient substrate adhesion and eliminates the drawbacks of prior art resist materials including uneven dissolution due to in-film delamination, pattern collapse due to peeling of highly hydrophobic sites, and swelling due to random penetration of a liquid developer to highly hydrophilic sites. The lactone-containing compound of formula (1) possesses both polarity attributable to the lactone structure and rigidity attributable to the fused tricyclic structure within a common molecule. When copolymerization is effected using this lactone-containing compound, there is obtained a uniform polymer exhibiting a satisfactory dissolution behavior in that separation between hydrophilic sites and hydrophobic sites does not occur as a matter of principle. In the polymer thus obtained, lactone sites can move relatively freely at a position spaced apart from the backbone so that a degree of substrate adhesion corresponding to the amount of lactone introduced may be effectively exerted. Not only the rigidity of the fused tricyclic structure imparts a sufficient etching resistance to the polymer, but its hydrophobic property moderately mitigates the affinity of lactone sites to a liquid developer, thereby avoiding swelling by excessive penetration of the developer and achieving an improvement in the rectangularity of a pattern. Accordingly, a resist composition having the polymer blended therein as the base resin forms a resist pattern having improved rectangularity and is etching resistance and free of peeling.

The photoacid generator is added in an amount of about 0.1 to 15 parts, and especially about 0.5 to 8 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the base resin (all parts are by weight, hereinafter). Less than 0.1 part of the photoacid generator would provide a poor sensitivity whereas more than 15 parts of the photoacid generator would lower the rate of alkali dissolution to reduce the resolution of resist compositions and also lower the heat resistance because of the excessive presence of lower molecular weight components.

Illustrative, non-limiting, examples of the organic solvent include ketones such as cyclohexanone and methyl-2-n-amylketone; alcohols such as 3-methoxybutanol, 3-methyl-3-methoxybutanol, 1-methoxy-2-propanol, and 1-ethoxy-2-propanol; ethers such as propylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, propylene glycol dimethyl ether, and diethylene glycol dimethyl ether; and esters such as propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, propylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, ethyl lactate, ethyl pyruvate, butyl acetate, methyl 3-methoxypropionate, ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate, tert-butyl acetate, tert-butyl propionate, and propylene glycol mono-tert-butyl ether acetate. These solvents may be used alone or in combinations of two or more thereof. Of the above organic solvents, it is recommended to use diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and 1-ethoxy-2-propanol because the photoacid generator serving as one of the resist components is most soluble therein, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate because it is a safe solvent, or a mixture thereof. An appropriate amount of the organic solvent used is about 200 to 1,000 parts, especially about 400 to 800 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the base resin.

R 004 is hydrogen or a monovalent hydrocarbon group of 1 to 15 carbon atoms having a carboxyl or hydroxyl group. At least one of R 005 to R 008 represents a monovalent hydrocarbon group of 1 to 15 carbon atoms having a carboxyl or hydroxyl group while the remaining Rs independently represent hydrogen or a straight, branched or cyclic alkyl group of 1 to 15 carbon atoms. Alternatively, R 005 to R 008 , taken together, may form a ring, and in that event, at least one of R 005 to R 008 is a divalent hydrocarbon group of 1 to 15 carbon atoms having a carboxyl or hydroxyl group, while the remaining Rs are independently single bonds or straight, branched or cyclic alkylene groups of 1 to 15 carbon atoms.

At least one of R 010 to R 013 is a monovalent hydrocarbon group of 2 to 15 carbon atoms containing a CO 2 partial structure, while the remaining Rs are independently single bonds or hydrogen or straight, branched or cyclic alkyl groups of 1 to 15 carbon atoms.

The inventive polymer and the other polymer are preferably blended in a weight ratio from 10:90 to 90:10, more preferably from 20:80 to 80:20. If the blend ratio of the inventive polymer is below this range, the resist composition would become poor in some of the desired properties. The properties of the resist composition can be adjusted by properly changing the blend ratio of the inventive polymer. The polymer is not limited to one type and a mixture of two or more other polymers may be added. The use of plural polymers allows for easy adjustment of resist properties. Dissolution inhibitor To the resist composition, a dissolution inhibitor may be added. The dissolution inhibitor is a compound having on the molecule at least two phenolic hydroxyl groups, in which an average of from 0 to 100 mol % of all the hydrogen atoms on the phenolic hydroxyl groups are replaced with acid labile groups or a compound having on the molecule at least one carboxyl group, in which an average of 80 to 100 mol % of all the hydrogen atoms on the carboxyl groups are replaced with acid labile groups, both the compounds having an average molecular weight within a range of 100 to 1,000, and preferably 150 to 800. The degree of substitution of the hydrogen atoms on the phenolic hydroxyl groups or carboxyl groups with acid labile groups is on average at least 0 mol %, and preferably at least 30 mol %, of all the phenolic hydroxyl groups or carboxyl groups. The upper limit is 100 mol %, and preferably 80 mol %. Preferable examples of such compounds having two or more phenolic hydroxyl groups or compounds having a carboxyl group include those of formulas (D1) to (D14) below. In these formulas, R 201 and R 202 are each hydrogen or a straight or branched alkyl or alkenyl of 1 to 8 carbon atoms; R 203 is hydrogen, a straight or branched alkyl or alkenyl of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or (R 207 ) h COOH; R 204 is (CH 2 ) i (where i2 to 10), an arylene of 6 to 10 carbon atoms, carbonyl, sulfonyl, an oxygen atom, or a sulfur atom; R 205 is an alkylene of 1 to 10 carbon atoms, an arylene of 6 to 10 carbon atoms, carbonyl, sulfonyl, an oxygen atom, or a sulfur atom; R 206 is hydrogen, a straight or branched alkyl or alkenyl of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or a hydroxyl-substituted phenyl or naphthyl; R 207 is a straight or branched alkylene of 1 to 10 carbon atoms; R 208 is hydrogen or hydroxyl; the letter ; is an integer from 0 to 5; u and h are each 0 or 1; s, t, s, t, s, and t are each numbers which satisfy st8, st5, and st4, and are such that each phenyl skeleton has at least one hydroxyl group; and a is number such that the molecular weight of the compounds of formula (D8) or (D9) is from 100 to 1,000.

In these formulas, R L01 to R L16a , m and n are as defined and exemplified above. The dissolution inhibitor may be formulated in an amount of 0 to 50 parts, preferably 5 to 50 parts, and more preferably 10 to 30 parts, per 100 parts of the base resin, and may be used singly or as a mixture of two or more thereof. Less than 5 parts of the dissolution inhibitor may fail to yield an improved resolution, whereas the use of more than 50 parts would lead to thinning of the patterned film, and thus a decline in resolution. The dissolution inhibitor can be synthesized by introducing acid labile groups into a compound having phenolic hydroxyl or carboxyl groups in accordance with an organic chemical formulation.

Other components In the resist composition, a compound bearing a CCOOH group in a molecule may be blended. Exemplary, non-limiting compounds bearing a CCOOH group include one or more compounds selected from Groups I and II below. Including this compound improves the PED stability of the resist and ameliorates edge roughness on nitride film substrates. Group I: Compounds in which some or all of the hydrogen atoms on the phenolic hydroxyl groups of the compounds of general formulas (A1) to (A10) below are replaced with R 401 COOH (wherein R 401 is a straight or branched alkylene of 1 to 10 carbon atoms), and in which the molar ratio C/(CD) of phenolic hydroxyl groups (C) to CCOOH groups (D) in the molecule is from 0.1 to 1.0.

The resist composition of the invention may additionally include an acetylene alcohol derivative for the purpose of enhancing the shelf stability. Preferred acetylene alcohol derivaatives are those having the general formula (S1) or (S1) below. In the formulas, R 501 , R 502 , R 503 , R 504 , and R 505 are each hydrogen or a straight, branched, or cyclic alkyl of 1 to 8 carbon atoms; and X and Y are each 0 or a positive number, satisfying 0X30, 0Y30, and 0XY40.

The acetylene alcohol derivative is preferably added in an amount of 0.01 to 2% by weight, and more preferably 0.02 to 1% by weight, per 100% by weight of the resist composition. Less than 0.01% by weight would be ineffective for improving coating characteristics and shelf stability, whereas more than 2% by weight would result in a resist having a low resolution. The resist composition of the invention may include, as an optional ingredient, a surfactant which is commonly used for improving the coating characteristics. Optional ingredients may be added in conventional amounts so long as this does not compromise the objects of the invention. Nonionic surfactants are preferred, examples of which include perfluoroalkylpolyoxyethylene ethanols, fluorinated alkyl esters, perfluoroalkylamine oxides, perfluoroalkyl EO-addition products, and fluorinated organosiloxane compounds. Useful surfactants are commercially available under the trade names Florade FC-430 and FC-431 from Sumitomo 3M K.K., Surflon S-141 and S-145 from Asahi Glass K.K., Unidine DS-401, DS-403 and DS-451 from Daikin Industry K.K., Megaface F-8151 from Dai-Nippon Ink Chemicals K.K., and X-70-092 and X-70-093 from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd. Preferred surfactants are Florade FC-430 from Sumitomo 3M K.K. and X-70-093 from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd. Pattern formation using the resist composition of the invention may be carried out by a known lithographic technique. For example, the resist composition is applied onto a substrate such as a silicon wafer by spin coating or the like to form a resist film having a thickness of 0.3 to 2.0 m, which is then pre-baked on a hot plate at 60 to 150 C. for 1 to 10 minutes, and preferably at 80 to 120 C. for 1 to 5 minutes. A patterning mask having the desired pattern is then placed over the resist film, and the film exposed through the mask to an electron beam or to high-energy radiation such as deep-UV rays, an excimer laser, or x-rays in a dose of about 1 to 200 mJ/cm 2 , and preferably about 10 to 100 mJ/cm 2 , then post-exposure baked (PEB) on a hot plate at 60 to 150 C. for 1 to 5 minutes, and preferably at 80 to 130 C. for 1 to 3 minutes. Finally, development is carried out using as the developer an aqueous alkali solution, such as a 0.1 to 5% (preferably 2 to 3%) aqueous solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), this being done by a conventional method such as dipping, puddling, or spraying for a period of 0.1 to 3 minutes, and preferably 0.5 to 2 minutes. These steps result in the formation of the desired pattern on the substrate. Of the various types of high-energy radiation that may be used, the resist composition of the invention is best suited to fine pattern formation with, in particular, deep-UV rays having a wavelength of 193 to 248 nm, an excimer laser, x-rays, or an electron beam. The desired pattern may not be obtainable outside the upper and lower limits of the above range. The resist composition comprising the polymer of the invention as a base resin lends itself to micropatterning with electron beams or deep-UV rays since it is sensitive to high-energy radiation and has excellent sensitivity, resolution, and etching resistance. Especially because of the minimized absorption at the exposure wavelength of an ArF or KrF excimer laser, a finely defined pattern having sidewalls perpendicular to the substrate can easily be formed.

Examples I-1 to T-70 Evaluation of resist resolution Resist compositions were formulated using Polymers 1 to 40 obtained in the above Synthetic Examples and examined for resolution. Resist compositions were prepared by using Polymers 1 to 40 or Polymers 41 to 42 shown below as a base resin, and dissolving the polymer, a photoacid generator (designated as PAG 1 to 8), a dissolution inhibitor (designated as DRR 1 to 4), a basic compound, and a compound having a CCOOH group in the molecule (ACC 1) in a solvent containing 0.05% by weight of surfactant Florade FC-430 (Sumitomo 3M) in the combination shown in Tables 1 to 3. These compositions were each filtered through a 0.2 m Teflon filter, thereby giving resist solutions. The solvents and basic compounds used are as follows. PGMEA: propylene glycol methyl ether acetate PG/EL: a mixture of 70% PGMEA and 30% ethyl lactate TBA: tributylamine TEA: triethanolamine TMMEA: trismethoxymethoxyethylamine TMEMEA: trismethoxyethoxymethoxyethylamine These resist solutions were spin-coated onto silicon wafers, then baked at 110 C. for 90 seconds on a hot plate to give resist films having a thickness of 0.5 m. The resist films were exposed using an ArF excimer laser stepper (Nikon Corporation; NA 0.55), then baked (PED) at 110 C. for 90 seconds, and developed with a solution of 2.38% tetramethylammonium hydroxide in water, thereby giving positive patterns. The resulting resist patterns were evaluated as described below. First, the sensitivity (Eth, mJ/cm 2 ) was determined. Next, the optimal dose (sensitivity Eop, mJ/cm 2 ) was defined as the dose which provides a 1:1 resolution at the top and bottom of a 0.25 m line-and-space pattern, and the resolution of the resist under evaluation was defined as the minimum line width (m) of the lines and spaces that separated at this dose. The shape of the resolved resist pattern was examined under a scanning electron microscope. The composition and test results of the resist materials are shown in Tables 1 to 3.

The resulting optically active hydroxamic acid can be converted to the corresponding optically active primary amines by a Lossen rearrangement. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The invention relates to the enzymatic synthesis of optically active hydroxamic acids and to their conversion to optically active primary amines by a Lossen rearrangement. 2. Background of the Prior Art Hydroxamic acids are compounds of great pharmaceutical interest. Hydroxamic acid derivatives exist which have antibacterial and fungicidal properties (Duda et al., 1965; Hase et al., 1971). Alkylaminopropionohydroxamic acids exhibit hypotensive properties (Coutts et al., 1971). Hypocholesterolaemic actions have also been demonstrated for hydroxamic acids (Ludwig et al., 1967). p-Butoxyphenylacetohydroxamic acid possesses an anti-inflammatory action (Dell et al., 1971) and is used in human medicine. Some hydroxamic acids have been studied for their efficacy against malaria (Hynes, 1970; Hynes Hack, 1972). Enantiomerically pure hydroxamic acids, however, are of particular importance. Their pharmacological activity is higher than that of the racemates. Furthermore, via the Lossen rearrangement, they also open up a new route to chiral primary amines. This class of substances is pharmacologically of great importance as well. Thus chiral -amino alcohols, for example, are used in large amounts as -adrenoceptor antagonists, abbreviated to -blockers. However, the preparation of enantiomerically pure hydroxamic acids by the conventional methods of organic chemistry is expensive. It normally requires a racemate separation or the use of metal-organic catalysts, but the latter are generally unsuitable for the preparation of drugs. Such methods are described for example in DE-PS 2 400 531, EP-A-203 379 and EP-A-268 215. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the invention is therefore to provide a novel method of preparing optically active hydroxamic acids which is not associated with the above-mentioned problems. Surprisingly it has now been found that amides, carboxylic acid esters and carboxylic acids which have a centre of chirality on the -carbon atom can be enantioselectively converted to optically active hydroxamic acids by acyltransferases in the presence of hydroxylamine. The invention therefore provides a method of preparing optically active hydroxamic acids of the general formula wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are different and are a cyclic or linear, aliphatic or aromatic, substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon radical which can optionally contain heteroatoms, said method being characterized in that a racemate of chiral amides, carboxylic acid esters or carboxylic acids of the general formula wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are as defined above and X is NH 2 , OR or OH, R being any organic radical, is reacted with hydroxylamine, NH 2 OH, in the presence of an acyltransferase, and the optically active hydroxamic acid (I) formed is then separated from the unconverted enantiomer of general formula (II). BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a graph plotting, against the reaction time in minutes, the concentration in mM of phenylacetohydroxamic acid (), acetohydroxamic acid () and phenylacetic acid () formed in a representative process of the invention reacting acetamide and phenylacetamide with hydroxylamine in the presence of an acyltransferase from quiescent cells of Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50; FIG. 2 is a graph plotting, against the reaction time in minutes, the concentration in mM of phenylacetohydroxamic acid (), acetohydroxamic acid () and phenylacetic acid () formed in a representative process of the invention reacting acetamide and phenylacetamide with hydroxylamine in the presence of an acyltransferase from a crude extract of Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50; and FIG. 3 is a graph depicting the formation of 2-phenylpropionohydroxamic acid () in mM for the reaction of (R,S)-2-phenylpropionamide () with hydroxylamine in the presence of acyltransferase recovered from Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50, with racemic 2-phenylpropionamide () as the model substrate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION, PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS AND BEST MODE Suitable acyltransferases, i.e. enzymes which transfer the acyl radical to the hydroxylamine, are known per se. They can be isolated for example from the following microorganisms: Mycobacteriaceae, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Arthrobacter, Aspergillus nidulans, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Brevibacterium sp. R312, Methylophilus methylotrophus, Pseudomonas chlororaphis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Rhodococcus rhodochrous Ji and Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50. The microorganism Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 was deposited with DSMZ (Deutsche Samnilung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH) Mascheroder Weg 1b, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany, on Jan. 16, 1995, and assigned DSMZ Accession No. 9675. The acyltransferase isolated from Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 is found to be very particularly suitable. Of all the amidases studied, this one had the highest specific activities and the broadest substrate spectrum. Amidase and acyltransferase activity can be found in the same enzyme. The amidase activity is high too, but the acyltransferase activity is markedly higher, probably because hydroxylamine is a better acyl radical acceptor than water. Thus, by using this special acyltransferase, i.e. the acyltransferase isolated from Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50, hydrolysis of the amides and esters used as starting materials can be extensively avoided. The method according to the invention can be carried out using either a crude extract of the acyltransferase from said microorganisms or a purified form. Using the crude extract has the advantage that the enzyme purification step can be dispensed with. For special applications, however, it is recommended to use purified acyltransferase. In particular, it is found that the catalytic activity of the purified acyltransferase is higher than that of the crude extract, so chemically inert starting materials are preferably reacted with the purified acyltransferase. The recovery and purification of the acyltransferase from Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 is described in Purification and properties of an amidase from Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 which enantioselectively hydrolyzes 2-aryilpropionamides, B. Hirrlinger, A. Stolz H. -J. Knackmuss, Journal of Bacteriology, 1996, vol. 178(12), pp. 3501-3507. The cells or the purified enzyme can be used directly or in immobilized form. Immobilization enables the biocatalyst to have multiple uses and simplifies the working-up of the reaction mixture. Within the framework of the present invention, whole cells or purified enzyme are immobilized by methods known per se. Whole cells are immobilized e.g. with alginate, -carrageenan, polyurethane or polyacrylamides (I. Chibata, T. Tosa T. Sato, 1983, Immobilized Cells in Preparation of Fine Chemicals, Advances In Biotechnological Processes (A. R. Liss, editor), volume 1, pp. 203-222. Purified enzyme is immobilized either by adsorption onto suitable supports (Clite, cellulose), by ionic binding to an ion exchanger resin (DEAE-cellulose, Sephadex), by covalent bonding to a carrier (porous glass beads, cellulose, dextran, agarose) or by inclusion in a gel (alginate, agar, polyacrylamide) (O. R. Zaborsky, 1973, Immobilized Enzymes, CRC Press, Cleveland, Ohio; M. D. Trevan, 1980, Immobilized Enzymes: Introduction and Applications in Biotechnology, Wiley, New York; W. Hartmeier, 1986, Immobilisierte Biokatalysatoren (Immobilized Biocatalysts), Springer, Berlin). As the method according to the invention is an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the pH of the reaction medium is to be taken into consideration. It should generally be in the pH range 5.5 to 9 and preferably in the pH range 6.5 to 7.5. Suitable buffer systems, such as sodium phosphate buffer and Tris/HCl buffer, can be used for this purpose. In principle, it is possible to use any amides, carboxylic acid esters and carboxylic acids as starting materials for the preparation of the desired hydroxamic acids, provided that the carbon atom adjacent to the carbonyl carbon, i.e. the -carbon atom, is chiral. This means that the substituents present on this carbon atom have to be different. These substituents can be any cyclic or linear, aliphatic or aromatic, substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbon radicals and can optionally contain heteroatoms such as oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc. Substituents such as methyl, ethyl, n-pentyl, isopropyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl and naphthyl are found to be particularly suitable. Particularly suitable starting materials are therefore alkylaminopropionic acid, p-butoxyphenylacetic acid, 2-phenylpropionic acid, 2- (6-methoxy-2-naphthyl) propionic acid (naproxen), 2-(3-benzoylphenyl)propionic acid (ketoprofen), 2-methylbutanoic acid, 2-(1-naphthyl)propionic acid and their esters or amides. In general, it is preferable to use the amides of the compounds covered by general formula (I), being more reactive than the corresponding carboxylic acids or carboxylic acid esters. The concentration of the reactants in the reaction medium is not particularly critical. The compounds of formula (I) are generally used in a concentration of 0.5 to 0.001 mol./l and preferably in a concentration of 0.1 mol./l. The concentration of the hydroxylamine is generally 1.0 to 0.1 mol./l and preferably 0.5 to 0.2 mol./l. The ratio of the compounds of formula (I) to hydroxylamine is therefore generally 1:10 to 1:2 and preferably 1:5. The activity of the acyltransferase is generally 3.5 to 37 units/mg protein and preferably 13 units/mg protein (with 2-phenylpropionamide as substrate). The essential advantage of the method according to the invention is to be regarded as the fact that the acyltransferase selectively catalyzes the conversion of only one enantiomer of the racemate of optically active amides, carboxylic acid esters or carboxylic acids, used as starting material, with hydroxylamine to the corresponding hydroxamic acid, while its mirror image remains unchanged in the reaction. The reaction mixture initially obtained directly after the conversion therefore contains the optically pure hydroxamic acid together with the unconverted enantiomer of the starting material. These two components can easily be separated from one another by shaking the reaction mixture with ethyl acetate, diethyl ether or methylene chloride to extract it, the general procedure being as follows: The aqueous reaction solution is adjusted to pH 10 with sodium hydroxide solution. The amide is extracted with one of the above-mentioned organic solvents. The aqueous phase is then adjusted to pH 2 with hydrochloric acid. The hydroxamic acid is then extracted into the organic phase by shaking and is thereby isolated. The optically active hydroxamic acid recovered in this way can then be converted in a manner known per se, by a Lossen rearrangement, to the corresponding optically active and enantiomerically pure primary amine. The invention therefore also provides a method of preparing optically active primary amines of the general formula wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are as defined above, in which method the optically active hydroxamic acid of general formula (I), obtained as described above, is O-acylated, the O-acylated hydroxamic acid is converted to the corresponding isocyanate by heating or by treatment with bases in aprotic solvents, and the isocyanate is reacted with water to give the amine of general formula (III) with the elimination of CO 2 . The Lossen rearrangement therefore proceeds according to the following reaction scheme: Suitable bases are compounds like NaOH, KOH, NaNH 2 and Na 2 CO 3 the nature of the bases used depending on the structure of the desired hydroxamic acid . Examples of convenient aprotic solvents are toluene, benzene or xylene. To decompose the O-acylated hydroxamic acid as quantitatively and as rapidly as possible, temperatures of 100 C. to 150 C., preferably 100 C., are generally convenient. As the absolute configuration of the -carbon atom of the optically active hydroxamic acid used as starting material is retained in the Lossen rearrangement (cf. Campbell Kenyon, 1946), the primary amines obtained as products of the Lossen rearrangement are also optically active. However, in the method according to the invention for the preparation of optically active primary amines, it is not necessary to remove the unconverted enantiomer of the amides, carboxylic acid esters or carboxylic acids used in the preparation of the optically active hydroxamic acids, after the first enzyme-catalyzed reaction, i.e. it is not necessary to use the pure optically active hydroxamic acid. The reaction can also be carried out in such a way that the racemate of the chiral amides, carboxylic acid esters or carboxylic acids is first reacted with hydroxylamine under enzyme catalysis, and the resulting reaction mixture, which contains the unconverted enantiomer of the starting material together with the optically active hydroxamic acid, is reacted with a carbodiimide under protonic catalysis to form an isocyanate and a corresponding urea derivative as intermediates. The isocyanate then reacts immediately with the water contained in the reaction system to give a carbamic acid, which in turn decomposes to carbon dioxide and the desired optically active primary amine. The amine can then easily be separated from the unconverted enantiomer of the starting material. The reaction with carbodiimide has the advantage that the optically active hydroxamic acid obtained in an aqueous reaction system can immediately be processed further, thereby obviating the need for a purification step. The derivatization with a carbodiimide is necessary because the conventional chemical methods of O-acylating hydroxamic acid can only be carried out in aprotic solvents, which are inconvenient for enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Examples of suitable carbodiimides are 1-benzyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) is found to be particularly convenient. This carbodiimide is described for example in Sheehan, J. C., P. A. Cruickshank G. L. Boshart, 1961, A convenient synthesis of water-soluble carbodiimides, J. Org. Chem. 26, 2525-2528. As an excess of hydroxylamine is generally used in the preparation of the optically active hydroxamic acid, it is convenient to remove the excess hydroxylamine before the reaction mixture is reacted with the carbodiimide. This is done by acidifying the reaction mixture to a pH in the range 0 to 2 and preferably in the region of 1. The hydroxylamine then readily decomposes to ammonium and nitrous oxide (cf. Holleman, A. F. E. Wiberg, 1985, Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie (Textbook of Inorganic Chemistry), edition 91-100, p. 591, Walter de Gruyter Verlag, Berlin, N.Y.). After acidification, the reaction mixture is heated at a temperature in the range 40 C. to 100 C., preferably at 80 C., until no further evolution of gas can be observed. A base, for example sodium hydroxide solution, is then added to the reaction mixture in order to adjust the pH to a value of 4 to 6 and preferably to pH 5.0. The derivatization with the carbodiimide is then-performed according to the following general scheme: wherein R 1 to R 5 are as defined above. If, for example, racemic 2-phenylpropionamide is used as the starting material in the method according to the invention, S()-phenylethylamine and R-2-phenylpropionamide are initially obtained according to the following reaction scheme: The desired optically active primary amine can easily be separated from the unconverted enantiomer of the starting material, a possible procedure being as follows: The aqueous reaction solution is acidified to pH 1 with hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate, diethyl ether or methylene chloride. The amide is now in the organic phase. The pH of the aqueous phase is then brought to 10 with sodium hydroxide solution and the amine is extracted with the solvents mentioned. This procedure affords optically active primary amines, such as S()-phenylethylamine, S-2-aminobutane or S-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine, which would otherwise only be accessible by expensive racemate separation. The invention is illustrated in greater detail by means of the Examples below. The procedure for determining the hydroxamic acids was as follows: As bidentate ligands, hydroxamic acids form stable, intensely coloured chelate complexes with iron(III) ions. These trishydroxamatoiron(III) complexes Fe(RCONHO) 3 have an absorption maximum at 500 nm and have a deep red colour to the eye. This property is utilized for the qualitative determination (Buckles, R. E. C. J. Thelen, 1950, Qualitative determination of carboxylic esters. Scope and limitations of hydroxamic acid test. Anal. Chem. 22, 676-678) and quantitative determination (Brammar, W. J. P. H. Clarke, 1964, Induction and repression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa amidase. J. Gen. Microbiol. 37, 307-319) of hydroxamic acids. The iron complex is obtained by mixing a solution containing hydroxamic acid with an iron(III) chloride solution acidified with hydrochloric acid. The extinction is determined by spectrophotometry in a glass cell at 500 nm. Iron(III) chloride solution (modified according to Hoare, D. G., A. Olson D. E. Koshland JR., 1968. The reaction of hydroxamic acids with water-soluble carbodiimides. A Lossen rearrangement. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 90, 1638-1643): FeCl 3 .6H 2 O 13.51 g conc. hydrochloric acid (12M) 3.33 ml H 2 O ad 500 ml The solution was filtered through a filter of pore size 0.45 m to remove turbidity. 600 l of the iron(III) chloride solution acidified with hydrochloric acid were pipetted into 300 l of a sample containing hydroxamic acid hydroxamic acid dissolved in Tris/HCl buffer (30 mM, pH 7.5). A deep red-coloured iron complex formed immediately. The extinction was determined by spectrophotometry. Calibration lines were plotted with acetohydroxamic acid and 2-phenylpropionohydroxamic acid dissolved in Tris/HCl buffer (30 mM, pH 7.5). These showed a linear dependence between extinction and hydroxamate concentration in the range 0.0 to 1.5 mM hydroxamic acid. The molar extinction coefficients ( max 500 nm) determined for acetohydroxamic acid, phenylacetohydroxamic acid and 2-phenylpropionohydroxamic acid were 3500 lmol. 1 cm 1 and 4500 lmol. 1 cm 1 respectively. Enzymatic activities were determined both by means of HPLC and by photometric methods. The photometric measurements were made at room temperature in 1 ml glass cells with a path length of 1 cm. The specific activity is indicated in enzyme units per mg of protein (U/mg). One unit is the enzymatic activity which catalyzes the conversion of 1 mol. of substrate or the formation of 1 mol. of product in one minute. EXAMPLE 1 Cells of Rhodococcus erythropolis MPSO were grown in ammonium-free mineral medium with succinate (10 mM) as the carbon and energy source, ketoprofenamide (1 mM) as the nitrogen source and 3% of complex medium (NB). At the end of the exponential growth phase, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in Tris/HCl buffer (30 mM, pH 7.5) and resuspended in the same buffer to give an optical density (OD 546 nm) of 16.0. 2.75 ml of Tris/HCl buffer (30 mM, pH 7.5) were placed in each of two 25 ml Erlenmeyer flasks with baffles and 54 mg of phenylacetamide (PAA) or 23.6 mg of acetamide were added. The flasks were then incubated at 30 C. in a vibrating water bath until the PAA or the acetamide had completely dissolved. 1 ml of a freshly prepared hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M), freshly neutralized with NaOH (10 M), was added to each flask. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.25 ml of the cellular suspension to each flask. The total volume was 4 ml. The optical density (OD 546 nm) in the experiment was 1.0. The batch contained 0.1 M amide and 0.5 M hydroxylamine. 0.3 ml aliquots of the cellular suspensions were withdrawn at intervals of 2 min and pipetted into 600 l of an iron(III) chloride solution acidified with hydrochloric acid. The cells were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was diluted again in a ratio of 1 to 10 with iron(III) chloride solution. The extinction was measured at 500 nm and the content of phenylacetohydroxamic acid () or acetohydroxamic acid () was determined by means of the appropriate calibration lines (cf. FIG. 1 ). Corresponding batches without quiescent cells were incubated in parallel in order to exclude the production of hydroxamic acid by a chemical reaction. No hydroxamic acid formation could be detected in the control batches over the observation period of 30 min. In a further batch (total volume 4 ml, OD 546 nm1.0), quiescent cells of the MP50 strain were incubated with PAA (100 mM) without hydroxylamine. 0.3 ml of the cellular suspension was withdrawn every 5 min, the cells were removed by centrifugation and the concentration of phenylacetic acid () was determined by means of HPLC. As shown in FIG. 1 , with acetamide and phenylacetamide (PAA) as substrates in the presence of hydroxylamine, Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 shows an acyltransferase activity which is markedly higher than the specific activity of the cells in the hydrolysis of PAA to the corresponding carboxylic acid. The specific activities for the formation of phenylacetic acid and phenylacetohydroxamic acid were 0.54 and 7.83 U/mg protein respectively. Acetohydroxamic acid was formed with a specific activity of 2.22 U/mg protein. EXAMPLE 2 Since acyltransferase activity could be detected in quiescent cells of the MPSO strain in Example 1, the experiments were repeated with crude extracts from induced cells. Again it was possible to detect acyltransferase activity towards PAA and acetamide in the presence of hydroxylamine (FIG. 2 ). The enzymatic hydrolysis of PAA to phenylacetic acid took place with a specific activity of 0.67 U/mg protein. The specific activities in the formation of phenylacetohydroxamic acid and acetohydroxami.c acid were 7.27 U/mg and 7.80 U/mg protein respectively, i.e. more than ten times higher than in the hydrolysis of PAA. The experimental procedure was as follows: Cells of Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 were grown with ketoprofenamide (1 mM) as the nitrogen source and harvested in the late exponential phase. Crude extract was prepared therefrom. 10 l of the crude extract (6.5 g of protein) were diluted with 640 l of Tris/HCl buffer (30 mM, pH 7.5) in an Eppendorf reaction vessel and mixed with 250 l of a freshly neutralized, aqueous hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M). The reaction was started by the addition of 100 l of a methanolic phenylacetamide solution (PAA, 50 mM) or an acetamide solution (50 mM) in Tris/HCl buffer (30 mM, pH 7.5) and took place at room temperature. The total volume was 1 ml. The concentrations of the amide and the hydroxylamine in the reaction were 5 mM and 0.5 M. 100 l of the batch were withdrawn every two minutes and mixed with 800 l of an iron(III) chloride solution acidified with hydrochloric acid. The strongly acidic solution denatured the protein and stopped the enzymatic reaction. Precipitated protein was centrifuged off and the extinction of the supernatant was determined by spectrophotometry at 500 nm. The concentrations of phenylacetohydroxamic acid () and acetohydroxamic acid () were determined by means of the appropriate calibration lines. To determine the amidase activity, 10 l of crude extract were diluted in 0.89 ml of Tris/HCl buffer (30 mM, pH 7.5). The reaction was started by the addition of 100 l of methanolic PAA solution. The total volume was 1 ml and the PAA concentration was 5 mM. 100 l aliquots of the reaction mixture were pipetted at regular intervals into 10 l of 1 N HCl, precipitated protein was centrifuged off and the phenylacetic acid concentration () was determined by means of HPLC. EXAMPLE 3 An acyltransferase activity could be detected in quiescent: cells and in crude extract of the MPSO strain. It still remained to demonstrate whether the amidase activity and the acyltransferase activity did indeed originate from the same enzyme. The formation of hydroxamic acid with amidase purified to homogeneity proved that acyltransferase and amidase were one and the same enzyme (Table 1). As shown in Table 1 below, the acyltransferase activity towards 2-phenylpropionamide was about three times as high as the amidase activity. The formation of acetohydroxamic acid proceeded four times as rapidly as the saponification to acetic acid, and phenylacetohydroxamic acid was even produced nine times as rapidly as phenylacetic acid. Thus, without exception, the amidase from the MP50 strain showed higher specific activities in the formation of hydroxamic acid than in the hydrolysis of the amides to the carboxylic acids. TABLE 1 Specific activities in the formation of carboxylic acids and hydroxamic acids from carboxamides by means of the purified amidase Spec. activity Substrate Product U/mg protein acetamide acetic acid 0.83 acetamide acetohydroxamic acid 3.54 phenylacetamide phenylacetic acid 4.10 phenylacetamide phenylacetohydroxamic acid 36.61 2-phenylpropion- 2-phenylpropionic acid 4.50 amide 2-phenylpropion- 2-phenylpropionohydroxamic 13.02 amide acid For determination of the acyltransferase activity, 10 l of purified amidase (2.6 g of protein) were diluted with 0.64 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) in an Eppendorf reaction vessel. 0.25 ml of a freshly prepared hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M), neutralized with sodium hydroxide solution, was pipetted in. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.1 ml of a methanolic stock solution (50 mM) of the appropriate amide. Acetamide (50 mM) was dissolved in sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) and then added. The total volume was 1 ml. The concentrations of hydroxylamine and the appropriate amide were 0.5 M and 5 mM respectively. Over a period of 20 min, four 0.1 ml aliquots of the reaction mixture were pipetted into 0.8 ml of iron(III) chloride solution acidified with hydrochloric acid, and the extinction of the hydroxamic acid complex was measured by photometry at 500 nm. The concentration of the hydroxamic acids was determined via the appropriate calibration lines. For determination of the amidase activity, the same amount of protein was diluted in 0.89 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) and the appropriate amide (5 mM) was then added. The concentrations of the carboxylic acids formed were measured by means of HPLC. In the reaction with acetamide, the amount of ammonium liberated was determined by the indophenol method. EXAMPLE 4 The fact that acyltransferases, and especially the acyltransferase recovered from Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50, are active as enantioselective catalysts was demonstrated as follows: Racemic 2-phenylpropionamide (2-PPA) was chosen as the model substrate for the studies. The purified enzyme was incubated with (R,S)-2-PPA (5 mM) in the presence of hydroxylamine (0.5 M), the formation of hydroxamic acid being monitored both by means of photometry and by means of ion pair chromatography. The experiments showed that the formation of hydroxamic acid slowed down drastically after 50% conversion of the substrate (FIG. 3 ). Study of the enzymatically formed 2-phenylpropiono-hydroxamic acid (2-PPHA) by means of a chiral HPLC column showed that only one enantiomer of hydroxamic acid was formed up to 46% conversion of the substrate. The formation of 2-phenylpropionic acid could not be observed in the presence of hydroxylamine. The amidase from the MP50 strain was indeed capable of converting racemic 2-PPA enantioselectively to 2-PPHA. The specific activity at the beginning of the reaction was 9.73 U/mg protein for the formation of hydroxamic acid, so it was somewhat below the maximum attained value of 13.02 U/mg (cf. Table 1) . The marked drop in activity was very clearly observable when 50% of the racemic substrate had been converted. Separation of the enzymatically formed hydroxamic acid by means of a chiral HPLC column showed that only one enantiomer appeared up to 46% conversion. The enantiomeric excess was thus greater than 99%. The experimental procedure was as follows: 10 l of purified amidase (2.6 g of protein) were diluted in 0.64 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) in an Eppendorf reaction vessel and then incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 0.25 ml of a freshly prepared and neutralized hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M). The reaction was started by the addition of 0.1 ml of a methanolic solution of (R,S)-2-PPA (50 mM stock solution). The total volume was 1 ml. The concentration of hydroxylamine was 0.5 M. The initial amide concentration was 5 mM. 50 l aliquots of the reaction mixture were pipetted into 5 l of 1 N HCl at regular intervals. Denatured protein was centrifuged off and the concentrations of amide () and hydroxamic acid () were determined by means of ion pair chromatography. The enantiomeric ratio () of the 2-PPHA was studied with a chiral HPLC column (Chiral-HSA). For this purpose, the 2-PPA and 2-PPHA had to be separated first through a Grom-Sil 120 TMS-2CP prepacked column. EXAMPLE 5 The optically pure 2-phenylpropionohydroxamic acid prepared in Example 4 was converted to the corresponding 1-phenylethylamine, also optically pure, by the following procedure: To remove the excess hydroxylamine, the reaction product obtained in Example 4 was first acidified with 1 N HCl. The pH of the solution was then about 0 to 1. Acidification caused the hydroxylamine to decompose to ammonium and nitrous oxide. This decomposition was assisted by keeping the reaction mixture at 80 C. in a water bath for 10 min. When the evolution of gas had ceased, the pH was readjusted to about 5 with sodium hydroxide solution. About 10 times the amount of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) - based on the 2-phenylpropionohydroxamic acidwas then added. The concentration of the 1-phenylethylamine formed was determined by means of ion pair chromatography and its enantiomeric excess was measured with the aid of a chiral HPLC column (Crownpak CR()). EXAMPLE 6 A reaction was carried out with the same reactants as those described in Example 5 except that, every time the enzymatic formation of hydroxamic acid was supposed to be stopped, a separate batch was started. This was done by diluting 10 l of the purified amidase (1.710 3 mg of protein) with 315 l of sodium phosphate buffer (54 mM, pH 7.5) in an Eppendorf reaction vessel and incubating it with 125 l of a freshly prepared and neutralized hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M). The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of 50 l of a methanolic solution of 2-PPA (50 mM). The total volume of each batch was 0.5 ml. The concentrations of 2-PPA and hydroxylamine were 5 mM and 0.5 M. 10 identical batches were started and were stopped at intervals of 10 min by the addition of 50 l of 1 N HCl. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation and 50 l were withdrawn from the batch for HPLC measurements to determine the concentrations of 2-PPA and 2-PPHA. The remaining 500 l were heated for 10 min at 800C in a water batch in order to boil off the hydroxylamine. After the samples had cooled to room temperature, the pH was adjusted to 4.5 by the addition of 29 l of 1 N NaOH. 9.6 mg of EDC (100 mM) were added and the mixture was heated again for one hour at 80 C. The concentration of the 1-phenylethylamine formed was determined by means of ion pair chromatography, as in Example 3, and its enantiomeric excess was measured with the aid of a chiral HPLC column (Crownpak CR()). EXAMPLE 7 To prepare larger amounts of hydroxamic acid, the initial procedure for recovering the enzymatically active material is as follows: A culture medium for growing Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 is prepared first; it has the following composition: NaHPO 4 .12H 2 O 14.0 g KH 2 PO 4 2.0 g CaCl 2 .2H 2 O 0.005 g Fe(III) citrate.7H 2 O 0.02 g MgSO 4 .7H 2 O 1.0 g Trace element solution SL6 1.0 ml (after Pfennig Lipper, 1966) but without EDTA and FeSO 4 Disodium succinate 1.62 g Nutrient broth solution 30 ml Phenylacetonitrile 0.18 g H 2 O ad 1000 ml 10 ml of this medium were inoculated with 0.1 ml of a liquid culture of Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 on nutrient. broth and incubated overnight in an Erlenmeyer flask with baffles, at 30 C., on a shaker at 150 rpm. This culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of fresh medium in an Erlenmeyer flask with baffles, which was incubated under the same conditions for 18 to 24 h. This culture in turn was used as an inoculum for 700 ml of culture medium in a 3 1 Erlenmeyer flask with notches. The cells were harvested by centrifugation in the late exponential growth phase and used, or fast-frozen at 70 C. and stored at 25 C. Cell digestion, crude extract recovery and enzyme purification are carried out as described in Journal of Bacteriology: B. Hirrlinger, A. Stolz H. -J. Knackmuss (1996), Purification and Properties of an Amidase from Rhodococcus erythropolis MP50 which Enantioselectively Hydrolyzes 2-Arylpropionamides, Journal of Bacteriology 178 (12), pp. 3501-3507. S-2-Phenylpropionohydroxamic acid was then prepared as follows using the enzymatically active material recovered in this way: 125 U of acyltransferase in the form of whole cells, crude extract or purified enzyme were mixed, using a magnetic stirrer, with 3.2 1 of sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) in a wide-mouth Schott flask with a volume of 10 1. 1.25 1 of a freshly prepared aqueous hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M), adjusted to pH 7 with sodium hydroxide solution, were added and the mixture was stirred for 10 min at room temperature. The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of 3.725 g (0.025 mol.) of (R,S)-phenylpropionamide (dissolved in 500 ml of methanol). The course of the reaction was monitored by means of ion pair chromatography. After 120 min, the conversion of the S enantiomer of the amide to the corresponding hydroxamic acid was complete and the cells were removed by centrifugation, or the crude extract or the purified enzyme was denatured by raising the pH to 10 with sodium hydroxide solution, and then centrifuged off. To separate the enzymatically formed S-2-phenylpropiano-hydroxamic acid from the unconverted R-2-phenylpropionamide, the amide was extracted from the alkaline aqueous solution by shaking with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. The aqueous solution was then adjusted to pH 2 with conc. HCl and re-extracted with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. Removal of the organic solvent under vacuum gave 1.9 g (0.012 mol.) of S-2-phenylpropionohydroxamic acid. The enantiomeric excess, determined by means of measurements with a chiral HPLC column, was 99%. EXAMPLE 8 S-2-Phenylpropionohydroxamic acid was prepared as follows using the enzymatically active material prepared as described in Example 7: 125 U of acyltransferase in the form of immobilized whole cells or immobilized purified enzyme were mixed, using a magnetic stirrer, with 3.2 1 of sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) in a wide-mouth Schott flask with a volume of 10 1. 1.25 1 of a freshly prepared aqueous hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M), adjusted to pH 7 with sodium hydroxide solution, were added and the mixture was stirred for 10 min at room temperature. The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of 3.725 g (0.02s mol.) of (R,S)-2-phenylpropionamide (dissolved in 500 ml of methanol). The course of the reaction was monitored by means of ion pair chromatography. After 120 min, the conversion of the S enantiomer of the amide to the corresponding hydroxamic acid was complete and the immobilized cells or the immobilized enzyme were filtered off and stored for subsequent use in sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) at 4 C. To separate the enzymatically formed S-2-phenylpropiono-hydroxamic acid from the unconverted R-2-phenylpropionamide, the aqueous solution was adjusted to pH with sodium hydroxide solution and the amide was extracted from the alkaline aqueous solution by shaking with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. The aqueous solution was then adjusted to pH 2 with conc. HCl and re-extracted with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. Removal of the organic solvent under vacuum gave 1.9 g (0.012 mol.) of S-2-phenylpropionohydroxamic acid. The enantiomeric excess, determined by means of measurements with a chiral HPLC column, was 99%. EXAMPLE 9 After O-acylation, the enantiomerically pure hydroxamic acids recovered by the methods described in Examples 7 to 9 can be converted to the isocyanate by heating or by treatment with bases in aprotic solvents. After the addition of water, the isocyanate forms an unstable carbamic acid, which reacts further to give the primary amine with the elimination of CO 2 . As the Lossen rearrangement proceeds with retention of the configuration at the migrating carbon atom, the products obtained are optically active primary amines. EXAMPLE 10 The following procedure was adopted for the production of chiral primary amines without prior isolation of the hydroxamic acid: 125 U of acyltransferase in the form of whole cells, crude extract or purified enzyme were mixed, using a magnetic stirrer, with 3.2 1 of sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) in a wide-mouth Schott flask with a volume of 10 1. 1.25 1 of a freshly prepared aqueous hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M), adjusted to pH 7 with sodium hydroxide solution, were added and the mixture was stirred for 10 min at room temperature. The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of 3.725 g (0.025 mol.) of (R,S)-2-phenylpropionamide (dissolved in 500 ml of methanol). The course of the reaction was monitored by means of ion pair chromatography. After 120 min, the conversion of the S enantiomer of the amide to the corresponding hydroxamic acid was complete and the cells were removed by centrifugation, or the crude extract or the purified enzyme was denatured by acidification to pH 1 with conc. HCl, and then centrifuged off. To remove the excess hydroxylamine, the aqueous solution was heated for 30 min at 80 C., with stirring. No further evolution of gas due to decomposing hydroxylamine could then be observed. After the solution had cooled to room temperature, its pH was adjusted to 4.5 with sodium hydroxide solution. For derivatization of the hydroxamic acid, 96 g (0.62 mol.) of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide (EDC) were added to the aqueous solution, with stirring, and the solution was then heated for 2 h at 80 C., with stirring. To separate the R-2-phenylpropionamide remaining from the enzymatic reaction from the S-1-phenylethylamine formed in the Lossen rearrangement, the aqueous solution was acidified to pH 1 with conc. HCl and the amide was extracted by shaking with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. The aqueous solution was then adjusted to pH 10 with sodium hydroxide solution and the amine was isolated by shaking with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. Removal of the solvent under vacuum gave 1.2 9 (0.096 mol.) of S-1-phenylethylamine with an enantiomeric excess of 99%. EXAMPLE 11 Analogously to the procedure described in Example 10, S-1-phenylethylamine was prepared as follows, by a Lossen rearrangement, without prior isolation of the corresponding hydroxamic acid: 125 U of acyltransferase in the form of immobilized whole cells or immobilized purified enzyme were mixed, using a magnetic stirrer, with 3.2 1 of sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) in a wide-mouth Schott flask with a volume of 10 1. 1.25 1 of a freshly prepared aqueous hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution (2 M), adjusted to pH 7 with sodium hydroxide solution, were added and the mixture was stirred for 10 min at room temperature. The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of 3.725 g (0.025 mol.) of (R,S)-2-phenylpropionamide (dissolved in 500 ml of methanol). The course of the reaction was monitored by means of ion pair chromatography. After 120 min, the conversion of the S enantiomer of the amide to the corresponding hydroxamic acid was complete and the immobilized cells or the immobilized enzyme were filtered off and stored for subsequent use in sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5) at 4 C. To remove the excess hydroxylamine, the aqueous solution was adjusted to pH 1 with conc. HCl and heated for 30 min at 80 C., with stirring. No further evolution of gas due to decomposing hydroxylamine could then be observed. After the solution had cooled to room temperature, its pH was adjusted to 4.5 with sodium hydroxide solution. For derivatization of the hydroxamic acid, 96 g (0.62 mol.) of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) were added to the aqueous solution, with stirring, and the solution was then heated for 2 h at 80 C., with stirring. To separate the R-2-phenylpropionamide remaining from the enzymatic reaction from the S-1-phenylethylamine formed in the Lossen rearrangement, the aqueous solution was acidified to pH 1 with conc. HCl and the amide was extracted by shaking with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. The aqueous solution was then adjusted to pH 10 with sodium hydroxide solution and the amine was isolated by shaking with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride.

This application claims priority from copending provisional application(s) Ser. No. 60/116,541 filed on Jan. 19, 1999. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION One of the most common practices for controlling undesirable plant species is the use of post-emergent selective herbicides. For example, certain compounds which inhibit the enzymes acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS), acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and/or 5-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate-dioxygenase (HPPD) are known herbicides which are effective against certain annual and perennial grass and broadleaf weeds. Unfortunately these herbicides cannot be used in all crops, especially cereal crops such as corn, wheat, barley and rice, because of unacceptable crop tolerance. Therefore what is needed in the art is a herbicide which is effective against weeds, while protecting the gramineous crop from injury. It is known, for example from U.S. Pat. No. 4,931,581 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,229,384, that certain benzothiadiazole derivatives have the capability to prevent healthy plants from attack by harmful microorganisms by stimulating the plantsown biological defense system. The term for the plant response on such stimulating agents is systemic acquired resistance (SAR). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a a method for protecting cereal crops from injury caused by a herbicidally effective amount of a herbicide, in particular, selected from the group consisting of AHAS-inhibiting, ACCase-inhibiting and HPPD-inhibiting herbicides, which comprises applying to the crop plant, the seed of the crop, or the soil surrounding the crop or crop seed an effective non-phytotoxic antidotal amount of a benzothiazole derivative of formula I wherein A represents an alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, hydroxy, cyano or nitro group or a group of the formula in which W represents O or S, and R represents a hydroxy, thiol, alkoxy, thioalkyl, amino, alkylamino or dialkylamino group; and X represents CH or N. This invention also includes a safened herbicidal composition which is effective against weeds, but spares the crop. The invention furthermore relates to seeds treated with an effective nonphytotoxic antidotal amount a benzothiazole derivative of formula I. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description and the appended claims. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The invention relates to a method for protecting cereal crops from injury caused by a herbicidally effective amount of herbicides which comprises applying to the crop plant, the seed of the crop, or to the soil surrounding the crop or crop seed an effective non-phytotoxic antidotal amount of a benzothiazole derivative of formula I. Benzothiazole derivatives which are suitable for use in the present invention are the compounds of formula I. Of these, preferred benzothiazole derivatives are the compounds of formula I wherein X represents N, and A is a COSCH 3 group attached to the 7-position of the benzothiazole moiety or a methyl, cyano, hydroxy or difluoromethoxy group attached to the 4-, 5- or 6-position of the benzothiazole moiety. The benzothiadiazole derivatives of formula I wherein A 1 represents a methyl, hydroxy, or a C 1-6 fluoroalkoxy group, are especially preferred for safening seeds, especially barley seeds. As used herein, Halogen means a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom, and preferably is fluorine, chlorine or bromine. Generally, when any of the above mentioned moieties comprises an alkyl or alkoxy group, such groups, unless otherwise specified, may be linear or branched and may contain 1 to 6, and preferably 1 to 4, carbon atoms. Examples of such alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl and butyl. Representative alkoxy groups are those such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, and the corresponding branched chain analogs thereof. Generally, when any of the above mentioned moieties comprises a haloalkoxy group, such groups, unless otherwise specified, may be linear or branched and may contain 1 to 6, and preferably 1 to 4, carbon atoms. Examples of such groups are halomethoxy, haloethoxy, halopropoxy, haloisopropoxy, halobutoxy, haloisobutoxy and halo-tertiary-butoxy groups. Haloalkoxy moieties of any groups within the definitions used herein can contain one or more halogen atoms, preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine. Haloalkoxy preferably represents mono-, di-, tri- or perfluoroalkoxy groups, especially difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, pentafluoroethoxy, or 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy, with difluoromethoxy being especially preferred. The alkylamino groups are those wherein the alkyl portion contains 1 to 6, and preferably 1 to 4, carbon atoms, and are typically aminomethyl, 2-aminoethyl and the like. Dialkylamino substituents likewise contain 1 to 6, and preferably 1 to 4, carbon atoms in the alkyl portion, as representative variants include dimethylamino, diethylamino and the like for safening seeds, especially barley seeds. Most preferred are the benzothiazoles selected from the group consisting of 4-difluoromethoxybenzo-1,2,3-thiadiazole, 5-cyanobenzo-1,2,3-thiadiazole, 6-methylbenzo-1,2,3-thiadiazole and 6-hydroxybenzo-1,2,3-thiadiazole. Another preferred group of benzothiazoles are those compounds of formula I wherein X represents CH, and A is a nitro group attached to the 5-position of the benzothiazole moiety. The benzothiazoles of formula I are known in the art and may be prepared by the processes described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,931,581, and 5,229,384, EP 0 039 795 and British Patent 1177972. Herbicides which are suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, AHAS-inhibiting herbicides, ACCase-inhibiting herbicides and HPPD-inhibiting herbicides. Preferred herbicides of the present invention include imidazolinone herbicides such as methyl 6-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl)-m-toluate and methyl 2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl)p-toluate (imazamethabenz-methyl), 5-ethyl-2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5oxo-2-imidazolin-2-y)nicotinic acid (imazethapyr), 2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-y)nicotinic acid, 5-methoxymethyl-2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5oxo-2-imidazolin-2-y)nicotinic acid and 2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl) quinoline-3-carboxylic acid (imazaquin); aryloxyphenoxy propionic acids, such as fenoxaprop including fenoxaprop-P and fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, and clodinafop including clodinafop-propargyl and a mixture of clodinafop-propargyl and cloquintocet; and benzothiopyran derivatives such as (E)-6-1-ethyl-5-(propylsulfonyl)oxypyrazol-4-ylcarbonyl-2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-4-oxo-1,1-dioxide-4H-1-benzothiopyran, 4-(O-methyloxime) and the zinc chelate of (E)-6-1-ethyl-5-hydroxypyrazol-4-ylcarbonyl-2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-4-oxo-1,1-dioxide-4H-1-benzothiopyran, 4-(O-methyloxime). Although many of these herbicides have been used with success in certain crops, they have been found to be phytotoxic in many cereal crops. Surprisingly, it has been found that by applying certain benzothiazole derivatives of formula I to the crop plant, the seed of the crop, or the soil surrounding the crop or crop seed, the herbicide is safened. Safening of cereal crops such as corn, wheat, barley and rice from the post emergence application of herbicides may also be effected by allowing said crop plants to grow until the third to early fourth leaf stage and then spraying with an aqueous solution of the safener either alone, or tank-mixed with at least one of the above-described herbicides. The tank mix should contain effective amounts of herbicide and effective amounts of the safener. Although rates will naturally vary with the particular herbicide and crop, typical rates of application for the safener are about 0.05 kg/ha to 2.0 kg/ha. The application rate of the compound of the herbicides is usually in the range of 0.001 to 2.0 kg/ha, with rates between 0.02-0.5 kg/ha often achieving satisfactory control. In general, the preferred application rate of the herbicides is in the range of 0.01 to 0.5 kg/ha, preferably 0.02-0.3 kg/ha. The optimal rate for a specific application will depend on the crop(s) under cultivation and the predominant species of infesting weed species, and readily may be determined by established biological tests known to those skilled in the art. A wide variety of troublesome weed species can also be effectively controlled in the presence of important agronomic crops such as corn, wheat, barley and rice by safening the crop plants by any conventional seed treatment techniques or uniformly coating the seeds with 0.01 to 0.5 % by weight of the safener. The herbicides can be co-formulated together with the safener in a suitable ratio according to the present invention, together with usual carriers and/or additives known in the art. Accordingly, the present invention further provides a herbicidal composition which comprises a carrier and, as active ingredient, at least one herbicide as defined above and at least one safener compound of formula I as defined above. A method of making such a composition is also provided which comprises bringing the compound of formula I and the herbicidal active ingredient as defined above into association with at least one carrier. It is also envisaged that diflerent isomers or mixtures of isomers of formula I and/or the herbcidal active ingredient may have different levels or spectra of activity and thus compositions may comprise individual isomers or mixtures of isomers. A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which maybe, for example, a plant, seed, foliage, soil, or into the water where the plant grows, or to the roots or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including material which is normally a gas but which has been compressed to form a liquid. The compositions may be manufactured into a variety of formulations suitable for agricultural use, e.g. emulsion concentrates, solutions, oil in water emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, suspension concentrates, dusts, granules, water dispersible granules, tablets, micro-capsules, gels and other formulation types by well-established procedures. These procedures include intensive mixing and/or milling of the active ingredients with other substances, such as fillers, solvents, solid carriers, surface active compounds (surfactants), and optionally, solid and/or liquid auxilaries and/or adjuvants. The form of application, such as spraying, atomizing, dispersing or pouring may be chosen according to the desired objectives and the given circumstances. The biological activity of the active ingredient can also be increased by including an adjuvant in the formulation or the spray dilution. An adjuvant is defined here as a substance which can increase the biological activity of an active ingredient but which, by itself, is not significantly biologically active. The adjuvant can either be included in the formulation as a coformulant or carrier, or can be added to the spray tank together with the formulation containing the active ingredient. As a commodity, the compositions of the present invention are preferably in a concentrated form which is then diluted for use by the end user. The concentrated compositions are typically diluted to a concentration down to 0.001% of active ingredient for application to the target. The typical doses of the herbicide ingredient are usually in the range from 0.01 to 0.5 kg ha and of safener are usually in the range from 0.05 to 2.0 kg/ha. In a preferred embodiment, the herbicide and the safener of formula I are added to the tank mix together each as individual formulations. A preferred embodiment of the present invention thus relates to a kit for the preparation of a spray mixture consisting of two separate containers: (a) a container which comprises at least one safener of formula I, conventional carriers and optional adjuvants; and (b) a container which comprises at least one herbicidal active ingredient, preferably one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of methyl 6-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl)-m-toluate, methyl 2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl)p-toluate, 5-ethyl-2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl)nicotinic acid, 5-methoxymethyl-2-(4-isopropyl-4methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl)nicotinic acid, 2-(4-isopropyl-4-methyl-5-oxo-2-imidazolin-2-yl) quinoline-3-carboxylic acid; fenoxaprop; clodinafop; (E)-6-1-ethyl-5-(propylsulfonyl)oxypyrazol-4-ylcarbonyl-2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-4-oxo-1,1-dioxide-4H-1-benzothiopyran, 4-(O-methyloxime) and the zinc chelate of (E)-6-1-ethyl-5-hydroxypyrazol-4-ylcarbonyl-2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-4-oxo-1,1-dioxide-4H-1-benzothiopyran, 4-(O-methyloxime), conventional carriers and optional adjuvants. In a preferred embodiment, the kit will consist of two bottles with dispensing means which allow the easy and correct addition of the active ingredients (a) and (b) to the tank mix. The compositions of this invention can be applied to the plants or their environment simultaneously with, or in succession to, other active substances. These other active substances can be fertilizers, agents which donate trace elements, or other preparations which influence plant growth. However, they can also be other fungicides, selective herbicides, insecticides, bactericides, nematicides, algicides, molluscidides, rodenticides, virucides, compounds inducing resistance into plants, biological control agents, such as viruses, bacteria, nematodes, fungi and other microorganisms, repellents of birds and animals, and plant growth regulators, or mixtures of several of these preparations, if appropriate together with other carrier substances conventionally used in the art of formulation, surfactants or other additives which promote application. The present invention is of wide applicability in the protection of crops, trees, residential and ornamental plants against attack by weed species. Preferred crops are cereals, such as corn, wheat and barley, rice, as well as vines and apples.

EXAMPLE 1 Benzothiazole Corn Seed Treatment as Safener for Benzothiopyran Herbicides Titrations of herbicides with untreated seed were used to determine a herbicide dose that would cause approximately 50% injury. Seed treatments were achieved by dissolving the test compounds in acetone at 1 mg/ml then treating six corn seeds at a dose of 1 mg of test compound per seed. The seed treatments were applied one day before planting. The seeds were then planted in cups containing artificial soil, and the cups were placed in aluminum pans. The herbicides were dissolved in 500 ml water. The plants in the aluminum pans were placed in a greenhouse, and the herbicide solutions were added to the aluminum pans. The plants absorbed the herbicides through the water solution taken up through the cups. Water was added to the pans daily throughout the tests. The results of the test were evaluated twelve days after planting and are shown in the following table I.

The respective safener was dissolved in water (formulated material) or 80/20 acetoneAwater (technical material) at the concentration needed to give the desired loading of safener in g per kg seed. This solution was poured onto the seeds and the jar was shaken vigorously until all the seeds were bathed in the safener solution. The seeds were then poured onto a glass plate and left in the fume hood to dry. The dry seeds were planted into greenhouse soil (see below) and were treated with herbicides seven days after planting (post-emergence application). Herbicide treatments were applied in water (formulated material) or in acetonic solution (technical material), respectively. This solution was prepared by dissolving the technical material at a concentration of 0.5% a.i. in acetone containing 0.5% of the adjuvant Triton X-100. The solution was topped up with water to give the final volume needed for the application and was applied with a pneumatic sprayer calibrated to deliver 400 I/ha spray volume. All plants were grown in a mixture of field soil (sandy loam soil with 1.9% organic matter, pH7.7) and compost 1/1. Visual ratings of crop injury were taken 2 weeks after treatment (DAT) and were expressed using a 0-100% scale with 0 no effect and 100total kill.

The benzothiadiazole No. 2 (BION), which controls powdery mildew in cereals by inducing systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in cereals, caused some inherent phytotoxicity in barley when used as a seed treatment. However, at the applied rate of 1 g/kg seed the SAR-compound No. 2 clearly reduced crop injury resulting from the post-emergence application of aryloxyphenoxy propionic acids such as fenoxaprop and clodinafop compared to plants grown from untreated seeds. None of the other benzothiadiazole derivatives used in the tests as a seed treatment caused crop injury in barley, and reduced crop damage of post-emergence treatments of aryloxyphenoxy propionic acids. In particular, Compounds No. 1 and No. 6 displayed marked safening effects to crop injury caused by either fenoxaprop P, clodinafop or the combination of clodinafop and cloquintocet.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to the use of N,N,N-trialkyl ureas to reduce the surface tension in water-based systems. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The ability to reduce the surface tension of water is of great importance in waterborne coatings, inks, adhesives, fountain solutions, agricultural formulations and cleaning compositions for electronics processes such as semiconductor manufacture because decreased surface tension translates to enhanced substrate wetting in actual formulations. Surface tension reduction in water-based systems is generally achieved through the addition of surfactants. Performance attributes resulting from the addition of surfactants include enhanced surface coverage, fewer defects, and more uniform distribution. Equilibrium surface tension performance is important when the system is at rest. However, the ability to reduce surface tension under dynamic conditions is of great importance in applications where high surface creation rates are utilized. Such applications include spraying, rolling and brushing of coatings or spraying of agricultural formulations, or high speed gravure or ink-jet printing. Dynamic surface tension is a fundamental quantity which provides a measure of the ability of a surfactant to reduce surface tension and provide wetting under such high speed application conditions. Traditional nonionic surfactants such as alkylphenol or alcohol ethoxylates, and ethylene oxide (EO)/propylene oxide (PO) copolymers have excellent equilibrium surface tension performance but are generally characterized as having poor dynamic surface tension reduction. In contrast, certain anionic surfactants such as sodium dialkyl sulfosuccinates can provide good dynamic results, but these are very foamy and impart water sensitivity to the finished coating. There is a need for surfactants which exhibit good equilibrium and dynamic surface tension properties, are low-foaming, are low viscosity liquids to facilitate handling, have low color and low odor characteristics and would be widely accepted in the waterborne coating, ink, adhesive, fountain solution, agricultural formulation and the electronics manufacturing industries. The importance of reducing equilibrium and dynamic surface tension in applications such as coatings, inks, adhesives, fountain solutions, agricultural formulations and electronics cleaning compositions, e.g., aqueous developer solutions for making semiconductor devices, is well-appreciated in the art. Low dynamic surface tension is of great importance in the application of waterborne coatings. In an article, Schwartz, J. The Importance of Low Dynamic Surface Tension in Waterborne Coatings , Journal of Coatings Technology, September 1992, there is a discussion of surface tension properties in waterborne coatings and a discussion of dynamic surface tension in such coatings. Equilibrium and dynamic surface tension were evaluated for several surface active agents. It is pointed out that low dynamic surface tension is an important factor in achieving superior film formation in waterborne coatings. Dynamic coating application methods require surfactants with low dynamic surface tensions in order to prevent defects such as retraction, craters, and foam. Efficient application of agricultural products is also highly dependent on the dynamic surface tension properties of the formulation. In an article, Wirth, W.; Storp, S.; Jacobsen, W. Mechanisms Controlling Leaf Retention of Agricultural Spray Solutions ; Pestic. Sci. 1991, 33, 411-420, the relationship between the dynamic surface tension of agricultural formulations and the ability of these formulations to be retained on a leaf was studied. These workers observed a good correlation between retention values and dynamic surface tension, with more effective retention of formulations exhibiting low dynamic surface tension. Low dynamic surface tension is also important in high-speed printing as discussed in the article Using Surfactants to Formulate VOC Compliant Waterbased Inks , Medina, S. W.; Sutovich, M. N. Am. Ink Maker 1994, 72 (2), 32-38. In this article, it is stated that equilibrium surface tensions (ESTs) are pertinent only to ink systems at rest. EST values, however, are not good indicators of performance in the dynamic, high speed printing environment under which the ink is used. Dynamic surface tension is a more appropriate property. This dynamic measurement is an indicator of the ability of the surfactant to migrate to a newly created ink/substrate interface to provide wetting during high speed printing. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) is the chemical of choice in aqueous alkaline solutions for developing photoresists according to Microlithography, Science and Technology , edited by J. R. Sheats and B. W. Smith, Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1998, pp 551-553. Surfactants are added to the aqueous TMAH solutions to reduce development time and scumming and to improve surface wetting. U.S. Pat. No. 5,098,478 discloses water-based ink compositions comprising water, a pigment, a nonionic surfactant and a solubilizing agent for the nonionic surfactant. Dynamic surface tension in ink compositions for publication gravure printing must be educed to a level of about 25 to 40 dynes/cm to assure that printability problems will not be encountered.

It is desirable that an aqueous solution of the N,N,N-trialkyl urea demonstrates a dynamic surface tension of less than 45 dynes/cm at a concentration of 5 wt % in water at 23 C. and 1 bubble/second according to the maximum-bubble pressure method. The maximum-bubble-pressure method of measuring surface tension is described in Langmuir 1986, 2, 428-432, which is incorporated by reference. By water-based, aqueous or aqueous medium we mean, for purposes of this invention, a solvent or liquid dispersing medium which comprises at least 90 wt %, preferably at least 95 wt %, water. Obviously, an all water medium is also included. Also provided is a method for lowering the equilibrium and dynamic surface tension of such aqueous compositions by the incorporation of these N,N,N-trialkyl urea compounds. Also provided is a method for applying a coating of a water-based inorganic or organic compound-containing composition to a surface to partially or fully coat the surface with the water-based composition, the composition containing an effective amount of an N,N,N-trialkyl urea compound of the above structure for reducing the dynamic surface tension of the water-based composition. There are significant advantages associated with the use of these N,N,N-trialkyl ureas in water-based organic coatings, inks, adhesives, fountain solutions, agricultural and electronic cleaning compositions and these advantages include: an ability to formulate water-borne coatings, inks, adhesives, fountain solutions and agricultural compositions which may be applied to a variety of substrates with excellent wetting of substrate surfaces including contaminated and low energy surfaces; an ability to provide a reduction in coating or printing defects such as orange peel and flow/leveling deficiencies; an ability to formulate water-borne coating and ink compositions capable of high speed application; an ability to produce low-foam surfactants capable of reducing dynamic surface tension; an ability to produce water-borne coatings and inks which have low volatile organic content, thus making these formulations environmentally favorable; and an ability to formulate low surface tension aqueous electronics cleaning and processing solutions, including photoresist developer solutions, for the semiconductor manufacturing industry with good wetting and extremely low foam. Because of their excellent surfactant properties and the ability to control foam, these materials are likely to find use in many applications in which reduction in dynamic and equilibrium surface tension and low foam are important. Applications in which low foam is important include various wet-processing textile operations, such as dyeing of fibers, fiber souring, and kier boiling, where low-foaming properties would be particularly advantageous; they may also have applicability in soaps, water-based perfumes, shampoos, and various detergents where their marked ability to lower surface tension while simultaneously producing substantially no foam would be highly desirable. In addition, the demands of the semiconductor fabrication industry have led to the requirement for high performance surfactants and wetting agents for photoresist developer formulations. As line features shrink to smaller sizes and photoresist substrate materials become more aliphatic in nature (i.e., lower surface energy), aqueous developer solutions increasingly are being formulated with surface tension reducing agents. An additional requirement for these developers, accentuated by the move toward larger wafer sized, is that they exhibit low foam. This is particularly important when the so-called spray puddle techniques are used in applying the developer solution, wherein the developer is sprayed over increasingly larger areas. Even in cases where puddle or immersion techniques are used, microbubble entrainment during spreading of the solution over the photoresist surface can lead to defects. The materials according to the present invention give efficient reduction of surface tension of aqueous developer solutions and exceedingly low foam, even under extreme conditions. Other applications in the electronics industry using aqueous processing media would also benefit from good dynamic wetting and low foam. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the use of compounds of the structure where R 1 and R 2 are C2 to C6 alkyl groups, R 3 is methyl or ethyl, and the total number of carbon atoms in R 1 , R 2 and R 3 is from 6 to 14, for the reduction of equilibrium and dynamic surface tension in water-based compositions containing an organic compound, particularly coating, ink, fountain solution, adhesive, agricultural and electronics processing compositions containing organic compounds such as polymeric resins, organic bases, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides or plant growth modifying agents. It is desirable that an aqueous solution of the N,N,N-trialkyl urea demonstrates a dynamic surface tension of less than 45 dynes/cm at a concentration of 5 wt % in water at 23 C. and 1 bubble/second according to the maximum-bubble-pressure method. The maximum-bubble-pressure method of measuring surface tension is described in Langmuir 1986, 2, 428-432, which is incorporated by reference. In one aspect of the invention the N,N,N-trialkyl ureas of the above formula display excellent ability to reduce equilibrium and dynamic surface tension while producing substantially no foam. These materials may be prepared by heating a dialkylamine with an N,N-dialkylurea. This reaction is illustrated below: Ureas suitable for the preparation of the compounds of this invention include N,N-dimethylurea and N,N-diethylurea which are easily prepared from urea and the primary amines. Dimethylurea is commercially available. Any secondary amine containing the requisite C2 to C6 alkyl substituents may be utilized for the preparation of the compounds of this invention. Amines which contain a total of 8-10 carbons are preferred. Alkyl groups which are suitable should have sufficient carbon to confer surface activity (i.e. an ability to reduce the surface tension of water) to the material but not enough carbon to decrease the solubility to the extent that the ability of the material to reduce surface tension is insufficient for a particular application. In general, an increase in the carbon number increases the efficiency of the resulting urea surfactant (i.e. less surfactant is required to obtain a given decrease in surface tension) but decreases its ability to reduce surface tension at high surface creation rates. The latter effect is a result of the fact that increased carbon number generally decreases the water solubility of the material, and consequently, diminishes the diffusive flux of surfactant to newly-created surface. Generally, in the practice of this invention, it is desirable to choose alkyl groups such that the resulting trialkylureas have a solubility limit in water from 0.001 to 10.0 wt %, preferably from 0.01 to 2 wt %, and most preferably from 0.1 to 1.5 wt %. The alkyl groups on the amine may be the same or different. They may be linear or branched, and the point of attachment to the nitrogen may be on either an internal or terminal carbon. The total number of carbons on R 1 and R 2 should be greater than about 5; fewer than this diminishes the surface activity of the urea too greatly. The total number of carbons should be less than about 12; a greater number decreases the solubility of the material to such a degree that its use in many formulations is impractical. Examples of suitable R 1 and R 2 are ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, n-pentyl, 2-pentyl, 3-pentyl, isopentyl, n-hexyl, 2-hexyl, 3-hexyl, cyclohexyl , and so on. Preferred derivatives are those in which R 1 and R 2 contain a total of 6 to 12 alkyl carbons, and derivatives containing 8 to 10 alkyl carbons are most preferred. The alkyl carbons may be distributed among R 1 and R 2 in any manner, although derivatives in which the alkyl groups contain equivalent numbers of carbons are preferred because parent amines of this type are the most economical and readily available. An amount of the trialkyl urea compound that is effective to reduce the equilibrium and/or dynamic surface tension of the water-based, inorganic or organic compound-containing composition is added. Such effective amount may range from 0.001 to 20 g/100 mL, preferably 0.01 to 10 g/100 mL, of the aqueous composition. Naturally, the most effective amount will depend on the particular application and the solubility of the N,N,N-trialkyl urea. The trialkyl ureas are suitable for use in an aqueous composition comprising in water an inorganic compound which is, for example, a mineral ore or a pigment or an organic compound which is a pigment, a polymerizable monomer, such as addition, condensation and vinyl monomers, an oligomeric resin, a polymeric resin, a detergent, a caustic cleaning agent, a dissolution agent such as trimethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), a herbicide, a fungicide, an insecticide, or a plant growth modifying agent. In the following water-based organic coating, ink, adhesive, fountain solution, agricultural and photoresist developer compositions containing a trialkyl urea according to the invention, the other listed components of such compositions are those materials well known to the workers in the relevant art. A typical water-based protective or decorative organic coating composition to which the trialkyl urea surfactants of the invention may be added would comprise in an aqueous medium 30 to 80 wt % of a coating composition containing the following components: Water-Based Organic Coating Composition 0 to 50 wt % Pigment Dispersant/Grind Resin 0 to 80 wt % Coloring Pigments/Extender Pigments/Anti-Corrosive Pigments/Other Pigment Types 5 to 99.9 wt % Water-Borne/Water-Dispersible/Water-Soluble Resins 0 to 30 wt % Slip Additives/Antimicrobials/Processing Aids/Defoamers 0 to 50 wt % Coalescing or Other Solvent 0.01 to 10 wt % Surfactant/Wetting Agent/Flow and Leveling Agents 0.01 to 5 wt % Trialkyl Urea A typical water-based ink composition to which the trialkyl urea surfactants of the invention may be added would comprise in an aqueous medium 20 to 60 wt % of an ink composition containing the following components: Water-Based Ink Composition 1 to 50 wt % Pigment 0 to 50 wt % Pigment Dispersant/Grind Resin 0 to 50 wt % Clay base in appropriate resin solution vehicle 5 to 99.9 wt % Water-Borne/Water-Dispersible/Water-Soluble Resins 0 to 30 wt % Coalescing or Other Solvent 0.01 to 10 wt % Surfactant/Wetting Agent 0.01 to 10 wt % Processing Aids/Defoamers/Solubilizing Agents 0.01 to 5 wt % Trialkyl Urea A typical water-based agricultural composition to which the trialkyl urea surfactants of the invention may be added would comprise in an aqueous medium 0.01 to 80 wt % of an agricultural composition containing the following components: Water-Based Agricultural Composition 0.1 to 50 wt % Pesticide, Insecticide, Herbicide or Plant Growth Modifying Agent 0.01 to 10 wt % Surfactant 0 to 5 wt % Dyes 0 to 20 wt % Thickeners/Stabilizers/Co-surfactants/Gel Inhibitors/ Defoamers 0 to 25 wt % Antifreeze 0.01 to 50 wt % Trialkyl Urea A typical water-based fountain solution composition to which the trialkyl urea surfactants of the invention may be added would comprise in an aqueous medium 30 to 70 wt % of a fountain solution composition containing the following components: Water-Based Fountain Solution 0.05 to 10 wt % Film Formable, Water Soluble Macromolecule 1 to 25 wt % Alcohol, Glycol, or C2-C12 Polyol, Water Soluble or Water Solubilizable 0.01 to 20 wt % Water Soluble Organic Acid, Inorganic Acid, or a Salt Thereof 0.01 to 5 wt % Trialkyl Urea A typical water-based adhesive composition to which the trialkyl urea surfactants of the invention may be added would comprise in an aqueous medium 30 to 65 wt % of an adhesive composition containing the following components: Water-Based Adhesive Composition 50 to 99 wt % Polymeric Resin (SBR, VAE, Acrylic) 0 to 50 wt % Tackifier 0 to 0.5 wt % Defoamer 0.5 to 2 wt % Trialkyl Urea A typical water-based photoresist developer, or electronic cleaning, composition to which the trialkyl urea surfactants of the invention may be added would comprise an aqueous medium containing the following components: Water-Based Photoresist Developer Composition 0.1 to 3 wt % Trimethylammonium Hydroxide 0 to 4 wt % Phenolic Compound 10 to 10,000 ppm Trialkyl Urea EXAMPLE 1 This example illustrates the preparation of the N,N,N-trialkylureas of the invention using the preparation of N,N-dibutyl-N-methylurea as representative. (The other trialkyl ureas in the Examples were prepared similarly.) A mixture of N,N-dimethylurea (10.0 g) and di-n-butylamine (14.6 g) was slowly heated to 150 C. At this temperature, gas evolution commenced and heating was continued at 150-160 C. for about 2.5 hours. The crude product, which was a liquid, was placed in a separatory funnel and washed with about 30 mL water. About 20 mL toluene was then added to dissolve the organic layer and the solution was then washed with 20 mL 5 M HCl. A noticeable exotherm occurred at this point. The organic layer was further washed with water, dilute sodium bicarbonate solution, and finally twice more with water. The solution was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the toluene removed on a roto-evaporator to give 12.8 g of a colorless oil (61% yield). The oil solidified over several days to give a waxy white solid (mp 46-48 C.). In the following Examples dynamic surface tension data were obtained for aqueous solutions of various compounds using the maximum bubble pressure method at bubble rates from 0.1 bubbles/second (b/s) to 20 b/s. These data provide information about the performance of a surfactant at conditions from near-equilibrium (0.1 b/s) through extremely high surface creation rates (20 b/s). In practical terms, high bubble rates correspond to high printing speeds in lithographic printing, high spray or roller velocities in coating applications, and rapid application rates for agricultural products, as well to conditions that might lead to microbubble entrainment in electronic applications. EXAMPLE 2 Aqueous solutions of N,N-di-isobutyl-N-methylurea (DIBMU) were prepared and their surface tensions were measured using the procedure described above. The data are set forth in Table 1. TABLE 1 Dynamic Surface Tension (dyne/cm) - DIBMU Concentration (wt %) 0.1 b/s 1 b/s 6 b/s 15 b/s 20 b/s 0.090 53.3 53.8 55.0 56.7 57.3 0.500 40.4 40.6 41.2 42.1 42.5 1.030 35.2 35.4 35.7 36.2 36.7 1.511 34.0 34.3 34.8 35.1 35.3 2.013 33.8 34.0 34.3 34.9 35.2 These results show that N,N-di-isobutyl-N-methylurea was effective at reducing the surface tension of water. It has not previously been recognized that trialkylureas would have the ability to reduce the surface tension of an aqueous system. The performance of this compound was particularly noteworthy under conditions in which surface was created rapidly. A 1 wt % aqueous solution of N,N-di-isobutyl-N-methylurea maintained a surface tension below 37 dyne/cm even at the extremely high surface creation rate of 20 b/s. The outstanding performance at high surface creation rates could be extremely important in formulating water-based coating, ink, and agricultural products for high speed applications, particularly for low energy surfaces. EXAMPLE 3 Aqueous solutions of N-butyl-N-ethyl-N-methylurea (BEMU) were prepared and their surface tensions were measured using the procedure described above. The data are set forth in Table 2. TABLE 2 Dynamic Surface Tension (dyne/cm) - BEMU Concentration (wt %) 0.1 b/s 1 b/s 6 b/s 15 b/s 20 b/s 0.1 63.2 63.7 64.4 64.0 63.8 1.0 46.5 46.8 47.3 47.9 48.0 2.0 46.8 41.0 41.5 42.2 42.6 3.0 37.4 37.5 37.9 38.5 38.9 5.0 33.0 33.2 33.7 34.3 34.8 The data of Table 2 illustrate that addition of N-butyl-N-ethyl-N-methylurea also had the ability to reduce the surface tension of an aqueous composition and that low surface tension could be maintained even under conditions in which surface was created at a rapid rate. Although this material was not as efficient as N,N-di-isobutyl-N-methylurea, a 3.0 wt % solution maintained a surface tension below 40 dyne/cm even at a rate of 20 b/s, and a 5 wt % solution maintained a surface tension below 35 dyne/cm at 20 b/s. EXAMPLE 4 Aqueous solutions of N,N-di-n-butyl-N-methylurea (DNBMU) were prepared and their surface tensions were measured using the procedure described above. The data are set forth in Table 3. TABLE 3 Dynamic Surface Tension (dyne/cm) - DNBMU Concentration (wt %) 0.1 b/s 1 b/s 6 b/s 15 b/s 20 b/s 0.1 48.7 49.4 50.7 51.9 52.3 0.2 43.1 43.7 44.6 45.5 45.6 0.5 36.7 37.0 37.7 38.4 38.4 N,N-di-n-butyl-N-methylurea is considerably more efficient than N-butyl-N-ethyl-N-methylurea; that is, less surfactant is required to obtain an equivalent reduction in surface tension. Use of DNBMU at a level of 0.5 wt % in water allows the surface tension of water to be maintained below 39 dyne/cm, even at 20 bubbles/second. By comparison, BEMU must be used at a level of 3.0 wt % to obtain an equivalent reduction in surface tension. EXAMPLE 5 Aqueous solutions of N,N-diamyl-N-methylurea (DAMU) were prepared and their surface tensions were measured using the procedure described above. The data are set forth in Table 4. TABLE 4 Dynamic Surface Tension (dyne/cm) - DAMU Concentration (wt %) 0.1 b/s 1 b/s 6 b/s 15 b/s 20 b/s 0.023 45.3 48.3 54.4 59.1 59.8 0.050 41.0 42.7 47.0 52.1 53.5 0.090 39.2 40.7 44.0 47.9 48.8 N,N-diamyl-N-methylurea was much more efficient than N,N-di-isobutyl-N-methylurea, particularly under conditions in which surface was not created rapidly. A 0.09 wt % aqueous solution of this surfactant provided a surface tension of under 40 dyne/cm at 0.1 b/s, although the surface tension rises to almost 50 dyne/cm at 20 b/s. DAMU would therefore be useful in applications in which surface is not created at an extremely high rate, particularly if it is desirable to use only low levels of surfactant. EXAMPLE 6 The foaming properties of a 0.1 wt % solution of N,N-di-isobutyl-N-methylurea, N -butyl-N-ethyl-N-methylurea, N,N-di-n-butyl-N-methylurea, and N,N-diamyl-N-methylurea were examined using a procedure based upon ASTM D 1173-53. In this test, a 0.1 wt % solution of the surfactant is added from an elevated foam pipette to a foam receiver containing the same solution. The foam height is measured at the completion of the addition (Initial Foam Height) and the time required for the foam to dissipate at the air-liquid interface (Time to 0 Foam) is recorded. This test provides a comparison between the foaming characteristics of various surfactant solutions. In general, in coatings, inks, adhesives, fountain solutions and agricultural formulations, foam is undesirable because it complicates handling and can lead to coating and print defects, and to inefficient application of agricultural materials. The data are presented in Table 5. TABLE 5 Foam Test Data Initial Foam Compound Height (cm) Time to 0 Foam N,N-di-isobutyl- 1.9 13 s N-methylurea N-butyl-N-ethyl- 4.0 6 s N-methylurea N,N-di-n-butyl- 1.0 21 s N-methylurea N,N-diamyl-N- 0.4 3 s methylurea The ability of a surfactant in aqueous systems to reduce surface tension under both equilibrium and dynamic conditions is of great importance in the performance of waterbased coatings, inks, adhesives, fountain solutions, agricultural compositions and photoresist developing and electronics cleaning compositions. Low equilibrium surface tension allows the development of excellent properties subsequent to application. Low dynamic surface tension results in enhanced wetting and spreading under the dynamic conditions of application, resulting in more efficient use of the formulations and fewer defects. In waterborne coating, ink, adhesive, fountain solution, agricultural and photoresist solution and electronics cleaning compositions, the formation of foam is generally undesirable because it complicates handling and can cause defects or result in inefficient application. That trialkylureas would exhibit surface activity would not be anticipated based on the teachings of the prior art. Although ureas have been studied in detergent applications, their role appears to have been to act as adjuvants to conventional detergents and not as surfactants themselves. In particular, surfactancy by relatively short chain trialkylureas is not apparent from the prior art. A property which is particularly not apparent from the prior art is the outstanding dynamic properties shown by ureas in reducing the surface tension of aqueous compositions under conditions of high surface creation rates.

Medicinal products containing the same which are useful in the treatment of cancer. The present invention relates to new 9-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-5,8,8a,9-tetrahydrofuro-3,4:6,7naphtho2,3-d1,3dioxol-6(5aH)-one compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The compounds of the invention are derivatives of podophyllotoxin, a natural extract known for its use in the treatment of cancer. Other synthetic compounds, such as etoposide and teniposide, are currently used as chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment especially of small-cell lung cancer. Those various compounds act by inhibiting the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Various modifications have been made to those compounds, such as the modifications described in the Patent Specifications JP 948 782, WO 97/13776 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,634,459. Nevertheless, anti-cancer therapeutic requirements call for the constant development of new anti-tumour and cytotoxic agents with the aim of obtaining medicaments that are simultaneously more active, more soluble and better tolerated. In addition to the fact that the compounds of the present invention are new, they have a surprising in vitro and in vivo activity that is superior to that observed hitherto. The compounds discovered by the Applicant accordingly have properties that render them particularly useful in the treatment of cancers.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is the U.S. National Phase of PCT/US98/11095 pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 371, which claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/049.404, filed Jun. 12. 1997 and U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/052.027, filed Jul. 9. 1997. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to synthetic analogues of naturally occurring antiviral 2,5-oligoadenylates wherein at least one of the nucleoside residues is replaced with a modified nucleoside. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The discovery of the 2-5 oligoadenylates is connected with the study of the mechanisms of interferon action as the cellular response to virus infection 2. The 5-triphosphate of the (2-5) oligoadenylate trimer plays a most important role in the antiviral mechanism induced by interferon 3. It is generally regarded that activation of RNase L by 2-5A is key to the antiviral defense mechanisms. Interferon induces transcription of the enzyme 2-5A synthetase which produces 2,5-linked oligoadenylates upon activation of double-stranded RNA. Previously, the only known biochemical effect of 2-5A is activation of RNase L. This enzyme hydrolyzes mRNA and rRNA, thereby resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis. The activation of RNase L is transient unless 2-5A is continuously synthesized, since 2-5A is rapidly degraded. RNase L activation thus plays a critical role in inhibiting replication, and therefore in defending against infection by viruses. Naturally occurring (2-5)oligoadenylates (both 5-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) have shown different kinds of biological activity 45. Analogues of the natural (2-5)oligoadenylates have been synthesized to achieve new approaches to antiviral and antitumoral therapy 6-13. Biological activities of 5-phosphorylated (2-5)oligoadenylates are connected with the functioning of the (2-5)A system which leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis 3. The mechanism of action of unphosphorylated (2-5)oligoadenylates in many cases is still unknown. Recently, certain sugar-modified trimers of (2-5)oligoadenylates were found to be inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) 14-18. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The compounds of the present invention are useful in inhibiting viral infections in plants and mammals. The compounds and the water-soluble salts thereof are of the formula wherein m is zero, 1, 2 or 3; n is from 1 to 8, preferably 1, 2 or 3; most preferably 1 or 2; R is independently selected from the group consisting of provided that all R may not be R 1 is independently selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl and hydrogen; R 2 is independently selected from the group consisting of oxygen and sulfur.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Replacement of the adenine moiety in the (2-5)oligoadenylate trimer core with 1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide (TCA) or with N 6 -(benzylamino)purine (Ade Bn )-moieties has resulted in a new group of inhibitors of HIV-1 replication.

The substitution of sulfur for oxygen in the 2,5-phosphodiester backbone referenced above, introduces chirality into the molecules and introduces a new chemistry of the backbone. The core 2,5-phosphorothioates exhibit increased resistance to phosphodiesterase and phosphatases and new biological activities compared to authentic 2-5A cores. The preparation of the 2,5-phosphorothioates, including fully resolved enantiomers thereof, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,924,624 and is incorporated herein by reference. A mixture of phosphorothioate and phosphodiester linkages is possible in the same oligomer, providing molecules with a mixed phosphodiester/phosphorothioate backbone, as described in PCT/US95/10683, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. While the preparation and examples that follow are directed to oligomers of a base-modified adenosine, the procedure described is equally applicable to the manufacture of oligomers comprising a base-modified cordycepin, or mixed chain of cordycepin and adenosine residues as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,859,768, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. Chemical Synthesis Syntheses of the compounds of the present invention may be achieved by the phosphotriester method using a published approach 19. Synthetic N 6 -benzyladenosine 1 and 1-(-D-ribofuranosyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide 7, obtained by the reaction of microbiological transglycosylation as described before 20, are converted into the corresponding selectively blocked nucleosides 2-6 and 8-11 and corresponding nucleotides 13 and 14, respectively. Thus, treatment of 1 with monomethoxytrityl chloride (MeOTrCl) in pyridine gives the 5-O-monomethoxytrityl derivative 2 (85%). Benzoylation of 2 with benzoyl cyanide (BzCN) in MeCN 19 leads to a mixture of the 2,3-di-O-benzyl 3, 2-O-benzoyl 4, and 3-O-benzoyl 5 derivatives which are isolated by column chromatography (CC) in 38, 13, and 46% yield, respectively. Treatment of 3 with a 2% solution of TsOH in CH 2 CL 2 /MeOh 7:3 affords 2,3-di-O-benzoyl-N 6 -benzyladenosine 6 in 96% yield. Similarly, 7 is converted into the 5-O-monomethoxytrityl derivatives 8-10 in 92, 16, and 57% yield, respectively. Detritylation of 9 leads to the 5-OH derivative 11 in 78% yield. Furthermore, the reaction of the 3-O-benzoylated compounds 5 and 10 with 2-chlorophenyl bis (1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-phosphinate followed by subsequent treatments with 2-(4-nitrophenyl)-ethanol (NpeOH) and then a solution of 4-nitrobenzaldoxin in dioxane/H 2 O/Et 3 N 1:1:1, gives the corresponding nucleoside 2-phosphodiesters 13 and 14 which are isolated by CC (silica gel) in 82 and 48% yield, respectively. The compounds 6, 11, 13, and 14 and the corresponding adenosine derivatives 12 21 and 15 22 are then used in the syntheses of the new. (2-5)oligonucleotide trimers 22-29. Condensation of 2,3-di-O-benzoyl-N 6 -benzyladenosine 6 with the 2-phosphodiester 15 in pyridine in the presence of a mixture of 1H-triazole/2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (TpsCl) 3:1, followed by detritylation, leads to the 5-OH dimer 16 which is isolated by CC in 85% yield. Similar reaction sequences convert compounds 6 and 13, 12 and 13, 11 and 15, and 12 and 14, into the corresponding 5-OH dimers 17-20, isolated in 81, 87, 74, and 76% yield, respectively. The synthesis of 5-OH dimer 21 has been described earlier 22. The transformations of the dimers 16-20 to the trimer level is afforded the same techniques consisting of a condensation step and followed by successive treatment with 2% solution of TsOH, 0.5M DBU (1,8diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene)/(pyridine, and NH 3 /MeOH, respectively, to remove the three different protecting groups. Final purification by CC(DEAE-cellulose)ion exchange gives the trimers 22-28 in good to moderate yields. Biological Utility The compounds of the present invention may be combined with appropriate pharmaceutical or agricultural carriers to form an antiviral composition. For pharmaceutical use, the compounds of the invention may be taken up in pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as, solutions, suspensions, tablets, capsules, ointments, elixirs and injectable composition and the like. They are administered to subjects suffering from viral infection. The dosage administered depends upon the nature and severity of the infection, the disease stage, and, when administered systematically, the size and weight of the infected subject. The compounds are generally administered in the form of water-soluble salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable water soluble salts include, for example, the sodium, potassium or ammonium salts of the active compounds. They are readily dissolved in water or saline solution. Thus, the preferred formulation for pharmacological use comprises a saline solution of the desired compound in salt form. The formulation may further contain an agent, such as a sugar or protein, to maintain osmotic balance. The salt form of the compound is preferred owing to the relatively high acidity (about pH 3) of the acid form of the compounds. The compounds of the invention may be used as a treatment for humans and animals from viral infectives such as Herpes simplex, rhinovirus, hepatitis and other infections of the hepatitis virus family, Epstein Barr virus, measles virus, multiple sclerosis (which may be caused by a viral agent) and the various Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV), such as HIV-1, which causes cutaneous T cell lymphoma, HIV-2, which causes Sezary lymphoma, and HIV-3, which is responsible for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The compounds of the invention inhibit HIV-1 induced syncytia formation. The compounds may be applied topically to treat skin cancers caused by radiation, carcinogens or viral agents. Such skin cancers include cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, Sezary lymphoma, Xeroderma pigmentosium, ataxia telangiectasia and Blooms syndrome. A sufficient amount of a preparation containing a compound of the invention is applied to cover the lesion or affected area. An effective concentration of active agent is between about 10 3 M and 10 5 M, with 10 4 M being preferred. The compounds of the present invention may also be used to treat plant-infecting viruses, particularly tobacco mosaic virus, and other viruses which cause necrosis in turnips, cucumbers, orchids and in other plants. Such viruses include, but are not limited to, tobacco vein mottling virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, vaccinia virus, turnip necrosis virus, and cymbidium orchid virus. The compounds may be administered effectively to plants by topical application by abrasion of the leaf surface, aerosol spray, treatment of the soil, spraying, or dusting. An effective antiviral composition may be formed by combining one or more of the compounds of the invention with a carrier material suitable for agricultural use. The active compound may also be administered by spraying insect vectors such as aphids, thrips and whiteflies which carry virus to plants. The dosage administered depends upon the severity of the infection. The compounds of the invention may be applied to plant seeds prior to germination to control viruses contained in the germ plasm. The seeds may be soaked in a solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG) containing one or more of the compounds. PEG brings the seeds to physiological activity and arrest. The relative concentration of active compound to PEG depends upon the type of seed under treatment. Plants may be effectively treated with an aqueous formulation containing from about 10 1 to about 10 2 M concentration of active ingredient. The compounds of the invention may be applied at very low concentrations. An effective amount of active ingredient on the plant surface is from about 10 8 to about 10 12 mole per cm 2 of plant surface area, with about 10 10 mole to about 10 12 mole per cm 2 being preferred. For the typical tobacco plant, 10 5 M of compound is effective. At this rate, one pound of active ingredient is sufficient to treat 210 8 tobacco plants. For agricultural application, the compounds are advantageously administered in the form of water-soluble salts, e.g. ammonium or potassium salts. Sodium salts are generally avoided in treating edible plants. The compounds of the invention are readily dissolved in water, particularly at such low concentrations. Aqueous formulations for agricultural use may optionally contain a sticker and/or a UV-stabilizer. Such agents are well-known to those skilled in the art. Fatty acids (1%) are useful as spreader sticker agents. Effective UV-stabilizers include, for example, p-aminobenzoic acid. For antiviral use in mammals, the compounds of the invention are administered parenterally, such as intravenously, intraarterially, intramuscularly, subcutaneously or when administered as an anti-cancer agent, intratumorally. The preferred route of administration for antiviral therapy is intravenous injection. The compounds of the invention may be administered to mammals at very low concentrations. The actual dosage administered may take into account the size and weight of the patient, whether the nature of the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic in nature, the age, health and sex of the patient, the route of administration, the nature and stage of the affliction, and other factors. An effective daily dosage of active ingredient, based upon in vivo studies involving other 2-5A analogues, is from about 0.25 g per 70 kg of body weight (approximately 152 lbs) to about 2.5 g per 70 kg of body weight. The preferred daily dosage is about 0.5 g per 70 kg of body weight. Those skilled in the art should readily be able to derive appropriate dosages and schedules of administration to suit the specific circumstance and needs of the patient. It is expected that an effective treatment regimen includes administration of the daily dosage for two days. Treatment is continued at least until the disease condition is substantially abated. Preferably, the therapeutic end point is determined by testing for the continued presence of viral DNA. Such testing can be done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in which the presence of viral DNA is assayed according to conventional PCR. PCR primers of appropriate nucleotide sequences for amplification of viral DNA can be prepared from known viral nucleotide sequences. To obtain DNA for testing, patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells are lysed with an appropriate lysing agent, such as NP-40. Alternatively, testing for the continued presence of the virus can be performed by an antigen-antibody assay using any of the known monoclonal or polyclonal antisera against a protein antigen of the target virus protein coat. For example, an antigen-antibody assay may be employed to detect any of the protein antigen in the virus HIV protein coat, for example, the gp120, p17 or p24. Moreover, the target antigen is not limited merely to coat protein antigens. Antisera can be targeted against a suitable non-coat protein antigen, such as the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) molecule. Monoclonal antibodies to HIV RT are known. Sobol et al., Biochemistry 1991, 30, 10623. Additionally, testing for the presence of the infecting virus during or post-treatment could be accomplished by an assay which assesses the viral load in the patients blood stream. This can be done by determining syncytia formation. See procedure outlined in Henderson et al., Virology, 1991, 182, 186. In addition to administration with conventional carriers, the compounds of the present invention may be administered by a variety of specialized oligonucleotide or nucleic acid delivery techniques. 2-5A and its analogues have been successfully encapsulated in various encapsulating materials, such as in unilamellar liposomes and delivered with the aid of monoclonal antibodies to cells, Bayard et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 1985, 151, 319. Reconstituted Sendai virus envelopes have been successfully used to deliver RNA and DNA to cells, Arad et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1986, 859, 88. Moreover, the virus envelope is not limited to Sendai virus, but could include encapsulation in any retroviral amphotrophic particle. For example, an HIV envelope could be formed from any part or all of the outer protein coat of a non-infectious HIV particle. Such particles as gp 120 can be cloned by known recombinant techniques. These techniques may be utilized for introduction of the present 2-5A oligoadenylate derivatives into cells. It is further contemplated that the compounds of the invention may be administered in the form of prodrugs in which lipophilic groups are attached to, for example, the 5-terminal hydroxyl group of the core compound. Biological Studies Three studies were performed to determine the antiviral activity of the (2-5)oligonucleotide derivatives of the present invention: (i) inhibition of HIV-1-replication, (ii) inhibition of HIV-1 reverse-transcriptase (RT) activity, and (iii) activation of recombinant human GST-RNase L. All compounds were tested at a concentration of 300 M. Inhibition of HIV-1 Replication The infected centers assay as described by Henderson et al., Virology 1991, 182, 186, was used to measure the ability of the trimer core compounds of the invention to inhibit HIV-1 induced syncytia formation, an indicator of HIV-1 replication in T cells. Freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were treated with 2-5A trimer or derivatives for 2 hours and infected with HIV-1 strain IIIB at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 0.1. The infected PBL were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37 C. in a humidified 5% CO 2 in air atmosphere. After 48 hours, the cells were washed twice in Hanks balanced salt solution, serially diluted and seeded into multiple wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. Immediately, 210 5 exponentially growing Sup T1 cells were added to each well; Sup T1 cells readily form a syncytium with a cell which is productively infected with HIV-1. The wells were examined daily for the presence of syncytia, using a tissue culture microscope. The first signs of syncytia formation can be seen in 12 hours, with some complete syncytia developing by 24 hours. Final results were read at 72 hours. Each syncytium was counted as a single infected cell. The number of syncytia per seeded cell is determined and expressed as an infected center per infected cell. The number of syncytia per 10 4 cells was 12116 for the control Sup T1 cells. The data is shown in Table 1. The mean of triplicate determinations is shown; variance did not exceed 5-10%. Inhibition of HIV-1 Reverse-Transcriptase Activity Sup T1 cells were treated with trimer core compound at 300 M for 6 hours and then infected with HIV-1 at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 0.1. At 96 hours post-infection, culture supernatant was removed and HIV-1 RT activity was assayed in triplicate as described by Henderson et al., Virology 1991, 182, 186. Briefly in this method, 25 l of culture supernatant was added to a 50 l cocktail containing 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 20 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 60 mM NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet p-40, 5 g/ml oligodeoxythymidylic acid, 10 g/ml polyriboadenylic acid, 10 M deoxythymidine triphosphate and 1mCi 32 Pthymidine 5-triphosphate. The mixture was incubated at 37 C. for 2 hours. Fifty microliters of the cocktail were then spotted onto diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) paper, dried, washed with 2SSC solution (three times for 10 minutes each time) and 95% ethanol (two times for 5 minutes each time), dried and exposed to radiographic film for 18 to 24 hours at 80 C. The filters were cut and final quantitation was determined by scintillation spectrometry. The data for the HIV-1 RT activity is shown in Table 1 as a percent of RT activity. Control values for RT activity ranged from 15,000 to 16,000 dpm 32 P incorporated. The mean of duplicate determinations is shown in Table 1. Variance did not exceed 5-10%. Activation of Recombinant Human GST-RNase L Human recombinant RNase L was expressed in E. coli (DH5) as a fusion protein of glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Activation of human recombinant GST-RNase L was measured as the percent of poly(U) 32 PpCp hydrolyzed in the presence of authentic 2,5-oligoadenylate trimer core or trimer core analog of the invention as described by Sobol et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1995, 270, 5963. The data is shown in Table 1 as the mean of duplicate determinations. Variance did not exceed 5-10%.

The mean of triplicate determinations is shown; variance did not exceed 5-10%. c Percent inhibition of reverse-transcriptase (HIV-1 RT) activity. Control values for HIV-1 RT activity ranged from 15000 to 16000 dpm incorporated. The mean of duplicate determinations is shown; variance did not exceed 5-10%. d The activation of recombinant human RNase L was measured as the percent hydrolysis of poly(U)-3- 32 PpCp in the presence of the trimers 22-29. The mean of duplicate determinations is shown; variance did not exceed 5-10%. The TCA-containing trimers 26-28 inhibited HIV-1 replication to the same extent as naturally occurring trimer 29, as determined by the inhibition of HIV-1-induced syncytia formation. In contrast to the trimers 26-28, the Ade Bn -containing trimers 22-25 inhibited HIV-1-induced syncytia formation1500-fold. On the other hand, the TCA-containing trimers 26-28 inhibited HIV-1 RT activity by 99.7, 99.7, and 99.5%, respectively; however, the inhibition of HIV-1 RT activity by the Ade Bn -containing trimers 22-25 was dependent on the position of the Ade Bn group in the oligonucleotide chain. The trimer 22, being N 6 -benzyl-substituted at the 5-terminus, inhibited HIV-1 RT activity by 33% compared to the trimers 23-25, which inhibited HIV-1 RT activity by 7.6, 16.7, and 10.6%. The TCA- and Ade Bn -containing (2-5)trimers inhibited recombinant human GST-RNase L activity as a function of the change in structure of the base moiety. The (2-5)trimer 26 with the TCA moiety at the 5-terminus activated GST-RNase L by 87.7%, compared to 50% hydrolysis of poly(U)-3- 32 PpCp with naturally occurring trimer 29. The (2-5)trimers 22-25 with the Ade Bn moiety instead of adenine activated GST-RNase L by 37.4, 34.8, O, and 13.6%, respectively. These data indicate that the adenine moiety at the 2,3-terminus of the (2-5)oligoadenylate trimer core 29 is essential for the activation of recombinant human RNase L.

Phosphorylation of Core Compounds The core compounds of the present invention may be 5-monophosphorylated according to the procedure of Sambrook el al., Molecular CloningA Laboratory Manual, 2 ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, pp. 5.68-5.71 (1989) with ATP with T4 polynucleotide kinase. 5-Monophosphorylation may be determined by reverse-phase HPLC analysis and confirmed by the subsequent hydrolysis of each 5-monophosphate derivative by 5-nucleotidase. Yields of phosphorylation range from 15% to 60%. In the case where the R 2 groups of all internucleotide bonds (Formula I) of the molecule comprise oxygen, i.e., the linkages comprise phosphodiester bonds, the 5-monophosphates are readily prepared by reacting the corresponding unphosphorylated core compound with POCl 3 . The 5-diphosphate and 5-triphosphate of the core compounds of the invention may be prepared by following the procedure of Example 8. EXAMPLE 8 All reactions are performed in glassware oven-dried at 125 C. for 18-24 hr. Core compound (400 OD units at 260 nm) is dissolved in 500 microliters of dry dimethylformamide (DMF) and dried in vacuo in a 10 ml conical flask at 35 C. This process is repeated three times. To the dry residue, 50 micromoles of triphenylphosphine, 100 micromoles of imidazole and 50 micromoles of dipyridinyl disulfide are added. The mixture is dissolved in 500 microliters dry DMF plus 50 microliters of dry dimethylsulfoxide. The solution is stirred with a stirring bar for 2 hr at room temperature. After 2 hr the solution is homogeneous (after 30 minutes, the solution begins to change to yellow). The solution is transferred dropwise to 10 ml of a 1% NaI/dry acetone (w/v) solution. The clear colorless precipitate which forms is the sodium salt of the 5-phosphoroimidazolidate. The precipitate is centrifuged at room temperature, the supernatant is decanted, and the precipitate is washed three times with 10 ml dry acetone. The centrifuging is repeated. The precipitate is dried over P 2 O 5 in vacuo for 2 hr. The precipitate is dissolved in 200 microliters of freshly prepared 0.5 M tributylammonium pyrophosphate in dry DMF. The solution is maintained at room temperature for 18 hr after which time the DMF is removed in vacuo. The residue is dissolved in 0.25M triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (TEAB) (pH 7.5). The 5-di and 5-triphosphate products are separated using a DEAE-Sephadex A25 column (HCO 3 -form; 120 cm) with a linear gradient of 0.25 M to 0.75 M TEAB. Fractions (10 ml) are collected. The product is observed by ultraviolet spectroscopy at 254 mn. The fractions containing the 5-di and 5-triphosphates are separately pooled and dried in vacuo. The TEAB is removed by repeated addition of water followed by lyophilization. The yield of the 5-diphosphate is about 5%; the yield of the 5-triphosphate is about 60%. All references cited with respect to synthetic, preparative and analytical procedures are incorporated by reference. The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof and, accordingly, reference should be made to the appended claims, rather than to the foregoing specification, as indication the scope of the invention.

The compounds containing an alkyl radical in position 16 can be obtained, for example, by the action of an alkyl halide, such as methyl iodide or ethyl iodide in the presence of a lithium complex. The compound containing a halogen in position 16 can be obtained, for example, by the action of bromine in an acid medium notably in acetic acid or also by the action of a halogenation agent such as N-bromo or N-chloro succinimide or N-bromo or N-chloro acetamide or also tertbutyl hypochlorite.

Kitazume et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc 1985, 107, 5186-5191, to a hydrogenation reaction, in the presence of a catalyst such as, for example, Raney nickel in methanol or platinum oxide in ethanol. The above saturated intermediate alcohol can also be prepared according to a process described by N. O. Brace, Journal of Fluorine Chemistry 20 (1982), 313-327, starting from iodo-pentafluoroethane which is condensed under pressure with allyl alcohol, in the presence of a catalyst such as, for example, azaisobutyronitrile (AIBN), Raney nickel in ethanol, tetra kis (triphenylphosphino) palladium in hexane or tin and silver acetate in methanol in order to obtain 2-iodo-4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentanol which is subjected to a hydrogenation reaction, for example, by hydrogen in the presence of palladium with 10% magnesia in methanol or of Raney nickel in ethanol, or by reaction with tributyl tin hydride in the presence of azoisobutyronitrile.

The compounds of formula (I) have useful pharmacological properties. Study of the products on the hormonal receptors has revealed that they possess in particular a remarkable anti-estrogen activity and antiproliferative properties, as the results of the tests given hereafter show.

The invention extends to pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one of the medicaments as defined above as active ingredient. The compounds of formula (I) are used by digestive, parenteral or local route, for example, by percutaneous route. They can be prescribed in the form of plain or sugar-coated tablets, capsules, granules, suppositories, pessaries, injectable preparations, ointments, creams, gels, microbeads, implants, patches; which are prepared according to the usual methods. The active ingredient or ingredients can be incorporated with excipients usually employed in these pharmaceutical compositions, such as talc, gum arabic, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, cocoa butter, aqueous or non-aqueous vehicles, fatty substances of animal or vegetable origin, paraffin derivatives, glycols, various wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents, preservatives.

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS Tablets were prepared corresponding to the following formula: Product of Example 5 . . . 50 mg Excipient (talc, starch, magnesium stearate) s.q. for a tablet completed at . . . 120 mg Pharmacological Study of the Products of the Invention 1Study of the activity of the products of the invention on the estrogen receptor of a mouse uterus: 18 to 21-day old impuberal female mice are sacrificed, the uteri are removed, then homogenized at 0 C., using a Potter teflon-glass in a TS buffered solution (10 mM Tris, 0.25 M saccharose, HCl pH 7.4) (1 g of tissue per 25 ml of TS). The homogenate is then ultracentrifuged (209,000 g30 mn.) at 0 C. The supernatant aliquots thus obtained are incubated at 25 C. for 5 hours, with a constant concentration (T) of tritiated estradiol in the presence of increasing concentrations either of unlabelled estradiol (0-100010 9 M), or of unlabelled product to be tested (1 to 2500010 9 M). The concentration of bound tritiated estradiol (B) is then measured in each incubate by the carbon-dextran adsorption technique. Calculation of the Relative Bond Affinity (RBA): The following two curves are drawn: the percentage of bound tritiated hormone B/BO as a function of the logarithm of the concentration of unlabelled reference hormone or as a function of the logarothm of the concentration of unlabelled test product. The straight line of the following equation: I 50 100(B/BO maxBmin/BO)/2 i.e. I 50 100(1Bmin/BO)/250 (1Bmin/BO) is determined. BO% of binding of the bound tritiated hormone in the absence of any unlabelled product. B% of the bound tritiated hormone in the presence of a concentration X of unlabelled product. B min% of bound tritiated hormone in the presence of a large excess of unlabelled reference hormone (500 nM). The intersections of the straight line I 50 and the curves allow the evaluation of the concentrations of unlabelled reference hormone (CH) and of the unlabelled test product (CX) which inhibit by 50% the specific binding of the tritiated hormone on the receptor. The relative bond affinity (RBA) of the test product is calculated by the equation: RBA100(CH)/(CX).

Description of the Test a) Cell Culture: MCF-7 lines are kept in culture in FCS medium (according to 1) at 37 C. in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 . Subconfluent cells are collected by trypsination (0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA) then rinsed by gentle centrifugation. A sample of cells in suspension is counted with a Malassez cell. b) Growth Study: The cells, resuspended in DSE medium (according to 1), are seeded at the rate of 50,000 cells per well in multiwell plates (24 wells of 2.5 cm 2 ). Twenty-four hours after seeding (DO), the product to be tested is added to the medium in ethanolic solution (final concentration of ethanol: 0.1%), at a concentration of 10 11 to 10 6 M, the control wells receiving the same ethanol concentration. The media are renewed every 48 hours. At the end of the experiment (D7 to D9), the medium is extracted and the cells are immediately fixed with 150 microlitres of methanol in order to dose the DNA. The anti-proliferative activity of the products is evaluated by their capacity to inhibit the increase of DNA c) DNA Dosage: The DNA is dosed by a fluorimetric method using DABA (3,5 diaminobenzoic acid) (according to 2): 150 microlitres of DABA are added to each well; the plates are then incubated for 45 mn at 56 C., then 2 ml of 1N HCl is added. The fluorescence is measured using a fluorimeter (excitation wavelength: 408 nm, emission wavelength: 510 nm). The quantity of DNA per well is evaluated relative to a reference scale obtained by treating a calf thymus DNA standard under the same conditions.

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to novel compounds that function as enzyme inhibitors, and particularly to a new class of non-peptide inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes. 2. Related Art Proteases are enzymes that cleave proteins at single, specific peptide bonds. Proteases can be classified into four generic classes; serine, thiol or cysteinyl, acid or aspartyl, and metalloproteases (Cuypers et al., J. Biol. Chem. 257:7086 (1982)). Proteases are essential to a variety of biological activities, such as digestion, formation and dissolution of blood clots, reproduction and the immune reaction to foreign cells and organisms. Aberrant proteolysis is associated with a number of disease states in man and other mammals. The human neutrophil proteases, elastase and cathepsin G, have been implanted as contributing to disease states marked by tissue destruction. These disease states include emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis, corneal ulcers and glomerular nephritis. (Barret, in Enzyme Inhibitors as Drugs, Sandler, ed., University Park Press, Baltimore, (1980)). Additional proteases such as plasmin, C-1 esterase, C-3 convertase, urokinase, plasminogen activator, acrosin, and kallikreins play key roles in normal biological functions of mammals. In many instances, it is beneficial to disrupt the function of one or more proteolytic enzymes in the course of therapeutically treating a mammal. Serine proteases include such enzymes as elastase (human leukocyte), cathepsin G, plasmin, C-1 esterase, C-3 convertase, urokinase, plasminogen activator, acrosin, chymotrypsin, trypsin, thrombin, factor Xa and kallikreins. Human leukocyte elastase is released by polymorphonuclear leukocytes at sites of inflammation and thus is a contributing cause for a number of disease states. Cathepsin G is another human neutrophil serine protease. Compounds with the ability of inhibit the activity of these enzymes are expected to have an anti-inflammatory effect useful in the treatment of gout, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases, and in the treatment of emphysema. Chymotrypsin and trypsin are digestive enzymes. Inhibitors of these enzymes are useful in treating pancreatitis. Inhibitors of urokinase and plasminogen activator are useful in treating excessive cell growth disease states, such as benign prostatic hypertrophy, prostatic carcinoma and psoriasis. The serine protease thrombin occupies a central role in hemostasis and thrombosis, and as a multifactorial protein, induces a number of effects on platelets, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, leukocytes, the heart, and neurons (Tapparelli et al., Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 14:366-376 (1993); Lefkovits and Topol, Circulation 90(3):1522-1536 (1994); Harker, Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 5 ( Suppl 1):S47-S58 (1994)). Activation of the coagulation cascade through either the intrinsic pathway (contact activation) or the extrinsic pathway (activation by exposure of plasma to a non-endothelial surface, damage to vessel walls or tissue factor release) leads to a series of biochemical events that converge on thrombin. Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen ultimately leading to a hemostatic plug (clot formation), potently activates platelets through a unique proteolytic cleavage of the cell surface thrombin receptor (Coughlin, Seminars in Hematology 31(4):270-277 (1994)), and autoamplifies its own production through a feedback mechanism. Thus, inhibitors of thrombin function have therapeutic potential in a host of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases, including: myocardial infarction; unstable angina; stroke; restenosis; deep vein thrombosis; disseminated intravascular coagulation caused by trauma, sepsis or tumor metastasis; hemodialysis; cardiopulmonary bypass surgery; adult respiratory distress syndrome; endotoxic shock; rheumatoid arthritis; ulcerative colitis; induration; metastasis; hypercoagulability during chemotherapy; Alzheimers disease; and Downs syndrome. Factor Xa is another serine protease in the coagulation pathway. Factor Xa associates with factor Va and calcium on a phospholipid membrane thereby forming a prothrombinase complex. This prothrombinase complex then converts prothrombin to thrombin (Claeson, Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 5:411-436 (1994); Harker, Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 5 (Suppl 1):S47-S58 (1994)). Inhibitors of factor Xa are thought to offer an advantage over agents that directly inhibit thrombin since direct thrombin inhibitors still permit significant new thrombin generation (Lefkovits and Topol, Circulation 90(3):1522-1536 (1994); Harker, Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 5 (Suppl 1):S47-S58 (1994)). A need continues to exist for non-peptidic compounds that are potent and selective protease inhibitors, and which possess greater bioavailability and fewer side-effects than currently available protease inhibitors. Accordingly, new classes of potent protease inhibitors, characterized by potent inhibitory capacity and low mammalian toxicity, are potentially valuable therapeutic agents for a variety of conditions, including treatment of a number of mammalian proteolytic disease states. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to novel compounds having one of Formulae I-III (below). Also provided are processes for preparing compounds of Formulae I-III. The novel compounds of the present invention are potent inhibitors of proteases, especially trypsin-like serine proteases, such as chymotrypsin, trypsin, thrombin, plasmin and factor Xa. Certain of the compounds exhibit antithrombotic activity via direct inhibition of thrombin, or are intermediates useful for forming compounds having antithrombotic activity. Other compounds are inhibitors of trypsin and/or chymotrypsin, and are the therefore useful in treating pancreatitis. Also provided are methods of inhibiting or treating aberrant proteolysis in a mammal and methods of treating thrombosis, ischemia, stroke, restenosis or inflammation in a mammal by administering an effective amount of a compound of Formulae I-III. Further provided are pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of Formulae I-III and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents.

Scheme Ia illustrates but is not limited to the preparation of compounds of Examples 1, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12. Each of R 1 through R 3 , R 6 through R 9 , n and m is as defined above; P a is a hydroxyl protecting group or hydrogen, and P b is an amino protecting group. Phenols 1 (where P is H) are converted to monosulfonates 2 by treatment with appropriate sulfonyl chlorides. Preferred conditions include treating phenol 1 with a sulfonyl chloride in a biphasic system composed of ether and an aqueous phase saturated with NaHCO 3 . Alternatively, the reaction may be effected first by deprotonating 1 with a strong base, most preferably NaH, in a polar organic solvent, such a DMF or tetrahydrofuran, followed by treating the deprotonated phenol with the sulfonyl chloride. Still alternatively, phenol 1, in a typical organic solvent, such as methylene chloride, may be converted to 2 by treating the phenol with sulfonyl chloride in the presence of an amine base, such as N-methylmorpholine. Phenols 1 may be monoprotected (P a is a protecting group) with a variety of protecting groups known in the art, such as esters and benzyl ethers (Green, T. W. Wuts, P. G. M., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York (1991)). Deprotection of the hydroxyl groups is routinely accomplished using reaction conditions well-known in the art. For example, deprotection of benzyl ethers may be effected through catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on carbon as a catalyst in solvents such as ethanol or tetrahydrofuran. Deprotection of an acetate is accomplished by basic hydrolysis, most preferably with sodium hydroxide in aqueous tetrahydrofuran. Phenols 2 are coupled to 3 (for LOH) using a Mitsunobu coupling procedure (Mitsunobu, O., Synthesis 1 (1981)) to provide 4. Preferred coupling conditions include using a trialkyphosphine or triarylphosphine, such as triphenylphosphine, in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or methylene chloride, and a dialkyl azodicarboxylate, such as diethyl azodicarboxylate. In some cases, it is advantageous to add an amine base such as N-methylmorpholine. The amine terminus of 3 is protected with a protecting group P b that is readily removed from 4. Amino-protecting groups are well known in the art (Greene, T. W. Wuts, P. G. M., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York (1991)). Deprotection of the amino group is effected by employing reaction conditions that are well known in the art. For example, the t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC) may be removed by exposure to strongly acidic medium, such as hydrogen chloride, in a suitable solvent, such as dioxane, or a mixed trifluoroacetic acid/methylene chloride solvent system. Benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz) groups may be removed by hydrogen using palladium on carbon as a catalyst in solvents such as ethanol or tetrahydrofuran. The resulting amine is then converted to amidine 5 in a manner similar to the procedure described by Nagahara et. al., J. Med. Chem. 37(8):1200-1207 (1994) wherein the amine is treated with an appropriate imidate in the presence of a base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine in an appropriate solvent such as DMF. Alternatively, the amine is treated with an appropriate imidiate in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydroxide, in an appropriate solvent, such as methanol. Scheme Ib illustrates but is not limited to the preparation of compounds of Examples 2 and 13. R 1 -R 3 , R 6 -R 8 , n, m P a and P b are each as defined above. Aryl ethers 8 are synthesized in a fashion analogous to synthesis of 5. Phenol 1 (P is H) is converted to derivative 6 by treating 1 with a strong base, preferably NaH, in a suitable solvent such as DMF, followed by addition of a reactive alkyl or benzyl compound, R 1 CH 2 X (where X is a reactive functional group such as iodine, chloride, bromide or alkylsulfonate). Alternatively, the Mitsunobu Reaction may be used with an appropriate R 1 CH 2 X (XOH) using the reaction conditions described above. The use of suitable alcohol protecting groups (P a ), such as esters, to suppress over-alkylation, is well known in the art (Greene, T. W. Wuts, P. G. M., Protective Groups in Organic Synthysis, 2nd edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York (1991)). The protecting group may then be removed using well-known techniques, for example by hydrolysis with aqueous NaOH, when an ester protecting group is employed. Phenol 6 is then converted to amidine 8 using the conditions described for formation of 5. Scheme II illustrates, but is not limited to, the preparation of compounds exemplified by Examples 3, 9 and 10. R 1 -R 3 , R 6 -R 10 , n, m, P a P b are as defined above. According to Scheme II, a nitrophenol 9 may be coupled to compound 3 by standard techniques. Preferably, the reaction is effected by the Mitsunobu reaction (where L is OH). Alternatively, 9 may be treated with a base, such as NaH, in a suitable solvent such as DMF or THF, followed by addition of 3 (where L is a reactive groups, such as Cl, Br, I or alkylsulfonate). The nitro group is thereafter reduced, for example, by catalytic reduction using palladium on carbon in a suitable solvent such as ethanol or tetrahydrofuran. The resulting product in then treated with an appropriate sulfonyl chloride (R 1 SO 2 Cl) to provide 11. Removal of the amine protecting group P b is accomplished by techniques known in the art. For example, the t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC) is removed by exposure to a strongly acidic medium, such as hydrogen chloride in a suitable solvent such as dioxane or trifluoroacetic acid in methylene chloride. Benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz) groups are removed by catalytic hydrogen using palladium on carbon as a catalyst in solvents such as ethanol or tetrahydrofuran. The resulting amine is then converted to amidine 12 in a manner similar to the procedure described by Nagahara et. al., J. Med. Chem 37(8):1200-1207 (1994) wherein the amine is treated with an appropriate imidate in the presence of a base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine in an appropriate solvent such as DMF. Alternatively, the amine is treated with an appropriate imidate in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide as base in an appropriate solvent such as methanol. N-Substituted sulfonamide derivative 13 is obtained by alkylation of 11 employing a suitable alkylating agent (R 10 X) in the presence of a base, most preferably Cs 2 CO 3 using a polar solvent such as DMF. Deprotection and amidination are then executed in a manner similar to the conversion of 11 to 12. Scheme III illustrates but is not limited to the preparation of compounds of Example 4. R 1 -R 3 , R 7 -R 10 , n, m and P b are each as defined above. According to Scheme III, nitroaniline 14 is converted to a sulfonamide by treatment with an appropriate sulfonyl chloride R 1 SO 2 Cl in the presence of a weak base, such as N-methylmorpholine. The resulting sulfonamide nitrogen is alkylated with a suitable alkylating agent (R 10 X) in the presence of a base, preferably an alkali metal carbonate such as Cs 2 CO 3 or K 2 CO 3 , using a polar solvent, such as DMF, to provide intermediate 15. After reduction of the nitro group, the resulting aniline is coupled to a carboxylic acid, 16, to provide amide 17. Amide coupling may be performed using any of a number of common peptide coupling reagents. Preferably, one of 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or Castros reagent (BOP) are employed (B. Castro et at., Tetrahedron Lett.: 1219 (1975)). Alternatively, 17 may be formed by coupling the aniline with the corresponding acid chloride of acid 16 in the presence of an acid scavenger, such as N-methylmorpholine. Amide 17 is converted to amine 18 by reduction of the amide functionally with an appropriate hydride reagent, preferably borane-THF complex or chlorotrimethylsilane and lithium borohydride. This reaction occurs in a suitable polar solvent, such as THF. Removal of the amine protecting group P b and formation of the amidine as described in Scheme II provides the desired compound 19. Alternatively the amide nitrogen may be alkylated using a strong base, such as sodium hydride, in a suitable polar solvent such as DMF, followed by treatment with an alkylating agent (R 10 X) to afford intermediate 20. Reduction of the amide, as executed in the formation of 18, to give 21 followed by deprotection and amidination as previously described provides the analogous compound 22. Scheme IV illustrates but is not limited to the preparation of compounds of Examples 6, 7, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. R 1 -R 3 , R 6 and n are each as defined above. Monosulfonates 2 are converted to cyano derivatives 24 by exposing 2 to a base, most preferably sodium hydride in a suitable solvent such as DMF, followed by addition 23, where L is a reactive group such as iodide, chloride, bromide, alkyl sulfonate, or aryl sulfonate. Alternatively, the Mitsunobu Reaction may be used with an appropriate alcohol 23, where LOH. The nitrile is submitted to amidino formation conditions such as those described by Nagahara et. at., J. Med. Chem. 37(8):1200-1207 (1994), wherein the nitrile is first exposed to a strong acid, preferably hydrogen chloride, in a suitable alcoholic solvent, preferably methanol or ethanol, which converts the nitrile to an imidate. Following brief isolation, the imidate is treated with an appropriate amine HNR 6 R 6 to effect formation of 25. Similarly, benzamidines 28 are prepared from 2 using appropriate benzonitrile derivatives 26. It is to be understood that in each of the above-mentioned schemes, an additional substituent, R 4 , may be present on the phenyl ring of the starting material. For medicinal use, the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, those salts in which the anion does not contribute significantly to toxicity or pharmacological activity of the organic cation, are preferred. The acid addition salts are obtained either by reaction of an organic base of Formulae I-XI with an organic or inorganic acid, preferably by contact in solution, or by any of the standard methods detailed in the literature available to any practioner skilled in the art. Examples of useful organic acids are carboxylic acids such as maleic acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, propionic acid, fumaric acid, isethionic acid, succinic acid, cyclamic acid, pivalic acid and the like; useful inorganic acids are hydrohalide acids such as HCl, HBr, HI; sulfuric acid; phosphoric acid and the like. Preferred acids for forming acid addition salts include HCl and acetic acid. The compounds of the present invention represent a novel class of potent inhibitors of metallo, acid, thio and serine proteases. Examples of the serine proteases inhibited by compounds within the scope of the invention include leukocyte neutrophil elastase, a proteolytic enzyme implicated in the pathogenesis of emphysema; chymotrypsin and trypsin, digestive enzymes; pancreatic elastase, and cathepsin G, a chymotrypsin-like protease also associated with leukocytes; thrombin and factor Xa, proteolytic enzymes in the blood coagulation pathway. Inhibition of thermolysin, a metalloprotease, and pepsin, an acid protease, are also contemplated uses of compounds of the present invention. The compounds of the present invention are preferably employed to inhibit trypsin-like proteases. An end use application of the compounds that inhibit chymotrypsin and trypsin is in the treatment of pancreatitis. For their end-use application, the potency and other biochemical parameters of the enzyme-inhibiting characteristics of the compounds of the present invention is readily ascertained by standard biochemical techniques well-known in the art. Actual dose ranges for their specific end-use application will, of course, depend upon the nature and severity of the disease state of the patient or animal to be treated, as determined by the attending diagnostician. It is expected that a useful dose range will be about 0.01 to 10 mg per kg per day for an effective therapeutic effect. Compounds of the present invention that are distinguished by their ability to inhibit either factor Xa or thrombin may be employed for a number of therapeutic purposes. As factor Xa or thrombin inhibitors, compounds of the present invention inhibit thrombin production. Therefore, these compounds are useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of states characterized by abnormal venous or arterial thrombosis involving either thrombin production or action. These states include, but are not limited to, deep vein thrombosis; disseminated intravascular coagulopathy which occurs during septic shock, viral infections and cancer; myocardial infarction; stroke, coronary artery bypass; hip replacement; and thrombus formation resulting from either thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCTA). The compounds of the present invention may also be used as an anticoagulant in extracorporeal blood circuits. By virtue of the effects of both factor Xa and thrombin on a host of cell types, such as smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and neutrophils, the compounds of the present invention find additional use in the treatment or prophylaxis of adult respiratory distress syndrome; inflammatory responses, such as edema; reperfusion damage; atherosclerosis; and restenosis following an injury such as balloon angioplasty, atherectomy, and arterial stent placement. The compounds of the present invention may be useful in treating neoplasia and metastasis as well as neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease. When employed as thrombin or factor Xa inhibitors, the compounds of the present invention may be administered in an effective amount within the dosage range of about 0.1 to about 500 mg/kg, preferably between 0.1 to 10 mg/kg body weight, on a regimen in single or 2-4 divided daily doses. When employed as inhibitors of thrombin, the compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with thrombolytic agents such as tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase, and urokinase. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with other antithrombotic or anticoagulant drugs such as, but not limited to, fibrinogen antagonists and thromboxane receptor antagonists. Human leucocyte elastase is released by polymorphonuclear leukocytes at sites of inflammation and thus is a contributing cause for a number of disease states. Thus, compounds of the present invention are expected to have an anti-inflammatory effect useful in the treatment of gout, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases, and in the treatment of emphysema. Cathepsin G has also been implicated in the disease states of arthritis, gout and emphysema, and in addition, glomerulonephritis and lung infestations caused by infections in the lung. In their end-use application the enzyme inhibitory properties of the compounds of Formulae I-XI is readily ascertained by standard biochemical techniques that are well-known in the art. The neutrophil elastase inhibitory properties of compounds within the scope of the present invention are determined by the following method. Neutrophil elastase is prepared by the procedure described by Baugh et al., Biochemistry 15: 836 (1979). Enzyme assays are conducted substantially according to the procedure disclosed by Nakajima et al., J. Biol. Chem. 254: 4027 (1979), in assay mixtures containing 0.10 M Hepes (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-ethanesulfonic acid) buffer, pH 7.5: 0.5 M NaCl; 10% dimethylsulfoxide; and 1.5010 4 M MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide as substrate. Inhibitors are evaluated by comparing enzymatic activity measured in the presence and absence of inhibitor. The Cathepsin G inhibitory properties of compounds within the scope of the present invention are determined by the following method. A preparation of partially purified human Cathepsin G is obtained by the procedure of Baugh et al., Biochemistry 15: 836 (1979). Leukocyte granules are a major source for the preparation of leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G (chymotrypsin-like activity). Leukocytes are lysed and granules are isolated. The leukocyte granules are extracted with 0.20 M sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and extracts are dialyzed against 0.05 M Tris buffer, pH 8.0 containing 0.05 M NaCl overnight at 4 C. A protein fraction precipitates during dialysis and is isolated by centrifugation. This fraction contains most of the chymotrypsin-like activity of leukocyte granules. Specific substrates are prepared for each enzyme, namely MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide and Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide. The latter is not hydrolyzed by leukocyte elastase. Enzyme preparations are assayed in 2.00 mL of 0.10 M Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.50 M NaCl, 10% dimethylsulfoxide and 0.0020 M Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide as a substrate. Hydrolysis of the p-nitroanilide substrate is monitored at 405 nm and at 25 C. Useful dose range for the application of compounds of the present invention as neutrophil elastase inhibitors and as Cathepsin G inhibitors will of course depend upon the nature and severity of the disease state, as determined by the attending diagnostician, with the range of 0.01 to 10 mg/kg of body weight, per day, being useful for the aforementioned disease states. Compounds of the present invention that inhibit urokinase or plasminogen activator are potentially useful in treating excessive cell growth disease state. As such the compounds of the present invention may also be useful in the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma, the treatment of psoriasis, and in their use as abortifacients. For their end-use application, the potency and other biochemical parameters of the enzyme inhibiting characteristics of the compounds of the present invention are readily ascertained by standard biochemical techniques well-known in the art. Actual dose ranges for their specific end-use application will, of course, depend upon the nature and severity of the disease state of the patient or animal to be treated as determined by the attending diagnostician. It is to be expected that the general end-use application dose range will be about 0.01 to 10 mg per kg per day for an effective therapeutic effect. Additional uses for compounds of the present invention include analysis of commercial reagent enzymes for active site concentration. For example, chymostrypisn is supplied as a standard reagent for use in clinical quantitation of chymostrypsin activity in pancreatic juices and feces. Such assays are diagnostic for gastrointestinal and pancreatic disorders. Pancreatic elastase is also supplied commercially as a reagent for quantitation of 1 -antitrypsin in plasma. Plasma 1 -antitrypsin increases in concentration during the course of several inflammatory diseases, and 1 -antitrypsin deficiencies are associated with increased incidence of lung disease. Compounds of the present invention can be used to enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of this assay by titrametric standardization of the commercial elastase supplied as a reagent. See, U.S. Pat. No. 4,499,082. Protease activity in certain protein extracts during purification of particular proteins is a recurring problem which can complicate and compromise the results of protein isolation procedures. Certain proteases present in such extracts can be inhibited during purification steps by compounds of the present invention, which bind tightly to various proteolytic enzymes. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered to any animal that can experience the beneficial effects of the compounds of the invention. Foremost among such animals are humans, although the invention is not intended to be so limited. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be administered by any means that achieve their intended purpose. For example, administration can be by parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, transdermal, buccal, or ocular routes. Alternatively, or concurrently, adminstration can be by the oral route. The dosage administered will be dependent upon the age, health, and weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment, and the nature of the effect desired. In addition to the pharmacologically active compounds, the new pharmaceutical preparations can contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries that facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations that can be used pharmaceutically. The pharmaceutical preparations of the present invention are manufactured in a manner that is, itself, known, for example, by means of conventional mixing, granulating, dragee-making, dissolving or lyophilizing processes. Thus, pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compound with solid excipients, optionally grinding the resulting mixture and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired or necessary, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as saccharides, for example, lactose or sucrose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and/or calcium phosphates, for example, tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, as well as binders, such as, starch paste, using, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinyl pyrrolidone. If desired, disintegrating agents can be added, such as, the above-mentioned starches and also carboxymethyl-starch, cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as, sodium alginate. Auxiliaries are, above all, flow-regulating agents and lubricants, for example, silica, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as, magnesium stearate or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings that, if desired, are resistant to gastric juices. For this purpose, concentrated saccharide solutions can be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. In order to produce coatings resistant to gastric juices, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as, acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose phthalate, are used. Dye stuffs or pigments can be added to the tablets or dragee coatings, for example, for identification or in order to characterize combinations of active compound doses. Other pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as, glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active compounds in the form of granules that may be mixed with fillers such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds are preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as, fatty oils or liquid paraffin. In addition, stabilizers may be added. Suitable formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form, for example, water-soluble salts, alkaline solutions and cyclodextrin inclusion complexes. Especially preferred alkaline salts are ammonium salts prepared, for example, with Tris, choline hydroxide, Bis-Tris propane, N-methylglucamine, or arginine. One or more modified or unmodified cyclodextrins can be employed to stabilize and increase the water solubility of compounds of the present invention. Useful cyclodextrins for this purpose are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,727,064, 4,764,604, and 5,024,998. In addition, suspensions of the active compounds as appropriate oily injection suspensions can be administered. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oil, for example, sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for example, ethyl oleate or triglycerides or polyethylene glycol-400 (the compounds are soluble in PEG-400). Aqueous injection suspensions can contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension, for example, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, and/or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain stabilizers. The following examples are illustrative, but not limiting, of the method and compositions of the present invention. Other suitable modifications and adaptations of the variety of conditions and parameters normally encountered and obvious to those skilled in the art are within the spirit and scope of the invention.

EXAMPLE 19 In Vitro Inhibition of Purified Enzymes Reagents All buffer salts were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, Mo.), and were of the highest purity available. The enzyme substrates, N-benzoyl-Phe-Val-Arg-p-nitroanilide (Sigma B7632), N-benzoyl-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (Sigma B2291), N-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Lys-p-nitroanilide (Sigma T6140), and N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Sigma S7388) were all obtained from Sigma. Human -thrombin and human factor Xa were obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, Ind.). Bovine trypsin was obtained from Sigma. K i Determinations All assays are based on the ability of the test compound to inhibit the enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis of a peptide p-nitroanilide substrate. In a typical K i determination, substrate is prepared in DMSO, and diluted into an assay buffer consisting of 50 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The final concentration for each of the substrates is listed below. In general, substrate concentrations are lower than the experimentally determined value for K m . Test compounds are prepared as a 0.16 mg/mL solution in DMSO. Dilutions are prepared in DMSO yielding 8 final concentrations encompassing a 200-fold concentration range. Enzyme solutions are prepared at the concentrations listed below in assay buffer. In a typical K i determination, into each well of a 96 well plate is pipetted 280 uL of substrate solution, 10 L of inhibitor solution, and the plate allowed to thermally equilibrate at 37 C. in a Molecular Devices plate reader for 10 minutes. Reactions were initiated by the addition of a 20 L aliquot of enzyme, and the absorbance increase at 405 nm is recorded for 15 minutes. Data corresponding to less than 10% of the total substrate hydrolysis were used in the calculations. The ratio of the velocity (rate of the change in absorbance as a function of time) for a sample containing no inhibitor is divided by the velocity of a sample containing inhibitor, and is plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration. The data are fit to a linear regression, and the value of the slope of the line calculated. The inverse of the slope is the experimentally determined K i value. Thrombin Thrombin activity was assessed as the ability to hydrolyze the substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Arg-pNA.

The alkoximinomethyldioxazine compounds have the structure: The invention relates to novel alkoximinomethyldioxazine derivatives, to a process for their preparation and to their use as fungicides, and also to novel intermediates and to a plurality of processes for their preparation. It is already known that certain alkoximinomethyldioxazine derivatives of a constitution similar to those described below have fungicidal properties (compare, for example, WO-A 9504728). However, the fungicidal activity of these compounds, in particular at low application rates, leaves something to be desired. The novel alkoximinomethyldioxazine derivatives of the general formula (I) have now been found in which G represents a single bond, alkanediyl which is optionally interrupted by heteroatoms (but where the carbon atom to which R 1 is attached is always linked to a carbon atom of the alkanediyl chain) or a grouping in which R 3 represents in each case optionally substituted alkyl or cycloalkyl, R 1 represents hydrogen, cyano or in each case optionally substituted alkyl or cycloalkyl, R 2 represents hydrogen or in each case optionally substituted alkyl or cycloalkyl, Z represents in each case optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkinyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl or heterocyclyl and E 1 , E 2 , E 3 and E 4 are identical or different and, independently of one another, each represents hydrogen, alkyl, halogenoalkyl or hydroxyalkyl, or E 1 and E 2 or E 1 and E 3 or E 3 and E 4 together with the respective carbon atoms to which they are attached form a cycloaliphatic ring and L 1 , L 2 , L 3 and L 4 , are identical or different and, independently of one another, each represents hydrogen, halogen, cyano, nitro, in each case optionally halogen-substituted alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, alkylsulphinyl or alkylsulphonyl. In the definitions, the saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon chains, such as alkyl, alkanediyl, alkenyl or Alkinyl, are in each case straight-chain or branched, including in combination with heteroatoms, such as in alkoxy, alkylthio or alkylamino. If an alkyl or alkanediyl chain is interrupted by more than one heteroatom, these can be identical or different. If an alkyl or alkanediyl chain is interrupted by more than one oxygen atom, two oxygen atoms are not directly adjacent. Halogen generally represents fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, and also pseudohalogens, such as, for example, cyano, preferably fluorine, chlorine, bromine or cyano, in particular fluorine or chlorine. Aryl represents aromatic, mono or polycyclic hydrocarbon rings, such as, for example, phenyl, naphthyl, anthranyl, phenanthryl, preferably phenyl of naphthyl, in particular phenyl. Heterocyclyl represents saturated or unsaturated, and also aromatic, cyclic compounds in which at least one ring member is a heteroatom, i.e. an atom different from carbon. If the ring contains a plurality of heteroatoms, these can be identical or different. Preferred heteroatoms are oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur. If appropriate, the cyclic compounds form a polycyclic ring system together with other carbocyclic or heterocyclic, fused-on or bridged rings. Preference is given to mono- or bicyclic ring systems, in particular to mono- or bicyclic aromatic ring systems. Cycloalkyl represents saturated, carbocyclic, cyclic compounds which, if appropriate, form a polycyclic ring system with other carbocyclic, fused-on or bridged rings. Furthermore, it has been found that the novel alkoximinomethyldioxazine derivatives of the general formula (I) are obtained when (process a) 3-(1-hydroxyphenyl-1-alkoximinomethyl)dioxazines of the general formula in which E 1 , E 2 , E 3 , E 4 , L 1 , L 2 , L 3 and L 4 each as defined above, are reacted with an acrylic acid halide of the general formula (III) in which G, R 1 , R 2 and Z are each as defined above, and X represents halogen, if appropriate in the presence of a diluent and if appropriate in the presence of an acid acceptor. Finally, it has been found that the novel alkoximinomethyldioxazine derivatives of the general formula (I) have very strong fungicidal activity. The compounds according to the invention may, if appropriate, be present as mixtures of different possible isomeric forms, in particular of stereoisomers, such as, for example, 20 E- and Z- or optical isomers. What is claimed are both the E and the Z isomers, the individual enantiomers, the racemates, and also any mixtures of these isomers.

CROSS REFERENCE This application claims the benefit of the following provisional application: U.S. Ser. No: 60/170,675, filed Dec. 14, 1999, under 35 USC 119(e)(i). FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel benzoic acid esters of oxazolidinones having a hydroxyacetylpiperazine substituent and their preparations. These compounds have potent activities against gram positive and gram-negative bacteria. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The oxazolidinone antibacterial agents are a novel synthetic class of antimicrobials with potent activity against a number of human and veterinary pathogens, including gram-positive aerobic bacteria such as multiply-resistant staphylococci and streptococci, anaerobic organisms such as bacteroides and clostridia species, and acid-fast organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium. However, oxazolidinones generally do not demonstrate an activity at a useful level against aerobic gram-negative organisms. Thus, the use of these oxazolidinone antibacterial agents is limited to infectious states due to gram-positive bacteria. Accordingly, it is among the objects of the present invention to provide pharmaceutical compounds, which have broader antibacterial activity including the activity against aerobic gram-negative organisms. We have now discovered that the oxazolidinones of the present invention increase the spectrum of activity to include gram-negative organisms such as Haemophilus influenza and Moraxella catarrhalis . In addition, the compounds of the present invention are excellent water soluble agents, which makes them particularly useful for IV and oral administration for the treatment of microbial infections. INFORMATION DISCLOSURE U.S. Pat. No. 5,652,238 discloses carboxylic and phosphate esters of substituted-hydroxyacetyl piperazine phenyl oxazolidinones. PCT International Publication WO 98/54161 discloses oxazolidinone antibacterial agents having a thiocarbonyl functionality.

The following Schemes describe the preparation of compounds of the present invention. All of the starting materials are prepared by procedures described in these schemes or by procedures that would be well known to one of ordinary skill in organic chemistry. The variables used in the Schemes are as defined below or as in the claims. The compounds of this invention can be prepared in accordance to one or more of the Schemes discussed below. As shown in Scheme I, compound 1-a with an appropriate amino protecting group (P) is esterified with either 3- or 4-nitrobenzoyl chloride to provide compound 1-b. In this reaction a tertiary amine base such as triethylamine may be used to neutralize the hydrogen chloride formed. Non-protic solvents such as CH 2 Cl 2 or THF and temperatures in the range of 0-24 C. are suitable for this reaction. Protecting groups (P) are chosen for their compatibility with the chemistry and functional groups of the molecules being synthesized. For the compounds synthesized in Examples 1-12 tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) is a suitable protecting group; however, depending on the chemistry and compounds desired other protecting groups may be employed. Synthesis of Compound 1-b wherein P is Boc is described in PCT International Publication WO 98/54161 and exemplified in Example 1 of the present invention. The nitro group of Compound 1-b is reduced to the amine to provide compound 1-c. This is conveniently accomplished by catalytic hydrogenation with a palladium catalyst in solvents such as MeOH, EtOH and CH 2 Cl 2 at room temperature; however, other catalytic or chemical methods known to one skilled in the art can be employed if desired. Compound 1-c where R 5 is methyl can be obtained by alkylating the amine formed in this reaction. Acylating the aniline 1-c with an appropriately activated amino acid derivative provides 1-d. Example 11, Step 3 illustrates the use of an acid chloride and tertiary amine base for this reaction; however, condensing agents such as 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole and 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole which are well known in the art of peptide chemistry can also be used for this reaction. In Schemes I, II and III when R 6 contains an OH or SH and when R 7 and or R 8 are hydrogen a protecting group (P) may be required. Example 11, Step 3 illustrates the use of 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) for protecting the amino group of glycine. Fmoc is stable to conditions suitable for removing Boc (Example 11, Step 4) but can be readily removed (piperidine in DMF) in the presence of a thioamide (Example 11, Step 6). The benzyloxycarbonyl can also be removed (HBr/HOAc) in the presence of a thioamide and is thus a suitable P group. Compound 1-d is deprotected to provide 1-e. Acylating 1-e provides 1-f. Any additional protecting groups (P) can be then removed at this stage. Removal of the Boc protecting group from 1-d can be conveniently carried out with HCl in dioxane to give the hydrochloride salt of the amine. This salt can often be used directly in the subsequent acylation. Acylation of the amine or amine hydrochloride 1-e with dithioesters and a tertiary amine base to give thioamides is carried out in solvents such as CH 2 Cl 2 , THF or preferably MeOH at temperatures in the range of 24-50 C. Preparations of other thiocarbonyl compounds can be prepared according to the procedures described in PCT International Publication WO 98/54161. In Scheme II the intermediate alcohol 2-a is esterified with a 3- or 4-(1-chloroalkyl)benzoyl chloride and a tertiary amine base in an appropriate solvent such as CH 2 Cl 2 at a temperature in the range of 0-40 C. to give compound 2-b. Alkylation of an amine with 2-b provides compound 2-c. The reaction can be carried out in solvents such as acetone or CH 2 Cl 2 with a catalytic amount of sodium iodide at a temperature ranging from ambient to the reflux temperature of the solvent. Deprotection of 2-c to provide 2-d, and the preparation of compounds 2-e are carried out by the same procedures described in Scheme I. In Scheme II the alcohol intermediate 3-a is esterified with an appropriately substituted benzoic acid to provide compound 3-b. As described in Schemes I and II, the acid chlorides and a tertiary amine base can be used for this reaction. In addition this reaction can be carried out with reagent systems such as 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 4-dimethylaminopyridine or triphenylphosphine and diethyl azodicarboxylate. The remaining steps which lead to the compounds of formula I of the present invention are carried out by the same procedures described in Schemes I and II. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be prepared by combining the compounds of Formula I of this invention with a solid or liquid pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, optionally, with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants and excipient employing standard and conventional techniques. Solid form compositions include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. A solid carrier can be at least one substance which may also function as a diluent, flavoring agent, solubilizer, lubricant, suspending agent, binder, tablet disintegrating agent, and encapsulating agent. Inert solid carriers include magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulosic materials, low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. Liquid form compositions include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. For example, there may be provided solutions of the compounds of this invention dissolved in water and water-propylene glycol and water-polyethylene glycol systems, optionally containing suitable conventional coloring agents, flavoring agents, stabilizers and thickening agents. Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition is provided employing conventional techniques in unit dosage form containing effective or appropriate amounts of the active component, that is, the compounds of formula I according to this invention. The quantity of active component, that is the compound of formula I according to this invention, in the pharmaceutical composition and unit dosage form thereof may be varied or adjusted widely depending upon the particular application, the potency of the particular compound and the desired concentration. Generally, the quantity of active component will range between 0.5% to 90% by weight of the composition. In therapeutic use for treating, or combating, bacterial infections in warm-blooded animals, the compounds or pharmaceutical compositions thereof will be administered orally, topically, transdermally, and/or parenterally at a dosage to obtain and maintain a concentration, that is, an amount, or blood-level of active component in the animal undergoing treatment which will be antibacterially effective. Generally, such antibacterially effective amount of dosage of active component will be in the range of about 0.1 to about 100, more preferably about 1.0 to about 50 mg/kg of body weight/day. It is to be understood that the dosages may vary depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the bacterial infection being treated, and the particular compound being used. Also, it is to be understood that the initial dosage administered may be increased beyond the above upper level in order to rapidly achieve the desired blood-level or the initial dosage may be smaller than the optimum and the daily dosage may be progressively increased during the course of treatment depending on the particular situation. If desired, the daily dose may also be divided into multiple doses for administration, e.g., two to four times per day. The compounds of formula I according to this invention are administered parenterally, i.e., by injection, for example, by intravenous injection or by other parenteral routes of administration. Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration will generally contain a pharmaceutically acceptable amount of the compound according to formula I as a soluble salt (acid addition salt or base salt) dissolved in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as, for example, water-for-injection and a buffer to provide a suitably buffered isotonic solution, for example, having a pH of about 3.5-6. Suitable buffering agents include, for example, trisodium orthophosphate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate, N-methylglucamine, L()-lysine and L()-arginine to name but a few representative buffering agents. The compounds according to formula I generally will be dissolved in the carrier in an amount sufficient to provide a pharmaceutically acceptable injectable concentration in the range of about 1 mg/ml to about 400 mg/ml of solution. The resulting liquid pharmaceutical composition will be administered so as to obtain the above-mentioned antibacterially effective amount of dosage. The compounds of formula I according to this invention are advantageously administered orally in solid and liquid dosage forms. The oxazolidinone antibacterial agents of this invention have useful activity against a variety of organisms. The in vitro activity of compounds of this invention can be assessed by standard testing procedures such as the determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by agar dilution as described in Approved Standard.

This application is A 371 of PCT/US 99/02419 filed Feb. 4, 1999. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention is in the field of medicinal chemistry. In particular, the invention relates to novel substituted semicarbazides and the discovery that these compounds are anticonvulsants and act as blockers of sodium (Na ) channels. 2. Related Background Art Several classes of therapeutically useful drugs, including local anesthetics such as lidocaine and bupivacaine, antiarrhythmics such as propafenone and amioclarone, and anticonvulsants such as lamotrigine, phenytoin and carbamazepine. have been shown to share a common mechanism of action by blocking or modulating Na channel activity (Catterall, W. A., Trends Pharmacol. Sci . 8:57-65 (1987)). Each of these agents is believed to act by interfering with the rapid influx of Na ions. Recently, other Na channel blockers such as BW619C89 and lifarizine have been shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of global and focal ischemia and are presently in clinical trials (Graham et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther . 269:854-859 (1994); Brown et al., British J. Pharmacol . 115:1425-1432 (1995); SCRIP 1870:8 (1993); SCRIP 1773:14 (1992)). The neuroprotective activity of Na channel blockers is due to their effectiveness in decreasing extracellular glutamate concentration during ischemia by inhibiting the release of this excitotoxic amino acid neurotransmitter. Studies have shown that unlike glutamate receptor antagonists, Na channel blockers prevent hypoxic damage to mammalian white matter (Stys et al., J. Neurosci . 12:430-439 (1992)). Thus, they may offer advantages for treating certain types of strokes or neuronal trauma where damage to white matter tracts is prominent. Another example of clinical use of a Na channel blocker is riluzole. This drug has been shown to prolong survival in a subset of patients with ALS (Bensimm et al., New Engl. J. Med . 330:585-591 (1994)) and has subsequently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of ALS. In addition to the above-mentioned clinical uses, carbamazepine, lidocaine and phenytoin are occasionally used to treat neuropathic pain, such as from trigeminal neurologia, diabetic neuropathy and other forms of nerve damage (Taylor and Meldrum, Trends Pharmacol. Sci . 16:309-316 (1995)), and carbamazepine and lamotrigine have been used for the treatment of manic depression (Denicott et al., J. Clin. Psychiatry 55: 70-76 (1994)). It has been established that there are at least five to six sites on the voltage-sensitive Na channels which bind neurotoxins specifically (Catterall, W. A., Science 242:50-61 (1988)). Studies have further revealed that therapeutic antiarrhythmics, anticonvuisants and local anesthetics whose actions are mediated by Na channels, exert their action by interacting with the intracellular side of the Na channel and allosterically inhibiting interaction with neurotoxin receptor site 2 (Catterall, W. A., Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol . 10:15-43 (1980)). PCT International Published Application WO96/40628 discloses semicarbazones represented by the following Formula: where R 1 -R 4 are independently hydrogen, halogen, C 1-9 alkyl, C 3-9 cycloalkyl, cyano, C 1-9 alkoxy, or C 6-10 aryloxy; R 5 is hydrogen, C 1-9 alkyl, C 3-9 cycloalkyl, or C 6-10 aryl; and X is oxygen or sulfur. The compounds are disclosed to be useful as anticonvulsants. However, it was not suggested or implicated that semicarbazides, which can be prepared by reduction of the semicarbazones, also will act as anticonvulsants. Dimmock et al., J. Med. Chem . 39:3984-3997 (1996) discloses (aryloxy)aryl semicarbazones that displayed anticonvulsant activities when administered intraperitoneally to mice or orally to rats. However, it was not suggested or implicated that semicarbazides, which can be prepared by reduction of the semicarbazones, also will act as anticonvulsants. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is related to the surprising discovery that novel substituted semicarbazides represented by Formula I are anticonvulsants and act as blockers of sodium (Na ) channels. Although the semicarbazides of Formula I can be prepared by reduction of the corresponding semicarbazones, semicarbazides and semicarbazones are two different classes of compounds. Semicarbazide is a base due to the presence of the basic N-1 nitrogen. Semicarbazone is not a base but the NH group on N-2 nitrogen is slightly acidic. The CN double bond in semicarbazone make it a relatively rigid molecule. The CN single bond in semicarbazide make it a relatively non-rigid molecule. Therefore it is a surprising discovery that semicarbazides of this invention as represented by Formula I are anticonvulsants and act as blockers of sodium (Na ) channels, similar to semicarbazones. The invention is also related with treating a disorder responsive to the blockade of sodium channels in a mammal suffering from excess activity of said channels by administering an effective amount of a compound of Formula I as described herein. The present invention is also directed to the use of a compound of Formula I for the treatment of neuronal damage following global and focal ischemia, and for the treatment or prevention of neurodegenerative conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as antimanic depressants, as local anesthetics, as antiarrhythmics, as anticonvulsants and for the treatment or prevention of diabetic neuropathy and for the treatment of pain including both acute and chronic pain and migraine headache. A first aspect of the present invention is directed to the novel substituted semicarbazides of Formula I. A second aspect of the present invention is directed to the novel compounds of Formula I as blockers of sodium channels. A third aspect of the present invention is to provide a method for treating, preventing or ameliorating neuronal loss following global and focal ischemia; treating, preventing or ameliorating pain including acute and chronic pain, and neuropathic pain; treating, preventing or ameliorating neurodegenerative conditions; treating, preventing or ameliorating manic depression; treating local anesthesia, arrhythmias, and convulsion by administering a compound of Formula I to a mammal in need of such treatment. A fourth aspect of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition useful for treating disorders responsive to the blockade of sodium ion channels, containing an effective amount of a compound of Formula I in a mixture with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents. A fifth aspect of the present invention is directed to methods for preparing novel compounds of Formula I.

The invention is also directed to a method for treating disorders responsive to the blockade of sodium channels in animals suffering thereof. Particular preferred embodiments of the substituted semicarbazides for use in method of this invention are represented by previously defined Formula I.

Compounds with Formulae I-VI can be prepared as illustrated by exemplary reaction in Scheme I from reduction of the corresponding semicarbazones. The compounds of the present invention were assessed by electrophysiological assays in dissociated hippocampal neurons for sodium channel blocker activity. These compounds also could be assayed for binding to the neuronal voltage-dependent sodium channel using rat forebrain membranes and 3 HBTX-B. Sodium channels are large transmembrane proteins that are expressed in various tissues. They are voltage sensitive channels and are responsible for the rapid increase of Na permeability in response to depolarization associated with the action potential in many excitable cells including muscle, nerve and cardiac cells. One aspect of the present invention is the discovery of the mechanism of action of the compounds herein described as specific Na channel blockers. Based upon the discovery of this mechanism, these compounds are contemplated to be useful in treating or preventing neuronal loss due to focal or global ischemia, and in treating or preventing neurodegenerative disorders including ALS, anxiety, and epilepsy. They are also expected to be effective in treating, preventing or ameliorating neuropathic pain, surgical pain and chronic pain. The compounds are also expected to be useful as antiarrhythmics, anesthetics and antimanic depressants. The present invention is directed to compounds of Formulae I that are blockers of voltage-sensitive sodium channels. According to the present invention, those compounds having preferred sodium channel blocking properties exhibit an IC 50 of about 100 M or less in the electrophysiological assay described herein. Preferably, the compounds of the present invention exhibit an IC 50 of 10 M or less. Most preferably, the compounds of the present invention exhibit an IC 50 of about 1.0 M or less. Substituted semicarbazides of the present invention may be tested for their Na channel blocking activity by the following electrophysiological and binding assays. Electrophysiological Assay: Cellpreparation: HEK-293 cells stably expressing the hSkM1 isoform of Na channels (generous gift from Dr. A. L. George, Vanderbilt University Medical School) were cultured using standard techniques, as described previously (Verdoorn, T. A, et al., Neuron 4:919-928 (1990)). For electrophysiology, cells were plated onto 35 mm Petri dishes (pre-coated with poly-D-lysine) at a density of 1:40 on the day of re-seeding from confluent cultures. Cells are suitable for recordings for 2-3 days after plating. Patch-clamp recordings of voltage-sensitive Na currents: Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made using conventional patch-clamp techniques (Hamill et al, Pfluegers Arch . 391:85-100 (1981)) with an Axopatch 200 A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, Calif.). Recordings were made within 2-3 hours after neuron dissociation. The recording chamber was continuously superfused with the external solution (150 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4 (NaOH)) at a speed of about 1 ml/min. Recording pipettes were pulled from thick-walled capillaries (WPI, Sarasota, Fla.) and fire-polished. The pipette resistances ranged from 1 to 3 M when the pipettes were filled with internal solution containing (in mM): 110 CsF, 10 NaCl, 5 MgCl 2 , 11 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with CsOH. Osmolality was set with a difference of 15-20 mmol/kg between external and internal solutions (lower inside the cell). Drugs and intervening wash-outs were applied through a linear array of flow pipes (Drummond Microcaps, 2-l, 64-mm length). Compounds are dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to make a 30 mM stock solution, which was subsequently diluted into the external solution to give final concentrations of 0.1-100 M. At the highest (1%) concentration, DMSO inhibited the size of Na current only slightly. Currents were recorded at room temperature (22-25 C.), filtered at 5 kHz with an active 8-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, Mass.), digitized at 10-50-s intervals, and stored using Digidata 1200 analog/digital interface with Pclamp6/Clampex software (Axon Instruments). Series resistance was cancelled typically by 75% when necessary. The inhibitory potency of drugs was assessed by measuring reductions in the peak amplitude of Na currents induced by increasing concentrations of compounds tested. Na currents were elicited by stepping membrane voltage from holding potentials over the range 100 mV to 50 mV, to a pulse potential of 10 mV. The test pulse duration was 5-10 msec, repeated at a frequency 1 Hz. Concentration-inhibition curves were fitted with equation 1: I/I control 1/(1(compound/IC 50 ))Eq. 1 where I control is the maximal Na current in the absence of antagonist, compound is the drug concentration, and IC 50 is the concentration of compound that produces half maximal inhibition. Binding Assay: The ability of compounds of the present invention to modulate either site 1 or site 2 of the Na channel was determined following the procedures fully described in Yasushi, J. Biol. Chem . 261:6149-6152 (1986) and Creveling, Mol. Pharmacol . 23:350-358 (1983), respectively. Rat forebrain membranes were used as sources of Na channel proteins. The binding assays were conducted in 130 M choline chloride at 37 C. for 60-minute incubation with 3 H saxitoxin and 3 H batrachotoxin as radioligands for site 1 and site 2, respectively. The compounds of the present invention may be tested for in vivo anticonvulsant activity after iv. po or ip injection using a number of anticonvulsant tests in mice (audiogenic seizure model in DBA-2 mice, pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in mice, maximum electroshock seizure test (MES)). The compounds may be tested for their neuroprotective activity after focal and global ischemia produced in rats or gerbils according to the procedures described in Buchan et al. (Stroke, Suppl. 148-152 (1993)) and Sheardown et al. ( Eur. J. Pharmacol . 236:347-353 (1993)) and Graham et al. ( J. Pharmacol Exp. Therap . 276:1-4 (1996)). The compounds may be tested for their neuroprotective activity after traumatic spinal cord injury according to the procedures described in Wrathall et. al. ( Exp. Neurology 137:119-126 (1996)) and Iwasaki et. al. ( J. Neuro Sci . 134:21-25 (1995)).

EXAMPLE 3 1-4-(4-Fluorophenoxy)benzylsemicarbazide as Anticonvulsant The ability of 1-4-(4-fluorophenoxy)benzylsemicarbazide to block maximal electroshock-induced seizures (MES) was determined by the following procedure. Seizures were induced by application of current (50 mA, 60 pulses/sec, 0.8 msec pulse width, 1 sec duration, D.C.) using a Ugo Basile ECT device (model 7801). Mice were restrained by gripping the loose skin on their dorsal surface and saline-coated corneal electrodes were held lightly against the two cornea. Current was applied and mice were observed for a period of up to 30 sec for the occurrence of a tonic hindlimb extensor response. A tonic seizure was defined as a hindlimb extension in excess of 90 degrees from plane of the body. 1-4-(4-Fluorophenoxy)benzylsemicarbazide was administered iv to mice 10 min before the test procedure. The compound exhibited protection against MES with an ED 50 (the dose protecting 50% of animals) of 4.2 mg/kg. 1-3-Fluoro-4-(4-fluorophenoxy)benzylsemicarbazide was tested po in mice and was found to have an ED 50 of 3.2 mg/kg. EXAMPLE 4 Activity of 1-(4-(4-Fluorophenoxy)benzylsemicarbazide as Sodium Channel Blocker 1-4-(4-Fluorophenoxy)benzylsemicarbazide was tested in the electro-physiological and binding assays described above and produced dose-dependent inhibition of voltage-gated sodium currents recorded HEK-293 cells stably expressing hSkM 1 sodium channels. The blocking effect of this compound on Na currents was highly sensitive to the holding voltage, indicating that 1-4-(4-fluorophenoxy)benzylsemicarbazide binds to voltage-sensitive Na channels in their inactivated states and has weak potency towards Na channels in their resting states (Ragsdale et al., Mol. Pharmacol . 40:756-765 (1991); Kuo and Bean, Mol. Pharmacol . 46:716-725 (1994)). The apparent antagonist dissociation constant (K d ) of this compound for inactivated sodium channels is 7.5 M.

RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application Serial No. 60/021,716, filed Jul. 12, 1996, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Chemoattractant cytokines or chemokines are a family of proinflammatory mediators that promote recruitment and activation of multiple lineages of leukocytes and lymphocytes. They can be released by many kinds of tissue cells after activation. Continuous release of chemokines at sites of inflammation mediates the ongoing migration of effector cells in chronic inflammation. The chemokines characterized to date are related in primary structure. They share four conserved cysteines, which form disulfide bonds. Based upon this conserved cysteine motif, the family is divided into two main branches, designated as the CXC chemokines (-chemokines), and the CC chemokines (-chemokines), in which the first two conserved cysteines are separated by an intervening residue, or adjacent respectively (Baggiolini, M. and Dahinden, C. A., Immunology Today , 15:127-133 (1994)). The CXC chemokines include a number of potent chemoattractants and activators of neutrophils, such as interleukin 8 (IL-8), PF4 and neutrophil-activating peptide-2 (NAP-2). The CC chemokines include RANTES (Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted), the macrophage inflammatory proteins 1 and 1 (MIP-1 and MIP-1), and human monocyte chemotatic proteins 1-3 (MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3), which have been characterized as chemoattractants and activators of mcnocytes or lymphocytes but do not appear to be chemoattractants for neutrophils. Chemokines, such as RANTES and MIP-1, have been implicated in a wide range of human acute and chronic inflammatory diseases including respiratory diseases, such as asthma and allergic disorders. The chemokine receptors are members of a superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) which share structural features that reflect a common mechanism of action of signal transduction (Gerard, C. and Gerard, N. P., Annu Rev. Immunol ., 12:775-808 (1994); Gerard, C. and Gerard, N. P., Curr. Opin. Immunol ., 6:140-145 (1994)). Conserved features include seven hydrophobic domains spanning the plasma membrane, which eLre connected by hydrophilic extracellular and intracebllular loops. The majority of the primary sequence homology occurs in the hydrophobic transmembrane regions with the hydrophilic regions being more diverse. The first receptor for the CC chemokines that was cloned and expressed binds the chemokines MIP-1 and RANTES. Accordingly, this MIP-1/RANTES receptor was designated CC chemokine receptor 1 (also referred to as CCR-1; Neote, K., et al., Cell , 72:415-425 (1993); Horuk, R. et al., WO 94/11504, May 26, 1994; Gao, J.-I. et al., J. Exp. Med ., 177:1421-1427 (1993)). Three new receptors have been characterized which bind and/or signal in response to RANTES: CCR3 mediates binding and signaling of chemokines including eotaxin, RANTES, and MCP-3 (Ponath et al., J. Exp. Med ., 183:2437 (1996)), CCR4 binds chemokines including RANTES, MIP-1, and MCP-1 (Power, et al., J. Biol. Chem ., 270:19495 (1995)), and CCR5 binds chemokines including MIP-1, RANTES, and MIP-1 (Samson, et al., Biochem . 35: 3362-3367 (1996)). RANTES is a chemotactic chemokine for a variety of cell types, including monocytes, eosinophils, and a subset of T-cells. The responses of these different cells may not all be mediated by the same receptor, and it is possible that the receptors CCR1, CCR4 and CCR5 will show some selectivity in receptor distribution and function between leukocyte types, as has already been shown for CCR3 (Ponath et al.). In particular, the ability of RANTES to induce the directed migration of monocytes and a memory population of circulating T-cells (Schall, T. et al., Nature , 347:669-71 (1990)) suggests this chemokine and its receptor(s) may play a critical role in chronic inflammatory diseases, since these diseases are characterized by destructive infiltrates of T cells and monocytes. Many existing drugs have been developed as antagonists of the receptors for biogenic amines, for example, as antagonists of the dopamine and histamine receptors. No successful antagonists have yet been developed to the receptors for the larger proteins such as chemokines and C5a. Small molecule antagonists of he interaction between CC chemokine receptors and their ligands, including RANTES and MIP-1, would provide compounds useful for inhibiting harmful inflammatory processes triggered by receptor ligand interaction, as well as valuable tools for the investigation of receptor-ligand interactions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that a number of small organic molecules are antagonists of chemokine receptor function and can inhibit leukocyte activation and/or recruitment. An antagonist of chemokine receptor function is a molecule which can inhibit the binding of one or more chemokines, including CC chemokines such as RANTES and MIP-1, to one or more chemokine receptors on leukocytes and/or other cell types. As a consequence, processes and cellular responses mediated by chemokine receptors can be inhibited with these small organic molecules. Based on this discovery, a method of treating a subject with a disease associated with aberrant leukocyte recruitment and/or activation is disclosed. The method comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or small organic molecule which is an antagonist of chemokine receptor function. Compounds or small organic molecules which have been identified as antagonists of chemokine receptor function are discussed in detail hereinbelow, and can be used for the manufacture of a medicament for treating or for preventing a disease associated with aberrant leukocyte recruitment and/or activation. The invention also relates to the disclosed compounds and small organic molecules and their use in treating or preventing a disease associated with aberrant leukocytes recruitment and/or activation. The invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more of the compounds or small organic molecules which have been identified herein as antagonists of chemokine function and a suitable pharmaceutical carrier. The invention further relates to novel compounds which can be used to treat an individual with a disease associated with aberrant leukocyte recruitment and/or activation. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES FIG. 1 A and FIG. 1B are histograms illustrating the inhibition by varying concentrations of LS370 and LS374 (also referred to herein as L-370 and L-374, respectively) in the chemotaxis of fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in response to RANTES or MIP-1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to small molecule compounds which are antagonists of chemokine receptor function. Accordingly, processes or cellular responses mediated by the binding of a chemokine to a receptor can be inhibited (reduced or prevented, in whole or in part), including leukocyte migration, integrin activation, transient increases in the concentration of intracellular free calcium Ca i , and/or granule release of proinflammatory mediators. The invention further relates to a method of treatment, including prophylactic and therapeutic treatments, of a disease associated with aberrant leukocyte recruitment and/or activation, including chronic inflammatory disorders characterized by the presence of RANTES and/or MIP-1 responsive T cels, monocytes and/or eosinophils, including but not limited to diseases such as arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease, as well as allergies and asthma. Other diseases associated with aberrant leukocyte recruitment and/or activation which can be treated (including prophylactic treatments) with the methods disclosesd herein are inflammatory diseases associated with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, e.g., AIDS associated encephalitis, AIDS related maculopapular skin eruption, AIDS related interstitial pneumonia, AIDS related enteropathy, AIDS related periportal hepatic inflammation and AIDS related glomerulo nephritis. The method comprises administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound (i.e., one or more compounds) which inhibits chemokine receptor function, inhibits the binding of a chemokine to leukocytes and/or other cell types, and/or which inhibits leukocyte migration to, and/or activation at, sites of inflammation. According to the method, chemokine-mediated chemotaxis and/or activation of pro-inflammatory cells bearing receptors for chemokines can be inhibited. As used herein, pro-inflammatory cells includes but is not limited to leukocytes, since chemokine receptors may be expressed on other cell types, such as neurons and epithelial cells.

A subject is preferably a mammal, such as a human, but can also be an animal in need of veterinary treatment, e.g., domestic animals (e.g., dogs, cats, and the like), farm animals (e.g., cows, sheep, pigs, horses, and the like) and laboratory animals (e.g., rats, mice, guinea pigs, and the like). A therapeutically effective amount of a compound is an amount which results in the inhibition of one or more processes mediated by the binding of a chemokine to a receptor in a subject with a disease associated with aberrant leukocyte recruitment and/or activation. Examples of such processes include leukocyte migration, integrin activation, transient increases in the concentration of intracellular free calcium Ca 2 i and granule release of proinflammatory mediators. Alternatively, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound is a quantity sufficient to achieve a desired therapeutic and/or prophylactic effect, such as an amount which results in the prevention of or a decrease in the symptoms associated with a disease associated with aberrant leukocyte recruitment and/or activation. The amount of compound administered to the individual will depend on the type and severity of the disease and on the characteristics of the individual, such as general health, age, sex, body weight and tolerance to drugs. It will also depend on the degree, severity and type of disease. The skilled artisan will be able to determine appropriate dosages depending on these and other factors. Typically, a therapeutically effective amount of the compound can range from about 0.1 mg per day to about 100 mg per day for an adult. Preferably, the dosage ranges from about 1 mg per day to about 100 mg per day. An antagonist of chemokine receptor function can also be administered in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents, e.g. theophylline, -adrenergic bronchdilators, corticosteroids, antihistamines, antiallergic agents and the like. The compound can be administered by any suitable route, including, for example, orally in capsules, suspensions or tablets or by parenteral administration. Parenteral administration can include, for example, systemic administration, such as by intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal injection. The compound can also be administered orally (e.g., dietary), topically, by inhalation (e.g., intrabronchial, intranasal, oral inhalation or intranasal drops), or rectally, depending on the disease or condition to be treated. Oral or parenteral administration are preferred modes of administration. The compound can be administered to the individual in conjunction with an acceptable pharmaceutical carrier as part of a pharmaceutical composition for treatment of HIV infection, inflammatory disease, or the other diseases discussed above. Formulation of a compound to be administered will vary according to the route of administration selected (e.g., solution, emulsion, capsule). Suitable pharmaceutical carriers may contain inert ingredients which do not interact with the compound. Standard pharmaceutical formulation techniques can be employed, such as those described in Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers for parenteral administration include, for example, sterile water, physiological saline, bacteriostatic saline (saline containing about 0.9% mg/ml benzyl alcohol), phosphate-buffered saline, Hanks solution, Ringers-lactate and the like. Methods for encapsulating compositions (such as in a coating of hard gelatin or cyclodextran) are known in the art (Baker, et al., Controlled Release of Biological Active Agents, John Wiley and Sons, 1986). The activity of compounds of the present invention can be assessed using suitable assays, such as receptor binding assays and chemotaxis assays. For example, as described in Exemplification Section, small molecule antagonists of RANTES and MIP-1 binding have been identified utilizing HL-60 (butyric acid differentiated) cells which bind RANTES and chemotax in response to RANTES and MIP-1 as a model for leukocyte chemotaxis. Specifically, a high through-put receptor binding assay, which monitors 125 I-RANTES and 125 I-MIP-1 binding to HL-60 cell membranes, was used to identify small molecule antagonists which block binding and RANTES and MIP-1 mediated HL-60, T-cell, peripheral blood mononuclear cell, and eosinophil cheaiotactic response. Compounds of the present invention can also be identified by virtue of their ability to inhibit the activation steps triggered by binding of a chemokine to its receptor, such as chemotaxis, integrin activation and/or granule mediator release.

The invention is illustrated by the following examples which are not intended to be limiting in any way. EXEMPLIFICATION Human eosinophils were prepared by isolation from the blood of donor individuals with high levels of circulating blood eosinophils (5-17%) by combining density gradient centifugation and negative selection with anti-CD16 magnetic beads (Hansel, T. T. J. Immunol. Methods , 122:97-103 (1989)). Briefly, the granulocyte fraction from the Percoll centrifugation was incubated with CD16 micro beads (miniMACS, separation unit) for 30 minutes. Cells were then passed through a MACS column (Miltenyi Biotec, Inc., Auburn, Calif.) and eosinophils were collected in the flow through. Eosinophil purity was 996 as determined by analysis of Diff-Quik (Baxter) stained cytocentrifugation preparations by light microscopy. HL-60 Cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were resuspended at 0.5 million cells/ml in equal proportions of RPMI-1640 and M199 (Gibco) with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS). After, addition of n-butyric acid (Sigma Chemical Co.) to a final concentration of 0.4 mM, cells were incubated for 4 days at 37 C., 5% CO 2 before use in either whole cell chemotaxis assays or preparation for use as membranes for receptor binding assays. Membrane Preparations for Chemokine Binding and Binding Assays Membranes were prepared from n-butyric acid-treated HL60 cells. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), and the cell pellets were frozen at 70 to 85 C. The frozen pellet was thawed in ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 5 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-ethane-sulfonic acid) pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), 5 g/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, andchymostatin (protease inhibitors), and 100 g/ml PMSF (phenyl methane sulfonyl fluoridealso a protease inhibitor, at a concentration of 1 to 510 7 cells/ml. This procedure results in cell lysis. The suspension was mixed welL to resuspend all of the frozen cell pellet. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation of 400g for 10 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and the membrane fragments were collected by centrifugation at 25,000g for 30 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet was resuspended in freezing buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM sucrose, 1 g/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and chymostatin, and 10 g/ml PMSF (approximately 0.1 ml per each 10 8 cells). All clumps were resolved using a minihomogenizer, and the total protein concentration was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif., cat 500-0002). The membrane solution was then aliquoted and frozen at 70 to 85 C. until needed. Binding Assays utilized the membranes described above. Membrane protein (2 to 20 g total membrane protein) was incubated with 0.1 to 0.2 nM 125 I-labeled RANTES or MIP-1 with or without unlabeled competitor (RANTES or MIP-1) or various concentrations of compounds. The binding reactions were performed in 60 to 100 l of a binding buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 1 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.5% BSA (bovine serum albumin), for 60 min at room temperature. The binding reactions were terminated by harvesting the membranes by rapid filtration through glass fiber filters (GF/B or GF/C, Packard) which were presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine. The filters were rinsed with approximately 600 l of binding buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl, dried, and the amount of bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting in a Topcount beta-plate counter. Chemokines and Chemotaxis. RANTES and MIP-1 were purchased from Peprotech, Inc. Leukocyte chemotaxis was assessed on eosinophils, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or HL60 cells differentiated with butyric acid, using a modification of a transendothelial assay (Carr, M. W., et al. T. A., Proc. Natl Acad Sci, USA , 91, 3652 (1994)). The endothelial cells used in this assay were the endothelial cell line, ECV 304, obtained from the European collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Porton Downs, Salisbury, U.K.). Endothelial cells were cultured on 6.5 mm diameter Transwell culture inserts (Costar Corp., Cambridge, Mass.) with 3.0 m pore size. Culture media for the ECV 304 cells consisted of M19910% FCS, L-glutamine, and antibiotics. The assay media consisted of equal parts RPMI 1640 and M199 with 0.5% BSA. Two hours before the assay, 210 5 ECV 304 cells were plated onto each insert of the 24 well Transwell chemotaxis plate and incubated at 37 C. Chemotactic factors such as RANTES or MIP-1 (Peprotech)(diluted in assay medium) were added to the 24-well tissue culture plates in a final volume of 600 L. Endothelial-coated Transwells were inserted into each well and 10 6 cells of the leukocyte type being studied were added to the top chamber in a final volume of 100 L of assay medium. The plate was then incubated at 37 C. in 5% CO 2 /95% air for 1-2 h. The cells that had migrated to the bottom chamber were counted using flow cytometry. 500 L of the cell suspension from the lower chamber was placed in a tube and relative counts were obtained for a set period of time of 30 seconds. This counting method was found to be highly reproducible and enabled gating on the leukocytes and the exclusion of debris or other cells. Counts obtained by this method matched closely those obtained by counting with a microscope. Assays evaluating chemotaxis inhibitors were performed in the same way as control experiments above, except that inhibitor solutions, in assay media containing up to 1% of DMSO cosolvent, were added to both the top and bottom chambers prior to addition of the cells. Inhibitor potency was determined by comparison of cell numbers migrated to the bottom chamber, with or without inhibitor. Control wells contained equivalent amounts of DMSO, but no inhibitor. Ligand Binding Assay. 125 I-RANTES and 125 I-MIP-1 were purchased from DuPont-NEN (Boston, Mass.) with a specific activity of 2,200 Ci/mM. Chemokine binding to the target cells, human eosinophils, was carried out using a modification of a method previously reported. (Van Riper, G. S.; J. Exp. Med . 177, 851-856 (1993)). Cells were washed once in PEBS and resusupended in binding buffer (50 mM HEPES, 1 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.5% BSA) at a concentration of 110 7 /mL. Aliquots of 50 L (510 5 cells) were dispensed into microfuge tubes, followed by the addition of cold and radiolabelled chemokines. The final reaction volume was 200 L. Nonspecific binding was determined by incubating cells with radiolabeled chemokines in the presence of increasing amounts of (250-500 nM) of cold chemokine. After 60-min incubation, at room temperature, the cells were washed 3 with 1 mL of binding buffer plus 0.5 M NaCl. Cell pellets were then counted. All experiments were carried out using duplicates and repeated at least three times. Curve fit was calculated by Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, Pa.). Inhibition of binding was assessed by the addition of test inhibitor compound at concentrations of 100 M final concentration, and incubation for 30 min prior to addition of the chemokine as above. Inhibition of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) Chemotaxis by Compounds L-370 and L-374 Cells were incubated with the concentrations of compound indicated in FIGS. 1A and 1B for 20 minutes at room temperature and were placed in the upper wells of the chemotaxis chambers. Migration in response to MCP-1, RANTES, or MIP-1 was assessed as described above. FIG. 1A is an illustration of the total number of cells migrating in response to the chemokines with and without preincubation with different concentrations of L-370 or L-374. MCP-1 was used as a negative control to show the specificity of action of the compounds. FIG. 1B is an illustration of the results of the same experiments as in FIG. 1A , expressed as percentage inhibition, where the inhibition was calculated as cells migrated in the absence of compound/cells migrated in the presence of compound. 100% inhibition of migration occurred with 10.0 M and 1.0 M of L-370 and L-374, respectively. The activities of other test compounds are reported in Tables 1-4 below as RBA, IC 50 or the inhibitor concentration required for 50% inhibition in receptor binding assays using 125 I-RANTES or 125 MIP-1 as ligand and HL60 cell membranes from cells differentiated by butyric acid (which chemotax in response to RANTES in an almost identical way described for eosinophils). Leukocyte chemotaxis inhibition is expressed as percent inhibition of RANTES-induced chemotaxis using the same HL60 cells (butyric acid diffentiated) at the indicated concentration (M) of compound.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to biphenyl derivatives. More particularly, it relates to biphenyl derivatives which exhibit dopamine 2 receptor antagonism and/or serotonin 2 receptor antagonism and which are clinically useful as therapeutic and ameliorative agents for mental disorders such as cerebrovascular disorder, aggressive behavior due to senile dementia, mental excitation, poriomania, delirium, hallucination, hyperkinesia, schizophrenia, emotional disturbance, depression, neurosis, psychophysiologic disorder and anxiety neurosis. 2. Description of the Related Art Mental disorders such as cerebrovascular disorder and dementia are frequently found in the aged, which becomes a significant problem with the approach of an aging society. In many cases, these diseases are accompanied with mental and/or behavior disorders which specifically appear as delirium, hallucination, hyperkinesia, poriomania, mental excitation or other sign or symptom. These signs and symptoms not only have an adverse effect on a patient himself, but also necessitate everyday care, imposing a heavy burden on the people around the patient. Under these circumstances, the development of a highly clinically useful medicine which can treat the above mental disorders medically has been expected not only by patients and their families, but also socially. Only Tiapride is now authorized as a therapeutic and ameliorative agent for the above diseases, and Haloperidol which is an antischizophrenic drug is also used, though the diseases are not included in the indications for which the drug is efficacious. As novel compounds having an antipsychotic activity, benzisothiazole derivatives and benzisoxazole derivatives are disclosed in European Patent Publication-A No. 196132, and pyridine derivatives are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,021,421. Tiapride and haloperidol are medicines exhibiting dopamine 2 (D 2 ) receptor antagonism. A medicine of this type has a problem of causing extrapyramidal syndrome including dystonia (hypermyotonia or muscle hypotonia), hypokinesis (akinesis), hyperkinesia (abnormal movement) and so forth as an adverse reaction, though the medicine is clinically efficacious. Risperidone which is a representative example of the benzisoxazole derivative disclosed in the above European Patent Publication-A No. 196132 is authorized as an antischizophrenic drug in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. However, this drug is problematic in that blood-pressure drop occurs as an adverse reaction owing to the high 1 blocking activity of the drug and that the QT C interval in electro-cardiogram is lengthened to induce arrhythmia, being undesirable particularly when administered to a patient of advanced age. The pyridine derivative disclosed in the above U.S. Pat. No. 5,021,421 also exhibits potent dopamine 2 receptor antagonism and is therefore feared to cause extrapyramidal syndrome like Tiapride or Haloperidol. Further, the pyridine derivative has not been used clinically as yet, so that its safeness in prolonged application is not apparent. As described above, there has not been found any therapeutic and ameliorative agent for mental disorders such as cerebrovascular disorder, aggressive behavior due to senile dementia, mental excitation, poriomania, delirium, hallucination, hyperkinesia, schizophrenia, emotional disturbance, depression, neurosis, psychophysiologic disorder and anxiety neurosis, which has high clinical usefulness and is excellent in safeness. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION 3. Summary of the Invention An object of the present invention is to provide novel biphenyl derivatives and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof which exhibit dopamine 2 receptor antagonism and/or serotonin 2 receptor antagonism, are clinically useful as therapeutic and ameliorative agents for mental diseases, is improved in the disadvantageous extrapyramidal syndrome as compared with dopamine 2 receptor antagonists of the prior art such as Tiapride and Haloperidol, and is freed from the adverse reactions caused by the above benzisoxazole derivative (such as Risperidone), for example, blood-pressure drop and induction of arrhythmia. Another object of the present invention is to provide processes for the preparation of the biphenyl derivatives described above. Another object of the present invention is to provide phenylpiperazine derivatives and salts thereof which are useful as intermediates in the production of the biphenyl derivatives and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof described above.

Preparation of Receptor Sources SD rats were each slaughtered with a guillotine to extirpate its cerebrum. The cortex and corpus striatum were separated from the cerebrum. The former was used in serotonin S 2 receptor binding test and adrenergic 1 , receptor binding test, while the latter was used in dopamine D 2 receptor binding test. The cortex was homogenized in a 0.32 M sucrose solution in an amount ten times the wet weight of the cortex by the use of a teflon glass homogenizer and the resulting mixture was centrifuged at 10,000G for 20 minutes. The obtained sediment was suspended in 50 mM Tris hydrochloride (pH 7.4) in an amount ten times the initial wet weight of the cortex by the use of a histocothrom, and the obtained suspension was centrifuged at 10,000G for 20 minutes. This operation was repeated twice. The obtained sediment was suspended in 50 mM Tris hydrochloride (pH 7.4) in an amount 20 times the initial wet weight of the cortex by the use of a histocothrom. The suspension thus prepared was used as a receptor fraction. This receptor fraction was stored at 80 C. until use. On the other hand, the corpus striatum was homogenized in a 0.32 M sucrose solution in an amount ten times the wet weight of the corpus striatum by the use of a teflon glass homogenizer and the obtained mixture was centrifuged at 1,000G for 20 minutes. The obtained supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000G for 20 minutes. The obtained sediments were suspended together in 50 mM Tris hydrochloride (pH 7.4) in an amount ten times the initial wet weight of the corpus striatum by the use of a histocothrom, and the obtained suspension was centrifuged at 10,000G for 20 minutes. This operation was repeated thrice. The resulting sediment was suspended in 50 mM Krebs-Tris (pH 7.4) in an amount 100 times the initial wet weight of the corpus striatum by the use of a histocothrom. The obtained suspension was used as a receptor fraction. This receptor fraction was stored at 80 C. until use. 4. 3 Ketanserin Binding Test The receptor fraction prepared from the cortex was molten and suspended by the use of a histocothrom.

The present invention relates to a group of novel 2-aminoquinoline derivatives, to a method for the preparation of these compounds, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of these compounds as an active component. It has surprisingly been found that the compounds and salts thereof of the formula (I) wherein (R 1 ) n represents 1 or 2 substituents, which can be the same or different, from the group C 1-3 -alkyl or alkoxy, halogen, trifluoromethyl, nitro, amino, and mono or dialkyl (C 1-2 )amino, or two groups R 1 at adjacent carbon atoms together with the benzene ring may form the benzdioxane group or benzofuran group, X represents nitrogen or carbon, and the dotted line may represent a double bond, (R 2 ) p represents 0, 1 or 2 substituents, which can be the same or different, from the group methyl and ethyl, or (R 2 ) p is a methylene bridge or ethylene bridge, R 3 is hydrogen or methyl, and (R) m represents 0, 1 or 2 substituents, which can be the same or different and can be located at all available positions of the quinolyl group, from the group C 1-3 -alkyl or akoxy, halogen, trifluoromethyl, nitro, amino, and mono- or dialkyl (C 1-2 )-amino, on the understanding that R 1 cannot represent o-OCH 3 when X is nitrogen, (R 2 ) p and R 3 are hydrogen, and m is 0 and n is 1, are potent and selective agonists of the dopamine D4-receptor. Compounds having formula (I) wherein R, R 1 and X have the above meaning, m is 0 or 1, n is 1, and (R 2 ) p and R 3 represent hydrogen, and salts thereof are preferred. Especially preferred are compounds having formula (I) wherein R, R 1 , X, m, n, (R 2 ) p and R 3 have the meanings given in claim 2 and salts thereof. Of particular interest is the compound 1-(2-2-quinolylamino)-ethyl-4-(4-methoxyphenyl) piperazine, and salts thereof. Due to the potent and selective D4-agonistic activity the compounds according to the invention are suitable for use in the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as psychosis, anxiety, depression, attention deficits, memory disorders, neurological disorders such as Parkinsons disease and ischaemia and other CNS-diseases involving dopaminergic neurotransmission. The affinity of the compounds of the invention for dopamine D4 receptors was determined using CHO-K1 cells which are stably transfected to express the human recombinant dopamine receptor, D4.2 subtype (Van Tol et al, Nature 350, 610, 1991) and using 3H-Spiperone as the ligand. After incubation of a freshly prepared cellmembrane preparation with the 3H-ligand, with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound and free ligand was performed by filtration over glassfiberfilters (Research Biochemicals International protocol, Catalog No. D-177). Radioactivity on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Results are expressed as IC50 values and transformed into inhibitory constants (Ki). The dopamine D4 agonistic activity of compounds of the invention was determined by functional studies using CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the human dopamine D4.4 receptor (Van Tol, et al, Nature, 358, 149, 1992). These cells were fitted with a construct encoding a truncated form of alkaline phosphatase, causing it to get secreted by the cells. Expression of this secretable alkaline phosphatase (SeAP) is under direct control of cellular cyclic AMP (Berger et al, Gene, 66, 1, 1988). SeAP measurements were done with p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) as the substrate using colorimetric readout at 450 nm. Dopamine D4 agonist activity was determined by incubation of cells with prostaglandin PGE1 (1 uM), with or without addition of compounds of the invention, and subsequent quantification of the concentration-dependant attenuation of dopamine D4 receptor mediated SeAP formation, yielding estimates of intrinsic activity and potency (pEC50 values). Quinpirole and dopamine were used as reference dopamine agonists. Absence of dopamine D4 antagonistic activity was confirmed using the same assay, but co-incubating cells with prostaglandin PGE1 (1 uM) and the standard agonist quinpirole (1 uM), with or without addition of compounds of the invention. In this way, the antagonistic effect of compounds of the invention against agonist dependant attenuation of dopamine D4 receptor mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase and subsequent SeAP formation was determined. Dopamine D4 agonist properties and the absence of D4 antagonist properties of selected compounds of the invention were further confirmed using radioactive measurements of cAMP formation according to Salomon et al. (Anal Biochem, 58, 541, 1974) as modified by Weiss et al. (J Neurochem 45, 869, 1985). The selectivity of the compounds of the invention with regard to the dopamine D2 receptor, was determined by measuring the affinity for dopamine D2 receptors using rat brain homogenates and 3H-Spiperone as the ligand (Leysen et al, Biochem Pharmacol 27, 307, 1978). After incubation of a freshly prepared cellmembrane preparation with the 3H-ligand, with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound and free ligand was performed by filtration over glassfiberfilters. Radioactivity on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Results are expressed as IC50 values and transformed into inhibitory constants (Ki). The dopamine D2 (ant)agonistic activity of compounds of the invention was determined by functional studies based on radioactive measurements of cAMP formation according to Salomon et al. (Anal Biochem, 58,541, 1974) as modified by Weiss et al. (J Neurochem 45, 869, 1985), using CHO cells, stably expressing human dopamine D2L receptors (Grandy et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 86, 9762, 1989). Suitable acids with which the compounds can form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are for example hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, and organic acids such as citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, p-toluene sulphonic acid, methane sulphonic acid and naphthalene sulphonic acid. The compounds of the invention can be brought into forms suitable for administration by means of usual processes using auxiliary substances and/or liquid or solid carrier materials. The compounds of the invention having formula (I) can be obtained according to methods known for the synthesis of structurally related compounds. A suitable method for the preparation of the compounds having formula (I) is the following: Step 1 Reaction of a compound having formula (II): with chloroacetonitrile in a polar solvent such as acetonitrile in the presence of a base such as triethylamine. Step 2 The obtained N-cyanomethyl derivative of the compound of formula (II) can be hydrogenated with a reducing agent such as lithium aluminium hydride in an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran to give the corresponding 2-aminoethyl derivative having formula (III): Step 3: The compound having formula (III) is then reacted with a suitable 2-chloroquinoline derivative of the formula (IV): in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in a polar aprotic solvent such as dimethylsulfoxide at 20-140 C., to give the desired compound having formula (I). The preparation of the compounds of the present invention is illustrated with the following examples. EXAMPLE I 1-(2-2-quinolylamino)-ethyl-4-(4-methoxyphenyl) piperazine.hydrochloride Part A: To a solution of 19.2 g (100 mmol) of commercially available 4-methoxyphenyl piperazine in acetonitrile (300 ml), 12.1 g (120 mmol) of triethylamine and 7.6 g (100 mmol) of chloroacetonitrile were subsequently added. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 2 hrs, cooled to room temperature and concentrated in vacuo. To the residue dichloromethane (300 ml) and water (150 ml) were added, the water layer was further extracted with dichloromethane (50 ml), the combined organic layers were dried over sodiumsulphate and concentrated in vacuo. In this manner 18.5 g of 1-(cyanomethyl)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl) piperazine (80%) was obtained as a white solid. Part B: To a solution of 18.5 g (80 mmol) of 1-(cyanomethyl)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl) piperazine in dry tetrahydrofuran (350 ml), heated to 40 C., a quantity of 6.1 g (160 mmol, 2 equivalent) of lithium aluminium hydride was added in portions. Cooling of the reaction mixture was required to keep the temperature at about 40 C. during addition of the lithium aluminium hydride. After reflux for 1 hr. the mixture was cooled to room temperature and subsequent dropwise addition was carried out of 1). a mixture of water (6 ml) and tetrahydrofuran (40 ml), 2). a solution of sodium hydroxide in water (2N, 12 ml) and 3). water (12 ml). The reaction mixture was heated at 40 C. for 2 hrs. The precipitate obtained after cooling to room temperature was removed by filtration and washed with tetrahydrofuran (two times 25 ml). The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. To the filtrate water (300 ml) and dichloromethane (150 ml) were added, the water layer was further extracted with dichloromethane (two times 100 ml), the combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated in vacuo. The product was purified applying flash-chromatography over silicagel using dichloromethane/methanol/ammonia 85:14:1 as the eluent. After concentration in vacuo a total of 9.4 g of 1-(2-aminoethyl)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl) piperazine (50% yield) was obtained as an oil, slowly solidifying at room temperature. Part C: A solution of 9.4 g (40 mmol) of 1-(2-aminoethyl)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl) piperazine in dry dimethyl sulfoxide (30 ml), 6.5 g (40 mmol) of commercially available 2-chloroquinoline and 6.1 g (44 mmol, 1.1 equivalent) of dry potassium carbonate were heated to 120 C. under nitrogen for 20 hrs. After cooling to room temperature water (150 ml) and dichloromethane (100 ml) were added. The water layer was further extracted with dichloromethane (two times 100 ml), the combined organic layers were washed with water (40 ml), dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated in vacuo. The product was purified applying flash-chromatography over silicagel using dichloromethane/methanol 95:5 as the eluent. After concentration in vacuo the residual oil was dissolved in absolute ethanol (80 ml), heated to 70 C. and a solution of 1.46 g hydrochloride (40 mmol) in absolute ethanol (10 ml) was added. After stirring for hr at 70 C., subsequent cooling and stirring at room temperate for 2 hrs, the resulting precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with hexane (two times 25 ml) and dried in vacuo.

receptors affinity", "abstract": "Compounds of general formula (I) wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , and R 4 denote hydrogen or hydroxy with the proviso that R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , and R 4 cannot simultaneously represent hydrogen, processes for their preparation of the compounds of general formula (I), and their use as pharmaceuticals. The present invention relates to novel pharmacologically active benzimidazolone derivatives and their addition salts which bind the serotonin and dopamine receptors, to their preparation and their use for therapeutic purposes. These compounds, owing to their pharmacological activity, are useful in the treatment of CNS disorders. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Serotonin (5-HT) and Dopamine recognize several well-defined cell surface receptors. Among these, 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , and D 4 at which serotonin and dopamine, respectively, have high affinity, are known to be implicated in many Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, Parkinsons disease, and neurodegenerative diseases. In the previous art, several classes of compounds able to interfere with the neurotransmission at serotonin or dopamine receptor subtypes are known. Particularly, derivatives based on the core structure of the arylpiperazine and benzimidazolone have been described (e.g., GB 2,023,594; U.S. Pat. No. 3,472,854; U.S. Pat. No. 4,954,503; and WO 98/33784), and targeted both to generic serotonin or dopamine receptors and to a specific receptor subtype. In another patent (U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,318), compounds based both on the benzimidazolone and phenyl piperazine structures are described: in this latter case the described affinities are limited to 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptor subtypes. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Here we describe, and this is the object of the present invention, new hydroxylated derivatives based on the benzimidazolone phenyl piperazine structure. Surprisingly it was discovered that the compounds according to this invention possess an interesting affinity profile at the said serotonin and dopamine receptor subtypes: indeed, some of them have a high and preferential affinity at a given site (e.g., 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , or D 4 ), whereas some other have a mixed affinity at all the said receptors. Owing to their peculiar profile, the present compounds may play a role in the regulation of neurotransmission at the serotonin and/or the dopamine sites an:d thus may be of value in the treatment of those diseases where an altered functioning of neurosignal transmission is present. Examples of these CNS disorders include depression, schizophrenia, Parkinsons disease, anxiety, sleep disturbances, sexual and mental disorders, and age-associated memory impairment. According to the present invention, we provide compounds of general formula (I) wherein: R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , and R 4 denote hydrogen or hydroxy with the proviso that R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , and R 4 cannot simultaneously represent hydrogen. Preferred compounds according to the invention are those of general formula (I) wherein two or three of the four radicals R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , and R 4 denote hydrogen. Also preferred are compounds of general formula (I) wherein one of the radicals R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , and R 4 denotes hydroxy, while the other radicals represent hydrogen. Of particular interest are compounds selected from the group consisting of: (a) 5-hydroxy-1-2-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazin-1-yl-ethyl-1,3-dihydrobenzimidazol-2-one; (b) 6-hydroxy-1-2-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazin-1-yl-ethyl-1,3 -dihydrobenzimidazol-2-one; (c) 4-hydroxy-1-2-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazin-1-yl-ethyl-1,3-dihydrobenzimidazol-2-one; (d) 7-hydroxy-1-2-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazin-1-yl-ethyl-1,3-dihydrobenzimidazol-2-one; (e) 1-2-4-(4-hydroxy-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazin-1-yl-ethyl-1,3-dihydrobenzimidazol-2-one; (f) 1-2-4-(3-hydroxy-5-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazin-1-yl-ethyl-1,3-dihydrobenzimidazol-2-one; (g) 1-2-4-(2-hydroxy-5-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazin-1-yl-ethyl-1,3-dihydrobenzimidazol-2-one; and (h) 1-2-4-(2-hydroxy-3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazin-1-yl-ethyl-1,3-dihydrobenzimidazol-2-one. For pharmaceutical use, the compounds of general formula (I) may be used either as free base or in the form of physiologically acceptable acid addition salts. The term acceptable acid addition salts includes both organic and inorganic acids such as maleic, citric, tartaric, methanesulphonic, acetic, benzoic, succinic, gluconic, isethionic, glycinic, lactic, malic, mucoic, glutamic, sulfamic, and ascorbic acid; inorganic acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, sulfuric, or phosphoric acid. The compounds of general formula (I) may be conveniently prepared by a variety of synthetic processes analogous to those known in the art using conventional methods and starting from suitable intermediates in which the hydroxy function (generally in the form of a methoxy precursor group) is inserted in a well defined position, and suitable for originating the final target compound. When a masked (i.e., protected) hydroxy function is used throughout all the synthetic process, the hydroxy function is generated in the last step as exemplarily outlined in Scheme 1. As protective groups conventional ether protective groups are applicable (e.g., methyl, methoxymethyl, benzyl). The preferred protecting group according to the invention is the methyl ether. The deprotection of the hydroxy group can be easily carried out by conventional known procedures. In case of the preferred protecting group (methoxy), the deprotection is achieved by treatment with strong aqueous acids such as 48% hydrobromic acid at high temperatures or alternatively by treatment with boron derivatives, such as BBr 3 , at low temperatures in chlorinated solvents such as methylene dichloride. As mentioned before, the compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention, surprisingly show interesting pharmacological properties owing to their different profile at the serotonin or dopamine receptor subtypes, such as 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A and D 4 . The biochemical profile of the compounds was assessed by evaluating their affinity for the 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A and D 4 receptors, according to the methods described below. Receptor Binding Studies Binding studies were carried out to determine the affinity of the compounds for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , and D 4 receptors 5-HT 1A Receptor Tissue preparation: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were used. The hippocampus taken from these animals was homogenized in 10 volumes of ice cold 50 mM TIUS buffer (pH 7.4). The homogenate was diluted 1:400 (w:v) in the same buffer to have a final protein concentration of about 200 g/ml, filtered and incubated at 37 C. for 10 minutes before use. Binding Assay: Displacement experiments were performed by incubating the homogenate (980 l) in the presence of 3 H-8-OH-DPAT (10 l; 1.0-1.2 nM) and different concentrations of the test compounds dissolved in DMSO (10 l), at 30 C. for 15 minutes (final volume: 1 ml).

The resulting pellet was suspended in 10 volumes of 50 mM TRIS buffer (pH 7.4), incubated at 37 C. for 10 minutes and recentrifuged at 48,000 g for 15 minutes. The residue was then resuspended in 10 volumes of 50 mM TRIS buffer (pH 7.4). Binding Assay: The tissue was diluted 1:100 (w:v) in 50 mM TRIS buffer (pH 7.4) to have a final concentration of about 200 g/ml.

Cells were passaged twice a week using a trypsin/EDTA solution and the split rate was 1:4. Cells were not subcultured more than 17 times. Preparation of cell membranes: The cells grown to confluence were washed twice with Dulbeccos PBS buffer and were detached adding VERSENE (PBS containing 0.2 g/l EDTA) for 10 minutes at 37 C. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 minutes and the pellet was harvested in DMEM with 10% DMSO and stored at 80 C. Before use, cells were thawed, centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 minutes and the pellet was resuspended in PBS. The cells were centrifuged again at 270g for 10 minutes at 4 C. and the pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 5 mM Na 2 EDTA and protease inhibitors) and incubated for 30 minutes on ice. Cells were homogenized with an Ultra Turrax homogenizer. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by an initial centrifugation at 270g for 10 minutes at 4 C. and crude membranes were collected from the supernatant by a 60 minute spin at 130,000g. The pelleted membranes were resuspended in the same lysis buffer with 20 strokes by a Potter homogenizer. The final cell membrane suspension, corresponding to about 110 7 original cells/ml, was aliquoted and immediately frozen at 80 C.

Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 M of Clozapine (10 l). The reaction was stopped by rapid filtration through Inotech IH 201 filters (pre-soaked in 0.1% polyethyleneimine) using an Inotech Cell Harvester. The radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Data analysis: The affinity values (K i ) for the compounds were obtained by a nonlinear least squares regression analysis on the basis of a one binding site model. The values were corrected on the basis of the radioligand occupancy on the receptors according to the equation: K i IC 50 /(1C/K d ), where C and K d represent the concentration and the dissociation constant of the used radioligands ( 3 H-8-OH-DPAT for the 5-HT 1A binding, 3 H-Ketanserine for the 5-HT 2A binding and 3 H-YM 09151-2) for the D 4 binding, respectively).

The pharmaceutical utility of compounds of this invention is indicated by the following assay for CRF receptor activity. Assay for CRF Receptor Binding Activity CRF receptor binding was performed using a modified version of the assay described by Grigoriadis and De Souza (Biochemical, Pharmacological, and Autoradiographic Methods to Study Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Receptors. Methods in Neurosciences, Vol. 5, 1991). Membrane pellets containing CRF receptors were resuspended in 50 mM Tris buffer pH 7.7 containing 10 mM MgCl 2 and 2 mM EGTA and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 48000 g. Membranes were washed again and brought to a final concentration of 1500 g/ml in binding buffer (Tris buffer above with 0.1% BSA, 0.15 mM bacitracin and 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin.). For the binding assay, 100 ul of the membrane preparation was added to 96 well microtube plates containing 100 l of 125 I-CRF (SA 2200 Ci/mmol , final concentration of 100 pM) and 50 l of drug. Binding was carried out at room temperature for 2 hours. Plates were then harvested on a Brandel 96 well cell harvester and filters were counted for gamma emissions on a Wallac 1205 Betaplate liquid scintillation counter. Non specific binding was defined by 1 M cold CRF. IC 50 values were calculated with the non-linear curve fitting program RS/1 (BBN Software Products Corp., Cambridge, Mass.). The binding characteristics for examples from this patent are shown in Table 2. TABLE 2 Compound Number 2 IC 50 (M) 1 1.110 5 0.500 2 Compound numbers relate to compounds shown above in Table 1.

These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid. Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol, anhydrides, for example sorbitan monoleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parentally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringers solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono-or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. The compounds of general formula I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. Compounds of general formula I may be administered parenterally in a sterile medium. The drug, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants such as local anaesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle.

RELATED APPLICATION This application is a continuation of application U.S. Ser. No. 08/671,540 filed Jun. 17, 1996 now abandoned which in turn claims priority to German application 195 23 906.7 filed Jun. 30, 1995, incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to novel substituted 1,3-dioxan-5-ylamino-heterocyclic compounds, processes for their preparation and their use as pest control compositions and fungicides. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is already known that certain cycloamino- and -alkoxy-heterocyclic compounds show a fungicidal, acaricidal and insecticidal action (DE-A-42 08 254, incorporated herein by reference). However, the biological action of these compounds is not satisfactory in all examples of use, especially when low amounts are applied and at low concentrations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Novel 1,3-dioxan-5-ylamino-heterocyclic compounds have been found of the formula I in which the radicals and groups are as defined below. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION The invention provides compounds which have a very good plant tolerance and favourable toxicity with respect to warm-blooded animals and are particularly suitable for control of animal pests, such as insects, arachnids, nematodes, helminths and mollusks, for control of endo- and ectoparasites in the veterinary medicine field and for control of harmful fungi. The foregoing and other objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in or apparent from the following description. The invention therefore relates to compounds of the formula I in which R 1 is hydrogen, halogen, (C 1 -C 4 )-alkyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-haloalkyl or (C 3 -C 5 )-cycloalkyl; R 2 and R 3 are identical or different and are each hydrogen, (C 1 -C 4 )-alkyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-haloalkyl, (C 2 -C 4 )-alkenyl, (C 2 -C 4 )-haloalkenyl, (C 2 -C 4 )-alkynyl, (C 2 -C 4 )-haloalkynyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-trialkylsilylalkynyl, preferably dimethyl-(C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl-silyl-alkynyl, phenyl-(C 1 -C 8 )-dialkyl-silyl-alkynyl, preferably phenyl-dimethyl-silyl-alkynyl, aryl-(C 1 -C 2 )-alkyl-(C 1 -C 8 )-dialkyl-silyl-alkynyl, preferably benzyl-dimethyl-silyl-alkynyl, (C 3 -C 8 )-cycloalkyl-(C 1 -C 8 )-dialkyl-silyl-alkynyl, preferably (C 3 -C 8 )-cycloalkyl-dimethyl-silyl-alkynyl, (1-methyl-sila-(C 3 -C 8 )-cycloalkyl-1-yl)-alkynyl, preferably (1-methyl-silacyclopent-1-yl)-alkynyl or (1-methyl-sila-cyclohex-1-yl)-alkynyl, triphenylsilylalkynyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-alkoxy, (C 1 -C 4 )-haloalkoxy, (C 1 -C 4 )-alkoxy-(C 1 -C 4 )-alkyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-haloalkoxy-(C 1 -C 4 )-alkyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-alkoxy-(C 1 -C 4 )-haloalkyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-haloalkoxy-(C 1 -C 4 )-haloalkyl, halogen, hydroxyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-hydroxyalkyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-alkanoyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-alkanoyl-(C 1 -C 4 )-alkyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-haloalkanoyl, (C 3 -C 5 )-cyclo-alkyl, (C 3 -C 5 )-halocycloalkyl, cyano, (C 1 -C 4 )-cyanoalkyl, nitro, (C 1 -C 4 )-nitroalkyl, thiocyano, (C 1 -C 4 )-thiocyanoalkyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-alkoxycarbonyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-alkoxycarbonyl-(C 1 -C 4 )-alkyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-haloalkoxycarbonyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-alkylthio, (C 1 -C 4 )-alkylthio-(C 1 -C 4 )-alkyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-haloalkylthio, (C 1 -C 4 )-alkyl-sulfinyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-haloalkylsulfinyl, (C 1 -C 4 )-alkylsulfonyl or (C 1 -C 4 )-haloalkylsulfonyl;

The explanation given above applies accordingly to homologs and radicals derived therefrom. The present invention relates to the compounds of the formula I in the form of the free base or an acid addition salt. Acids which can be used for salt formation are inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid, or organic acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, malonic acid, oxalic acid, fumaric acid, adipic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid or toluenesulfonic acid. In addition to the cis/trans isomerism mentioned for the hetero-aliphatic system including the groups Y and Z, the compounds of the formula I in some cases contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms or stereoisomers on double bonds. Enantiomers or diastereomers can therefore occur. The invention relates both to pure isomers and to mixtures thereof. The mixtures of diastereomers can be separated into the components by customary methods, for example by selective crystallization from suitable solvents or by chromatography. Racemates can be separated into the enantiomers by customary methods, thus, for example, by salt formation with an optically active acid, separation of the diastereomeric salts and liberation of the pure enantiomers by means of a base. The invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of compounds of the formula I which comprises reacting a compound of the formula II in which A, R 1 , R 2 and R 3 have the meanings given under formula I and L is a leaving group, for example halogen, alkylthio, alkanesulfonyloxy or arylsulfonyloxy, alkylsulfonyl or arylsulfonyl, with a nucleophile of the formula III in which X, Y, Z, R 4 , R 4 and R 5 have the meanings given above under formula I, and, in the compounds of the formula I obtained in this manner or in another manner, optionally further derivatizing the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic radical or the side chain R 5 . The substitution reaction described above is known in principle. The leaving group Z can be varied within wide limits and can be, for example, a halogen atom, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, or alkylthio, such as methyl- or ethylthio, or alkanesulfonyloxy, such as methane-, trifluoromethane- or ethanesulfonyloxy, or arylsulfonyloxy, such as benzenesulfonyloxy or toluenesulfonyloxy, or alkylsulfonyl, such as methyl- or ethylsulfonyl, or arylsulfonyl, such as phenyl- or toluenesulfonyl. The above-mentioned reaction is carried out in a temperature range from 20 to 150 C., expediently in the presence of a base and if appropriate in an inert organic solvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, methanol, ethanol, butanol, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, toluene, chlorobenzene or xylene. Mixtures of the solvents mentioned can also be used. Suitable bases in the case were X is oxygen are, for example, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carbonates, bicarbonates, amides or hydrides, such as sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium amide or sodium hydride, and in the case where X is NH, these are, for example, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carbonates, bicarbonates, hydroxides, amides or hydrides, such as sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium amide or sodium hydride, or organic bases, such as triethylamine or pyridine. A second equivalent of an amine of the formula III can also be employed as an auxiliary base. The compounds of the formula II required as starting substances are in most cases known from the literature or can be prepared by methods analogous to those known from the literature (cf. EP 370 391, EP 470 600, DOS 43 31 179, DOS 44 04 702, incorporated herein by reference). To prepare the nucleophiles of the formula III, suitably substituted 1,3-dioxan-5-ones or 1,3-dithian-5-ones are used as starting substances (A. A. Marei, R. A. Raphael, J. Chem. Soc. 1960, 886; H. Vorbrggen, Acta Chem. Scand., 1982, 420; D. Enders, B. Bockstiegel, Synthesis 1989, 493; A. Luttringhaus, M. Mohr, N. Engelhard, Liebigs Ann. Chem. 661 (1963) 84; Y. M. Kobayashi, J. Lambrecht, J. C. Jochims, U. Burkert, Chem. Ber. 111, 3442 (1978), incorporated herein by reference) and these are converted into the corresponding amines by reductive amination (H 2 , NH 3 , metal catalyst or ammonium acetate/sodium cyanoborohydride) or Leuckart-Wallach reduction, or into the corresponding alcohols by reduction with a complex metal hydride. To prepare the particularly preferred cis derivatives, a rhodium or a rhodium/palladium mixed catalyst is particularly suitable for the reductive amination, and particularly suitable complex metal hydrides are those which carry alkyl substituents of large bulk, in addition to the hydrogen, such as, for example, L-Selectride. Alternatively, there is the possibility of converting the 1,3-dioxan-5-ones into the corresponding alcohols by reduction with a complex metal hydride (LiAlH 4 , NaBH 4 ), and obtaining the amines (H 2 /Pd or LiAlH 4 ) from these via the mesylate or tosylate (CH 3 SO 2 Cl/CH 3 C 6 H 4 SO 2 Cl, pyridine) and azide (NaN 3 , dimethylformamide) (cf. D. Lednicer, D. E. Emmert, R. Lahti, A. D. Rudzik, J. Med. Chem. 15, 1239, (1972), incorporated herein by reference). The alcohols mentioned can also be obtained directly from aldehyde and glycerol under acid catalysis (P. E. Verkade, J. D. van Roon, Rec. Trav. Chim. Pays Bas, 61, 831 (1942); E. Juaristi, S. Antunez, Tetrahedron 48, 5941 (1992), incorporated herein by reference). The invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of compounds of the formula I, which comprises reacting a compound of the formula IV in which R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , A, X, Y and Z have the meanings given above for formula I, with a compound of the formula V or V in which R 4 and R 5 have the meanings given above for formula I and R 6 are the same or different and are (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, preferably (C 1 -C 4 )-alkyl, and, in the compounds of the formula I obtained in this manner or in another manner, further varying the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic radical or the side chain R 5 . The reaction is expediently carried out by allowing the compounds of the formula IV and of the formula V to react in the presence of an acid catalyst in a temperature range of 20-200 C., preferably between 60 and 150 C., in bulk or in an inert organic solvent. The ketalization reaction described above is known in principle. It is carried out in a temperature range of 20-200 C., preferably between 60 and 150 C., in the presence of an acid dehydrating catalyst, in bulk or in an inert solvent. Suitable catalysts are, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, sodium hydrogen sulfate, sulfonic acids, such as methane- or toluenesulfonic acid, phosphorus-V oxide, iron(III) chloride, zinc chloride, anhydrous copper sulfate, iodine or also acid ion exchangers, such as, for example, Amberlite IR-120. The water formed during the reaction is expediently removed from the reaction mixture by distillation, if appropriate under reduced pressure, or by azeotropic distillation using an entraining agent. Suitable entraining agents are, for example, benzene, toluene, xylene or petroleum ether. The reaction of the compounds of the formula IV with the compounds of the formula V is carried out in analogy to the reaction of the compounds of the formula IV with the compounds of the formula V, in bulk or in an inert organic solvent, such as benzene, toluene, xylene or petroleum ether. The compounds of the formula V 1 are used in an equimolar ration or in excess. The alcohol formed during the reaction is expediently removed by distillation from the reaction mixture. The compounds of the formula IV required as starting substances can be synthesized as follows: The reaction conditions for the reactions described under a) and b) correspond to those for the preparation of the compounds III from the compounds of the formula II. The educts of the formula VIa are commercially obtainable, are known from the literature or can be synthesized by processes analogous to known processes (cf. M. Kujima, Yakugaku Zasshi 90, (1970), 670, incorporated herein by reference). Compounds of the formula VIb are employed in a protected form. A suitable protective group is, for example, the benzyl group, which is removed by hydrogenolysis after the reaction has taken place. The starting materials of the formula VIb are commercially obtainable, are known from the literature or can be synthesized by processes analogous to known processes. The active compounds have a good plant tolerance and favourable toxicity with respect to warm-blooded animals and are suitable for controlling animal pests, in particular insects, arachnids, helminths and mollusks, especially preferably for controlling insects and arachnids which are encountered in agriculture, in animal husbandry, in forestry, in the preservation of stored products and materials and in the hygiene sector.

The invention also relates to compositions, in particular insecticidal and acaricidal compositions, which comprise the compounds of the formula I in addition to suitable formulation auxiliaries. The compositions according to the invention in general comprise the active compounds of the formula I to the extent of 1 to 95% by weight. They can be formulated in various ways, depending on how this is determined by the biological and/or chemico-physical parameters. Suitable formulation possibilities are therefore: Wettable powders (WP), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), aqueous solutions (SL), emulsions, sprayable solutions, oil- or water-based dispersions, suspension concentrates (SC), suspoemulsions (SE), dusting powders (DP), seed dressings, granules in the form of microgranules, sprayed granules, absorption granules and adsorption granules, water-dispersible granules (WG), ULV formulations, microcapsules, waxes or baits. These individual types of formulation are known in principle and are described, for example, in: Winnacker-Kchler, Chemische Technologie Chemical Technology, Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th Edition 1986; van Falkenberg, Pesticides Formulations, Marcel Dekker N.Y., 2nd Edition 1972-73; K. Martens, Spray Drying Handbook, 3rd Edition 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd. London, incorporated herein by reference. The necessary formulation auxiliaries, such as inert materials, surfactants, solvents and further additives, are likewise known and are described, for example, in: Watkins, Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers, 2nd Edition, Darland Books, Caldwell N.J.; H. v. Olphen, Introduction to Clay Colloid Chemistry, 2nd Edition, J. Wiley Sons, N.Y.; Marsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Edition, Interscience, N.Y. 1950; McCutcheons, Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual, MC Publ. Corp., Ridgewood N.J.; Sisley and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents, Chem. Publ. Co. Inc., N.Y. 1964; Schnfeldt, Grenzflchenaktive thylenoxidaddukte Surface-active ethylene oxide adducts, Wiss. Verlagsgesell., Stuttgart 1967; Winnacker-Kchler, Chemische Technologiel Chemical Technology, Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th Edition 1986, incorporated herein by reference. Combinations with other substances having a pesticidal action, fertilizers and/or growth regulators can be prepared on the basis of these formulations, for example in the form of a ready-to-use formulation or as a tank mix. Wettable powders are preparations which are uniformly dispersible in water and which, alongside the active compound, and in addition to a diluent or inert substance, also comprise wetting agents, for example poly-oxyethylated alkylphenols, polyoxyethylated fatty alcohols or alkyl- or alkylphenol-sulfonates, and dispersing agents, for example sodium ligninsulfonate or sodium 2,2-dinaphthylmethane-6,6-disulfonate. Emulsifiable concentrates are prepared by dissolving the active compound in an organic solvent, for example butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, xylene or also higher-boiling aromatics or hydrocarbons, with the addition of one or more emulsifiers. Emulsifiers which can be used are, for example: calcium alkylarylsulfonates, such as Cadodecylbenzenesulfonate, or nonionic emulsifiers, such as fatty acid polyglycol esters, alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, propylene oxide/ethylene oxide condensation products, alkyl polyethers, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters or polyoxyethylene sorbitol esters. Dusting powders are obtained by grinding the active compound with finely divided solid substances, for example talc, naturally occurring clays, such as kaolin, bentonite and pyrophillite, or diatomaceous earth. Granules can be prepared either by spraying the active compound onto granular inert material capable of adsorption or by applying active compound concentrates to the surface of carrier substances, such as sand, kaolinites or granular inert material, by means of adhesives, for example polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate or mineral oils. Suitable active compounds can also be granulated in the manner customary for the preparation of fertilizer granulesif desired as a mixture with fertilizers. In wettable powders, the active compound concentration is, for example, about 10 to 90% by weight, the remainder to make up 100% by weight comprising customary formulation constituents. In emulsifiable concentrates, the active compound concentration can be about 5 to 80% by weight. Dust-like formulations usually comprise 5 to 20% by weight of active compound, and sprayable solutions about 2 to 20% by weight. In granules, the content of active compound partly depends on whether the active compound is present in liquid or solid form and what granulating auxiliaries, fillers and the like are used. In addition, the active compound formulations mentioned comprise, if appropriate, the particular customary tackifiers, wetting agents, dispersing agents, emulsifiers, penetration agents, solvents, fillers or carriers. For use, the concentrates in the commercially available form are diluted in the customary manner, if appropriate, for example by means of water in the case of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions and in some cases also microgranules. Dust-like and granular formulations as well as sprayable solutions are usually not diluted further with additional inert substances before use. The required amount applied varies with external conditions, such as temperature, humidity and the like. It can vary within wide limits, for example between 0.0005 and 10.0 kg/ha or more of active substance, but is preferably between 0.001 and 5 kg/ha.

The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can be from 0.00000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.00001 and 1% by weight. The active compounds are used in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms. The active compounds according to the invention are also suitable for controlling endo- and ectoparasites in the veterinary medicine field and in the field of animal husbandry. The active compounds according to the invention are used here in a known manner, such as by oral use in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, potions or granules, by means of dermal use in the form of, for example, dipping, spraying, pouring-on, spotting-on and dusting, and by parenteral use in the form of, for example, injection. The novel compounds of the formula I according to the invention can accordingly also particularly advantageously be used in livestock husbandry (for example cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry, such as chickens, geese and the like). In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the novel compounds are administered orally to the animals, if appropriate in suitable formulations (cf. above) and if appropriate with the drinking water or feed. Since excretion in the faeces takes place in an active manner, the development of insects in the faeces of the animals can be prevented very easily in this way. The dosages and formulations suitable in each case depend in particular on the species and the development stage of the stock animals and also on the pressure of infestation, and can easily be determined and specified by the customary methods. The novel compounds can be employed in cattle, for example, in dosages of 0.01 to 1 mg/kg of body weight. The compounds of the formula I according to the invention are also distinguished by an outstanding fungicidal action. Fungal pathogens which have already penetrated into the plant tissue can successfully be controlled curatively. This is particularly important and advantageous for those fungal diseases which can no longer be controlled effectively with the otherwise customary fungicides after infection has occurred. The action spectrum of the compounds claimed includes various economically important phytopathogenic fungi, such as, for example, Plasmopara viticola, Phytophthora infestans, Erysiphe graminis, Pyricularia oryzae, Pyrenophora teres, Leptosphaeria nodorum and Pellicularia sasakii and Puccinia recondita. In addition, the compounds according to the invention are also suitable for use in industrial fields, for example as wood preservatives, as preservatives in paints and in cooling lubricants for metalworking, or as preservatives in drilling and cutting oils. The active compounds according to the invention can be used in their commercially available formulations either by th emselves or in combination with other fungicides known from the literature. The following products, for example, may be mentioned as fungicides which are known from the literature and can be combined according to the invention with the compounds of the formula I: aldimorph, andoprim, anilazine, BAS 480F, BAS 450F, BAS 490F, benalaxyl, benodanil, benomyl, binapacryl, bitertanol, bromuconazole, buthiobate, captafol, captan, carbendazim, carboxin, CGA 173506, cyprodinil, cyprofuram, dichlofluanid, dichlomezin, diclobutrazol, diethofencarb, difenconazol (CGA 169374), difluconazole, dimethirimol, dimethomorph, diniconazole, dinocap, dithianon, dodemorph, dodine, edifenfos, ethirimol, etridiazol, epoxiconazole, fenbuconazole, fenarimol, fenfuram, fenpiclonil, fenpropidin, fenpropimorph, fentin acetate, fentin hydroxide, ferimzone (TF 164), fluazinam, fluobenzimine, fludioxinil, fluquinconazole, fluorimide, flusilazole, flutolanil, flutriafol, folpet, fosetylaluminium, fuberidazole, fulsulfamide (MT-F 651), furalaxyl, furconazole, furmecyclox, guazatine, hexaconazole, ICI A5504, imazalil, imibenconazole, iprobenfos, iprodione, isoprothiolane, KNF 317, copper compounds, such as Cu oxychloride, oxine-Cu, Cu oxide, mancozeb, maneb, mepanipyrim (KIM 3535), metconazol, mepronil, metalaxyl, methasulfocarb, methfuroxam, MON 24000, myclobutanil, nabam, nitrothalidopropyl, nuarimol, ofurace, oxadixyl, oxycarboxin, penconazole, pencycuron, PP 969, probenazole, propineb, prochloraz, procymidon, propamocarb, propiconazole, prothiocarb, pyracarbolid, pyrazophos, pyrifenox, pyrimethanil, pyroquilon, rabenzazole, RH7592, sulfur, tebuconazole, TF 167, thiabendazole, thicyofen, thiofanatemethyl, thiram, tolclofos-methyl, tolylfluanid, triadimefon, triadimenol, triazoxid, tricyclazole, tridemorph, triflumizol, triforine, triflonazol, validamycin, vinchlozolin, XRD 563, zineb, sodium dodecylsulfonate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium C13/C15-alcohol ether-sulfonate, sodium cetostearyl phosphate ester, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, sodium isopropyl-naphthalenesulfonate, sodium methylenebisnaphthalene-sulfonate, cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium chloride, salts of long-chain primary, secondary or tertiary amines, alkyl-propyleneamines, lauryl-pyrimidinium bromide, ethoxylated quaternized fatty amines, alkyl-dimethyl-benzyl-ammonium chloride and 1-hydroxyethyl-2-alkyl-imidazoline.

PREPARATION EXAMPLES Example A 5-Chloro-6-ethyl-4-2-(4-methylphenyl)-1,3-dioxan-5-ylamino-pyrimidine 4.6 g (0.02 mol) of 5-chloro-6-ethyl-4-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propylamino)-pyrimidine, 4.6 g (0.02 mol) of p-tolylaldehyde and 0.5 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid hydrate were heated in 100 ml of toluene for 6 hours using a water separator. After cooling, the mixture was extracted by stirring with dilute sodium hydroxide solution and concentrated aqueous bisulfite solution and the organic phase was dried and concentrated. For purification and for separation of the cis/trans isomers, the residue was chromatographed over silica gel with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (8:2). This gave initially 0.64 g (9.6% of theory) of the trans isomer (colorless crystals, melting point 129-130 C.), and then 3.55 g (53.2% of theory) of the cis isomer (colorless crystals, melting point 107-108 C.). Preparation of the starting substance 5-chloro-6-ethyl-4-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propylamino)-pyrimidine. 27.3 g (0.3 mol) of 2-amino-1,3-propanediol, 53.1 g (0.3 mol) of 4,5-dichloro-6-ethylpyrimidine and 44.6 g (0.45 mol) of triethylainine were heated under reflux in 500 ml of toluene for 6 hours. A white precipitate of triethylamine hydrochloride and undissolved product formed. The toluene was stripped off, the solid contents of the flask were dissolved in methanol and, for purification and removal of the triethylamine hydrochloride, the solution was chromatographed over silica gel with methanol as the mobile phase. This gave 39.0 g of colorless crystals (56.1% of theory), melting point 104-105 C. Example B 4-(2-n-Butyl-2-methyl-1,3-dioxan-5-ylamino)-5-chloro-6-ethyl-pyrimidine 2.16 g (9 mmol) of 5-chloro-6-ethyl-4-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propylamino)-pyrimidine (Example 1), 1.80 g (18 mmol) of 2-hexanone and 500 mg of p-toluenesulfonic acid were heated in 100 ml of toluene for 8 hours, using a water separator. After the mixture had been extracted by stirring with dilute sodium hydroxide solution, the organic phase was dried and concentrated. The cis/trans isomers were separated by chromatography over silica gel (mobile phase: ethyl acetate/petroleum ether 4:1). 0.29 g of trans isomer (10.3% of theory, colorless oil) was first eluted, followed by 0.49 g of the cis isomer (17.3% of theory, colorless oil). Example C 5-Chloro-6-ethyl-4-(2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-5-ylamino)-pyrimidine 2.65 g (15 mmol) of 4,5-dichloro-6-ethyl-pyrimidine, 2.40 g (18.3 mmol) of 5-amino-2,4-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane and 3.03 g (30 mmol) of triethylamine were heated under reflux in 10 ml of toluene for 4 hours. After cooling, the mixture was extracted by stirring with water and the organic phase was dried and concentrated. For purification, the residue was chromatographed over silica gel (ethyl acetate/petroleum ether 4:1). This gave 0.46 g (11% of theory) of product as a colorless oil. Preparation of the precursor 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-5-ylamine 6.1 g (47 mmol) of 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxan-5-one (D. Enders, B. Bockstiegel, Synthesis 1989, 493, incorporated herein by reference) were subjected to reductive amination in 50 ml of ammoniasaturated methanol in an autoclave at 50 C. under a hydrogen pressure of 100 bar, using Raney nickel as the catalyst. After the catalyst had been filtered off and the filtrate concentrated, 4.8 g of a brown oil were obtained, this being further reacted without purification. Example D 5-Chloro-6-ethyl-4-cis-2-(4-methylphenyl)-1,3-dithian-5-ylamino-pyrimidine 1.77 g (10 mmol) of 4,5-dichloro-6-ethyl-pyrimidine and 2.2 g (10 mmol) of 5-amino-2-(4-methylphenyl)-1,3-dithian were stirred with 2.02 g of triethylamine at 80-90 C. for 6 hours. The mixture was taken up in water/methylene chloride and the organic phase was dried and concentrated. For purification, the residue was chromatographed over silica gel (eluting agent petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 4:1). This gave 1.0 g of colorless solid (27.3% of theory), melting point: 138-139 C. Preparation of the educt 5-amino-2-(4-methylphenyl)-1,3-dithian 22.4 g (0.1 mol) of 2-(4-methylphenyl)-1,3-dithian-5-one and 77.1 g (1.0 mol) of ammonium acetate were stirred in 250 ml of methanol with the addition of 37.5 g of molecular sieve (3 ) for 30 minutes and 6.30 g (0.1 mol) of sodium cyanoborohydride were then added in portions at 20 C. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 48 hours, diluted with methanol and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated and the residue was taken up in dilute hydrochloric acid/toluene. The hydrochloric acid phase was rendered basic with concentrated sodium hydroxide solution and extracted with ether. This gave 2.2 g of product as a colorless oil (9.8% of theory), which was reacted without further purification. Preparation of 2-(4-methylphenyl)-1,3-dithian-5-one 131 g of methyl 2-(4-methylphenyl)-1,3-dithia-cyclohexan-5-one-4-carboxylate (0.464 mol) were heated under reflux with 350 ml of 2N sulfuric acid for 6 hours, with intensive stirring. After cooling, the mixture was decanted and the residue was taken up in ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with bicarbonate solution and water, dried and concentrated. For further purification, the solid residue was suspended in diisopropyl ether and filtered off with suction. This gave 62.7 g of yellow crystals (60.2% of theory), melting point: 112-113 C. Preparation of methyl 2-(4-methylphenyl)-1,3-dithian-5-one-4-carboxylate 42.30 g of sodium hydride (80% dispersion in oil) (1.41 mol) were suspended in 700 ml of toluene and the suspension was heated to 90 C. 211.2 g (0.67 mol) of bis-(5-carbomethoxymethyl)-(4-methylbenzaldehyde)-mercaptal were slowly added dropwise at this temperature. Severe evolution of hydrogen and a yellow coloration of the reaction mixture occurred. If necessary, it was possible to start the reaction by addition of a few drops of ethanol. The mixture was then stirred at 100 C. for 4 hours. After cooling to room temperature, 20 ml of ethanol were added dropwise to destroy excess sodium hydride, water was added, the mixture was brought to pH 3 with concentrated hydrochloric acid and the organic phase was separated off. The aqueous phase was extracted twice more by stirring with toluene and the combined organic phases were extracted by stirring with bicarbonate solution. After drying and concentration of the organic phase, 131.7 g of product (69.4% of theory) were obtained, this being reacted without further purification. Preparation of bis-(5-carbomethoxymethyl)-(4-methylphenyl)-mercaptal 120.1 g (1.0 mol) of p-tolylaldehyde and 201.7 g (1.9 mol) of methyl mercaptoacetate were heated with 5 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid hydrate in 600 ml of toluene, using a water separator, until the formation of water had ended. The mixture was then extracted twice by stirring with bicarbonate solution and water and the organic phase was dried and concentrated. To remove excess aldehyde, the crude product was dissolved in ethyl acetate and extracted by stirring with concentrated sodium bisulfite solution. After drying and concentration of the organic phase, 213.2 g of crude product were obtained (67.8% of theory), this being reacted further without further purification. Example E 3-Chloro-2-ethyl-4-(2-phenyl-1,3-dioxan-5-ylamino)-pyridine 2.3 g (10 mmol) of 5-chloro-6-ethyl-4-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propylamino)-pyridine (prepared analogously to Example A from 2-amino-1,3-propanediol and 3,4-dichloro-2-ethyl-pyridine) and 5.0 g of benzaldehyde were heated with 2.1 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid hydrate in 40 ml of toluene, using a water separator, until the evolution of water had ended. Working up and purification were carried out analogously to Example A. the chromatography over silica gel (ethyl acetate) gave initially 0.6 g of trans isomer (18.8% of theory), melting point: 139-140 C., and then 2.4 g of cis isomer (75.2% of theory), melting point 119-120 C. Example F 5-Chloro-6-ethyl-4-(cis-2-phenyl-dioxan-5-yloxy)-pyrimidine 1.8 g (10 mmol) of cis-5-hydroxy-2-phenyl-1,3-dioxane (E. Juaristi, S. Antunez, Tetrahedron 48, 5941 (1992), incorporated herein by reference) and 1.8 g of 4,5-dichloro-6-ethyl-pyrimidine were initially introduced into 15 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran, and 0.4 g (12 mmol) of sodium hydride (80% in mineral oil) was added in portions at room temperature. The mixture was subsequently stirred at room temperature for 8 hours, 2 ml of methanol were added dropwise and the mixture was concentrated. The residue was taken up in ethyl acetate, the mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated. For purification, the residue was chromatographed over silica gel (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 1:1). This gave 1.0 g (31.2% of theory) of colorless solid. Melting point 114-115 C. Example G 5-Methoxy-6-methoxymethyl-4-(2-phenyl-1,3-dioxan-5-ylamino)-pyrimidine In analogy to example A there was first synthesized the intermediate 4-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propylamino)-5-methoxy-6-methoxy-methyl-pyrimidine-4-chloro-5-methoxy-6-methoxymethylpyrimidine (Collection Czechosl. Chem.

Use as an Insecticide/Acaricide Example A In each case 1 ml of the formulation tested, emulsified in water, was applied uniformly to the inside of the lid and the base of a Petri dish, and after the deposit dried, in each case 10 imagos of the housefly (Musca domestica) were introduced. After the dishes were closed, they were kept at room temperature, and the mortality of the test animals was determined after 3 hours. At 250 ppm (based on the content of active compound), the preparations according to Examples No. 2, 6, 7, 33, 35, 36, 40, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 57, 85, 94, 101 and 115 showed a 100% mortality of the test animals employed. Example B Rice seed was germinated under damp conditions on cotton-wool in growing glasses and, after growing to a stem length of about 8 cm, the leaves were introduced into the test solution to be tested. After the solution dripped off, the rice plants treated in this way were introduced into cultivation containers, separated according to the test concentration, and infested with in each case 10 larvae (L3) of the species Nilaparvata lugens. After the closed cultivation containers were kept at 21 C., the mortality of the leafhopper larvae could be determined after 4 days. At a concentration of 250 ppm (based on the content of active compound), the preparations according to Examples No. 2, 6, 7, 13, 23, 26, 29, 33, 35, 36, 40, 46, 48, 49, 50, 53, 54, 57, 85, 86 and 94 showed a 100% mortality of the test animals employed. Example C Wheat seed was pregerminated under water for 6 hours and then placed in 10 ml glass test tubes and covered in each case with 2 ml of soil. After addition of 1 ml of water, the plants remained in the cultivation glasses at room temperature (21 C.) until a growth height of about 3 cm was reached. Middle Diabrotica undecimpunctata larvae stages (in each case 10) were then placed on the soil in the glasses and, after 2 hours, 1 ml of the test liquid in the concentration to be tested was pipetted onto the soil surface in the glasses. After the glasses stood under laboratory conditions (21 C.) for 5 days, the soil and the root parts were examined for live Diabrotica larvae and the mortality was determined. At 250 ppm (based on the content of active compound), the preparations according to Examples No. 2, 6, 7, 13, 26, 29, 33, 36, 38, 40, 52, 53, 54, 57, 85, 86, 92, 94, 101, 127 and 129 showed a 100% mortality of the test animals employed. Example D Broad beans (Vicia faba) heavily infested with the black bean aphid (Aphis fabae) were sprayed with aqueous dilutions of wettable powder concentrates having an active compound content of 250 ppm up until the stage where they started to drip. The mortality of the aphids was determined after 3 days. 100% destruction was achieved with the compounds according to Examples No. 2, 6, 7, 12, 13, 23, 26, 29, 33, 35, 36, 38, 40, 48, 50, 52, 53, 54, 57, 85, 86 and 92. Example E Bean plants (Phaseolus v.) heavily infested with two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae, full population) were sprayed with an aqueous dilution of a wettable powder concentrate which comprised 250 ppm of the particular active compound. The mortality of the mites was checked after 7 days. 100% destruction was achieved with the compounds according to Examples No. 2, 6, 7, 13, 23, 26, 29, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 48, 50, 53, 54, 55, 57, 85, 86 and 94. Example F Disks of filter paper on which eggs of cotton stainers (Oncopeltus fasciatus) lay were treated with in each case 0.5 ml of an aqueous dilution of the formulation to be tested. After the deposit dried on, the Petri dish was closed and the inside was kept at maximum atmospheric humidity. After the dish had been kept at room temperature, the ovicidal action was determined after 7 days. With an active compound content of 500 ppm, a 100% ovicidal action was achieved with the compounds according to Examples No. 6, 13, 33, 35, 48, 52, 53, 54, 55, 57, 85, 86, 94, 101 and 115. Example G Leaves of the Phaseolus vulgaris bean were covered uniformly with eggs of the whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) and, after a development time of the whitefly population to the L2-L3 stage, were sprayed uniformly with the aqueous test emulsions of the formulation. After 4 days, a microscopic check of the larvae on the leaves showed that a 100% destruction was achieved with the compounds according to Examples No. 6, 7, 13, 26, 35, 36, 48, 52, 53, 54, 57 and 86. Example H L2 larvae of Spodoptera litoralis (Egyptian cotton-worm) were placed in Petri dishes which were covered with filter paper on the base and which contained a small amount of nutrient medium. The base with the nutrient medium and the larvae on top was sprayed with the aqueous emulsions of the test substances and the Petri dishes were closed with a lid. After 5 days at about 23 C., the action of the compounds on the larvae was determined. It was found that with the method mentioned, a 100% action was achieved on Spodoptera litoralis larvae with the compounds according to Examples No. 13, 29 and 33 at a concentration of the spray liquor of 250 ppm (based on the active compound). Example J Control of Root Gall Nematodes An aqueous formulation comprising 0.03% of active compound was prepared in a glass vessel (final volume 20 ml). About 5000 freshly hatched, active (mobile) larvae (2nd development stage) of root gall nematodes (Meloidogyne incognita) were added to this prepared mixture. After 6 days of continuous exposure of the nematode larvae, the percentage proportion of individuals which became motionless (immobile) due to the action of the active compound was determined in comparison with the untreated controls. This percentage proportion is called percent nematicidal contact action (Test Section A). After conclusion of this test section, the entire solution (active compound and pretreated nematode larvae) was poured into a pot with three pre-cultivated cucumber plants (Cucumis stivus; soil volume 60 ml; age of the cucumber plants: 9 days after sowing). As a result of this drench application, the active compound content was reduced to 0.009%, based on the soil volume. The host plants treated in this way were then cultivated further in a greenhouse (25 to 27 C., watering twice daily). After two weeks, the host plants with the root balls were removed from the soil mixture infested with nematodes and freed from adhering soil. The plant growth and root formation of the host plants were evaluated visually during this procedure, and recorded. The number of root galls per plant was then counted and compared with the infestation of untreated control plants. The calculation of the percentage reduction in infestation as a criterion for evaluation of the action was carried out in accordance with the Abbott formula. The result is called the percent nematicidal soil drench action (Test Section B). The compounds of Examples 2, 6, 7, 13, 35, 57, 83, 87, 96, 110 and 111 showed a 90 to 100% action against the root gall nematode Meloidogyne incognita in Test Section A and Test Section B. Use as an Antiparasitic Example A In vitro test on tropical cattle ticks (Boophilus microplus) It was possible to detect the activity of the compounds according to the invention against ticks in the following experimental arrangement: To prepare a suitable active compound formulation, the active compounds were dissolved to the extent of 10% (w/v) in a mixture comprising dimethylformamide (85 g), nonylphenol polyglycol ether (3 g) and ethoxylated castor oil (7 g), and the emulsion concentrates thus obtained were diluted with water to a test concentration of 500 ppm. In each case ten fully satiated females of the tropical tick Boophilus microplus were dipped in these active compound dilutions for five minutes. The ticks were then dried on filter paper and then attached with their back to an adhesive film for the purpose of oviposition. The ticks were kept in a heated cabinet at 28 C. and an atmospheric humidity of 90%. As a control, tick females were dipped only in water. Two weeks after the treatment, the inhibition of oviposition was used to evaluate the activity. In this test, the compounds according to Examples No. 2, 7, 13, 17, 21, 23, 25, 26, 33, 35, 36, 38, 40, 44, 50, 52, 54, 55, 57, 63, 85, 87, 96, 100, 104, 106, 108, 110, 111, 179 and 182 in each case caused 100% inhibition of the laying of eggs.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel heterocyclic compounds which inhibit microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, and to methods for decreasing serum lipids and treating atherosclerosis employing such compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) catalyzes the transport of triglyceride (TG), cholesteryl ester (CE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) between small unilamellar vesicles (SUV). Wetterau Zilversmit, Chem. Phys. Lipids 38, 205-22 (1985). When transfer rates are expressed as the percent of the donor lipid transferred per time, MTP expresses a distinct preference for neutral lipid transport (TG and CE), relative to phospholipid transport. The protein from bovine liver has been isolated and characterized. Wetterau Zilversmit, Chem. Phys. Lipids 38, 205-22 (1985). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis of the purified protein suggests that the transfer protein is a complex of two subunits of apparent molecular weights 58,000 and 88,000, since a single band was present when purified NTP was electrophoresed under nondenaturing condition, while two bands of apparent molecular weights 58,000 and 88,000 were identified when electrophoresis was performed in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). These two polypeptides are hereinafter referred to as 58 kDa and 88 kDa, respectively, or the 58 kDa and the 88 kDa component of MTP, respectively, or the low molecular weight subunit and the high molecular weight subunit of MTP, respectively. Characterization of the 58,000 molecular weight component of bovine MTP indicates that it is the previously characterized multifunctional protein, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). Wetterau et al., J. Biol. Chem . 265, 9800-7 (1990). The presence of PDI in the transfer protein is supported by evidence showing that (1) the amino terminal 25 amino acids of the bovine 58,000 kDa component of MTP is identical to that of bovine PDI, and (2) disulfide isomerase activity was expressed by bovine MTP following the dissociation of the 58 kDa-88 kDa protein complex. In addition, antibodies raised against bovine PDI, a protein which by itself has no TG transfer activity, were able to immunoprecipitate bovine TG transfer activity from a solution containing purified bovine MTP. PDI normally plays a role in the folding and assembly of newly synthesized disulfide bonded proteins within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Bulleid Freedman, Nature 335, 649-51 (1988). It catalyzes the proper pairing of cysteine residues into disulfide bonds, thus catalyzing the proper folding of disulfide bonded proteins. In addition, PDI has been reported to be identical to the beta subunit of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase. Koivu et al., J. Biol. Chem . 262, 6447-9 (1987). The role of PDI in the bovine transfer protein is not clear. It does appear to be an essential component of the transfer protein as dissociation of PDI from the 88 kDa component of bovine MTP by either low concentrations of a denaturant (guanidine HCl), a chaotropic agent (sodium perchlorate), or a nondenaturing detergent (octyl glucoside) results in a loss of transfer activity. Wetterau et al., Biochemistry 30, 9728-35 (1991). Isolated bovine PDI has no apparent lipid transfer activity, suggesting that either the 88 kDa polypeptide is the transfer protein or that it confers transfer activity to the protein complex. The tissue and subcellular distribution of MTP activity in rats has been investigated. Wetterau Zilversmit, Biochem. Biophys. Acta 875, 610-7 (1986). Lipid transfer activity was found in liver and intestine. Little or no transfer activity was found in plasma, brain, heart, or kidney. Within the liver, MTP was a soluble protein located within the lumen of the microsomal fraction. Approximately equal concentrations were found in the smooth and rough microsomes. Abetalipoproteinemia is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by a virtual absence of plasma lipoproteins which contain apolipoprotein B (apoB). Kane Havel in The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease , Sixth edition, 1139-64 (1989). Plasma TG levels may be as low as a few mg/dL, and they fail to rise after fat ingestion. Plasma cholesterol levels are often only 20-45 mg/dL. These abnormalities are the result of a genetic defect in the assembly and/or secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) in the liver and chylomicrons in the intestine. The molecular basis for this defect has not been previously determined. In subjects examined, triglyceride, phospholipid, and cholesterol synthesis appear normal. At autopsy, subjects are free of atherosclerosis. Schaefer et al., Clin. Chem . 34, B9-12 (1988). A link between the apoB gene and abetalipoproteinemia has been excluded in several families. Talmud et al., J. Clin. Invest . 82, 1803-6 (1988) and Huang et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet . 46, 1141-8 (1990). Subjects with abetalipoproteinemia are afflicted with numerous maladies. Kane Havel, supra. Subjects have fat malabsorption and TG accumulation in their enterocytes and hepatocytes. Due to the absence of TG-rich plasma lipoproteins, there is a defect in the transport of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin E. This results in acanthocytosis of erythrocytes, spinocerebellar ataxia with degeneration of the fasciculus cuneatus and gracilis, peripheral neuropathy, degenerative pigmentary retinopathy, and ceroid myopathy. Treatment of abetalipoproteinemic subjects includes dietary restriction of fat intake and dietary supplementation with vitamins A, E and K. In vitro, MTP catalyzes the transport of lipid molecules between phospholipid membranes. Presumably, it plays a similar role in vivo, and thus plays some role in lipid metabolism. The subcellular (lumen of the microsomal fraction) and tissue distribution (liver and intestine) of MTP have led to speculation that it plays a role in the assembly of plasma lipoproteins, as these are the sites of plasma lipoprotein assembly. Wetterau Zilversmit, Biochem. Biophys. Acta 875, 610-7 (1986). The ability of MTP to catalyze the transport of TG between membranes is consistent with this hypothesis, and suggests that MTP may catalyze the transport of TG from its site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to nascent lipoprotein particles within the lumen of the ER. Olofsson and colleagues have studied lipoprotein assembly in HepG2 cells. Bostrom et al., J. Biol. Chem . 263, 4434-42 (1988). Their results suggest small precursor lipoproteins become larger with time. This would be consistent with the addition or transfer of lipid molecules to nascent lipoproteins as they are assembled. MTP may play a role in this process. In support of this hypothesis, Howell and Palade, J. Cell Biol . 92, 833-45 (1982), isolated nascent lipoproteins from the hepatic Golgi fraction of rat liver. There was a spectrum of sizes of particles present with varying lipid and protein compositions. Particles of high density lipoprotein (HDL) density, yet containing apoB, were found. Higgins and Hutson, J. Lipid Res . 25, 1295-1305 (1984), reported lipoproteins isolated from Golgi were consistently larger than those from the endoplasmic reticulum, again suggesting the assembly of lipoproteins is a progressive event. However, there is no direct evidence in the prior art demonstrating that MTP plays a role in lipid metabolism or the assembly of plasma lipoprotein. Recent reports (Science, Vol. 258, page 999, 1992; D. Sharp et al, Nature, Vol. 365, page 65, 1993) demonstrate that the defect causing abetalipoproteinemia is in the MTP gene, and as a result, the NTP protein. Individuals with abetalipoproteinemia have no MTP activity, as a result of mutations in the MTP gene, some of which have been characterized. These results indicate that MTP is required for the synthesis of apoB containing lipoproteins, such as VLDL, the precursor to LDL. It therefore follows that inhibitors of MTP would inhibit the synthesis of VLDL and LDL, thereby lowering VLDL levels, LDL levels, cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels in animals and man. Canadian Patent Application No. 2,091,102 published Mar. 2, 1994 (corresponding to U.S. application Ser. No. 117,362, filed Sep. 3, 1993 (file DC21b)) which is incorporated herein by reference), reports MTP inhibitors which also block the production of apoB containing lipoproteins in a human hepatic cell line (HepG2 cells). This provides further support for the proposal that an MTP inhibitor would lower apoB containing lipoprotein and lipid levels in vivo.

The compounds of the present invention are agents that decrease the activity of MTP and can be administered to various mammalian species, such as monkeys, dogs, cats, rats, humans, etc., in need of such treatment. These agents can be administered systemically, such as orally or parenterally. The agents that decrease the activity of MTP can be incorporated in a conventional systemic dosage form, such as a tablet, capsule, elixir or injectable formulation. The above dosage forms will also include the necessary physiologically acceptable carrier material, excipient, lubricant, buffer, antibacterial, bulking agent (such as mannitol), anti-oxidants (ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite) or the like. Oral dosage forms are preferred, although parenteral forms are quite satisfactory as well. The dose administered must be carefully adjusted according to the age, weight, and condition of the patient, as well as the route of administration, dosage form and regimen, and the desired result. In general, the dosage forms described above may be administered in amounts of from about 5 to about 500 mg per day, preferably, from about 10 to about 400 mg per day in single or divided doses of one to four times daily.

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a novel 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative and agricultural chemicals, particularly agents for controlling plant diseases, containing this compound as an active ingredient. BACKGROUND ART In agricultural production, there are needs for controlling various fungi pathogenic to plants, pests, weeds, and the like, and agricultural chemicals have hitherto been useful means therefor. However, there have been problems in that some compounds are phytotoxic for plants, and particularly for the crop plants to which the agricultural chemicals are applied, even though these compounds have excellent activity as agricultural chemicals, or in that even compounds which are not phytotoxic are not effective enough for practical use. Accordingly, production of compounds which are greatly effective as agricultural chemicals and which have little phytotoxicity has always been demanded. Japanese Patent No. 2514823 and Japanese Patent Application, First Publication (Kokai), No. 1-283270, disclose that 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid derivatives having specific structures are active in protecting crop plants from pathogenic microorganisms. However, these compounds are phytotoxic for some types of crops, although these compounds were effective. On the other hand, 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol, to which the present invention relates, can be synthesized, for example, by bringing about a reduction reaction using 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid or an ester thereof as a starting material. (J. Prakt. Chem., Vol. 134, pp. 177-187 (1932); West German Patent Publication No. 3,615,293) However, neither a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative according to the present invention nor use of 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol and a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative as an agricultural chemical has been known. The object to be achieved by the present invention is to provide a novel compound with which there is little possibility of phytotoxicity for crop plants, and which is greatly effective in controlling various plant diseases caused by viruses pathogenic to plants, by bacteria, and by molds, and to provide agricultural chemicals, particularly agents for controlling plant diseases, containing this compound, i.e., 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol, and/or a benzoic acid ester thereof as an active ingredient.

Alternatively, a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative expressed by formula (1) can be obtained by reacting 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol with a suitable halogenating agent, arylsulfonic acid, or the like to form a leaving group, and thereafter reacting with a carboxylic acid derivative, an alcohol derivative, or the like. Alternatively, a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative expressed by formula (1) can be obtained by adding 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol to an olefin derivative, an isocyanate derivative, or the like in the presence of a catalyst such as an acid or a base. As a solvent for the reaction, a hydrocarbon such as hexane, benzene, and toluene, an alcohol such as methanol and ethanol, a polyol or polyol ester such as ethylene glycol and ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, an ether such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran, a hydrocarbon halide such as chloroform and dichloroethane, or an aprotic polar solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide can be used. As a base, an organic base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, and diazabicycloundecene, a hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, or a carbonate salt such as potassium carbonate and cesium carbonate can be used. The reaction temperature is normally in the range between 10 C. and the boiling point, although it varies depending on the solvent, the base, and the like. The reaction time is normally 0.1 to 10 hours, and preferably 0.5 to 5 hours, although it varies depending on the reaction temperature, the solvent, the base, and the like. A method for synthesizing 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol, which is a material for synthesizing the compound of the present invention, is disclosed, for example in J. Prakt. Chem., Vol 134, pp. 177-187 (1932). Novel compounds of the present invention include: a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative in which W in general formula (1) denotes a C 1 to C 8 alkyl group or a trifluoromethylpyridyl group, the C 1 to C 8 alkyl group being unsubstituted or being substituted with an alkoxy group, an alkylthio group, a cyano group, a phenyl group, or a pyridyl group, the pyridyl group being optionally substituted with a halogen atom; a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative in which W in general formula (1) denotes SO 2 R 2 in which R 2 denotes a C 1 to C 12 alkyl group or a phenyl group which is optionally substituted with a C 1 to C 12 alkyl group; a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative in which W in general formula (1) denotes PO(OR 3 ) 2 in which R 3 denotes a C 1 to C 4 alkyl group; a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative in which W in general formula (1) denotes CONHR 4 , COOR 4 or COCOR 4 in which R 4 denotes a C 1 to C 3 alkyl group or a phenyl group; and a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative in which W in general formula (1) denotes SiR 5 R 6 R 7 in which each of R 5 to R 7 , being the same or different, denotes a C 1 to C 4 alkyl group. Among the above 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivatives, in view of the balance of agricultural chemical activity and phytotoxicity, a preferable one is a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative in which W in general formula (1) denotes a C 1 to C 8 alkyl group or a trifluoromethylpyridyl group, the C 1 to C 8 alkyl group being unsubstituted or being substituted with an alkoxy group, an alkylthio group, a cyano group, a phenyl group, or a pyridyl group, the pyridyl group being optionally substituted with a halogen atom. Alternatively, a novel compound of the present invention is a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative in which W in general formula (1) denotes COR 1 in which R 1 denotes: a C 1 to C 18 alkyl group which is unsubstituted or which is substituted with an alkoxy group, an alkylthio group, a phenyl group (the phenyl group being optionally substituted with an alkoxy group), a hydroxy group, a phenylalkoxy group, a phenylalkylthio group, an alkyloxycarbonyl group, an alkylcarbonylamino group, or a phenoxy group; a C 1 to C 18 alkenyl group which is unsubstituted or which is substituted with a phenyl group which is optionally substituted with an alkoxy group; a phenyl group which has one or more substituent groups, being the same or different, the substituent groups being selected from: halogen atoms; C 1 to C 6 alkyl groups which are optionally substituted with a halogen atom; C 1 to C 12 alkoxy groups which are optionally substituted with a halogen atom; C 2 to C 3 alkenyloxy groups; a nitro group; an amino group; C 1 to C 4 alkylamino groups; a cyano group; an acetylamino group; a benzoylamino group; an acetyloxy group; a phenyl group; and a phenoxy group; or a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring residue which has any one of a nitrogen atom, an oxygen atom, or a sulfur atom as a ring component atom, the heterocyclic ring residue being optionally substituted with a C 1 to C 4 alkyl group. Among these compounds, in view of the balance of agricultural chemical activity and phytotoxicity, a preferable one is a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative in which R 1 is an alkenyl group which is unsubstituted or which is substituted with a phenyl group which is optionally substituted with an alkoxy group, or a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative in which R 1 is a phenyl group which has one or more substituent groups, being the same or different, the substituent groups being selected from: halogen atoms; C 1 to C 6 alkyl groups which are optionally substituted with a halogen atom; C 1 to C 12 alkoxy groups which are optionally substituted with a halogen atom; C 2 to C 3 alkenyloxy groups; a nitro group; an amino group; C 1 to C 4 alkylamino groups; a cyano group; an acetylamino group; a benzoylamino group; an acetyloxy group; a phenyl group; and a phenoxy group. Among these, a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative in which R 1 is a C 1 to C 12 alkoxyphenyl group which is optionally substituted with a halogen atom is most preferable. An agricultural chemical, particularly an agent for controlling a plant disease, containing a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative of the present invention as an active ingredient can be used against various plant diseases caused by viruses pathogenic to plants, by bacteria, and by molds, such as blast, which is a major disease of rice, and leaf blight of cucumbers. Such an agricultural chemical particularly exhibits great effects against blast. This agricultural chemical is believed to exhibit effects in controlling the diseases not only by the fungicidal action directly on fungi pathogenic to plants, but by the action which induces resistant reaction, which is innate to the plants, to the fungi pathogenic to the plants. As this agricultural chemical, a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative may be used alone. However, an agricultural chemical may be used which is prepared in the form of a wettable powder, a solution, an oil solution, a dust, a granule, a sol (a suspension concentrate), or the like by mixing a 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative with a known conventional solid or liquid carrier and an adjuvant such as a dispersant, a diluent, an emulsifier, a spreader, and a thickener. Examples of solid or liquid carriers are talc, clay, bentonite, kaolin, diatomaceous earth, montmorillonite, mica, vermiculite, gypsum, calcium carbonate, white carbon, wood meal, starch, alumina, silicate salts, polysaccharides, wax, alcohols (such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, and benzyl alcohol), fractions of petroleum distillate (such as petroleum ether, kerosene, and solvent naphtha), aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons (such as n-hexane and cyclohexane), aromatic hydrocarbons (such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, chlorobenzene, cumene, and methylnaphthalene), hydrocarbon halides (such as chloroform and dichloromethane), ethers (such as isopropyl ether, ethylene oxide and tetrahydrofuran), ketones (such as acetone, ethyl methyl ketone, cyclohexanone, and isobutyl methyl ketone), esters (such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethylene glycol acetate, and amyl acetate), acid amides (such as dimethylformamide and dimethylacetanilide), nitriles (such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, and acrylonitrile), sulfoxides (such as dimethyl sulfoxide), and alcohol ethers (such as ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and ethylene glycol monoethyl ether). Examples of adjuvants are nonionic surface active agents (such as polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl esters, polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ethers, polyoxyethylene sorbitan alkyl ethers, and sorbitan alkyl esters), anionic surface active agents (such as alkylbenzenesulfonates, alkylsulfosuccinates, polyoxyethylene alkyl sulfates, and arylsulfonates), cationic surface active agents (such as alkylamines, polyoxyethylenealkylamines, and quaternary ammonium salts), amphoteric surface active agents (such as alkylaminoethylglycine and alkyldimethylbetaine), polyvinyl alcohol, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, gum arabic, tragacanth gum, xanthane gum, polyvinyl acetate, gelatin, casein, and sodium alginate. In addition, the agricultural chemical of the present invention may be used in a mixture with any of various agricultural chemicals (such as fungicides for agricultural and horticultural use, herbicides, plant growth regulators, insecticides, and acaricides) and fertilizers. The amount of the active ingredient in the agricultural chemical of the present invention is normally 0.5 to 95% by weight, and preferably 1 to 50% by weight, although the amount varies depending on the prepared form, the process of application, and other conditions. In the process of application of the agricultural chemical of the present invention, the agricultural chemical may be applied to plants (foliage application), soil on which plants grow (soil application), paddy surface water (water surface application), seeds (seed treatment), or the like. A suitable amount of the agricultural chemical of the present invention used per 10 ares, although it varies depending on the plant to which the agricultural chemical is applied and on the disease of the plant, is 50 to 300 L of a solution having 1 to 10000 ppm, preferably 10 to 1000 ppm, of the active ingredient in the case of foliage application, and 0.1 g to 1000 g, preferably 10 to 100 g, of the active ingredient in the case of soil application or water surface application. In the case of seed treatment, 0.001 to 50 g of the active ingredient per 1 kg of seeds are preferable. A 2,6-dichloro-4-pyridinemethanol derivative according to the present invention does not have the possibility of being phytotoxic for plants, and is greatly effective in controlling various plant diseases caused by viruses pathogenic to plants, by bacteria, and by molds, as it is useful as an agent for controlling plant diseases.

Test Example 1 Test for Rice Blast Control (Water Surface Application) Chemical solutions prepared by diluting each wettable powder described in Formulation Example 2 in water were applied to rice plants (cultivar: Aichiasahi) in the two-leaf stage planted in pots (diameter: 6 cm; height: 5.5 cm) by way of water surface application (amount of active ingredient: 0.01 mg/pot). Fourteen days later, a suspension of spores of rice blast fungus (Pyricularia oryzae) was sprayed for inoculation. After the rice plants were left in a moist chamber at 25 C. for 24 hours, they were kept in a greenhouse. The number of lesions was investigated 10 days after the inoculation. Tests were also conducted in a similar manner using the same amount of active ingredients, but using, as controls, propenazole granules which are commercially sold as an agent for controlling rice blast (active ingredient: 8%) and 2,6-dichloronicotinic acid (a compound disclosed in Japanese Patent No 2514823). Protective values were calculated according to the following formula. In addition, foliage die back and growth retardation of the plants were observed for phytoxicity. The results are shown in Table 28. In the table, the minus sign () indicates that no phytotoxicity was observed, and the plus sign () indicates that phytoxicity was observed.

m0-10; n1-3; and p0-10; with the proviso that mp is less than or equal to 15; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which are useful in treating metabolic disorders related to insulin resistance or hyperglycemia. This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/112,008, which was converted from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/076,708, filed May 12, 1998 now abandoned, pursuant to a petition filed under 37 C.F.R. 1.53(c)(2)(i) on Jun. 16, 1998. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The prevalence of insulin resistance in glucose intolerant subjects has long been recognized. Reaven et al ( American Journal of Medicine 1976, 60, 80) used a continuous infusion of glucose and insulin (insulin/glucose clamp technique) and oral glucose tolerance tests to demonstrate that insulin resistance existed in a diverse group of nonobese, nonketotic subjects. These subjects ranged from borderline glucose tolerant to overt, fasting hyperglycemia. The diabetic groups in these studies included both insulin dependent (IDDM) and noninsulin dependent (NIDDM) subjects. Coincident with sustained insulin resistance is the more easily determined hyperinsulinemia, which can be measured by accurate determination of circulating plasma insulin concentration in the plasma of subjects. Hyperinsulinemia can be present as a result of insulin resistance, such as is in obese and/or diabetic (NIDDM) subjects and/or glucose intolerant subjects, or in IDDM subjects, as a consequence of over injection of insulin compared with normal physiological release of the hormone by the endocrine pancreas. The association of hyperinsulinemia with obesity and with ischemic diseases of the large blood vessels (e.g. atherosclerosis) has been well established by numerous experimental, clinical and epidemiological studies (summarized by Stout, Metabolism 1985, 34, 7, and in more detail by Pyorala et al, Diabetes/Metabolism Reviews 1987, 3, 463). Statistically significant plasma insulin elevations at 1 and 2 hours after oral glucose load correlates with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Since most of these studies actually excluded diabetic subjects, data relating the risk of atherosclerotic diseases to the diabetic condition are not as numerous, but point in the same direction as for nondiabetic subjects (Pyorala et al). However, the incidence of atherosclerotic diseases in morbidity and mortality statistics in the diabetic population exceeds that of the nondiabetic population (Pyorala et al; Jarrett Diabetes/Metabolism Reviews 1989, 5, 547; Harris et al, Mortality from diabetes, in Diabetes in America 1985). The independent risk factors obesity and hypertension for atherosclerotic diseases are also associated with insulin resistance. Using a combination of insulin/glucose clamps, tracer glucose infusion and indirect calorimetry, it has been demonstrated that the insulin resistance of essential hypertension is located in peripheral tissues (principally muscle) and correlates directly with the severity of hypertension (DeFronzo and Ferrannini, Diabetes Care 1991, 14, 173). In hypertension of the obese, insulin resistance generates hyperinsulinemia, which is recruited as a mechanism to limit further weight gain via thermogenesis, but insulin also increases renal sodium reabsorption and stimulates the sympathetic nervous system in kidneys, heart, and vasculature, creating hypertension. It is now appreciated that insulin resistance is usually the result of a defect in the insulin receptor signaling system, at a site post binding of insulin to the receptor. Accumulated scientific evidence demonstrating insulin resistance in the major tissues which respond to insulin (muscle, liver, adipose), strongly suggests that a defect in insulin signal transduction resides at an early step in this cascade, specifically at the insulin receptor kinase activity, which appears to be diminished (reviewed by Haring, Diabetalogia 1991, 34, 848). Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) play an important role in the regulation of phosphorylation of proteins. The interaction of insulin with its receptor leads to phosphorylation of certain tyrosine molecules within the receptor protein, thus activating the receptor kinase. PTPases dephosphorylate the activated insulin receptor, attenuating the tyrosine kinase activity. PTPases can also modulate post-receptor signaling by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of cellular substrates of the insulin receptor kinase. The enzymes that appear most likely to closely associate with the insulin receptor and therefore, most likely to regulate the insulin receptor kinase activity, include PTP1B, LAR, PTP and SH-PTP2 (B. J. Goldstein, J. Cellular Biochemistry 1992, 48, 33; B. J. Goldstein, Receptor 1993, 3, 1-15,; F. Ahmad and B. J. Goldstein Biochim. Biophys Acta 1995, 1248, 57-69). McGuire et al. ( Diabetes 1991, 40, 939), demonstrated that nondiabetic glucose intolerant subjects possessed significantly elevated levels of PTPase activity in muscle tissue vs. normal subjects, and that insulin infusion filled to suppress PTPase activity as it did in insulin sensitive subjects. Meyerovitch et al ( J. Clinical Invest . 1989, 84, 976) observed significantly increased PTPase activity in the livers of two rodent models of IDDM, the genetically diabetic BB rat, and the STZ-induced diabetic rat. Sredy et al ( Metabolism , 44, 1074, 1995) observed similar increased PTPase activity in the livers of obese, diabetic ob/ob mice, a genetic rodent model of NIDDM. 2-Aminothiazoleacetic acid derivatives have been used extensively in chemical and patent literature as intermediates for penam and cepham classes of antibiotics, but the long (C 16 , C 18 ) unsaturated carboxamide chains at C 2 of the thiazoleacetic acid moiety makes these compounds novel. WO 9616650 and JP 07149745 generically claim lower alkyl amides of 2-aminothiazoleacetic acid are antibacterial and antiinflammatory (elastase inhibitors) agents, respectively. U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,821 (1997, to AHP) teaches that some of the same compounds that are in this invention are inhibitors of the enzymes phospholipase A 2 derived from human sources (anti-inflammatory agents), but others are not and vice-versa. Certain long acylhydrocarbon chain derivatives of 2-aminothiazoleacetic acid have been prepared (Toth, Liebigs Ann. Chem. EN , 7, 685, 1994). DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The compounds of this invention have been shown to inhibit rat-derived and human derived recombinant PTPase-1B (rPTP-1B) in vitro. They are useful in the treatment of insulin resistance associated with obesity, glucose intolerance, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and ischemic diseases of the large and small blood vessels. This invention provides a method of using a compound of formula I having the structure wherein R 1 , R 2 are both hydrogen or form a bond, or are each, independently, alkyl of 1-6 carbon atoms or aryl of 6-12 carbon atoms; m0-10; n1-3; and p0-10; with the proviso that mp is less than or equal to 15; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the treatment of metabolic disorders related to insulin resistance or hyperglycemia, primary hypertension, or atherosclerosis. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be formed from organic and inorganic bases, such as alkali metals (sodium, potassium, or lithium), alkaline earth metals (calcium or magnesium), ammonium, primary, secondary alkyl amines, or tertiary alkyl amines. The use of tromethamine salts of the compounds of this invention showed improved water solubility and bioavailability. It is understood that the compounds of this invention can exhibit E (trans) or Z (cis) stereoisomerism about the double bond, and that this invention covers both the E and Z isomers, at each double bond, and in particular when R 1 and R 2 are both hydrogen, alkyl, or aryl. When R 1 and R 2 are not a bond, it is preferred that they both are hydrogen. Preferred compounds of this invention are those in which: m1 and n3 and p6; m4 and n3 and p3; m5 and n1 and p6 or 8; m7 and n1 and p6; and m10 and n1 and p3. Aryl is defined as an organic radical derived from an aromatic hydrocarbon by the removal of a hydrogen (i.e., phenyl from benzene). It is preferred that the aryl moiety is a phenyl or naphthyl group; with phenyl being most preferred. The aryl moiety may be optionally mono-, di-, or tri- substituted with a substituent selected from the group consisting of alkyl of 1-6 carbon atoms, alkoxy of 1-6 carbon atoms, trifluoromethyl, halogen, alkoxycarbonyl of 2-7 carbon atoms, alkylamino of 1-6 carbon atoms, and dialkylamino in which each of the alkyl groups is of 1-6 carbon atoms, nitro, cyano, CO 2 H, alkylcarbonyloxy of 2-7 carbon atoms, and alkylcarbonyl of 2-7 carbon atoms. The compounds of this invention can be synthesized by saponification of the corresponding 2-fatty acylaminothiazole-4-acetic acid ethyl esters, followed by acidification of the reaction mixture. Basic salts of these acids are prepared also in a conventional manner as is known in the art. In particular the tromethamine salts of this invention provide water soluble derivatives for improved bioavailability. The fatty acylaminothiazoleacetic acid esters are prepared in one of two ways: condensation of ethyl-2-aminothiazoleacetate with a fatty acid chloride in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine in an aprotic solvent (e.g. dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran) at ice temperature (Procedure A) or, preferably, directly from the fatty acid with the aid of an organodiimide coupling agent as is well known in the synthesis of peptides (Procedure B). The fatty acyl starting materials are either prepared according to standard chemical methodology (such as Wittig or Peterson olefination reactions and or modifications thereof, or by reductive dicarbonyl coupling reactions, such as those procedures of McMurry, Corey and Mukiyama), or from commercially available starting materials General procedures to prepare representative compounds of this invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,821, which is hereby incorporated by reference, and the preparation of specific representative compounds of this invention are provided in Examples which follow. The compounds of this invention are useful in treating metabolic disorders related to insulin resistance or hyperglycemia, typically associated with obesity or glucose intolerance. The compounds of this invention are therefore, particularly useful in the treatment or inhibition of type II diabetes. The compounds of this invention are also useful in modulating glucose levels in disorders such as type I diabetes. Additionally, because an association exists between insulin resistance and hypertension and between insulin resistance, hypertension and coronary artery disease, the compounds of this invention are also useful for the treatment of primary (essential) hypertension and atherosclerosis. The ability of compounds of this invention to treat or inhibit disorders related to insulin resistance or hyperglycemia was established with representative compounds of this invention in the following pharmacological test procedures which measure the inhibition of PTPase. Inhibition of Recombinant Rat Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (rPTP1B) Activity Using p-nitrophenylphosphate as a Substrate. Measurement of pNPPase Activity. The assay is conducted as described by Moss (Acid Phosphatases. In: Methods of Enzymatic Analysis, Enzymes 2: Esterases, Glycosidases, Lyases, Ligases. Bergmeyer, H. U., ed. Weinheim: Verlag Chemie GmBH, 1984: 92) and Tonks, et al., J. Biol. Chem . 263, 6731, 1988), with minor modifications. The incubation mixture contains in a final volume of 0.24 ml: 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 6.33 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate and 5/25/100 M compound suspended in 1.25% DMSO. rPTP1B (obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Barry Goldstein of Thomas Jefferson University. The enzyme (see Goldstein et al. Mol. Cell. Biochem . 109, 107, 1992), in microvials containing 500-700 g/ml protein in 33 mM TRIS-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) is preincubated with drug in HEPES buffer for ten minutes at 37 C. The reaction is started by the addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate and after 30 minutes at 37 C., the reaction is terminated by adding 1 ml of 0.1 N NaOH. The assay is performed in triplicate and the reaction mixture contains approximately 3.3 g/ml protein, the above components, plus: 5.50 mM TRIS-HCl, 8.33 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.33 mM EDTA and 1.67% glycerol. The samples are read at 410 nm in a spectrophotometer and are evaluated based on a calibration curve of p-nitrophenol standard solution. Compounds were screened robotically at a single concentration of 25 M. The results are expressed as percent of control, in that the amount of p-nitrophenol formed in the compound treated samples (nmol/minute/mg protein) is compared to the amount (nmol/minute/mg protein) formed in the untreated samples. p-Nitrophenylphosphatase activity is also determined in each experiment and is expressed per minute per mg protein. Representative results are given in Table 1. Inhibition of Recombinant Human Protein Tytosine Phosphatase 1B A representative compound (Example 8) of this invention was also evaluated for inhibition of recombinant human PTP1B. Human recombinant PTP1B was prepared as described by Goldstein (see Goldstein et al. Mol. Cell. Biochem . 109, 107, 1992). The enzyme preparation used was in microtubes containing 500-700 g/ml protein in 33 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Measurement of PTPase Activity. The malachite green-ammonium molybdate method, as described (Lanzetta et al. Anal. Biochem . 100, 95, 1979) and adapted for a platereader, is used for the nanomolar detection of liberated phosphate by recombinant PTP1B. The assay uses, as substrate, a dodecaphosphopeptide custom synthesized by AnaSpec, Inc. (San Jose, Calif.). the peptide, TRDIYETDYYRK, corresponding to the 1142-1153 catalytic domain of the insulin receptor, is tyrosine phosphorylated on the 1146, 1150, and 1151 tyrosine residues. The recombinant rPTP1B is diluted with buffer (pH 7.4, containing 33 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EDTA and 50 mM b-mercaptoethanol) to obtain an approximate activity of 1000-2000 nmoles/min/mg protein. The diluted enzyme (83.25 mL) is preincubated for 10 min at 37 C. with or without test compound (6.25 mL) and 305.5 mL of the 81.83 mM HEPES reaction buffer, pH 7.4 peptide substrate, 10.5 ml at a final concentration of 50 mM, and is equilibrated to 37 C. in a LABLINE Multi-Blok heater equipped with a titerplate adapter. The preincubated recombinant enzyme preparation (39.5 ml) with or without drug is added to initiate the dephosphorylation reaction, which proceeds at 37 C. for 30 min. The reaction is terminated by the addition of 200 mL of the malachite green-ammonium molybdate-Tween 20 stopping reagent (MG/AM/Tw). The stopping reagent consists of 3 parts 0.45% malachite green hydrochloride, 1 part 4.2% ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate in 4 N HCl and 0.5% Tween 20. Sample blanks are prepared by the addition of 200 mL MG/AM/Tw to substrate and followed by 39.5 ml of the preincubated recombinant enzyme with or without drug. The color is allowed to develop at room temperature for 30 min. and the sample absorbances are determined at 650 nm using a platereader (Molecular Devices). Sample and blanks are prepared in quadruplicates. PTPase activities, based on a potassium phosphate standard curve, are expressed as nmoles of phosphate released/min/mg protein. Inhibition of recombinant PTP1B by test compounds is calculated as percent of phosphatase control. A four parameter non-linear logistic regression of PTPase activities using SAS release 6.08, PROC NLIN, is used for determining IC 50 values of test compounds.

No. 08/213,273 Mar. 14, 1994 ABN. FIELD OF THE INVENTION Renin-inhibiting compounds are known for control of hypertension. Of particular interest herein are compounds useful as renin inhibiting agents. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Renin is a proteolytic enzyme produced and secreted into the bloodstream by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney. In the bloodstream, renin cleaves a peptide bond in the serum protein angiotensinogen to produce a decapeptide known as angiotensin I. A second enzyme known as angiotensin converting enzyme, cleaves angiotensin I to produce the octapeptide known as angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent pressor agent responsible for vasoconstriction and elevation of cardiovascular pressure. Attempts have been made to control hypertension by blocking the action of renin or by blocking the formation of angiotensin II in the body with inhibitors of angiotensin I converting enzyme. Classes of compounds published as inhibitors of the action of renin on angiotensinogen include renin antibodies, pepstatin and its analogs, phospholipids, angiotensinogen analogs, pro-renin related analogs and peptide aldehydes. A peptide isolated from actinomyces has been reported as an inhibitor of aspartyl proteases such as pepsin, cathepsin D and renin Umezawa et al, in J. Antibiot. (Tokyo), 23, 259-262 (1970). This peptide, known as pepstatin, was found to reduce blood pressure in vivo after the injection of hog renin into nephrectomized rats Gross et al, Science, 175, 656 (1971). Pepstatin has the disadvantages of low solubility and of inhibiting acid proteases in addition to renin. Modified pepstatins have been synthesized in an attempt to increase the specificity for human renin over other physiologically important enzymes. While some degree of specificity has been achieved, this approach has led to rather high molecular weight hepta- and octapeptides Boger et al, Nature, 303, 81 (1983). High molecular weight peptides are generally considered undesirable as drugs because gastrointestinal absorption is impaired and plasma stability is compromised. Short peptide aldehydes have been reported as renin inhibitors Kokubu et al, Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun., 118, 929 (1984); Castro et al, FEBS Lett., 167, 273 (1984). Such compounds have a reactive C-terminal aldehyde group and would likely be unstable in vivo. Other peptidyl compounds have been described as renin inhibitors. EP Appl. 128,762, published Dec. 18, 1984, describes dipeptide and tripeptide glyco-containing compounds as renin inhibitors also see Hanson et al, Biochm. Biophys. Res. Comm., 132, 155-161 (1985), 146, 959-963 (1987). EP Appl. 181,110, published May 14, 1986, describes dipeptide histidine derivatives as renin inhibitors. EP Appl. 186,977 published Jul. 9, 1986 describes renin-inhibiting compounds containing an alkynyl moiety, specifically a propargyl glycine moiety, attached to the main chain between the N-terminus and the C-terminus, such as N-4(S)-(N)-bis(1-naphthylmethyl)acetyl-DL-propargylglycylamino-3(S)-hydroxy-6-methylheptanoyl-L-isoleucinol. EP Appl. 189,203, published Jul. 30, 1986, describes peptidyl-aminodiols as renin inhibitors. EP Appl. 200,406, published Dec. 10, 1986, describes alkylnaphthylmethylpropionyl-histidyl aminohydroxy alkanoates as renin inhibitors. EP Appl. 216,539, published Apr. 1, 1987, describes alkylnaphthylmethylpropionyl aminoacyl aminoalkanoate compounds as renin inhibitors orally administered for treatment of renin-associated hypertension. EP Appl. 229,667, published Jul. 22, 1987, describes acyl -aminoacyl aminodiol compounds having a piperazinylcarbonyl or an alkylaminoalkylcarbonyl terminal group at the N-amino acid terminus, such as 2(S)-(1-piperazinyl)carbonyl-oxy-3-phenylpropionyl-Phe-His amide of 2(S)-amino-1-cyclohexyl-3(R), 4(S)-dihydroxy-6-methylheptane. PCT Application No. WO 87/04349, published Jul. 30, 1987, describes aminocarbonyl aminoacyl hydroxyether derivatives having an alkylamino-containing terminal substituent and which are described as having renin-inhibiting activity for use in treating hypertension. EP Appl. 300,189 published Jan. 25, 1989 describes amino acid monohydric derivatives having an alkylamino-alkylamino N-terminus and a -alanine-histidine or sarcosyl-histidine attached to the main chain between the N-terminus and the C-terminus, which derivatives are mentioned as useful in treating hypertension. U.S. Pat. No. 4,902,706 which issued Feb. 13, 1990 describes a series of histidineamide-containing amino alkylaminocarbonyl-H-terminal aminodiol derivatives for use as renin inhibitors. U.S. Pat. No. 5,032,577 which issued Jul. 16, 1991 describes a series of histidineamide-aminodiol-containing renin inhibitors.

Preferred aryl groups are those consisting of one, two, or three benzene rings. The term aryl embraces aromatic radicals such as phenyl, naphthyl and biphenyl. The term aralkyl embraces aryl-substituted alkyl radicals such as benzyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenyl-methyl, phenyl-ethyl, phenylbutyl and diphenylethyl. The terms benzyl and phenylmethyl are interchangeable. The terms aryloxy and arylthio denote radical respectively, aryl groups having an oxygen or sulfur atom through which the radical is attached to a nucleus, examples of which are phenoxy and phenylthio. The terms sulfinyl and sulfonyl, whether used alone or linked to other terms, denotes respectively divalent radicals SO and SO 2 . The term aralkoxy, alone or within another term, embraces an aryl group attached to an alkoxy group to form, for example, benzyloxy. The term acyl whether used alone, or within a term such as acyloxy, denotes a radical provided by the residue after removal of hydroxyl from an organic acid, examples of such radical being acetyl and benzoyl. Lower alkanoyl is an example of a more prefered sub-class of acyl. The term amido denotes a radical consisting of nitrogen atom attached to a carbonyl group, which radical may be further substituted in the manner described herein. The amido radical can be attached to the nucleus of a compound of the invention through the carbonyl moiety or through the nitrogen atom of the amido radical. The term alkenylalkyl denotes a radical having a double-bond unsaturation site between two carbons, and which radical may consist of only two carbons or may be further substituted with alkyl groups which may optionally contain additional double-bond unsaturation. The term heterocyclic, as used alone or within groups such as heterocyclicalkyl and heterocycliccycloalkyl, (hereinafter referred to as heterocyclic-containing groups), embraces radicals having a saturated, or partially unsaturated, or fully saturated heterocyclic group, wherein the cyclic portion consists of a ring system having one ring or two fused rings, which ring system contains one, two or three hetero atoms as ring members selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur atoms, and which ring system has 4 to about 12 ring members. Examples of saturated heterocyclic-containing groups are pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, pyrrolidinylmethyl, piperidinylmethyl, pyrrolidinylcyclopropyl and piperidinylcyclopropyl. The term heteroaryl, whether used alone or within the greater terms heteroarylalkyl or heteroarylcycloalkyl, denotes a subset of heterocyclic-containing groups having a cyclic portion which is fully-unsaturated, that is, aromatic in character, and which has one or two hetero atoms as ring members, said hetero atoms selected from oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen atoms, and which ring system has five or six ring members. The heteroaryl ring may be attached to a linear or branched alkyl radical having one to about ten carbon atoms or may be attached to a cycloalkyl radical having three to about nine carbon atoms. Examples of such heteroarylalkyl or heteroarylcycloalkyl groups are pyrazolemethyl, pyrazoleethyl, pyridylmethyl, pyridylethyl, thiazolemethyl, thiazoleethyl, imidazolemethyl, imidazoleethyl, thienylmethyl, thienylethyl, furanylmethyl, furanylethyl, oxazolemethyl, oxazoleethyl, thiazolylcyclopropyl, imidazolecyclopropyl, thienylcyclopropyl, isoxazolemethyl, isoxazoleethyl, pyridazinemethyl, pyridazineethyl, pyrazinemethyl and pyrazineethyl. The heterocyclic portion or heteroaryl portion of the radical, as well as the alkyl or cycloalkyl portion of groups containing a heterocyclic or heteroaryl portion, may be substituted at a substitutable position with one or more groups selected from oxo, alkyl, alkoxy, halo, haloalkyl, cyano, aralkyl, aralkoxy, aryl and aryloxy. Such heterocyclic, heterocyclic-containing group, or heteroaryl group may be attached as a substituent through a carbon atom of the hetero ring system, or may be attached through a carbon atom of a moiety substituted on a hetero ring-member carbon atom, for example, through the methylene substituent of an imidazolemethyl moiety. Also, a heterocyclic or heterocyclic-containing group may be attached through a ring nitrogen atom. For any of the foregoing defined radicals, preferred radicals are those containing from one to about fifteen carbon atoms. Specific examples of alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, methylbutyl, dimethylbutyl and neopentyl. Typical alkenyl and alkynyl groups may have one unsaturated bond, such as an allyl group, or may have a plurality of unsaturated bonds, with such plurality of bonds either adjacent, such as allene-type structures, or in conjugation, or separated by several saturated carbons. Also included in the family of compounds of Formula I are isomeric forms, including diastereoisomers, and the pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof. The term pharmaceutically-acceptable salts embraces salts commonly used to form alkali metal salts and to form addition salts of free acids or free bases. The nature of the salt is not critical, provided that it is pharmaceutically-acceptable. Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salts of compounds of Formula I may be prepared from an inorganic acid or from an organic acid. Examples of such inorganic acids are hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric, carbonic, sulfuric and phosphoric acid. Appropriate organic acids may be selected from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, araliphatic, heterocyclic, carboxylic and sulfonic classes of organic acids, example of which are formic, acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, gluconic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, glucuronic, maleic, fumaric, pyruvic, aspartic, glutamic, benzoic, anthranilic, p-hydroxybenzoic, salicyclic, phenylacetic, mandelic, embonic (pamoic), methansulfonic, ethanesulfonic, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic, pantothenic, benzenesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, sulfanilic, mesylic, cyclohexylaminosulfonic, stearic, algenic, -hydroxybutyric, malonic, galactaric and galacturonic acid. Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable base addition salts of compounds of Formula I include metallic salts made from aluminium, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc or organic salts made from N,N-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine (N-methylglucamine) and procaine. Also included within the phrase pharmaceutically-acceptable salts are quaternary salts or salts of onium cations, such as ammonium, morpholinium and piperazinium cations, as well as any substituted derivatives of these cations where the salt is formed on the nitrogen atom lone pair of electrons. All of these salts may be prepared by conventional means from the corresponding compound of Formula I by reacting, for example, the appropriate acid or base with the compound of Formula I. Compounds of Formula I would be useful to inhibit enzymatic conversion of angiotensionogen to angiotensin I. When administered orally, a compound of Formula I would be expected to inhibit plasma renin activity and, consequently, lower blood pressure in a mammalian subject (e.g., a human subject). Thus, compounds of Formula I would be therapeutically useful in methods for treating hypertension by administering to a hypertensive subject a therapeutically-effective amount of a compound of Formula I. The phrase hypertensive subject means, in this context, a mammalian subject suffering from or afflicted by the effects of hypertension or susceptible to a hypertensive condition if not treated to prevent or control such hypertension. Description of the Synthetic Methods for the Preparation of the Renin Inhibitors of the Invention Synthetic Scheme 1 (Preparation of Compounds of Formula I) A suitably protected amino aldehyde 1 is treated with a Grignard reagent or other organometallic reagent, preferably vinylmagnesium bromide, to obtain the vinyl carbinol 2 . This material, suitably protected, is oxidized, preferably with ozone, followed by dimethyl sulfide or zinc treatment, to give intermediate 3 . The preceeding process is exemplified in Hanson, et al., J. Org. Chem. 50, 5399 (1985). This aldehyde is reacted with an organometallic reagent such as propargylmagnesium bromide to give intermediate 4 . Other suitable organometallic reagents include ethynylmagnesium bromide, 1-methylpropynylmagnesium bromide, 3-methylpropynyl-magnesium bromide, butynylmagnesium bromide and pentynylmagnesium bromide, but the choices are not limited to these reagents. Compound 4 is deprotected then coupled, using standard amide/peptide coupling methodology, to protected amino acid derivatives 5 (such as Boc-thiazolyl-alanine or Boc-histidine or Boc-pyridylalanine) to give compound 6 . These standard coupling procedures such as the carbodiimide, active ester (N-hydroxysuccinimide), and mixed carbonic anhydride methods are shown in Benoiton, et al. J. Org. Chem. 48, 2939 (1983) and Bodansky et al,Peptide Synthesis, Wiley (1976). Intermediate 6 is then deprotected, then coupled to intermediate 7 using the standard amide/peptide coupling methodology, to give compounds of Formula I. Suitable protecting groups may be selected from among those reviewed by R. Geiger in The Peptides, Academic Press, N.Y. vol. 2 (1979). For example, P 1 may by Boc or Cbz; P 2 may be a typical oxygen protective group such as acetyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl. Synthetic Scheme 2 (Preparation of Compounds of Formula I) Intermediate 7 may be prepared according to the schematic of Synthetic Scheme 2. Intermediate 7 is prepared by coupling amine 8 to mono-protected carboxylic acid 9 . Carboxylic acid 9 is a mono-activated moiety by virtue of a suitable leaving group Q which may be chloride, bromide, fluoride, N-hydroxysuccinimido, p-toluenesulfonyloxy or isobutyloxycarbonyloxy, but is not limited to these groups. After coupling, protecting group P 4 is removed (if P 4 is a benzyl group, hydrogenolysis over palladium-on-carbon (Pd-C) is performed) to give intermediate amino acid 7 . Synthetic Scheme 3 (Preparation of Compounds of Formula I) Synthetic Scheme 3 describes the preparation of intermediate 8 , a non-cyclic diamine. Many of the members of this class, such as ethylene diamine, N,N,N-trimethylethylene diamine, N,N-dimethylethylene diamine, N,NI-dimethylpropylene diamine, etc. are commercially available starting materials. Other substituted diamines such as compounds 8 a through 8 c are obtainable by the procedures depicted in Scheme 3. For example, Boc-L-alanine methyl ester is reduced with diisobutylaluminum hydride to give the corresponding aldehyde which is then reductively aminated with methylamine, then the Boc group is cleaved to give 8 a . Alternatively, the procedure of Miller, et al. J. Med. Chem. 19, 1382 (1976) may be employed to give intermediate 8 . In another example, a suitably protected diamine is treated with trifluoroacetaldehyde in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride to give an trifluoroethyl substituent on nitrogen, followed by deprotection to give amine 8 . Abbreviations used: P1 is an N-protecting group; P2 is H or an oxygen protecting group; P3 is an N-protecting group; P4 is an oxygen protecting group such as benzyl or methyl; Q is a leaving group; Boc is t-butyloxycarbonyl; Cbz is carbobenzoxy. The following Steps 1-14 constitute specific exemplification of methods to prepare starting materials and intermediates embraced by the foregoing generic synthetic schemes. Those skilled in the art will readily understand that known variations of the conditions and processes of the following preparative procedures can be used to prepare the compounds of Steps 1-14.

The mixture turned cloudy. Ether (10 mL) was then added to both the flask and to the propargyl bromide solution in the addition funnel. The funnel solution was added dropwise to the reaction mixture which was cooled to 10 C. The white opaque mixture was stirred for 45 minutes at room temperature after the addition was completed. A solution of the title aldehyde of Step 4 (4.64 mmol) in Et 2 O (10 mL) was added dropwise to the flask at room temperature. After 2 h at room temperature, the mixture was cooled down to 0 C. and a saturated NH 4 Cl solution (25 mL) was added.

The mixture was washed with 3N HCl, aqueous sodium bicarbonate, brine and dried over magnesium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated to give a clear mobile liquid (68 g). Chromatography on silica gel, eluting with from 100% hexane to 25% ethyl acetate gave pure 1-(benzyl)-4-(4-methoxybenzyl) itaconate (55 g, 81% yield).

The solvent was evaporated to give the title compound (4.7 g, 85% yield). 300 MHz 1 H NMR: consistent with proposed structure. Step 13 R-2-2-(dimethylamino)ethylmethylaminol-2-oxoethylbenzene propanoic acid The title compound of Step 12 (4.6 g) was dissolved in ethanol (50 mL) and hydrogenated over 4% Pd-C at 5 psi at room temperature for 17 hours.

TABLE I Example Compound No. Structure 3 4 5 6 7 8 BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION Human Renin Inhibition in vitro Compounds of Formula I may be evaluated as inhibitors of human renin in an in vitro assay, as follows: This human renin inhibition test has been previously described in detail Papaioannou et al., Clinical and Experimental Hypertension, A 7(9), 1243-1257 (1985). Human renin is obtained from the National Institute for Biological Standards, London. An incubation mixture is prepared containing the following components: in a total volume of 0.25 mL: 100 mM Tris-acetate buffer at pH 7.4, 2510 6 Goldblatt units of renin, 0.05 mL of plasma from human volunteers taking oral contraceptives, 6.0 mM Na-EDTA, 2.4 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 mM 8-hydroxyquinoline, 0.4 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.024 mg/mL neomycin sulfate. This mixture is incubated for two hours at 37 C. in the presence or absence of renin inhibitors. The produced angiotensin I is determined by radioimmunoassay (New England Nuclear kit). A test compound to be assayed is dissolved in DMSO and diluted with 100 mM Tris-acetate buffer at pH 7.4 containing 0.5% BSA to the appropriate concentration. The final concentration of organic solvent in the reaction mixture is less than 1%. Control incubations at 37 C. are used to correct for effects of organic solvent on renin activity. The in vitro enzymatic conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I would be expected to be inhibited by a test compound of the invention at a concentration in a range from about 1 to 100 nM for the test compound. Marmoset Plasma Renin Activity (PRA) Inhibition on Oral Administration The oral activity of renin inhibitor compounds is determined in vivo in Marmoset monkeys using the following procedure. Common Marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus, Charles River, both sexes, body weight 300-400 g) are placed on a modified high-protein low-sodium diet (Purina, St. Louis, Mo.) for 1 week. About 24 hours prior to the administration of test compound, Lasix (5 mg/kg, im) is given. On the day of the test, the animal is anesthetized with isoflurane, body weight recorded, and a baseline blood sample taken. Then, test compound is given intragastrically and blood samples are taken in K-EDTA for plasma renin activity at appropriate time intervals. The PRA is determined by using the protocol outlined below. Results may be expressed in terms of PRA at various time intervals both before and after compound administrations. It is expected that a compound of the invention, when administered orally, would inhibit marmoset plasma renin activity to a level of at about 70% at a dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight.

Compound concentration in plasma is determined using the bioassay technique described below. The percent bioavailability is calculated by dividing the area under the concentration-vs.-time curve obtained from the intragastric experiment by the area under the concentration-vs.-time curve obtained from the intravenous experiment (adjusting for different doses), and multiplying the result by 100%. A compound of the invention would be expected to be orally bioavailable in marmoset and dog. Renin inhibitor plasma concentrations are determined by a bioassay. The plasma samples are extracted with acetonitrile and the extract is evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. Residue is dissolved in 4% bovine serum albumin containing 0.9% NaCl and 5% EDTA. The dissolved residue (0.1 ml) is incubated with a reaction mixture containing human plasma (0.12 ml), 5% phenylmethysulfonylfluoride (1.2 ul), 10% neomycin (2.4 ul), 0.5 M TES buffer (pH 7.4, 24 ul), and 0.6 mU/ml recombinant human renin (1000 U/mg, 50 ul) at 37 C. for 90 minutes. The renin activity is determined by a standard angiotensin I radioimmunoassay (New England Nuclear Corp.). The amount of test compound in the plasma is determined by comparing the extent of inhibition of renin activity with that produced by a known amount of test compound added to plasma and analyzed above. Renin Inhibitor Species Specificity Method Blood was collected in a 10 ml Becton Dickinson vacutainer tube with 0.1 ml of 15% EDTA (K3) solution (15 mg) from normal animals or high renin animals; i.e., those pre-treated with 5 mg/kg of Lasix intramuscularly 2 times within a 6 hour interval 24 hours prior to bleeding. The blood was then centrifuged at 2500 RPM for 20 minutes and the plasma from the various species respectively pooled, aliquoted and stored in the freezer. The human plasma source was a male Caucasian taking a prescription of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The plasma renin activity assay is a modification of the human renin inhibition test in that the animal plasma is the source of both the renin substrate and the renin enzyme. In a total volume of 0.1 ml, 90 mM Tris-acetate buffer, pH 7.5, 12 mM sodium EDTA, 0.012 mg/ml neomycin sulfate, 0.9 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.61 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, 4 mM 8-hydroxyquinoline and 0.09 ml of the animal or human plasmas were incubated for 2 hours at 37 C. in a shaking water bath or at 4 C. in an ice bath in the presence or absence of renin inhibitors. The produced angiotensin I was determined by radioimmunoassay (New England Nuclear kit). The amount of angiotensin I generated during the 2 hours at 4 C. was usually less than 5% of that activity produced at 37 C.; however, the 40 C. background values were nevertheless subtracted from the 37 C. ones for the 100% activity values. The renin inhibitors are assayed in duplicate using 5 concentrations and the data is expressed as a percent of the 100% total renin activity. The Effect of Compound of the Invention on Marmoset Blood Pressure Reduction on Intravenous Administration The blood pressure reducing activity of the renin inhibitor compound of the invention is determined in vivo in Marmoset monkeys using the following procedure. Common Marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus, Charles River, both sexes, body weight ca. 400 g) were placed on a modified high protein low sodium diet (Purina, St. Louis, Mo.) for 1 week. 24 hours prior to the administration of test compound, Lasix (5 mg/kg, im) was given. On the day of the test, the animal was anesthetized with isoflurane, body weight recorded, and the left femoral artery and vein were catheterized. The animal is allowed to regain consciousness and the title compound of Example 1 (100 micrograms/kg) is administered intravenously in 0.1 mL/kg polyethylene glycol 400 at time zero. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) in mmHg is then recorded every ten minutes until 120 minutes. It is expected that a compound of the invention would lower blood pressure in salt-depleted, conscious marmosets.

These compounds are modulators of CRF receptors and are therefore useful for treating affective disorders, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and stress disorders in humans and other animals. Methods of treatment of such disorders and well as packaged pharmaceutical compositions are also provided. Compounds of the invention are also useful as probes for the localization of CRF receptors and as standards in assays for CRF receptor binding. Methods of using the compounds in receptor localization studies are given. This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application no. 60/127,624, filed Apr. 1, 1999. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates N-phenyl benzimidazolecarboxamides and N-phenyl indolecarboxamides. When appropriately substituted, such compounds act as selective modulators of CRF1 receptors. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and to the use of such compounds in treatment of psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases, including major depression, anxiety-related disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, supranuclear palsy and feeding disorders, as well as treatment of immunological, cardiovascular or heart-related diseases and colonic hypersensitivity associated with psychopathological disturbance and stress. Additionally this invention relates to the use such compounds as probes for the localization of CRF1 receptors in cells and tissues. BACKGROUND Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), a 41 amino acid peptide, is the primary physiological regulator of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) derived peptide secretion from the anterior pituitary gland. In addition to its endocrine role at the pituitary gland, immunohistochemical localization of CRF has demonstrated that the hormone has a broad extrahypothalamic distribution in the central nervous system and produces a wide spectrum of autonomic, electrophysiological and behavioral effects consistent with a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role in brain. There is also evidence that CRF plays a significant role in integrating the response of the immune system to physiological, psychological, and immunological stressors. Clinical data provide evidence that CRF has a role in psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases including depression, anxiety-related disorders and feeding disorders. A role for CRF has also been postulated in the etiology and pathophysiology of Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, Huntingtons disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as they relate to the dysfunction of CRF neurons in the central nervous system. In affective disorder, or major depression, the concentration of CRF is significantly increased in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of drug-free individuals. Furthermore, the density of CRF receptors is significantly decreased in the frontal cortex of suicide victims, consistent with a hypersecretion of CRF. In addition, there is a blunted adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) response to CRF (i.v. administered) observed in depressed patients. Preclinical studies in rats and non-human primates provide additional support for the hypothesis that hypersecretion of CRF may be involved in the symptoms seen in human depression. There is also preliminary evidence that tricyclic antidepressants can alter CRF levels and thus modulate the numbers of CRF receptors in brain. CRF has also been implicated in the etiology of anxietyrelated disorders. CRF produces anxiogenic effects in animals and interactions between benzodiazepine/non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics and CRF have been demonstrated in a variety of behavioral anxiety models. Preliminary studies using the putative CRF receptor antagonist -helical ovine CRF (9-41) in a variety of behavioral paradigms demonstrate that the antagonist produces anxiolytic-like effects that are qualitatively similar to the benzodiazepines. Neurochemical, endocrine and receptor binding studies have all demonstrated interactions between CRF and benzodiazepine anxiolytics providing further evidence for the involvement of CRF in these disorders. Chlordiazepoxide attenuates the anxiogenic effects of CRF in both the conflict test and in the acoustic startle test in rats. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788, which was without behavioral activity alone in the operant conflict test, reversed the effects of CRF in a dose-dependent manner, while the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142 enhanced the actions of CRF. CRF has also been implicated in the pathogeneisis of certain immunological, cardiovascular or heart-related diseases such as hypertension, tachycardia and congestive heart failure, stroke and osteoporosis, as well as in premature birth, psychosocial dwarfism, stress-induced fever, ulcer, diarrhea, post-operative ileus and colonic hypersensitivity associated with psychopathological disturbance and stress. The mechanisms and sites of action through which conventional anxiolytics and antidepressants produce their therapeutic effects remain to be fully elucidated. It has been hypothesized however, that they are involved in the suppression of CRF hypersecretion that is observed in these disorders. Of particular interest are that preliminary studies examining the effects of a CRF receptor antagonist peptide (-helical CRF 9-41 ) in a variety of behavioral paradigms have demonstrated that the CRF antagonist produces anxiolytic-like effects qualitatively similar to the benzodiazepines.

Conversely, if the product is a free base, an addition salt, particularly a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt, may be produced by dissolving the free base in a suitable organic solvent and treating the solution with an acid, in accordance with conventional procedures for preparing acid addition salts from base compounds. Non-toxic pharmaceutical salts include salts of acids such as hydrochloric, phosphoric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfinic, formic, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, nitric, benzoic, citric, tartaric, maleic, hydroiodic, alkanoic such as acetic, HOOC(CH 2 )n-COOH where n is 0-4, and the like. Those skilled in the art will recognize a wide variety of non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts. The present invention also encompasses acylated prodrugs of the compounds of Formula I. Those skilled in the art will recognize various synthetic methodologies which may be employed to prepare non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts and acylated prodrugs of the compounds encompassed by Formula I. The invention encompasses all possible tautomers and rotamers of the compounds represented by Formula I. The compounds of general Formula I may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation or spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. In addition, there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of general Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. One or more compounds of general Formula I may be present in association with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents and/or adjuvants and if desired other active ingredients. The pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of general Formula I may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsion, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Composition intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monosterate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil. Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydropropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example, lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin. Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredients in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide palatable oral preparations. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid. Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol, anhydrides, for example sorbitan monoleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parentally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringers solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono-or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. The compounds of general Formula I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. Compounds of general Formula I may be administered parenterally in a sterile medium. The drug, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants such as local anesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. Dosage levels of the order of from about 0.1 mg to about 140 mg per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions (about 0.5 mg to about 7 g per patient per day). The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient. Frequency of dosage may also vary depending on the compound used and the particular disease treated. However, for treatment of most CNS disorders, a dosage regimen of 4 times daily or less is preferred. For the treatment of stress and depression a dosage regimen of 1 or 2 times daily is particularly preferred. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. Preferred compounds of the invention will have certain pharmacological properties. Such properties include, but are not limited to oral bioavailability, low toxicity, low serum protein binding and desirable in vitro and in vivo half-lifes. Penetration of the blood brain barrier for compounds used to treat CNS disorders is necessary, while low brain levels of compounds used to treat periphereal disorders are often preferred. Assays may be used to predict these desirable pharmacological properties. Assays used to predict bioavailability include transport across human intestinal cell monolayers, including Caco-2 cell monolayers. Toxicity to cultured hepatocyctes may be used to predict compound toxicity. Penetration of the blood brain barrier of a compound in humans may be predicted from the brain levels of the compound in laboratory animals given the compound intravenously. Serum protein binding may be predicted from albumin binding assays. Such assays are described in a review by Oravcov, et al. (Journal of Chromatography B (1996) volume 677, pages 1-27). Compound half-life is inversely proportional to the frequency of dosage of a compound. In vitro half-lifes of compounds may be predicted from assays of microsomal half-life as described by Kuhnz and Gieschen (Drug Metabolism and Disposition, (1998) volume 26, pages 1120-1127). The present invention also pertains to packaged pharmaceutical compositions for treating disorders responsive to C5a receptor modulation, e.g., eating disorders, depression or stress. The packaged pharmaceutical compositions include a container holding a therapeutically effective amount of at least one CRF1 receptor modulator as described supra and instructions for using the treating disorder responsive to CRF1 receptor modulation in the patient. Compounds of the invention can be prepared using the reactions depicted in Schemes I to III. In Schemes I-III, the groups G, R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 , R 7 , R 8 and Y are as defined in general Formula I. Those having skill in the art will recognize that the starting materials may be varied and additional steps employed to produce compounds encompassed by the present invention, as demonstrated by the following examples. The disclosures of all articles and references mentioned in this application, including patents, are incorporated herein by reference.

Commercial reagents were used without further purification. Room temperature refers to 20 to 25 C. TLC refers to thin layer chromatography. Mass spectral data were obtained either by ESI or APCI methods. EXAMPLE 1 General Procedure for the Preparation of Chloromethylbenzimidazoles as Outlined in Scheme I 1. Imidate hydrochloride: A solution of 150 mL (2.37 mole) of chloroacetonitrile, 139 mL (2.37 mole) of ethanol in 1,200 mL of dry benzene is cooled to 0 C. in an ice/ethanol bath. Dry HCl gas is bubbled through the vigorously stirred solution for approximately 30 minutes while the internal temperature is maintained below 10 C. The solution is allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. The resulting solid is filtered and washed with 2L of dry ether and allowed to air dry to afford 328 g (88%) of imidate hydrochloride. 2. 1-2-(chloromethyl)benzimidazolyl-4-methoxy-2-methylbenzene: Diarylamines were prepared according to literature procedure J. J. Kulagowski and C. W. Rees, Synthesis , 215 (1980). A solution of 60 g (0.26 mole) of (2-aminophenyl) (4-methoxy-2-methylphenyl) amine in 350 mL of anhydrous chloroform is treated with 59 g (0.37 mole) of imidate at room temperature. The heterogeneous reaction mixture is allowed to stir for 1 hour at room temperature at which time no starting material is detectable by TLC. 100 mL of saturated NaHCO 3 is added and extracted with 4 X 150 mL of CH 2 Cl 2 . The extracts are dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 , the solvent removed in vacuo, and the residue chromatgraphed (SiO 2 ) with 20% ethyl acetate/hexane to afford 50 g (65%) of 1-2-(chloromethyl)benzimidazolyl-4-methoxy-2-methylbenzene: Mass Spec. 287 (MH). EXAMPLE 2 General Procedure for the Preparation of Benzimidazole Carboxamides as Shown in Scheme II N-1-(4-methoxy-2-methylphenyl)benzimidazol-2-ylmethyl-N-(methylethyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)carboxamide A solution of 3 g (10.5 mmole) 1-2-(chloromethyl) benzimidazolyl-4-methoxy-2-methylbenzene in 20 mL of dry acetonitrile is treated with 5 mL of isopropylamine for 1 hour in a sealed reaction vessel at 50 C. The solvent is removed in vacuo and the residue is partitioned between 30 mL of ethyl acetate and 10 mL of 1 N NaOH. The ethyl acetate layer is dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 and solvent removed in vacuo to afford 3.1 g (98%) (1-(4-methoxy-2-methylphenyl)benzimidazol-2-ylmethyl(methylethyl) amine. The latter amine is then vigorously stirred with 2.6 mL of 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylchloride in a 1:1 mixture of dichloroethane and saturated aqueous sodium carbonate (30 mL) at room temperature for 1 hour. The mixture is partitioned, the organic layer is dried with Na 2 SO 4 and the solvent removed in vacuo. The crystallized product is triturated in ethyl ether, filtered and dried to afford 4.4 g (92%) of white solid N-1-(4-methoxy-2-methylphenyl)benzimidazol-2-ylmethyl-N-(methylethyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)carboxamide: Mass Spec. 456 (MH); (Compound 1).

EXAMPLE 4 General Procedure for the Preparation of Indole Carboxamides as Shown in Scheme III N-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)indol-2-ylmethyl-N-(methylethyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)carboxamide N-Phenyl indolecarboxylic acids are prepared according to literature procedures P.C. Unangst et al., J. Heterocyclic Chem ., 24, 811 (1987). To a solution of the N-(4-methoxy) phenylindole-2-carboxylic acid (2 g, 7.48 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (15 ml) is added triethylamine (1.25 ml, 9 mmol) followed by diethyl cyanophosphonate (DECP) (1.52 ml, 9 mmol) at 0 C. The resulting solution is stirred for 10 minutes before isopropylamine (1.92 ml, 22.5 mmol) is added. After stirring at room temperature for 1 hour, the solution is diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The extracts are combined, washed with water, washed with brine and then dried. Solvent is removed in vacuo to give the product as a light yellow solid (2.07 g, 90%). A mixture of the latter amide (840 mg, 2.72 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (THF, 4 mL) is added to a solution of lithium aluminum hydride in THF (1N, 6.8 ml). The resulting yellow solution is refluxed for 24 hours and then cooled to room temperature, diluted with Et 2 O and quenched by adding water at 0 C. until formation of a gel. The Et 2 O layer is separated and the gel is extracted with more Et 2 O. The combined Et 2 O extract is washed with water, washed with brine and dried. Solvent is removed in vacuo to give a yellow oil residue that is stirred in 1N HCl (5 ml) and Et 2 O (10 ml). The white precipitate is separated, washed with water, rinsed with Et 2 O and dried to give the product as its hydrochloride (430 mg, 48%). To the latter amine (165 mg, 0.5 mmol) in dichloroethane (2 ml) and triethylamine (0.25 ml, 1.75 mmol) is added 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl chloride (0.166 ml, 1 mmol). The resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 4 hours, diluted with CH 2 Cl 2 , washed with water, washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO 3 solution, washed with brine and dried. The solvent is removed in vacuo and the residue is purified by silica gel column (CH 2 Cl 2 elution) to give a white solid (100 mg) of N-1-(4-methoxyphenyl) indol-2-ylmethyl-N-(methylethyl)( 2,4,6 -trimethylphenyl) carboxamide: MS 441 (MH); (Compound 68). EXAMPLE 5 Assay for CRF Receptor Binding Activity The following two assays for human CRF1 receptor activity are standard assays of CRF binding that may be used to determine the affinity of CRF for the CRF receptor. Assay for Recombinant Human CRF 1 Receptor Binding Activity CRF receptor binding is performed using a modified version of the assay described by Grigoriadis and De Souza ( Methods in Neurosciences , Vol. 5, 1991). Membrane pellets containing CRF receptors are re-suspended in 50 mM Tris buffer pH 7.7 containing 10 mM MgCl 2 and 2 mM EDTA and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 48000 g. Membranes are washed again and brought to a final concentration of 1500 mg/ml in binding buffer (Tris buffer above with 0.1% BSA, 15 mM bacitracin and 0.01 mg/mL aprotinin.). For the binding assay, 100 mL of the membrane preparation is added to 96 well microtube plates containing 100 mL of 125 I-CRF (SA 2200 Ci/mmol, final concentration of 100 pM) and 50 mL of drug. Binding is carried out at room temperature for 2 hours. Plates are then harvested on a Brandel 96 well cell harvester and filters are counted for gamma emissions on a Wallac 1205 Betaplate liquid scintillation counter. Non specific binding is defined by 1 mM cold CRF. IC 50 values are calculated with the non-linear curve fitting program RS/1 (BBN Software Products Corp., Cambridge, Mass.). The binding affinity for the compounds of Formula I expressed as IC 50 value, generally ranges from about 0.5 nanomolar to about 10 micromolar. Preferred Arylpyrimidines of the invention exhibit good activity in standard in vitro receptor binding assays, specifically the assay as specified in Example 44, which follows and is defined below. Particularly preferred arylpyrimidines of the invention have an IC 50 of about 10 micromolar or less, still more preferably and IC 50 of about 100 nanomolar or less even more preferably an IC 50 of about 10 nanomolar or less or even 1 nanomolare or less in such a defined standard in vitro CRF receptor binding assay. Alternatively, the binding activity of the compounds of formula I to the human CRF 1 receptor can be measured as follows: Assay for Human CRF Receptor Binding Activity in IMR32 cells IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells are grown to 80% confluence in EMEM containing Earles Balanced Salts and 2 mM 1-glutamine with 10% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, and nonessential amino acids. At this time, flasks of cells are treated with 2.5 uM 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (Br-dU) for 10 days. Media is changed every 3-4 days across the 10-day period. Cells are harvested using No-Zyme (JRH Biosciences) and rinsed with PBS. For membrane preparation, cells are homogenized in wash buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 48,000g for 10 minutes at 4 C. Pellets are resuspended, homogenized and centrifuged two additional times. The receptor binding assay is performed using assay buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA, 0.1 mM bacitracin (22.0 mg/100 mL)), 150 ug protein/tube, and 125 I Sauvagine (NEN; 100 pM for competition analysis and 10 pM-1 nM for saturation analysis) to yield a final volume of 200 uL. Nonspecific binding is defined using 2 uM r/h CRF or 9-41 alpha-helical CRF. Cells are incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The assay is terminated by rapid vacuum filtration (Tomtec: Deepwell 3) through GFC filters presoaked in 1% PEI using ice-cold 50 mM Tris Hcl and dry thoroughly by air. Specific Binding: 70-80%; Kd (nM): 0.30 nM; Bmax (fmole/mg protein): 40-50. IC 50 values are calculated with the non-linear curve fitting program RS/1 (BBN Software Products Corp., Cambridge, Mass.). The binding affinities for the compounds of Formula I expressed as IC 50 value are less than 10 micromolar.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The prevalence of insulin resistance in glucose intolerant subjects has long been recognized. Reaven et al ( American Journal of Medicine 1976, 60, 80) used a continuous infusion of glucose and insulin (insulin/glucose clamp technique) and oral glucose tolerance tests to demonstrate that insulin resistance existed in a diverse group of nonobese, nonketotic subjects. These subjects ranged from borderline glucose tolerant to overt, fasting hyperglycemia. The diabetic groups in these studies included both insulin dependent (IDDM) and noninsulin dependent (NIDDM) subjects. Coincident with sustained insulin resistance is the more easily determined hyperinsulinemia, which can be measured by accurate determination of circulating plasma insulin concentration in the plasma of subjects. Hyperinsulinemia can be present as a result of insulin resistance, such as is in obese and/or diabetic (NIDDM) subjects and/or glucose intolerant subjects, or in IDDM subjects, as a consequence of over injection of insulin compared with normal physiological release of the hormone by the endocrine pancreas. The association of hyperinsulinemia with obesity and with ischemic diseases of the large blood vessels (e.g. atherosclerosis) has been well established by numerous experimental, clinical and epidemiological studies (summarized by Stout, Metabolism 1985, 34, 7, and in more detail by Pyorala et al, Diabetes/Metabolism Reviews 1987, 3, 463). Statistically significant plasma insulin elevations at 1 and 2 hours after oral glucose load correlates with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Since most of these studies actually excluded diabetic subjects, data relating the risk of atherosclerotic diseases to the diabetic condition are not as numerous, but point in the same direction as for nondiabetic subjects (Pyorala et al). However, the incidence of atherosclerotic diseases in morbidity and mortality statistics in the diabetic population exceeds that of the nondiabetic population (Pyorala et al; Jarrett Diabetes/Metabolism Reviews 1989, 5, 547; Harris et al, Mortality from diabetes, in Diabetes in America 1985). The independent risk factors obesity and hypertension for atherosclerotic diseases are also associated with insulin resistance. Using a combination of insulin/glucose clamps, tracer glucose infusion and indirect calorimetry, it has been demonstrated that the insulin resistance of essential hypertension is located in peripheral tissues (principally muscle) and correlates directly with the severity of hypertension (DeFronzo and Ferrannini, Diabetes Care 1991, 14, 173). In hypertension of the obese, insulin resistance generates hyperinsulinemia, which is recruited as a mechanism to limit further weight gain via thermogenesis, but insulin also increases renal sodium reabsorption and stimulates the sympathetic nervous system in kidneys, heart, and vasculature, creating hypertension. It is now appreciated that insulin resistance is usually the result of a defect in the insulin receptor signaling system, at a site post binding of insulin to the receptor. Accumulated scientific evidence demonstrating insulin resistance in the major tissues which respond to insulin (muscle, liver, adipose), strongly suggests that a defect in insulin signal transduction resides at an early step in this cascade, specifically at the insulin receptor kinase activity, which appears to be diminished (reviewed by Haring, Diabetalogia 1991, 34, 848). Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) play an important role in the regulation of phosphorylation of proteins. The interaction of insulin with its receptor leads to phosphorylation of certain tyrosine molecules within the receptor protein, thus activating the receptor kinase. PTPases dephosphorylate the activated insulin receptor, attenuating the tyrosine kinase activity. PTPases can also modulate post-receptor signaling by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of cellular substrates of the insulin receptor kinase. The enzymes that appear most likely to closely associate with the insulin receptor and therefore, most likely to regulate the insulin receptor kinase activity, include PTP1B, LAR, PTP and SH-PTP2 (B. J. Goldstein, J. Cellular Biochemistry 1992, 48, 33; B. J. Goldstein, Receptor 1993, 3, 1-15,; F. Ahmad and B. J. Goldstein Biochim. Biophys Acta 1995, 1248, 57-69). McGuire et al. ( Diabetes 1991, 40, 939), demonstrated that nondiabetic glucose intolerant subjects possessed significantly elevated levels of PTPase activity in muscle tissue vs. normal subjects, and that insulin infusion failed to suppress PTPase activity as it did in insulin sensitive subjects. Meyerovitch et al ( J. Clinical Invest . 1989, 84, 976) observed significantly increased PTPase activity in the livers of two rodent models of IDDM, the genetically diabetic BB rat, and the STZ-induced diabetic rat. Sredy et al ( Metabolism , 44, 1074, 1995) observed similar increased PTPase activity in the livers of obese, diabetic ob/ob mice, a genetic rodent model of NIDDM. The compounds of this invention have been shown to inhibit PTPases derived from rat liver microsomes and human-derived recombinant PTPase-1B (hPTP-1B) in vitro. They are useful in the treatment of insulin resistance associated with obesity, glucose intolerance, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and ischemic diseases of the large and small blood vessels. K. Shinzo, et al., Heterocylces 1982, 19, 1033-1037 disclosed a synthesis of benzobnaphtho2,3-dthiophenes of which two examples also had a 11-phenyl substituent as shown by structure A below. The compounds shown by structure A differ from that in the present invention in that the terminal furan ring of the compounds in the present invention is replaced by a benzene ring. None of these prior art compounds are for the indications of diabetes or PTPase inhibitors. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention provides compounds of Formula I having the structure wherein B and D are each, independently, hydrogen, halogen, CN, alkyl of 1-6 carbon atoms, aryl, or aralkyl of 6-12 carbon atoms; R 1 is hydrogen, alkyl of 1-6 carbon atoms, CH(R 2 )W, C(CH 3 ) 2 CO 2 R 3 , 5-thiazolidine-2,4-dione, CH(R 4 )CH 2 CO 2 R 3 , COR 3 , or PO 3 (R 3 ) 2 ; R 2 is hydrogen, alkyl of 1-6 carbon atoms, aralkyl of 6-12 carbon atoms, aryl, CH 2 (1H-imidazol-4-yl), CH 2 (3-1H-indolyl), CH 2 CH 2 (1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl), CH 2 CH 2 (1-oxo-1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl), or CH 2 (3-pyridyl); W is CO 2 R 3 , CONH 2 , CONHOH, CN, CONH(CH 2 ) 2 CN, 5-tetrazole, or PO 3 (R 3 ) 2 ; R 3 is hydrogen, alkyl of 1-6 carbon atoms, or aryl; R 4 is hydrogen or alkyl of 1-6 carbon atoms; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which are useful in treating metabolic disorders related to insulin resistance or hyperglycemia. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be formed from organic and inorganic acids, for example, acetic, propionic, lactic, citric, tartaric, succinic, fumaric, maleic, malonic, mandelic, malic, phthalic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, nitric, sulfuric, methanesulfonic, napthalenesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, camphorsulfonic, and similarly known acceptable acids when a compound of this invention contains a basic moiety, such as when R 2 is CH 2 (3-pyridyl) or contains similar basic moieties. Salts may also be formed from organic and inorganic bases, preferably alkali metal salts, for example, sodium, lithium, or potassium, when a compound of this invention contains a carboxylate or phenolic moiety. Alkyl includes both straight chain as well as branched moieties. Halogen means bromine, chlorine, fluorine, and iodine. It is preferred that the aryl portion of the aryl or aralkyl substituent is a phenyl or naphthyl; with phenyl being most preferred. The aryl moiety may be optionally mono-, di-, or tri-substituted with a substituent selected from the group consisting of alkyl of 1-6 carbon atoms, alkoxy of 1-6 carbon atoms, trifluoromethyl, halogen, alkoxycarbonyl of 2-7 carbon atoms, alkylamino of 1-6 carbon atoms, and dialkylamino in which each of the alkyl groups is of 1-6 carbon atoms, nitro, cyano, CO 2 H, alkylcarbonyloxy of 2-7 carbon atoms, and alkylcarbonyl of 2-7 carbon atoms. The compounds of this invention may contain an asymmetric carbon atom and some of the compounds of this invention may contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to optical isomers and diastereomers. While shown without respect to stereochemistry in Formula I, the present invention includes such optical isomers and diastereomers; as well as the racemic and resolved, enantiomerically pure R and S stereoisomers; as well as other mixtures of the R and S stereoisomers and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of this invention may be atropisomers by virtue of possible restricted or slow rotation about the aryl-tetracyclic single bond. This restricted rotation creates additional chirality and leads to enantiomeric forms. If there is an additional chiral center in the molecule, diasteriomers exist and can be seen in the NMR and via other analytical techniques. While shown without respect to atropisomer stereochemistry in Formula I, the present invention includes such atoropisomers (enantiomers and diastereomers; as well as the racemic, resolved, pure diastereomers and mixutures of diasteomers) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Preferred compounds are those in which B and D are halogen; those in which R 1 is hydrogen or CH(R 2 )W; and those in which R 1 is hydrogen or CH(R 2 )W, wherein R 2 is hydrogen, alkyl of 1-6 carbon atoms, aralkyl of 6-12 carbon atoms, or aryl, W is CO 2 R 3 , or CONH 2 , and R 3 is hydrogen, or alkyl of 2-6 carbon atoms. More preferred compounds of this invention are: ((R)-2-4-(2,3-dimethyl-1-oxa-9-thia-cyclopentabfluoren-4-yl)-2,6-diiodo-phenoxy-3-phenyl-propionic acid; and (R)-2-4-(2,3-dimethyl-1-oxa-9-thia-cyclopentabfluoren-4-yl)-2,6-diiodo-phenoxy-propionic acid. The compounds of this invention can be prepared according to the following schemes from commercially available starting materials or starting materials which can be prepared using to literature procedures. These schemes show the preparation of representative compounds of this invention. In Scheme 1, commercially available thianaphthene (IIa) is treated with one to 1.3 molar equivalents of an alkyl lithium reagent such as N-butyl lithium most preferably in a nonprotic solvent such as THF at temperatures ranging from 78 C. to room temperature under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon to provide the 2-lithiated-thianaphthene derivative. This lithiated analog is reacted in situ with one or more molar equivalents of 4,5-dimethyl-2-furanaldehyde (IIb) (prepared from Vilsmeir-Haack formylation of commercially available 4,5-dimethylfuraldehyde; S. F. Martin, et al. J. Org. Chem . 1984, 49, 2512-2516), generally at 78 C. to room temperature for 5 min to 3 h to provide the compound of formula (III: QOH). The hydroxy group (QOH) of (III) can be removed by a number of reduction procedures such as hydrogenation using palladium catalysts to produce the compound of formula (III: QH) but is most conveniently removed using a modification of the method of Nutaitis, et. al. ( Org. Prep. and Proceed. Int . 1991, 23, 403-411) in which (III: QOH) is stirred with one to ten molar equivalents of sodium borohydride in a suitable solvent such as ether, THF, dichloromethane or carbon disulfide at 0 C. to room temperature and one to fifty molar equivalents of trifluoroacetic acid is slowly added over a 15 min to 3 h period to produce the compound of formula (III: QH). The compounds of formula (III: QH) can be reacted with one or more molar equivalents of a commercially available benzoic acid chloride of formula (IV: B, D is H) to produce the cyclic derivative of formula (Ia: B, D is H). This reaction is accomplished most readily using a one to five molar equivalents of a Lewis acid catalyst such as tin tetrachloride or aluminum chloride in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, ether or carbon disulfide, generally at temperatures ranging from 78 C. to room temperature. In an analogous fashion to the reactions above in Scheme 1, the compounds of formula (Ia: B, D is lower alkyl) can be prepared starting from the compound of formula (III: Q is H) and the appropriate benzoic acid chloride (IV: B, D is lower alkyl). The benzoic acid chloride (IV: B, D is lower alkyl). is prepared from the corresponding benzoic acid by standard procedures using reagents such as oxalyl chloride and thionyl chloride. The starting benzoic acid of the benzoic acid chloride (IV: B, D is lower alkyl) is commercially available or can be easily prepared by known procedures. For example, the acid starting material for benzoic acid chloride (IV: B, D is isopropyl) can be prepared using a modification of the method of Schuster, et al., J. Org. Chem 1988, 53, 5819. Thus commercially available 2,6-diisopropyl phenol is brominated in the 4-position (bromine/acetic acid), methylated (iodomethane/potassium carbonate/DMF), reacted with n-butyl lithium to effect lithium halogen exchange and the resultant organolithium species is reacted with carbon dioxide to provide 3,5-diisopropyl, 4-methoxy benzoic acid. The methyl ethers of formula (Ia: B, D is H, lower alkyl) can be demethylated to the phenols of formula (Ia: B, D is H, lower alkyl) using standard demethylation procedures including one or more molar equivalents of boron tribromide or boron trichloride in dichloromethane at 78 C. to room temperature; excess neat pyridinium hydrochloride at 190 to 280 C.; hydrobromic acid in acetic acid at 0 C. to 50 C.; excess trimethylsilylbromide or trimethylsilyliodide in dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride or acetonitrile at 78 C. to 50 C.; lithium iodide in pyridine or quinoline at temperatures from 100 to 250 C. and one or more molar equivalents of ethyl, methyl or isopropyl mercaptan in the presence of one or more molar equivalents of a Lewis acid such as aluminum trichloride or boron trifluoride in a solvent such as dichoromethane at temperatures ranging from 78 C. to 50 C. The phenol of formula (Ib) (Scheme 2) can be conveniently iodinated to the diiodophenol of formula (Ic: B, D is I; R 1 is H) using at least two molar equivalents of iodine in the presence of two or more molar equivalents of an alkali metal hydroxide such as NaOH in an alcohol solvent such as methanol at 20 C. to room temperature. Similarly the monoiodophenol (Ic: B is I; R 1 , D is H) can be prepared from the phenol of formula (Ib) (Scheme 2) using one to 1.5 molar equivalents of iodine in the presence of at least one equivalent of an alkali metal hydroxide such as NaOH in an alcohol solvent such as methanol at 20 C. to room temperature. Either the monoiodophenol (Ic: B is I; R 1 , D is H) or the diiodophenol (Ic: B, D is I; R 1 is H) can be converted to the respective methyl ether derivative of formula (Ic: B is I; D is H; R 1 is Me) or (Ic: B, D is I; R 1 is Me) by reacting the phenol moiety with a suitable methylating agent such as one or more molar equivalents of methyl iodide or dimethylsulfate employing a base such an alkali methyl carbonate or hydroxide such as potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide in a suitable solvent such as THF, DMF or DMSO. The reaction is generally performed at temperatures ranging from 0 C. to 60 C. The monoiodo methylether derivative of formula (Ic: B is I; D is H; R 1 is Me) or the diiodo methylether of formula (Ic: B, D is I; R 1 is Me) can be reacted with one or more molar equivalents of copper (I) cyanide for the monoiodo analog or two or more molar equivalents of copper (I) cyanide for the diiodo derivative to produce the monocyanomethyl ether of formula (Ib: B is CN; D is H; R 1 is Me) or the dicyanomethyl ether of formula (Ib: B, D is CN; R 1 is Me). The cyanation reaction is generally performed at temperatures ranging from 100 C. to 250 C. employing polar aprotic solvents such as DMF, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone or HMPA. Quinoline or pyridine can also be used. The mono or dicyano methoxy analogs of formula (Ib: B is CN; D is H or CN; R 1 is Me) can be converted to the corresponding mono or dicyano phenol analogs of formula (Ic: B is CN; D is H or CN; R 1 is H) (Scheme 2) using standard demethylation procedures including one or more molar equivalents of boron tribromide or boron trichloride in dichloromethane at 78 C. to room temperature; excess neat pyridinium hydrochloride at 190 to 280 C.; hydrobromic acid in acetic acid at 0 C.to 50 C.; excess trimethylsilylbromide or trimethylsilyliodide in dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride or acetonitrile at 78 C. to 50 C.; lithium iodide in pyridine or quinoline at temperatures from 100 to 250 C. and one or more molar equivalents of ethyl, methyl or isopropyl mercaptan in the presence of one or more molar equivalents of a Lewis acid such as aluminum trichloride or boron trifluoride in a solvent such as dichloromethane at temperatures ranging from 78 C. to 50 C. The monoiodo methylether derivative of formula (Ic: B is I; D is H; R 1 is Me) or the diiodo methylether of formula (Ic: B, D is I; R 1 is Me) (Scheme 2) can be reacted with one or more molar equivalents of copper (I) bromide for the monoiodo analog or two or more molar equivalents of copper (I) bromide for the diiodo derivative to produce the monobromo methyl ether of formula (Ic: B is Br; D is H; R 1 is Me) or the dibromo-methyl ether of formula (Ic: B, D is Br; R 1 is Me). The bromine/idodine exchange reaction is generally performed at temperatures ranging from 100 C. to 250 C. employing polar aprotic solvents such as DMF, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone or HMPA. Quinoline or pyridine can also be used. The mono or dibromo methoxy analogs of formula (Ib: B is Br; D is H or Br; R 1 is Me) can be converted to the corresponding mono or dibromo phenol analogs of formula (Ib: B is Br; D is H or Br; R 1 is H) (Scheme 2) using standard demethylation procedures including one or more molar equivalents of boron tribromide or boron trichloride in dichloromethane at 78 C. to room temperature; excess neat pyridinium hydrochloride at 190 to 280 C.; hydrobromic acid in acetic acid at 0 C. to 50 C.; excess trimethylsilylbromide or trimethylsilyliodide in dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride or acetonitrile at 78 C. to 50 C.; lithium iodide in pyridine or quinoline at temperatures from 100 to 250 C. and one or more molar equivalents of ethyl, methyl or isopropyl mercaptan in the presence of one or more molar equivalents of a Lewis acid such as aluminum trichloride or boron trifluoride in a solvent such as dichloromethane at temperatures ranging from 78 C. to 50 C. The phenols of formula (Ib: B, D is H, Br, I, CN, lower alkyl; R 1 is H) can be acylated on the phenolic oxygen using one or more molar equivalents of suitable acylating agent to provide the compounds of formula (Ib: B, D is H, Br, I, CN, lower alkyl; R 1 is OCOR; R is lower alkyl, aryl). The acylating agent is generally a lower alkyl or aryl carboxylic acid anhydride or a lower alkyl or aryl carboxylic acid chloride.

The procedure used and results obtained are briefly outlined below. Preparation of Microsomal Fraction: Rats (Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Kingston, N.Y.) weighing 100-150 g, maintained on standard rodent chow (Purina)) are sacrificed by asphyxiation with CO2 and bilateral thoracotomy. The liver is removed and washed in cold 0.85% (w/v) saline and weighed. The tissue is homogenized on ice in 10 volumes of Buffer A and the microsomes are isolated essentially as described by Meyerovitch J, Rothenberg P, Shechter Y, Bonner-Weir S, Kahn C R. Vanadate normalizes hyperglycemia in two mouse models of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

New York: Garland Publishing, Inc., 1989 with minor modifications. The liver homogenate is filtered through silk to remove any remaining tissue debris and then is centrifuged at 10,000g for 20 minutes at 40 C. The supernatant is decanted and centrifuged at 100,000g for 60 minutes at 40 C. The pellet, microsomes and small vesicles, is resuspended and lightly homogenized in: 20 mM TRIS-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 250 mM sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM AEBSF, 0.1 mM TLCK, 0.1 mM TPCK, 0.5 mM benzamidine, 25 ug/ml leupeptin, 5 ug/ml pepstatin A, 5 ug/ml; H5B antipain, 5 ug/ml chymostatin, 10 ug/ml aprotinin (Buffer A), to a final concentration of approximately 850 ug protein/ml.

The test procedure uses, as substrate, a dodecaphosphopeptide custom synthesized by AnaSpec, Inc. (San Jose, Calif.). The peptide, TRDIYETDYYRK, corresponding to the 1142-1153 catalytic domain of the insulin receptor, is tyrosine phosphorylated on the 1146, 1150 and 1151 tyrosine residues. The microsomal fraction (83.25 ul) is preincubated for 10 min at 37 deg.C with or without test compound (6.25 ul) and 305.5 ul of the 81.83 mM HEPES reaction buffer, pH 7.4. Peptide substrate, 10.5 ul at a final concentration of 50 uM, is equilibrated to 37 deg.C in a LABLINE Multi-Blok heater equipped with a titerplate adapter. The preincubated microsomal preparation (39.5 ul) with or without drug is added to initiate the dephosphorylation reaction, which proceeds at 37 deg.C for 30 min. The reaction is terminated by the addition of 200 ul of the malachite green-ammonium molybdate-Tween 20 stopping reagent (MG/AM/Tw). The stopping reagent consists of 3 parts 0.45% malachite green hydrochloride, 1 part 4.2% ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate in 4 N HCl and 0.5% Tween 20. Sample blanks are prepared by the addition of 200 ul MG/AM/Tw to substrate and followed by 39.5 ul of the preincubated membrane with or without drug. The color is allowed to develop at room temperature for 30 min and the sample absorbances are determined at 650 nm using a platereader (Molecular Devices). Samples and blanks are prepared in quadruplicates. Screening activity of 50 uM (final) drug is accessed for inhibition of microsomal PTPases. Calculations: PTPase activities, based on a potassium phosphate standard curve, are expressed as nmoles of phosphate released/min/mg protein. Test compound PTPase inhibition is calculated as percent of control. A four parameter non-linear logistic regression of PTPase activities using SAS release 6.08, PROC NLIN, is used for determining IC50 values of test compounds. All compounds were administered at a concentration of 50 M.

The genetically obese-hyperglycemic ob/ob mouse exhibits many of these metabolic abnormalities and is thought to be a useful model to search for hypoglycemic agents to treat NIDDM Coleman, D.: Diabetologia 14: 141-148, 1978. In each test procedure, mice Male or female ob/ob (C57 Bl/6J) and their lean litermates (ob/ or /, Jackson Laboratories) ages 2 to 5 months (10 to 65 g) of a similar age were randomized according to body weight into 4 groups of 10 mice. The mice were housed 5 per cage and are maintained on normal rodent chow with water ad libitum. Mice received test compound daily by gavage (suspended in 0.5 ml of 0.5% methyl cellulose); dissolved in the drinking water; or admixed in the diet. The dose of compounds given ranges from 2.5 to 200 mg/kg body weight/day. The dose is calculated based on the fed weekly body weight and is expressed as active moiety. The positive control, ciglitazone (5-(4-(1-methylcyclohexylmethoxy)benzyl)-2,4-dione, see Chang, A., Wyse, B., Gilchrist, B., Peterson, T. and Diani, A. Diabetes 32: 830-838, 1983.) was given at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day, which produces a significant lowering in plasma glucose. Control mice received vehicle only. On the morning of Day 4, 7 or 14 two drops of blood (approximately 50 ul) were collected into sodium fluoride containing tubes either from the tail vein or after decapitation. For those studies in which the compound was administered daily by gavage the blood samples were collected two hours after compound administration. The plasma was isolated by centrifugation and the concentration of glucose is measured enzymatically on an Abbott V.P. Analyzer. For each mouse, the percentage change in plasma glucose on Day 4, 7 or 14 is calculated relative to the mean plasma glucose of the vehicle treated mice. Analysis of variance followed by Dunetts Comparison Test (one-tailed) are used to estimate the significant difference between the plasma glucose values from the control group and the individual compound treated groups (CMS SAS Release 5.18). The results shown in the table below shows that the compounds of this invention are antihyperglycemia agents as they lower blood glucose levels in diabetic mice. % Change Glucose from % Change Insulin from Example Dose (mg/Kg) Vehicle Vehicle 9 10 8.13 (a) 43.43 Ciglitazone (reference 100 43 39 standard a - no significant activity (p 0.05) at this dose. b - not measured Based on the results obtained in the standard pharmacological test procedures, representative compounds of this invention have been shown to inhibit PTPase activity and lower blood glucose levels in diabetic mice, and are therefore useful in treating metabolic disorders related to insulin resistance or hyperglycemia, typically associated with obesity or glucose intolerance.

compound having formula (I) wherein A is an optionally unsaturated 5- or 6-membered ring, which may comprise a heteroatom selected from N, O and S and which may be substituted with oxo or (1-6C)alkyl; R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are independently H, (1-6C)alkyl, (1-6C)alkoxy, (1-6C)alkoxy(1-6C)-alkyl, carbo(1-6C)alkoxy or halogen; X is O or S; and n is 1 or 2; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with the exception of 3-(naphth-1-yl-oxy)-pyrolidin and 3-(5,6,7,8-tetmhydro-naphth-1-yl-oxy)-pyrolidin. The compounds of the invention have antidepressant activity and can be used in treating or preventing serotonin-related diseases. This application is a 371 of PCT/EP98/01282 Feb. 26, 1998. The invention relates to derivatives of azetidine and pyrrolidine, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same, a process for their preparation, as well as the use of derivatives of azetidine and pyrrolidine for the preparation of a medicament which acts on the central nervous system. In recent years the contribution of serotonergic activity to the mode of action of antidepressant drugs has been well documented and compounds which enhance activity in the serotonin system have been developed and successfully introduced as antidepressants. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI) work by increasing the amount of serotonin available at the synapse. Although the SRIs have more favourable side effect profiles than previous generations, they are not devoid of side effects and still suffer from a slow onset of action Andrews and Nemeroff, Contemporary management of depressionAmerican Journal of Medicine 97(6A): 24S-32S (1994); Leonard, The comparative pharmacology of new antidepressantsJournal of Clinical Psychiatry 54(Suppl): 3-15 (1993). Moreover, the mechanism of action of the SRIs although specific for serotonin, is not selective in that they effect activity at a multitude of different serotonin receptor subtypes. This broad spectrum of activity may lead to many of the side effects associated with the SRIs e.g. nausea from activation of 5-HT3, headache due to activation of 5-HT2B. Thus, SRIs can alter the function of several 5-HT2 receptor subtypes, however, the efficacy of these drugs may correlate most strongly with their effects on the 5-HT2C system (Broekkamp and Berendsen The importance of 5-HT1C receptors for anti-depressant effectsPolish Journal of Pharmacology and Pharmacy 44(Suppl): 20 (1992); Cesana et al Mesulergine antagonism towards the fluoxetine anti-immobility effect in the forced swimming test in miceJournal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology 45: 473-475 (1993); Berendsen and Broekkamp Comparison of stimulus properties of fluoxetine and 5-HT receptor agonists in a conditioned taste aversion procedureEuropean Journal of Pharmacology 253: 83-89 (1994). These data suggest that compounds which selectively activate the 5-HT2C receptor will be effective in the treatment of affective disorders and related conditions. The invention relates to compounds according to the formula I wherein A is an optionally unsaturated 5- or 6-membered ring, which may comprise a heteroatom selected from N, O and S and which may be substituted with oxo or (1-6C)alkyl; R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are independently H, (1-6C)alkyl, (1-6C)alkoxy, (1-6C)alkoxy-(1-6C)alkyl, carbo(1-6C)alkoxy or halogen; X is O or S; and n is 1 or 2; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with the exception of 3-(naphth-1-yl-oxy)-pyrrolidir and 3-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-naphth-1-yl-oxy)-pyrrolidin. The compounds have a selective effect on 5-HT2C receptors in the central nervous sytem. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,452,809 filed Apr. 22, 1983 3-aryloxy-4-hydroxypyrrolidines were disclosed, wherein it was found that 3-naphthyl or 3-indenyloxy-4-hydroxypyrrolidines have antiarrhythmic activity, whereas 3-phenoxy-4-hydroxypyrrolidines were found to have antidepressant activity. Some years earlier, in DT 2,738,477 priority date Sep. 1, 1977 also 3-aryloxy-4-hydroxypyrrolidines were disclosed, wherein the preferred compounds with antidepressant activity were also 3-phenoxy derivatives. Other 3-aryloxypyrrolidines wherein the pyrrolidine-group of all compounds is N-substituted, having an effect on the serotonin receptor, were disclosed in EP 0,338,331 priority date Apr. 19, 1988. Surprisingly, after many years of research, it has now been found, that the compounds of formula I, (bicyclic aryl)oxy-substituted pyrrolidines and (bicyclic aryl)oxy-substituted azetidines wherein the 5- or 4-membered heterocycle is not substituted at any position in the ring, have a selective effect on 5-HT2C receptors in the central nervous sytem. Also the compounds 3-(naphth-1-yl-oxy)-pyrrolidin and 3-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-naphth-1-yl-oxy)-pyrrolidin, known as intermediates but not claimed in EP 0,338,331, were found to have this effect. Therefore, also protection is sought for the use of these compounds and for pharmaceutical compositions comprising them. Thus, the invention also pertains to the first medical use of the compounds according to formula 1, i.e. including the compounds 3-(naphth-1-yl-oxy)-pyrrolidin, 3-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-naphth-1-yl-oxy)-pyrrolidin for use as a medicament (or, in other words, for use in therapy). The use of a selective 5-HT2C agonist ensures that pharmacological activity occurs immediately and preferentially at the 5-HT2C receptors allowing a much quicker onset of selective pharmacological activation than can be observed with SRIs. Moreover the selectivity of the compound reduces the potential for adverse effects mediated by other serotonin receptors e.g. nausea, headache, effects which may hinder compliance and thus interfere with efficacy. The compounds of the present invention act on the central nervous system, in particular as antidepressants, and against obsessive compulsive disorders, anxiety disorders including generalised anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia, eating disorders such as obesity, urinary incontinence, impotence, aggression and drug abuse such as alcohol or narcotic addiction. Preferred compounds according to the invention have the formula I wherein the heteroatom in A, if present, is N or S; R 1 is H, (1-6C)alkyl, (1-6C)alkoxy, (1-6C)alkoxy-(1-6C)alkyl; R 2 is H, (1-6C)alkoxy, carbo(1-6C)alkoxy or halogen and R 3 is H, (1-6C)alkyl, (1-6C)alkoxy or halogen. More preferred are compounds of the formula (Ia) wherein A is an unsubstituted saturated 5-membered or optionally aromatic 6-membered ring, which may comprise a nitrogen atom adjacent to the position indicated with an asterisk; R 1 is H or (1-6C)alkoxy; R 2 is H, (1-6C)alkoxy or halogen; R 3 is H or halogen; and n is 1 or 2. More preferred are the compounds of formula (Ia) wherein A is an unsubstituted saturated 5-membered or optionally aromatic 6-membered ring; R 1 is (1-6C)alkoxy and R 2 and R 3 are H. Most preferrably, A in formula (Ia) is a 5-membered ring and R 1 is methoxy, in particular when n is 2. The term (1-6C)alkyl means a branched or unbranched alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, t-butyl, isopentyl, and the like. The most preferred alkyl group is methyl. The term (1-6C)alkoxy means an alkoxy group having 1-6 carbon atoms, the alkyl moiety of which having the meaning as previously defined. The most preferred alkoxy group is methoxy. The term halogen means fluorine, chlorine or bromine. The compounds according to formula I may be prepared in a manner conventional for such compounds. To that end, compounds of general formula II, wherein A, R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , X and n are as previously defined and P is any N-protecting group, stable under alkaline conditions suitable N-protecting groups can be found in T. W. Green and P. G. M. Wuts: Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Second Edition (Wiley, NY, 1991), are deprotected using the appropriate conditions such as catalytic hydrogenation or intermediate carbamate formation, followed by reaction with alcohols. Optionally at the same time, a salt may be formed. The compounds according to general formula II may be prepared by arylether formation of suitable N-protected 3-hydroxy-azetidines or -pyrrolidines, wherein the protecting group is as hereinbefore defined, with appropriately substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds bearing a suitable leaving group. Alternatively, N-protected-azetidines or -pyrrolidines bearing a suitable leaving group at the 3-position, such as halogen, triflate, tosylate or mesylate, can be reacted with appropriately substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds bearing a hydroxy, or mercapto group. The compounds of the invention, which can be in the form of a free base, may be isolated from the reaction mixture in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also be obtained by treating the free base of formula I with an organic or inorganic acid such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen iodide, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, methanesulphonic acid, fiumaric acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, ascorbic acid and the like. The compounds of this invention may possess one or more chiral carbon atoms, and may therefore be obtained as a pure enantiomer, or as a mixture of enantiomers, or as a mixture containing diastereomers. Methods for obtaining the pure enantiomers are well known in the art, e.g. crystallization of salts which are obtained from optically active acids and the racemic nixture, or chromatography using chiral columns. The compounds of the invention may be administered enterally or parenterally, and for humans preferably in a daily dosage of 0.001-100 mg per kg body weight, preferably 0.01-10 mg per kg body weight. Mixed with pharmaceutically suitable auxiliaries, e.g. as described in the standard reference, Gennaro et al., Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, (18th ed., Mack Publishing Company, 1990, see especially Part 8: Pharmaceutical Preparations and Their Manufacture) the compounds may be compressed into solid dosage units, such as pills, tablets, or be processed into capsules or suppositories. By means of pharmaceutically suitable liquids the compounds can also be applied in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion, e.g. for use as an injection preparation, or as a spray, e.g. for use as a nasal spray. For making dosage units, e.g. tablets, the use of conventional additives such as fillers, colorants, polymeric binders and the like is contemplated. In general any pharmaceutically acceptable additive which does not interfere with the function of the active compounds can be used. Suitable carriers with which the compositions can be administered include lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives and the like, or mixtures thereof, used in suitable amounts. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples. EXAMPLES Experimental General Methods A first general process step consists of the preparation of a suitable N-protected-3-hydroxy-azetidine and -pyrrolidine and subsequent arylether formation. Any protective group, stable under alkaline coupling conditions will do. This applies also for the pyrrolidines series, where a benzyl group is found to be the, best accessible and most convenient protective group. As for the azetidines a bulky group such as triphenylmethyl, 4,4-disubstituted diphenylmethyl, -methylbenzyl and, as a matter of choice, diphenylmethyl can be used for the ease of azetidine ring formation during synthesis. These compounds may be prepared by reacting the corresponding primary amnines with epichlorohydrine in a polar solvent such as methanol or dimethylformamnide at elevated temperatures ranging from room temperature to reflux, usually over a period of several days. The N-protected-3-hydroxy-azetidines and -pyrrolidines can be used as such in a condensation reaction with a wide variety of compounds bearing a suitable leaving group on an aromatic moiety to get ether formation. When the leaving group is for instance halogen the reaction can be performed in a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide and a suitable base, for example potassium carbonate in the presence of a catalyst like activated copper, at elevated temperatures ranging from room temperature up to reflux temperature. In a preferred second general process step the hydroxy group of the N-protected-3-hydroxy-azetidines and -pyrrolidines is converted, by methods well known to a skilled person, into a reactive leaving group such as for instance halogen, triflate , tosylate and, for choice, mesylate, followed by a condensation reaction with a wide variety of compounds bearing an aromatic hydroxy (or mercapto) group to get a wide variety of aryl ethers, as well as aryl thioethers. The mesylates are conveniently prepared by the addition of methanesulfonylchloride to the 3-hydroxy compounds in an apolar solvent such as toluene in the presence of an organic base like triethylamine at a temperature of 30 C. up to reflux temperature, usually at reduced temperature. Although all common aryl-alkyl ether formation reactions known from literature may be applicable, most compounds were prepared according to three main procedures. (I) A first general applicable preparation consist of a heterogeneous two phase reaction between mesylate and an appropriate nucleophile, preferably a bicyclic compound containing an aromatic hydroxy or mercapto group. The two phase system consists of an aqueous solution of an inorganic base such as sodium hydroxide and an organic layer, preferably 4-methyl-2-pentanone. The reaction is performed at a temperature of 25 C. up to reflux temperature, preferably at elevated temperature. (ii) A second preparation consists of a condensation reaction of both substrates, mesylate and nucleophile, in a polar organic solvent such as tert-butanol or dimethylsulfoxide or mixtures thereof and a suitable base like potassium tert-butoxide, generally at elevated temperatures ranging from 25 C. up to 100 C. (iii) A third preparation consists of anion formation by a base like sodium hydride and subsequent reaction with mesylate in a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide, usually at elevated temperatures ranging from 25 C. up to reflux. A third general process step concerns all types of deprotection methods resulting in (cyclic) secondary amines. All convential methods with regard to the selected protective group, well known to a skilled person, must be taken in consideration. As for the aralkyl groups commonly used in this invention two types of deprotection methods are preferred. The first method consists of the removal of the protective group by catalytic hydrogenation at a pressure varying from atmospheric to 60 psi in a polar solvent such as ethanol or methanol in the presence of a commonly used catalyst such as palladium on activated carbon or palladium hydroxide on carbon at a temperature of 25-60 C. A second method consist of the replacement of the original protective group by an intermediate carbamate function which on turn is removed afterwards. Suitable reagents are for instance 1-chloroethyl chloroformate or vinyl chloroformate in an aprotic solvent such as 1,2-dichloroethane at a temperature of 15 C. up to reflux temperature and subsequent reaction with an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol at a temperature of 15 C. up to reflux temperature. A fourth general process step concerns the preparation or separaration of stereoisomers, including diastereomers and enantiomers, as a consequence of the presence of one or more centres of chirality. Enantio selective preparations can be performed starting from enantio pure (R) and (S) substrates such as for instance (R)- or (S)-1-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinol. The individual enantiomers may also be obtained from a mixture of stereoisomers using any method well known in the art for separating such isomers into their constituent enantiomers. For example, using methods described in Stereochemistry of Organic compounds, E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen, chapter 7, 1994. In particular by methods such as salt formation with optically active acids followed by fractional crystallisation or by differential absorption using columns packed with chiral material, for example chiral liquid or gas chromatography. A fifth general process step includes the conversion of the secondary and tertiary amines prepared during synthesis into any salt or solvate form, preferably pharmaceutically accepted salts and solvates such as hydrochloride salts, namely prepared by addition of the acid of choice to the free base in a solvent like ethanol and isolation as a solid.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to salt forms of (2E)-5-amino-5-methylhex-2-enoic acid N-methyl-N-((1R)-1-(N-methyl-N-((1R)-1-(methylcarbamoyl)-2-phenylethyl)carbamoyl)-2-(2-naphthyl)ethyl)amide, preparation thereof and use as therapeutic agent. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Growth hormone is a hormone which stimulates growth of all tissues capable of growing. In addition, growth hormone is known to have a number of effects on metabolic processes, e.g., stimulation of protein synthesis and free fatty acid mobilisation and to cause a switch in energy metabolism from carbohydrate to fatty acid metabolism. Deficiency in growth hormone can result in a number of severe medical disorders, e.g., dwarfism. Growth hormone is released from the pituitary. The release is under tight control of a number of hormones and neurotransmitters either directly or indirectly. Growth hormone release can be stimulated by growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) and inhibited by somatostatin. In both cases the hormones are released from the hypothalamus but their action is mediated primarily via specific receptors located in the pituitary. Other compounds which stimulate the release of growth hormone from the pituitary have also been described. For example arginine, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-Dopa), glucagon, vasopressin, PACAP (pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide), muscarinic receptor agonists and a synthethic hexapeptide, GHRP (growth hormone releasing peptide) release endogenous growth hormone either by a direct effect on the pituitary or by affecting the release of GHRH and/or somatostatin from the hypothalamus. The compound, (2E)-5-amino-5-methylhex-2-enoic acid N-methyl-N-((1R)-1-(N-methyl-N-((1R)-1-(methylcarbamoyl)-2-phenylethyl)carbamoyl)-2-(2-naphthyl)ethyl)amide, was disclosed in WO 97/23508. Therein the hydrochloride salt was prepared. For commercial use it is important to have a physiologically acceptable salt with good stability, good solubility, non-hygroscopicity, good bioavailability, good handling properties, and a reproducible crystalline form. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a salt of (2E)-5-amino-5-methylhex-2-enoic acid N-methyl-N-((1)-1-(N-methyl-N-((1R)-1-(methylcarbamoyl)-2-phenylethyl)carbamoyl)-2-(2-naphthyl)ethyl)amide having an aqueous solubility of at least about 5 mg/ml, and a hygroscopicity of less than about 8 at 98% RH. In particular the invention relates to the anhydrous hemi fumarate salt of (2E)-5-amino-5-methylhex-2-enoic acid N-methyl-N-((1R)-1-(N-methyl-N-((1R)-1-methylcarbamoyl)-2-phenylethyl)carbamoyl)-2-(2-naphthyl)ethyl)amide. (The invention also relates to the hydrous hemi fumarate salt of (2E)-5-amino-5-methylhex-2enoic acid N-methyl-N-((1)-1-(N-methyl-N-((1R)-1-(methylcarbamoyl)-2-phenylethyl)carbamoyl)-2-(2-naphthyl)ethyl)amide and the L()-mandelate salt of (2E)-5-amino-5-methylhex-2-enoic acid N-methyl-N-((1R)-1-(N-methyl-N-((1)-1-(methylcrbamoyl)-2-phenylethyl)carbamoyl)-(naphthyl)ethyl)amide. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a salt of (2E)-5-amino-5-methylhex-2-enoic acid N-methyl-N-((1R)-1-(N-methyl-N-((1R)-1-(methylcarbamoyl)-2-phenylethyl)carbamoyl)-2-(2-naphthyl)ethyl)amide having the structural formula I as shown herein below having an aqueous solubility of at least about 5 mg/ml, and a hygroscopicity of less than about 8 at 98% relative humidity (RH). Such aqueous solubility and hygroscopicity are measured by methods well-known in the art. Hereinafter the above compound of formula I is referred to as compound I. A salt of the compound I is provided in the form of polymorph crystals, which have good stability characteristics, good solubility in e.g. water, good bioavailability, good handling properties, and a reproducible crystalline form. In one embodiment the salt of compound 1 has an aqueous solubility of at least about 7 mg/ml, preferably at least about 100 mg/ml, more preferably at least about 200 mg/ml, in particular from 5 to 400 mg/ml, such as 150 to 250 mg/ml. In a further embodiment the salt of compound I has a hygroscopicity of less than about 7 at 98% RH, preferably from 0.1 to 8 at 98% RH, in particular from 0.5 to 7 at 98% RH, such as 1 to 6.5 at 98% RH. In a further embodiment the salt of compound I is the hemi fumarate salt. In a further embodiment the salt of compound I is the hemi fumarate, monohydrate salt.

STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT This invention was made with United States Government support awarded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Grant No. P01-DK14881. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This patent invention relates to vitamin D compounds, and more particularly to vitamin D derivatives substituted at the carbon 18 position. Vitamin D is essential for life in higher animals. It is one of the important regulators of calcium and phosphorus and is required for proper development and maintenance of bone. However, during the past decade, the spectrum of activities promoted by 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 has been found to extend far beyond a role in calcium homeostasis. In addition to its action on the intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid glands to control serum calcium, this hormone has been shown to have important cell differentiating activity. Ostrem et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84, 2610 (1987). Receptors for this hormone have been identified in several different target cells that respond to 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 with a diverse range of biological action. These newly discovered activities have suggested other therapeutic applications of 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 including hyperparathyroidism, psoriasis, cancer, and immune regulation. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a universal complication in patients with chronic renal failure. Because of its ability to suppress parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 has been used with success in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism, Slatopolsky, et al, Marked Suppression of Secondary Hyperparathroidism by Intravenous Administration of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol in Uremic Patients, J. Clin. Invest. 74:2136-2143, 1984. Its use is often precluded, however, by the development of hypercalcemia resulting from its potent action on intestinal absorption and bone mineral mobilization. From the clinical point of view, one of the most difficult biochemical alterations to correct in hemodialysis patients is hyperphosphatemia. Patients on dialysis usually ingest approximately 1.0 to 1.4 grams of phosphorus per day. Since the maximum amount of phosphorus that is removed during each dialysis approximates 800 to 1,000 mg, Hou et al, Calcium and Phosphorus Fluxes During Hemodialysis with Low Calcium Dialysate, Am. J. Kidney Dis. 18:217-224, 1991, the remaining 2.5 to 3.5 grams of phosphorus ingested per week must be removed by other means. Thus, the use of phosphate binders such as calcium carbonate and calcium acetate are usually utilized to correct the hyperphosphatemia, Emmett et al, Calcium Acetate Control of Serum Phosphorus in Hemodialysis Patients, Am. J. Kidney Dis. 24:544-550, 1991; Schaefer et al, The Treatment of Uraemic Hyperphosphataemia with Calcium Acetate and Calcium Carbonate: A Comparative Study, Nephrol Dial Transplant 6:170-175, 1991; Delmez et al, Calcium Acetate as a Phosphorus Binder in Hemodialysis Patients, J. Am. Soc. Nephrol 3:96-102, 1992. Unfortunately, 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 not only increases the absorption of calcium but also of phosphorus, making hyperphosphatemia more difficult to be treated. Thus, the hyperphosphatemia induced in part by the action of 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 requires a further addition of calcium carbonate or calcium acetate, which can greatly increase the levels of serum ionized calcium. The high calcium-phosphate product that the patient may develop imposes a tremendous risk for the development of hypercalcemia and metastatic calcifications, Arora et al, Calcific Cardiomyopathy in Advanced Renal Failure, Arch. Inter. Med. 1335:603-605 1975; Rostand et al, Myocardial Calcification and Cardiac Dysfunction in Chronic Renal Failure, Am. J. ed. 85:651-657, 1988; Gipstein et al, Calcification and Cardiac Dysfunction in Chronic Renal Failure, Am. J. Med. 85:651-657, 1988: Gipstein et al, Calciphylaxis in Man A Syndrome of Tissue Necrosis and Vascular Calcifications in 11 Patients with Chronic Renal Failure, Arch. Intern. Med. 136:1273-1280, 176; Milliner et al, Soft Tissue Calcification in Pediatric Patients with End-stage Renal Disease, Kidney Int. 38:931-936, 1990. Therefore, the treatment demands a decrease in the amount of 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 administered to the patient thus decreasing the effectiveness of 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 therapy for controlling PTH secretion. Thus, an analog of 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 that can suppress PTH with minor effects on calcium and phosphate metabolism would be an ideal tool for the control of secondary hyperparathyroidism, and the treatment of renal osteodystrophy. Many structural analogs of 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 have been prepared and tested, including 1-hydroxyvitamin D 3 , 1-hydroxyvitamin D 2 , various side chain homologated D 3 and D 2 vitamins and fluorinated D 3 and D 2 analogs. Some of these compounds exhibit an interesting separation of activities in cell differentiation and calcium regulation. This difference in activity may be useful in the treatment of a variety of diseases as renal osteodystrophy, vitamin D-resistant rickets, osteoporosis, psoriasis, and certain malignancies. Several analogs of 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 modified at the carbon 18 position are described in Nilsson et al, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of 18-Substituted Analogs of 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D 3 , Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 3, No. 9, pp. 1855-1858, 1993, and their in vitro biological behavior reported. 18-hydroxylated analogs are disclosed in Valles et al, Functionalization of Vitamin D Metabolites at C-18 and Application to the Synthesis of 1,18,25-Trihydroxyvitamin D 3 and 18,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D 3 , Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 33, No. 1, pp. 1503-1506, 1992. 18-acetoxy analogs are described in Maynard et al, 18-Substituted Derivatives of Vitamin D: 18-Acetoxy-1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D 3 and Related Analogues, J. Org. Chem., Vol. 57, No. 11, pp. 3214-3217, 1992, and are reported to be nearly devoid of in vivo biological activity. Another class of vitamin D analogs, i.e. the so called 19-nor-vitamin D compounds, are characterized by the replacement of the A-ring exocyclic methylene group (carbon 19), typical of the vitamin D system, by two hydrogen atoms. Biological testing of such 19-nor-analogs (e.g., 1,25-dihydroxy-19-nor-vitamin D 3 ) revealed a selective activity profile with high potency in inducing cellular differentiation, and very low intestinal calcemic transport activity as well as very low bone calcium mobilizing activity. Thus, these 19-nor compounds are potentially useful as therapeutic agents for the treatment of malignancies, (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,497) or the treatment of various skin disorders (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,578,587) as well as for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,597,815), and hyperparathyroidism (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,246,925). Two different methods of synthesis of such 19-nor-vitamin D analogs have been described (Perlman et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 31, 1823 (1990); Perlman et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 32, 7663 (1991), and DeLuca et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,086,191). Recently, 2-substituted analogs of 1,25-dihydroxy-19-norvitamin D 3 have also been synthesized, i.e. compounds substituted at 2-position with hydroxy or alkoxy groups (DeLuca et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,536,713). These compounds exhibit interesting and selective activity profiles making them useful for the treatment of osteoporosis. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A series of 1-hydroxylated vitamin D compounds not known heretofore are the 19-nor-vitamin D analogs having a methyl or methylene group at the 18-position, i.e. 13-ethyl-18,19-dinor-vitamin D compounds and 13-vinyl-18,19-dinor-vitamin D compounds, particularly 13-ethyl-18,19-dinor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 and 13-vinyl-18,19-dinor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 . Structurally these novel analogs are characterized by the general formula I shown below: where Y 1 and Y 2 , which may be the same or different, are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and a hydroxy-protecting group, R 6 is selected from the group consisting of an ethyl or vinyl radical, and where the group R represents any of the typical side chains known for vitamin D type compounds. The above novel compounds exhibit a desired, and highly advantageous, pattern of biological activity. These compounds are characterized by little, if any, intestinal calcium transport activity and little, if any, intestinal phosphorus absorption activity, as compared to that of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 , as well as little, if any, bone calcium mobilizing activity, as compared to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 . At the same time these compounds have the ability to suppress parathyroid hormone (PTH). Hence, these compounds are highly specific in their biological activity. Their preferential activity on suppressing PTH and minimal intestinal calcium transport and bone calcium mobilization activities allows the in vivo administration of these compounds for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism and renal osteodystrophy. Because of their minimal intestinal phosphorus absorption activity, these compounds would be preferred therapeutic agents for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in kidney disorder patients. The treatment may be transdermal, oral or parenteral. The compounds may be present in a composition in an amount from about 0.1 g/gm to about 50 g/gm of the composition, and may be administered in dosages of from about 0.1 g/day to about 50 g/day. The compounds of the invention are also especially suited for treatment and prophylaxis of human disorders which are characterized by an imbalance in the immune system, e.g. in autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, host versus graft reaction, and rejection of transplants; and additionally for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma, as well as the improvement of bone fracture healing and improved bone grafts. Acne, alopecia, skin conditions such as dry skin (lack of dermal hydration), undue skin slackness (insufficient skin firmness), insufficient sebum secretion and wrinkles, and hypertension are other conditions which may be treated with the compounds of the invention. The above compounds are also characterized by having high cell differentiation activity. Thus, these compounds also provide therapeutic agents for the treatment of psoriasis, or as an anti-cancer agent, especially against leukemia, colon cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer. The compounds may be present in a composition to treat psoriasis in an amount from about 0.01 g/gm to about 100 g/gm of the composition, and may be administered topically, transdermally, orally or parenterally in dosages of from about 0.01 g/day to about 100 g/day. This invention also provides novel intermediate compounds formed during the synthesis of the end products. Structurally, these novel intermediates have the general formula II shown below: where R represents any of the typical side chains known for vitamin D type compounds, and X is an acyl group, preferably CH 3 CO. This invention also provides a novel synthesis for the production of the end products of structure I. This invention also provides a novel efficient synthesis for hydroxylated Windaus Grundmann ketone (8) through four steps from compound (1a) (see Scheme I). Hydroxylated Windaus Grundmann ketone (8) is an important fragment for the synthesis of 25-hydroxy vitamin D 3 .

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A series of 1-hydroxylated vitamin D compounds comprising 19-nor-vitamin D analogs having a methyl or methylene group at the 18-position, i.e. 13-ethyl-18,19-dinor-vitamin D compounds and 13-vinyl-18,19-dinor-vitamin D compounds, particularly 13-ethyl-18,19-dinor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 and 13-vinyl-18,19-dinor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 . Structurally these novel analogs are characterized by the general formula I shown below: where Y 1 and Y 2 , which may be the same or different, are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and a hydroxy-protecting group, R 6 is selected from the group consisting of an ethyl or vinyl radical, and where the group R represents any of the typical side chains known for vitamin D type compounds. More specifically R can represent a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon radical of 1 to 35 carbons, that may be straight-chain, branched or cyclic and that may contain one or more additional substituents, such as hydroxy- or protected-hydroxy groups, fluoro, carbonyl, ester, epoxy, amino or other heteroatomic groups. Preferred side chains of this type are represented by the structure below where the stereochemical center (corresponding to C-20 in steroid numbering) may have the R or S configuration, (i.e. either the natural configuration about carbon 20 or the 20-epi configuration), and where Z is selected from Y, OY, CH 2 OY, CCY and CHCHY, where the double bond may have the cis or trans geometry, and where Y is selected from hydrogen, methyl, COR 5 and a radical of the structure: where m and n, independently, represent the integers from 0 to 5, where R 1 is selected from hydrogen, deuterium, hydroxy, protected hydroxy, fluoro, trifluoromethyl, and C 1-5 -alkyl, which may be straight chain or branched and, optionally, bear a hydroxy or protected-hydroxy substituent, and where each of R 2 , R 3 , and R 4 , independently, is selected from deuterium, deuteroalkyl, hydrogen, fluoro, trifluoromethyl and C 1-5 alkyl, which may be straight-chain or branched, and optionally, bear a hydroxy or protected-hydroxy substituent, and where R 1 and R 2 , taken together, represent an oxo group, or an alkylidene group, CR 2 R 3 , or the group (CH 2 ) p , where p is an integer from 2 to 5, and where R 3 and R 4 , taken together, represent an oxo group, or the group (CH 2 ) q , where q is an integer from 2 to 5, and where R 5 represents hydrogen, hydroxy, protected hydroxy, or C 1-5 alkyl and wherein any of the CH-groups at positions 20, 22, or 23 in the side chain may be replaced by a nitrogen atom, or where any of the groups CH(CH 3 ), CH(R 3 ), or CH(R 2 ) at positions 20, 22, and 23, respectively, may be replaced by an oxygen or sulfur atom. The wavy line to the substituent at C-20 indicates that the carbon 20 may have either the R or S configuration. Specific important examples of side chains with natural 20R-configuration are the structures represented by formulas (a), b), (c), (d) and (e) below. i.e. the side chain as it occurs in 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 (a); vitamin D 3 (b); 25-hydroxyvitamin D 2 (c); vitamin D 2 (d); and the C-24 epimer of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 2 (e): The preferred compounds are 13-ethyl-18,19-dinor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 and 13-vinyl-18,19-dinor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 . As used in the description and in the claims, the term hydroxy-protecting group signifies any group commonly used for the temporary protection of hydroxy functions, such as for example, alkoxycarbonyl, acyl, alkylsilyl or alkylarylsilyl groups (hereinafter referred to simply as silyl groups), and alkoxyalkyl groups. Alkoxycarbonyl protecting groups are alkyl-OCO groupings such as methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, propoxycarbonyl, isopropoxycarbonyl, butoxycarbonyl, isobutoxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl or allyloxycarbonyl. The term acyl signifies a group of the type Q CO, where Q represents hydrogen or a hydrocarbon radical of from 1 to 18 carbons that may be straight chain, cyclic, branched, saturated or unsaturated. Thus, for example, the hydrocarbon radical Q may be a straight chain or branched alkyl group, or a straight chain or branched alkenyl group with one or more double bonds, or it may be an optionally substituted cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl group, or an aromatic group, such as substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, benzyl or naphthyl. Especially preferred acyl groups are alkanoyl or alkenoyl groups, of which some typical examples are formyl, acetyl, propanoyl, hexanoyl, isobutyryl, 2-butenoyl, palmitoyl or oleoyl. The word alkyl as used in the description or the claims, denotes a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical of 1 to 10 carbons, in all its isomeric forms. Alkoxyalkyl protecting groups are groupings such as methoxymethyl, ethoxymethyl, methoxyethoxymethyl, or tetrahydrofuranyl and tetrahydropyranyl. Preferred silyl-protecting groups are trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl, dibutylmethylsilyl, diphenylmethylsilyl, phenyldimethylsilyl, diphenyl-t-butylsilyl and analogous alkylated silyl radicals. The term aryl specifies a phenyl-, or an alkyl-, nitro- or halo-substituted phenyl group. A protected hydroxy group is a hydroxy group derivatized or protected by any of the above groups commonly used for the temporary or permanent protection of hydroxy functions, e.g. the silyl, alkoxyalkyl, acyl or alkoxycarbonyl groups, as previously defined. The terms hydroxyalkyl, deuteroalkyl and fluoroalkyl refer to an alkyl radical substituted by one or more hydroxy, deuterium or fluoro groups respectively. It should be noted in this description that the term 24-homo refers to the addition of one methylene group and the term 24-dihomo refers to the addition of two methylene groups at the carbon 24 position in the side chain. Likewise, the term trihomo refers to the addition of three methylene groups. Also, the term 26,27-dimethyl refers to the addition of a methyl group at the carbon 26 and 27 positions so that for example R 3 and R 4 are ethyl groups. Likewise, the term 26,27-diethyl refers to the addition of an ethyl group at the 26 and 27 positions so that R 3 and R 4 are propyl groups. In the following lists of compounds, the particular group attached at the carbon 13 position should be added to the nomenclature. For example, if a vinyl group is attached, the term 13-vinyl should precede each of the named compounds. If an ethyl group is attached, the term 13-ethyl should precede each of the named compounds. In addition, if the methyl group attached at the carbon 20 position is in its epi or unnatural configuration, the term 20(S) or 20-epi should be included in each of the following named compounds. The named compounds could also be of the vitamin D 2 or D 4 type if desired.

Specific and preferred examples of the 13-alkyl-compounds of structure I when the side chain is shortened are: 18,19-dinor-24-nor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 ; 18,19-dinor-23,24-nor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 ; 18,19-dinor-1-hydroxy-bishomopregnacholecalciferol; and 18,19-dinor-1-hydroxy-homopregnacalciferol. Examples of other side chains (e.g. hydroxyalkylated analogs) within the scope of the present invention can be found in Ostrem et al, Induction of Monocytic Differentiation of HL-60 Cells by 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D Analogs, Jour. Bio. Chem., Vol 262, No. 29, pp. 14164-14171 (1987), as well as in Calverley et al, Vitamin D, Antitumor Steroids, Academic Press: San Diego, pp. 193-270 (1992). The preparation the 13-alkyl-18,19-dinor-vitamin D compounds having the structure I can be accomplished as follows. First of all, and referring to Scheme 1, we prepared CD-ring fragments and chose diol (1a) as a starting material obtained from ozonolysis of vitamin D 2 followed by reduction with sodium borohydride and then selective tosylation of (1a) generated monotosylated (1b). Considering that the axial hydroxy group at C 8 in compound (1) is quite hindered and can withstand a variety of reaction conditions, even without protection of C 8 -OH, we directly introduced the side chain into the compound (1b) with six moles lithium salt of 3-methyl-1-butyn-3yl tetrahydropyranyl ether and catalytically hydrogenated the acetylenic bond in the side chain (2) with 10% Palladium-on-carbon to give compounds (2) and (3), respectively in high yield. Oxidation of (3) with pyridinium chlorochromate in the presence of sodium acetate gave 25-hydroxylated Windaus-Grundmann ketone derivative (8) in 56% overall yield from diol (1a) through 4 steps. With the compound (3) in hand, our attention was next turned to extend one more carbon atom onto C 13 . Taking advantage of an axil 8-hydroxy-CD-synthon (3), we irradiated a mixture of (3), lead tetracetate, iodine, calcium carbonate in cyclohexane and unexpectantly found a mixture of diostereoisomers of the hemiacetal acetate (4), which proved to be a faster entry for making 18-substuted CD-ring synthons. Thus hydrolysis of (4) with potassium carbonate in methanol yield hemiacetals (5), which were submitted in a Wittig reaction by treatment of methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide and potassium tert-butoxide affording (6). Catalytic hydrogenation of (6) formed the compound (7). As with compound (3), both (6) and (7) were oxidized to the C 13 -vinyl or C 13 -ethyl-CD-ring synthon (9) and (10), respectively. Finally, and referring now to Scheme 2, the compound 13 (a, b and c) were achieved by the sequences of the Horner-Wittig coupling of the phosphine oxide (14) with the ketone (8), (9) or (10) to give the compound 11 (a, b, and c). Thereafter, cleavage of the silyl group with tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride gave 12 (a, b, and c) and the removal of the alcohol protective group of compound 12 (a, b, and c) with p-toluensulfonic acid monhydrate gave compounds 13 (a, b, and c). Although the above synthesis is specific to the preparation of the 13-vinyl-18,19-dinor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 and the 13-ethyl-18,19-dinor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 , 13-vinyl and 13-ethyl compounds having varying side chains may also be prepared by this process. This is accomplished by the analogous coupling of phosphine oxide (14) with a ketone (9) or (10) having the appropriate side chain directly introduced into compound (1b) as described above. Experimental Spectra were obtained on the following instruments: Ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectra were taken with Perkin-Elmer Lambda 3B UV/VIS spectrophotometer.

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF 13-ETHYL AND 13-VINYL-18,19-DINOR-1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 COMPOUNDS The introduction of an ethyl or vinyl group to the 13-position of 18,19-dinor-1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 increases binding to the porcine intestinal vitamin D receptor as compared to the standard 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 (FIG. 1 ). In fact, at low concentrations the 13-ethyl and 13-vinyl 18,19-dinor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 compounds have approximately twice the binding activity of 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 . It might be expected from these results that the 13-ethyl and 13-vinyl compounds would have greater biological activity than 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 . Surprisingly, however, the 13-ethyl and 13-vinyl substitutions produced analogs with no significant change versus control in intestinal calcium transport activity or bone calcium mobilizing activity. When given for 7 days in a chronic mode, the compounds tested resulted in little if any effects on calcium metabolism (Table 1), and in fact, the activity of these two compounds on bone calcium mobilization (serum calcium) and intestinal calcium transport was minimal and about equal to that of 19-nor-1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 . These results illustrate that the 13-ethyl and 13-vinyl derivatives of 18,19-dinor-1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 have minor if any action on the mobilization of calcium from bone or on intestinal calcium absorption. The results in FIG. 2 illustrate that the 13-ethyl and 13-vinyl derivatives of 18,19-dinor-1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 are extremely potent in inducing differentiation of HL-60 cells to the monocyte. The 13-ethyl and 13-vinyl derivatives of 18,19-dinor-1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 compounds had activity similar to 1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 . These results illustrate the potential of the 13-ethyl and 13-vinyl derivatives of 18,19-dinor-1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 compounds as anti-cancer agents, especially against leukemia, colon cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer, or as agents in the treatment of psoriasis. Competitive binding of the analogs to the porcine intestinal receptor was carried out by the method described by Dame et al (Biochemistry 25, 4523-4534, 1986). The differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic into monocytes was determined as described by Ostrem et al (J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14164-14171, 1987).

(Indianapolis, Ind.) and fed a 0.47% calcium, 0.3% phosphorus vitamin D-deficient diet for 1 week and then given the same diet containing 0.02% calcium, 0.3% phosphorus for 3 weeks. During the last week they were given the indicated dose of compound by intraperitoneal injection in 0.1 ml 95% propylene glycol and 5% ethanol each day for 7 days. The control animals received only the 0.1 ml of 95% propylene glycol, 5% ethanol. Twenty-four hours after the last dose, the rats were sacrificed and intestinal calcium transport was determined by everted sac technique as previously described and serum calcium determined by atomic absorption spectrometry on a model 3110 Perkin Elmer instrument (Nonvalk, Conn.). There were 5 rats per group and the values represent mean SEM. For treatment purposes, the novel compounds of this invention defined by formula I may be formulated for pharmaceutical applications as a solution in innocuous solvents, or as an emulsion, suspension or dispersion in suitable solvents or carriers, or as pills, tablets or capsules, together with solid carriers, according to conventional methods known in the art. Any such formulations may also contain other pharmaceutically-acceptable and non-toxic excipients such as stabilizers, anti-oxidants, binders, coloring agents or emulsifying or taste-modifying agents. The compounds may be administered orally, topically, parenterally or transdermally. The compounds are advantageously administered by injection or by intravenous infusion or suitable sterile solutions, or in the form of liquid or solid doses via the alimentary canal, or in the form of creams, ointments, patches, or similar vehicles suitable for transdermal applications. Doses of from 0.1 g to 50 g per day of the compounds are appropriate for treatment purposes, such doses being adjusted according to the disease to be treated, its severity and the response of the subject as is well understood in the art. Since the new compounds exhibit specificity of action, each may be suitably administered alone, or together with graded doses of another active vitamin D compounde.g. 1-hydroxyvitamin D 2 or D 3 , or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 in situations where different degrees of bone mineral mobilization and calcium transport stimulation is found to be advantageous. Compositions for use in the above-mentioned treatment of psoriasis and other malignancies comprise an effective amount of one or more 13-substituted-18,19-dinor-vitamin D compound as defined by the above formula I as the active ingredient, and a suitable carrier. An effective amount of such compounds for use in accordance with this invention is from about 0.01 g to about 100 g per gm of composition, and may be administered topically, transdermally, orally or parenterally in dosages of from about 0.1 g/day to about 100 g/day. The compounds are advantageously administered in amounts sufficient to effect the differentiation of promyelocytes to normal macrophages. The formulations of the present invention comprise an active ingredient in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefore and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulations and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of discrete units as capsules, sachets, tablets or lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; in the form of a powder or granules; in the form of a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or non-aqueous liquid; or in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion. Formulations for rectal administration may be in the form of a suppository incorporating the active ingredient and carrier such as cocoa butter, or in the form of an enema. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile oily or aqueous preparation of the active ingredient which is preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Formulations suitable for topical administration include liquid or semi-liquid preparations such as liniments, lotions, applicants, oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions such as creams, ointments or pastes; or solutions or suspensions such as drops; or as sprays. For asthma treatment, inhalation of powder, self-propelling or spray formulations, dispensed with a spray can, a nebulizer or an atomizer can be used. The formulations, when dispensed, preferably have a particle size in the range of 10 to 100. The formulations may conveniently be presented in dosage unit form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. By the term dosage unit is meant a unitary, i.e. a single dose which is capable of being administered to a patient as a physically and chemically stable unit dose comprising either the active ingredient as such or a mixture of it with solid or liquid pharmaceutical diluents or carriers.

RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a Continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/359,226, filed Jul. 22, 1999 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,177,478 which is a Continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 08/964,956, filed Nov. 5, 1997 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,985,938, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Approximately 0.1% of adults in the USA are hospitalized each year for urinary calculi (e.g. kidney stones), of which about 80% are primarily calcium oxalate. Patients at risk for urinary calculi generally include those with calculi or who have had calculi in the past, those with renal insufficiency, those on diets containing a large amount of oxalate, those with ileal disease, ileal resection, or jejeunoileal bypass, those with chronic biliary or pancreatic disease, and those with a family history of calculi. Thus, there is a need for superior oxalate reducers. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to the discovery that a class of polymers have improved oxalate binding properties. The polymers employed in the invention comprise water-insoluble, non-absorbable, and optionally cross-linked polyamines as defined herein. The polyamines of the invention can be amine or ammonium containing aliphatic polymers. By aliphatic amine polymers, it is meant a polymer which is manufactured by polymerizing an aliphatic amine monomer. In a preferred embodiment, the polymers are characterized by one or more monomeric units of Formula I: and salts thereof, where n is a positive integer and x is 0 or an integer between 1 and about 4, preferably 1. In preferred embodiments, the polymer is crosslinked by means of a multifunctional crosslinking agent. The invention provides an effective treatment for removing oxalate from a patient (and thereby reducing the patients urinary output of oxalate and urinary calculi). The invention also provides for the use of the polymers described herein for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of urinary calculi, for oxalate binding or reduction of oxalate levels. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments thereof and from the claims. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As described above, the polymers employed in the invention comprise water-insoluble, non-absorbable, optionally cross-linked polyamines. Preferred polymers are polyallylamine, polyvinylamine and polydiallylamine polymers. The polymers can be homopolymers or copolymers, as discussed below, and can be substituted or unsubstituted. These and other polymers which can be used in the claimed invention have been reported in the patent literature in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,487,888, 5,496,545, 5,607,669, 5,618,530, 5,624,963, 5,667,775, 5,679,717, 5,703,188, 5,702,696 and 5,693,675. Copending U.S. application Ser. Nos. 08/659,264, 08/823,699, 08/835,857, 08/470,940, 08/826,197, 08/777,408, 08/927,247, 08/964,498 and 08/964,536, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The polymer can be a homopolymer or a copolymer of one or more amine-containing monomers or a copolymer of one or more amine-containing monomers in combination with one or more non-amine containing monomers. Where copolymers are manufactured with the monomer of the above Formula I, the comonomers are preferably inert, non-toxic and/or possess oxalate binding properties. Examples of suitable non-amine-containing monomers include vinylalcohol, acrylic acid, acrylamide, and vinylformamide. Examples of amine containing monomers preferably include monomers having the Formula 1 above. Preferably, the monomers are aliphatic. Most preferably, the polymer is a homopolymer, such as a homopolyallylamine, homopolyvinylamine or homopolydiallylamine. Other preferred polymers include polymers characterized by one or more repeat units set forth below or copolymers thereof, wherein n is a positive integer, y and z are both integers of one or more (e.g., between about one and about 10) and each R, R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 , independently, is H or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group (e.g., having between 1 and 25 or between 1 and 5 carbon atoms, inclusive), alkylamino (e.g., having between 1 and 5 carbons atoms, inclusive, such as ethylamino or poly(ethylamino)) or aryl (e.g., phenyl) group, and each X is an exchangeable negatively charged counterion. In one preferred polymer, at least one of R, R 1 , R 2 , R 3 or R 4 groups is a hydrogen atom. In a more preferred embodiment, each of these groups are hydrogen. In each case, the R groups can carry one or more substituents. Suitable substituents include therapeutic anionic groups, e.g., quaternary ammonium groups, or amine groups, e.g., primary, secondary or tertiary alkyl or aryl amines. Examples of other suitable substituents include hydroxy, alkoxy, carboxamide, sulfonamide, halogen, alkyl, aryl, hydrazine, guanadine, urea, poly(alkylenimine), such as (polyethylenimine) and carboxylic acid esters, for example. Preferably, the polymer is rendered water-insoluble by crosslinking. The crosslinking agent can be characterized by functional groups; which react with the amino group of the monomer. Alternatively, the crosslinking group can be characterized by two ore more vinyl groups which undergo free radical polymerization with the amine monomer. Examples of suitable crosslinking agents include diacrylates and dimethylacrylates (e.g. ethylene glycol diacrylate, propylene glycol diacrylate, butylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, propylene glycol dimethacrylate, butylene glycol dimethacrylate, polyethyleneglycol dimethacrylate and polyethyleneglycol diacrylate), methylene bisacrylamide, methylene bismethacrylamide, ethylene bisacrylamide, ethylene bismethacrylamide, ethylidene bisacrylamide, divinylbenzene, bisphenol A, dimethacrylate and bisphenol A diacrylate. The crosslinking agent can also include acryloyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, butanedioldiglycidyl ether, ethanedioldiglycidyl ether, succinyl dichloride, the diglycidal ether of bisphenol A, pyromellitic dianhydride, toluene diisocyanate, ethylene diamine and dimethyl succinate. A preferred crosslinking agent is epichlorohydrin because of its high availability and low cost. Epichlorohydrin is also advantageous because of its low molecular weight and hydrophilic nature, increasing the water-swellability and gel properties of the polyamine. The level of crosslinking makes the polymers insoluble and substantially resistant to absorption and degradation, thereby limiting the activity of the polymer to the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the compositions are non-systemic in their activity and will lead to reduced side-effects in the patient. Typically, the cross-linking agent is present in an amount from about 0.5-35% or about 0.5-25% (such as from about 2.5-20% or about 1-10%) by weight, based upon total weight of monomer plus crosslinking agent. The polymers can also be further derivatized, such as alkylated amine polymers, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,679,717, 5,607,669 and 5,618,530, which are incorporated herein by reference. Preferred alkylating agents include hydrophobic groups (such as aliphatic hydrophobic groups) and/or quaternary ammonium- or amine-substituted alkyl groups. Non-cross-linked and cross-linked polyallylamine and polyvinylamine are generally known in the art and are commercially available. Methods for the manufacture of polyallylamine and polyvinylamine, and cross-linked derivatives thereof, are described in the above US Patents, the teachings of which are incorporated entirely by reference. Harada et al. (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,605,701 and 4,528,347, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety) ilso describe methods of manufacturing polyallylamine and cross-linked polyallylamine. As described above the polymer can be administered in the form of a salt. By salt it is meant that the nitrogen group in the repeat unit is protonated to create a positively charged nitrogen atom associated with a negatively charged counterion. The cationic counterions can be selected to minimize adverse effects on the patient, as is more particularly described below. Examples of suitable counterions include organic ions, inorganic ions, or a combination thereof, such as halides (Cl and Br ) CH 3 OSO 3 , HSO 4 , SO 4 2 , HCO 3 , CO 3 , acetate, lactate, succinate, propionate, butyrate, ascorbate, citrate, dihydrogen citrate, tartrate, laurocholate, glycocholate, cholate, hydrogen citrate, maleate, benzoate, folate, an amino acid derivative, a nucleotide, a lipid, or a phospholipid. The counterions can be the same as, or different from, each other. For example, the polymer can contain two different types of counterions. The polymers according to the invention can be administered orally to a patient in a dosage of about 1 mg/kg/day to about 1 g/kg/day, preferably between about 10 mg/kg/day to about 200 mg/kg/day; the particular dosage will depend on the individual patient (e.g., the patients weight and the extent of oxalate removal required). The polymer can be administrated either in hydrated or dehydrated form, and can be flavored or added to a food or drink, if desired to enhance patient acceptability. Additional ingredients such as other oxalate reducers or binders (including calcium), ingredients for treating other related indications, or inert ingredients, such as artificial coloring agents can be added as well. For example, an enzyme which can reduce oxalate levels can be coadministered with the polymer. Suitable enzymes include oxalate decarboxylase, oxalate oxidase and additional enzymes that can function collaterally and, for example, convert products of the enzymatic reaction to harmless products. For example, peroxidase can be administered to convert hydrogen peroxide produced by oxalate oxidase. The additional active ingredients, such as enzymes, can be administered simultaneously or sequentially with the oxalate binding polymer. Where the ingredients are administered simultaneously, the enzyme can optionally be bound to the polymer, for example, by covalent bonding or physically encapsulating the enzyme, on the exterior or interior of the polymeric particle. Covalent bonding can be accomplished by reacting the polymer and enzyme(s) with a suitable crosslinking agent. For example, polyallylamine and an enzyme can be cross-linked with epichlorohydrin, polyacrylamide and an enzyme can be cross-linked with methylenebisacrylamide and poly-2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid (and its salts) and an enzyme can be cross-linked with methylenebisacrylamide. Examples of suitable forms for administration (preferably oral administration) include pills, tablets, capsules, and powders (e.g., for sprinkling on food or incorporating into a drink). The pill, tablet, capsule, or powder can be coated with a substance capable of protecting the composition from disintegration in the esophagus but will allow disintegration as the composition in the stomach and mixing with food to pass into the patients small intestine. The polymer can be administered alone or in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substance, e.g., magnesium carbonate, lactose, or a phospholipid with which the polymer can form a micelle. The polymers of the invention can be used to treat patients, preferably humans, with high urinary or serum oxalate levels or hyperoxaluria or who are at risk of high urinary or serum oxalate levels or hyperoxaluria. For example, patients who can be treated by the administration of the polymers described herein include those who have or have had urinary calculi or kidney stones, those who have renal deficiency due to elevated oxalate levels, those who are on diets containing large amounts of oxalate, those who have ileal disease, ileal resection or jejeunoileal bypass, those who have biliary or pancreatic disease and those with a family history of calculi. Additionally, patients with cardiomyopathy, cardiac conductance disorders, cystic fibrosis, Crohns disease, renal failure, vulvodynia and depleted colonies of intestinal Oxalobacter formigenes. EXAMPLES A. Polymer Preparation 1. Poly(vinylamine) The first step involved the preparation of ethylidenebisacetamide. Acetamide (118 g), acetaldehyde (44.06 g), copper acetate (0.2 g), and water (300 mL) were placed in a 1 L three neck flask fitted with condenser, thermometer, and mechanical stirred. Concentrated HCl (34 mL) was added and the mixture was heated to 45-50 C. with stirring for 24 hours. The water was then removed in vacuo to leave a thick sludge which formed crystals on cooling to 5 C. Acetone (200 mL) was added and stirred for a few minutes, after which the solid was filtered off and discarded. The acetone was cooled to 0 C. and solid was filtered off. This solid was rinsed in 500 mL acetone and air dried 18 hours to yield 31.5 g of ethylidenebis-acetamide. The next step involved the preparation of vinylacetamide from ethylidenebisacetamide. Ethylidenebisacetamide (31.05 g), calcium carbonate (2 g) and celite 541 (2 g) were placed in a 500 mL three neck flask fitted with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, and a distilling head atop a Vigroux column. The mixture was vacuum distilled at 24 mm Hg by heating the pot to 180-225 C. Only a single fraction was collected (10.8 g) which contained a large portion of acetamide in addition to the product (determined by NMR). This solid product wa dissolved in isopropanol (30 mL) to form the crude vinylacetamide solution used for polymerization. Crude vinylacetamide solution (15 mL), divinylbenzene (1 g, technical grade, 55% pure, mixed isomers), and AIBN (0.3 g) were mixed and heated to reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere for 90 minutes, forming a solid precipitate. The solution was cooled, isopropanol (50 mL) was added, and the solid was collected by centrifugation. The solid was rinsed twice in isopropanol, once in water, and dried in a vacuum oven to yield 0.8 g of poly(vinylacetamide), which was used to prepare poly(vinylamine as follows). Poly(vinylacetamide) (0.79 g) was placed in a 100 mL one neck flask containing water (25 mL) and conc. HCl (25 mL). The mixture was refluxed for 5 days, after which the solid was filtered off, rinsed once in water, twice in isopropanol, and dried in a vacuum oven to yield 0.77 g of product. Infrared spectroscopy indicated that a significant amount of the amide (1656 cm 1 ) remained and that not much amine (1606 cm 1 ) was formed. The product of this reaction (0.84 g) was suspended in NaOH (46 g) and water (46 g) and heated to boiling (140 C.). Due to foaming the temperature was reduced and maintained at 100 C. for 2 hours. Water (100 mL) was added and the solid collected by filtration. After rinsing once in water the solid was suspended in water (500 mL) and adjusted to pH 5 with acetic acid. The solid was again filtered off, rinsed with water, then isopropanol, and dried in a vacuum oven to yield 0.51 g of product. Infrared spectroscopy indicated that significant amine had been formed. 2. Poly(allylamine) hydrochloride To a 2 liter, water-jacketed reaction kettle equipped with (1) a condenser topped with a nitrogen gas inlet, 92) a thermometer, and (3) a mechanical stirrer was added concentrated hydrochloric acid (360 mL). The acid was cooled to 5 C. using circulating water in the jacket of the reaction kettle (water temperature0 C.). Allylamine (328.5 mL, 250 g) was added dropwise with stirring while maintaining the reaction temperature at 5-10 C. After addition was complete, the mixture was removed, placed in a 3 liter one-neck flask, and 206 g of liquid was removed by rotary vacuum evaporation at 60 C. Water (20 mL) was then added and the liquid was returned to the reaction kettle. Azobis(amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (0.5 g) was suspended in 11 mL of water was then added. The resulting reaction mixture was heated to 50 C. under a nitrogen atmosphere with stirring for 24 hours. Additional azobis(amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (5 mL) suspended in 11 mL of water was then added, after which heating and stirring were continued for an additional 44 hours. At the end of this period, distilled water (100 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and the liquid mixture allowed to cool with stirring. The mixture was then removed and placed in a 2 liter separatory funnel, after which it was added dropwise to a stirring solution of methanol (4 L), causing a solid to form. The solid was removed by filtration, re-suspended in methanol (4 L), stirred for 1 hour, and collected by filtration. The methanol rinse was then repeated one more time and the solid dried in a vacuum oven to afford 215.1 g of poly(allylamine) hydrochloride as a granular white solid. 3. Poly(allylamine) hydrochloride crosslinked with epichlorohydrin To a 5 gallon vessel was added poly(allylamine) hydrochloride prepared as described in Example 2 (1 kg) and water (4 L). The mixture was stirred to dissolve the hydrochloride and the pH was adjusted by adding solid NaOH (284 g). The resulting solution was cooled to room temperature, after which epichlorohydrin crosslinking agent (50 mL) was added all at once with stirring. The resulting mixture was stirred gently until it gelled (about 35 minutes). The crosslinking reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional 18 hours at room temperature, after which the polymer gel was removed and placed in portions in a blender with a total of 10 L of water. Each portion was blended gently for about 3 minutes to form coarse particles which were then stirred for 1 hour and collected by filtration. The solid was rinsed three times by suspending it in water (10 L, 15 L, 20 L), stirring each suspension for 1 hour, and collecting the solid each time by filtration. The resulting solid was then rinsed once by suspending it in isopropanol (17 L), stirring the mixture for 1 hour, and then collecting the solid by filtration, after which the solid was dried in a vacuum oven at 50 C. for 18 hours to yield about 677 g of the cross-linked polymer as a granular, brittle, white solid. 4. Poly(allylamine) hydrochloride crosslinked with butanedioldiglycidyl ether To a 5 gallon plastic bucket was added poly(allylamine) hydrochloride prepared as described in Example 2 (500 g) and water (2 L). The mixture was stirred to dissolve the hydrochloride and the pH was adjusted to 10 by adding solid NaOH (134.6 g). The resulting solution was cooled to room temperature in the bucket, after which 1,4-butanedioldiglycidyl ether crosslinking agent (65 mL) was added all at once with stirring. The resulting mixture was stirred gently until it gelled (about 6 minutes). The crosslinking reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional 18 hours at room temperature, after which the polymer gel was removed and dried in a vacuum oven at 75 C. for 24 hours. The dry solid was then ground and sieved to 30 mesh, after which it was suspended in 6 gallons of water and stirred for 1 hour. The solid was then filtered off and the rinse process repeated two more times. The resulting solid was then air dried for 48 hours, followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 50 C. for 24 hours to yield about 415 g of the crosslinked polymer as a white solid. 5.

The resulting solution was cooled to room temperature in the beaker, after which 1,2-ethanedioldiglycidyl ether crosslinking agent (2.0 mL) was added all at once with stirring. The resulting mixture was stirred gently until it gelled (about 4 minutes). The crosslinking reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional 18 hours at room temperature, after which the polymer gel was removed and blended in 500 mL of methanol. The solid was then filtered off and suspended. in water (500 mL). After stirring for 1 hour, the solid was filtered off and the rinse process repeated. The resulting solid was rinsed twice in isopropanol (400 mL) and then dried in a vacuum oven at 50 C. for 24 hours to yield 8.7 g of the crosslinked polymer as a white solid. 6.

After stirring for 1 hour, the solid was filtered off and the rinse process repeated two more times. The solid was then rinsed once in isopropanol (800 mL) and dried in a vacuum oven at 50 C. for 24 hours to yield 5.9 g of the crosslinked polymer as a white solid. 7. Poly(allyltrimethylammonium chloride) To a 500 mL three necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a thermometer, and a condenser topped with a nitrogen inlet, was added poly(allylamine) crosslinked with epichlorohydrin (5.0 g), methanol (300 mL), methyl iodide (20 mL), and sodium carbonate (50 g). The mixture was then cooled and water was added to total volume of 2 L. Concentrated hydrochloric acid was added until no further bubbling resulted and the remaining solid was filtered off. The solid was rinsed twice in 10% aqueous NaCl (1 L) by stirring for 1 hour followed by filtration to recover the solid. The solid was then rinsed three times by suspending it in water (2 L), stirring for 1 hour, and filtering to recover the solid. Finally, the solid was rinsed as above in methanol and dried in a vacuum over at 50 C. for 18 hours to yield 7.7 g of white granular solid. 8. Poly(ethyleneimine)/acryloyl chloride Into a 5 L three neck flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and an additional funnel was added polyethyleneimine (510 g of a 50% aqueous solution (equivalent to 255 g of dry polymer) and isopropanol (2.5 L). Acryloyl chloride (50 g) was added dropwise through the addition funnel over a 35 minute period, keeping the temperature below 29 C. The solution was then heated to 60 C. with stirring for 18 hours. The solution was cooled and solid immediately filtered off. The solid was rinsed three times by suspending it in water (2 gallons), stirring for 1 hour, and filtering to recover the solid. The solid was rinsed once by suspending it in methanol (2 gallons), stirring for 30 minutes, and filtering to recover the solid.

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a 2,2-bis(6-benzotriazolylphenol) compound, an ultraviolet ray absorber consisting of the compound, and a copolymer and a polymer composition containing the compound. BACKGROUND ART Among a large number of UV absorbers, a benzotriazole-type UV absorber which is transparent to visible light is used most widely in terms of amounts and applications. However, conventional UV absorbers involve various problems to be solved. For example, the conventional benzotriazole-type UV absorbers have the following drawbacks. (1) They are high in vapor pressures because of the low molecular weights. When a conventional UV absorber is blended with a resin and molded, it tends to volatilize, so that the yield is decreased or the contamination of mold or the pollution of working environment occurs. Further, the absorber bleeds out of the surface of molded article or coating film with the lapse of time to impair the appearance of the product. it is washed out by rain or water containing a detergent or the like in using environment, failing to impart UV absorption to products over a long period of time. (2) The benzotriazole-type compound has inherently a property to react with a wide variety of metal ions(metal ion reactivity). For this reason, it easily forms chelate compounds with metal ions, so that color formation occurs, impairing an inherent transparency to visible light and losing properties as UV absorber. Accordingly, in order to alleviate the defects indicated in (1) and (2) above, namely, volatility, elution, reactivity with metal ions and the like, a method has been usually employed in which a bulky substituent is introduced in the molecule of UV absorber, especially, in an adjacent carbon atom having a phenolic hydroxyl group. However, the bulky substituent to be introduced in the method is usually a tert-butyl group, a tert-octyl group or a dimethylbenzyl group. The introduction of such a substituent incapable of UV absorption lowers the molecular absorption coefficient in proportion to increased molecular weight of the UV absorber, with the result that UV absorption per molecule is reduced. Another method is known in which 2-hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole group is introduced as bulky group (Japanese Unexamined Publication No. 49-61,071, Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 55-39,180 and the like). Although the compounds disclosed in these documents exhibit improved properties concerning volatility, elution, etc., but the effects achieved are still unsatisfactory. Further, these documents does not teach the importance of metal ion resistance. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.60-38,411 discloses an approach in which polymerizable unsaturated group (CH 2 C(R a )COO(R b )) (wherein R a is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and R b is a linear or branched alkylene group having 2 to 10 carbon atoms) is introduced into the molecule of UV absorber to convert it into a copolymer and to improve the properties relating to volatility and elution. However, the polymerizable UV absorber described in the document has a defect that it does not sufficiently absorb UV and has a high volatility itself, so that it is volatilized when the graft polymerization reaction is conducted, for example, in an extruder or a kneading molding machine. Accordingly, a UV absorber has not been found yet which can eliminate the defects associated with the, conventional UV absorber, namely, which is free from volatility and elution problems during polymerization or molding, which is excellent in alkali resistance, heat resistance and metal ion resistance and which has a high absorptivity. Consequently, it is desired to provide UV absorbers having been improved in these properties. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide, by solving various problems associated with the prior art as discussed above, novel 2,2-bis(6-benzotriazolylphenol) compounds which do not volatilize during high-temperature processing nor bleed out of the surface of a molded article, which have high weatherability and high heat resistance for a long period of time, which are not colored in an atmosphere where alkalis or metal ions are present, and which have a high molecular absorption coefficient and excellent UV absorptivity. Another object of the present invention is to provide a UV absorber which eliminates the defects associated with the conventional UV absorbers, namely, which is free from volatilization and elution during polymerization or molding, which is excellent in alkali resistance, heat resistance and metal ion resistance and which has high UV absorptivity. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a copolymer comprising the above-mentioned 2,2-bis(6-benzotriazolylphenol) compound as a copolymerizable component. Another object of the present invention is to provide a polymer composition comprising the above-mentioned copolymer containing the 2,2-bis(6-benzotriazolylphenol) compound. Other features of the present invention will be apparent from the following description. The present invention provides a 2,2-bis(6-benzotriazolylphenol) compound represented by the formula wherein A represents a single bond, a methylene group, CH(CH 3 ), C(CH 3 ) 2 or C(CH 3 )(C 2 H 5 ), R 1 and R 5 are the same or different, and each represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an aryl group, an alkoxy group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a halogen atom, R 2 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, R 3 represents a single bond or a linear or branched alkylene group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and R 4 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group. The 2,2-bis(6-benzotriazolylphenol) compound of formula (1) is a novel compound which has not been disclosed in literature. The 2,2-bis(6-benzotriazolylphenol) compound of the present invention having a high molecular absorption coefficient is excellent in UV absorption markedly low in vapor pressure, high in heat stability, and excellent in alkali resistance and metal ion resistance. Accordingly, it is useful as a UV absorber. In the compound of the present invention, a molecule of ultraviolet-absorbable group is introduced into a carbon atom adjacent a carbon atom having a substituent phenolic hydroxyl group. This compound does not form chelate compound nor is colored even in environment where alkali metal ions, alkaline earth metal ions such as calcium or the like, or metal ions such as iron, copper or the like are present. Further, the substituent on the carbon atom adjacent the carbon atom having the phenolic hydroxyl substituent group in the compound of the present invention is not a mere bulky substituent such as a tert-butyl group, a tert-octyl group, a dimethylbenzyl group or the like, but an ultraviolet-absorbable group per se. Accordingly, the compound of the invention has a high molecular absorption coefficient, providing a highly excellent UV absorptivity. The present invention provides a UV absorber comprising the above-mentioned 2,2-bis(6-benzotriazolylphenol) compound of formula (1). The 2,2-bis(6-benzotriazolylphenol) compound of formula (1) of the present invention has a feature that it has a highly reactive addition-polymerizable group in the molecule. As a result, the compound of the present invention can be homopolymerized or copolymerized with an addition-polymerizable monomer to introduce the ultraviolet-absorbable groups into the side chains of the resulting polymer at a desired ratio. The present invention provides a copolymer comprising a 2,2-bis(6-benzotriazolylphenol) compound of formula (1) as a copolymerizable component in an amount of 0.01 to 70% by weight and having a weight average molecular weight of 2,000 to 1,000,000. The present invention provides a copolymer comprising a 2,2-bis(6-benzotriazolylphenol) compound of formula (1) and a vinyl monomer, the amount of 2,2-bis(6-benzotriazolylphenol) compound as the copolymerizable component being in the range of 0.01 to 70% by weight, and the copolymer having a weight average molecular weight of 2,000 to 1,000,000. The preferable copolymers of the invention include a copolymer comprising a 2,2-bis(6-benzotriazolylphenol) compound of formula (1) and a vinyl monomer, the amount of 2,2-bis(6-benzotriazolylphenol) compound as the copolymerizable component being in the range of 0.01 to 30% by weight, the copolymer having a weight average molecular weight of 2,000 to 1,000,000, and a copolymer comprising a 2,2-bis(6-benzotriazolylphenol) compound of formula (1) and a vinyl monomer, the amount of 2,2-bis(6-benzotriazolylphenol) compound as the copolymerizable component being in the range of 0.05 to 70% by weight, the copolymer having a weight average molecular weight of 2,000 to 1,000,000. The polymer capable of UV absorption of the present invention has a very low vapor pressure, is not volatilized by heating during molding, and does not lose UV absorptivity. Nor does the compound of the invention as the UV absorber bleed out of the molded article formed of the polymer. Accordingly, satisfactory weatherability can be imparted to the molded product over a long period of time, so that excellent UV absorption can be achieved for a long period of time. The compound of the invention has a very low vapor pressure and a high decomposition temperature. Consequently, even when it is polymerized at high temperatures, it is not volatilized or decomposed during the reaction, making it possible to produce a UV-absorbing polymer with a required molecular weight at a remarkably high yield.

The compound (1) of the present invention can be added to the polymer by simply dissolving the same in the polymer. It is preferable to copolymerize the compound (1) of the invention with a copolymerizable comonomer to introduce the compound into side chains of the polymer. Thus, a copolymer containing the compound (1) of the invention as a copolymer component is obtained with desired copolymerization compositions and required molecular weight.

Subsequently, irradiation was conducted in air at a line speed of 2 m/min using a high-pressure mercury lamp (80 w/cm) to form a UV cured coated film. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4 A curable paint prepared by mixing 4.0 g of Art Resin UN-3320HA (polyurethane acrylate-type oligomer, product of Negami Kogyo K.K.), 3.0 g of pentaerythritol triacrylate, 3.0 g of dipentaerythritol hexacrylate, 0.3 g of DaRocuR1173 (polymerization initiator, product of Ciba Geigy AG), 1.0 g of methyl ethyl ketone and 0.3 g of comparative UVA-2 was coated on a polycarbonate plate with a thickness of 3 mm to a film thickness of 5 m using a bar coater, and dried for 15 minutes using a circulating hot-air drier of 70 C. Subsequently, irradiation was conducted in air at a line speed of 2 m/min using a high-pressure mercury lamp (80 w/cm) to form a UV cured coated film. TEST EXAMPLE 3 The UV cured coated polycarbonate plates obtained in Example 4 and Comparative Example 4 were compared with respect to a pencil hardness, a resistance to rub damage, an adhesion and a weatherability (1) Pencil hardness: Measured according to JIS K-5400. (2) Resistance to rub damage A degree of damage was evaluated using a 0000 steel wool based on the following criteria. A: The plate is not damaged or little damaged even though strongly rubbed. B: The plate is damaged when strongly rubbed. C: The plate is damaged (3) Adhesion: One hundred crosscuts (1 mm1 mm) were applied to the coated film, and a cellophane tape was adhered thereto. Then, the tape was abruptly peeled off therefrom perpendicularly, and the adhesion of the coated film was evaluated according to the following criteria. : No peeling-off is observed : Peeling-off is partially observed. (4) Weatherability: The condition of the coated film was observed after it was subjected to an accelerated weathering test for 2,000 hours using a Dew cycle sunshine Super Long-Life Weather Meter WEL-SUN-DC (product of Test Instruments Co., Ltd., 18-minute rainfall every 120 minutes), and the yellow index (YI) was evaluated. The condition of the coated film was evaluated according to the following criteria. : The coated film is unchanged. : The coated film is cracked. : The coated film is spontaneously peeled off completely. The results are shown in Table 6.

Further, the UV cured coated polycarbonate plate containing the comparative UVA-2 distinctly and drastically yellowed with the lapse of time during the weathering test period of time owing to the decrease in the UV absorption of the coated film caused by the bleedout of comparative UVA-2 with time. On the other hand, the reactive UV absorber of the present invention was reacted with the other UV curable monomer by the UV curing reaction, and incorporated into the cured film through the covalent bond, with the result that the hardness of the coated film was high and the weatherability of the coated film itself was also high. Further, in the UV cured coated film containing the reactive UV absorber of the present invention, the UV absorber did not bleed out. Accordingly, it absorbed UV effectively over a long period of time, and the polycarbonate substrate hardly yellowed, showing a very high weatherability. EXAMPLE 5 The molar absorption coefficients in the maximum absorption wavelength of 2-(2-hydroxy-5-methacryloyloxyethylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole as a starting material of RUVA-1 formed in Synthesis Example 2, 2-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole (used in Synthesis Example 1) as a starting material of the above-mentioned compound and 2-2-hydroxy-3,5-di(dimethylbenzyl)phenylbenzotriazole (hereinafter abbreviated as comparative UVA-3) known as a general sparingly volatile benzotriazole-type UV absorber were as low as 17, 600, 16,400 and 15,400 L-mol 1 cm 1 respectively, whereas that of RUVA-1 formed in Synthesis Example 2 was 33,400 L-mol 1 cm 1 which was quite high. RUVA-1 was found to have a markedly high UV absorption compared with the other UV absorbers.

The compounds of general formula I are valuable intermediate products for the manufacture of imidazo 1,5-a1,4diazepine derivatives, like for instance 7-chloro-3-(5-dimethylaminomethyl-1,2,4oxadiazol-3-yl)-5-methyl-4,5-dihydro-imidazo1,5-a1,4benzodiazepin-6-one, which diazepine derivatives show excellent psychopharmacological properties as agonists of the central benzodiazepine receptors. CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The present application is related to copending application Ser. No. 09/566,832 filed on even date herewith, entitled Imidazodiazepine Derivative, by inventors F. Emery, W. J. Hunkeler, F. Jenck, J. R. Martin and A. Sleight. BACKGROUND Conventional means for making intermediate products used in the maufacture of imidazo1,5-a1,4diazepine derivatives have been chracterised by low yields resulting in higher production costs for the final products. The low yields of the conventional production methods have also lead to problems regarding the disposal of unwanted byproducts which are concomitantly produced with the production of the desired intermediates. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing diazepine derivatives of the general formula wherein R 1 is lower alkyl; R 2 is hydrogen; or R 1 and R 2 are together (CH 2 ) n and n is 2 or 3; R 3 is halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy and m is 0, 1 or 2; and R 4 is hydrogen or lower alkyl. The compounds of general formula I are valuable intermediate products for the manufacture of imidazo1,5-a1,4diazepine derivatives, like for instance 7-chloro-3-(5-dimethylaminomethyl-1,2,4oxadiazol-3-yl)-5-methyl-4,5-dihydro-imidazo1,5-a1,4benzodiazepin-6-one, which diazepine derivatives show excellent psychopharmacological properties as agonists of the central benzodiazepine receptors. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The compounds of general formula I are obtained by the known process consisting of reacting a compound of general formula wherein R 3 is halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy and m is 0, 1 or 2; and R 4 is hydrogen or lower alkyl. , with a compound of general formula wherein R 1 is lower alkyl; R 2 is hydrogen; or R 1 and R 2 are together (CH 2 ) n and n is 2 or 3. This reaction step takes place in a polar solvent such as for instance DMF, under atmospheric pressure and at a temperature between 110 C. and the boiling point of the reaction mixture. The compounds of formula II can be obtained, on their turn, by reacting a compound of formula wherein R 3 is halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy and m is 0, 1 or 2. , with: a) phosgene and hydrochloric acid in THF; or b) ethyl haloformiate, e.g. ethyl chloroformiate, in dioxane and subsequent treatment with acetylchloride. Both steps take place in a batch system, under atmospheric pressure and at the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture (see e.g. G. M. Coppola, The Chemistry of Isatoic Anhydride, Synthesis , Georg Thieme Verlag, (1980), pp 505-535). The last step of the mentioned production pathway is characterised by low yields. This is mainly due to a low conversion of the reactants and, in certain cases, also to a low selectivity towards the desired product because of the formation of a side product of general formula These low yield and selectivity imply higher costs for the production of the compounds of formula I and lead to important disposal problems since the compounds of formula V cannot be used for other purposes and must be therefore destroyed or recycled. The above elucidated problems are addressed by the present invention by providing a process for manufacturing the compounds of general formula I which can overcome the disadvantages mentioned above. The problem is solved, according to the present invention, by a process for manufacturing diazepine derivatives of the general formula I, comprising the step of reacting a compound of general formula II with a compound of general formula III, characterised in that said compound of general formula II and said compound of general formula III undergo chemical reaction in the absence of a solvent or in the presence of an apolar solvent. It has been surprisingly found that the conversion, and in certain cases also the selectivity, towards the compound of formula I strongly increases if the reaction components (i.e. compounds of formula II and III) are not solvated in the reaction mixture. This situation can take place only if no solvent at all is added to the reaction mixture or if the reactants and/or products are not soluble in a given solvent. Being the present compounds of polar nature, apolar solvents can be used in the process of the invention for achieving the wished results. Particularly preferred solvents are substituted benzene rings, such as xylenes, mesitylene, ethylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, etc. Most preferably, p-xylene or a mixture of xylenes are used as solvent for carrying out the process according to the present invention. The reaction temperature is preferably set from 0 to 30 C. under the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture. The process of the present invention is particularly suitable for the manufacture of 6-Chloro-3,4-dihydro-4-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5(1H)-dione. By way of examples, preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described. Comparative tests were made in which the compounds of formulae II and III underwent reaction in the conventional manner, i.e. using DMF as (polar) solvent. The yields of compound I (Y(CI)) depicted in Table 1 were measured on the purified product. The ratios of compounds I and V depicted in Table 2 (R(CI) and R(CV)) were directly obtained from the HPLC measurements (HP1050, column CC70/4 nucleosil 100-5Cl8HD), and refer to the molar percentage of CI and CV in the crude product of the reaction.

TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to compounds having a high affinity for mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor receptor (MDR). BACKGROUND ART Benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors which are an acting site of anti-anxiety drugs are classified into 2 subtypes of central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) located on GABA A receptor/chloride channel complex and MDR located on the central nervous system (glial cells) or adrenal glands (Clin. Neuropharmacol., 16, 401-417 (1993)). Recently, CBR agonists of which representative is diazepam are widely used as anti-anxiety drugs. However, since CBR agonists act directly on GABA A receptor/chloride channel complex, they cause an anti-anxiety action together with side-effects such as excessive sedation or psychic dependence. On the other hand, since MDR agonists act indirectly on GABA A receptor/chloride channel complex via synthesis of neurosteroids such as endogenous neuroactive steroids (endogenous anti-anxiety substances), they cause an anti-anxiety action, but do not cause side-effects such as psychic dependency or excessive sedation (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 267, 462-471, 1993; ibid., 265, 649-656, 1993). Accordingly, there is a need of the development of therapeutic agents for diseases (obsessive disorders, panic disorders) on which the previous BZs do not have a satisfactorily therapeutic effect, and development of MDR agonists as anti-anxiety drugs which alleviate the side-effects as recognized in the previous BZs. Furthermore, the compounds which act on MDR, in view of acting on GABA A receptors, have a possibility of use as therapeutical agents of sleeping disorders, epilepsy, dyskinesia accompanied by muscle rigidity, feeding disorders, circulation disorders, recognition and learning disability or drug dependence (Progress in Neurobiology, 38, 379-395, 1992, ibid., 49, 73-97, 1996; J. Neurochem., 58, 1589-1601; Neuropharmacol., 30, 1435-1440, 1991). In addition, these compounds, in view of the physiological functions of MDR, have a possibility of use as therapeutic agents of cancer (Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1241, 453-470, 1995), lipid metabolism abnormality (Eur. J. Pharmacol., 294, 601-607, 1995), schizophrenia (Neuropharmacology, 35, 1075-1079, 1996), cerebral infarction (J. Neurosci., 15, 5263-5274, 1995), AIDS (Abstracts of the fifth international conference on AIDS, p. 458, 1989), Alzheimers disease (Alzheimer Dis. Assoc. Disotd., 2, 331-336, 1988) or Huntington chorea (Brain Res., 248, 396-401, 1982). Among the compounds having affinity for MDR, there are indole compounds disclosed in Japanese Translation of PCT publication (Kohyo) No.6-501030.

Experiment MDR Receptor Binding Assay Crude mitochondria fractions prepared from rat cerebral cortex were used as a receptor sample, and 3 HPK11195 was used as a 3 H-labeled ligand. A binding assay using the 3 H-labeled ligand was carried out according to the following method as described in Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 262, 971(1992). Preparation of Receptor Sample: Rat cerebral cortex was homogenized using a Teflon-coated homogenizer in a 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.32 M sucrose in ten volumes of the wet weight. The homogenate was centrifuged at 900 g for 10 minutes, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 10 minutes. The precipitate was suspended in a HEPES buffer to give a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml, and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 minutes. The resulting precipitate was suspended in a 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) to give a crude mitochondria fraction. MDR Binding Assay: Mitochondria sample (1.0 mg protein/ml), 3 HPK11195 (2 nM) and the test drug were reacted at 4 C. for 90 minutes. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered with suction through a glass filter (GF/B) treated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine, and the radioactivity on the filter was measured by a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The binding at the reaction in the presence of 10 M PK11195 was defined as non-specific binding of 3 HPK11195, and the difference between total binding and non-specific binding was defined as specific binding.

A compound of formula 2, wherein X represents Br or I, is prepared by known methods (Moyer, M. P.; Shiurba, J. F.; Rapoport, H. J. Org. Chem. 1986, 51, 5106.), and is alkylated by known methods (NaH and alkyl iodide in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or tetrahydrofuran at 0 C. to about 25 C.) to give a corresponding compound of formula 3. Alternatively, alkylation can be carried out using dimethyl carbonate and a base (such as K 2 CO 3 ) or a catalyst (such as TBAB) in DMF, by heating the reaction mixture to reflux (greater than 90 C.). A compound of formula 3 is reacted with a heteroaryl substituted trialkylstnnane, in a solvent such as toluene or THF in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine, catalyzed by a palladium catalyst, such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (0) at a temperature of 50 C. to reflux to afford a corresponding compound of formula 4 with R 2 being heteroaryl.

No. 5,057,614) or a compound prepared by known methods, in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine in dichloromethane at a temperature between 0 C. to 25 C. The resultant product is then treated with an acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or hydrochloric acid in a solvent such as methylene chloride, methanol or THF at a temperature of 25 C. to 65 C. to form a corresponding compound of formula 1. If a protecting group was utilized during the reaction of 7 and 8, it is removed at this point using methods known in the art.

The conversion of an acidic compound of formula I into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can be carried out by treatment with a suitable base in a known manner. Suitable salts are those derived not only from inorganic bases, for example, sodium, potassium or calcium salts, but also from organic bases such as ethylenediamine, monoethanolamine or diethanolamine. The conversion of a basic compound of formula I into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can be carried out by treatment with a suitable acid in a known manner. Suitable salts arc those derived not only from inorganic acids, for example, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, phosphates or sulphates, but also from organic acids, for example, acetates, citrates, fumarates, tartrates, maleates, methansulphonates or p-toluenesulphonates. The antiproliferatiave activity of the compounds of the invention is demonstrated below. These effects indicate that the compounds of the present invention are useful in treating cancer, in particular solid tumors such as breast and colon tumors. The epithelial breast carcinoma cell line (MDAMB-435) was purchased from ATCC (American Type Cell Culture Collection) and was grown in culture medium as recommended by ATCC. For analysis of the effect of various compounds of formula I on the growth of these cells, the cells were plated at a concentration of 1500 cells/well in a 96 well tissue culture plate (test plate). The day after the cells were plated, the compounds to be analyzed were dissolved in 100% DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) to yield at 10 mM stock solution. Each compound was diluted in H 2 O to 1 mM and was added to triplicate wells in the first row of a 96 well master plate containing medium to yield a final concentration of 40 M. The compounds were then serially diluted in medium in the master plate. The diluted compound(s) were then transferred to test plates containing cells. A row of vehicle control cells received DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO in each well was 0.1%. 5 days post drug addition, the plate was analyzed as described below. MTT (3-(4-5 methyl thiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; thiazolyl blue) was added to each well to yield a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The plate was then incubated at 37 C. for 2-3 hours. The MTT-containing medium was then removed and 50 l of 100% ethanol was added to each well to dissolve the formazan. The absorbences were then read using an automated plate reader (Bio-tek microplate reader). IC 50 s were calculated using the Reed and Munsch equation, see Am. J. Hygiene Vol. 27 pgs. 493-497,1938.

that L represents a group of formula XR 2 . This application claims priority from copending provisional application(s) Ser. No. 60/129,462 filed on Apr. 15, 1999 and Ser. No. 60/139,356 filed on Jun. 15, 1999. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of substituted pyrimidines. Pyrimidines, which are substituted in the 4-position by a hydrocarbyloxy or hydrocarbylthio group are of great commercial interest as highly effective pesticides or pharmaceuticals. U.S. Pat. No. 3,498,984 discloses 2-phenyl4-thiopyrimidines with interesting pharmaceutical properties. U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,624 describes herbicidal compositions comprising 2-phenyl-4-oxypyrimidines. The International Patent Applications WO 98/40379 and WO 98/56789 disclose herbicidal 4-oxypyrimidines, in which a 5-membered heteroaromatic group is attached to the 2-position of the pyrimidine moiety. These compounds can be prepared for example in a multi-step process including the steps of treating a benzamidine hydrochloride with a substituted acetylacetate in the presence of a strong base to form a 2-phenylpyrimid-4-one, which is subsequently treated with a halogenating agent, in particular a phosphoryl halide to yield a 4-halo-2-phenylpyrimidine, which is reacted with an alcohol or a thioalcohol. However, this process cannot be used for manufacture of relatively large quantities on an industrial scale due to the high risk of uncontrollable heat generation during the aqueous work up of the halogenation step. W. Schroth et al., disclose the preparation of 1,3-thiazin-6-thiones by condensation of 3,3-dichloroacrolein and thioamides in the presence of trifluoroborane. However, there is no motivation to apply this reaction on the manufacture of substituted pyrimidines, especially, since trifluoroborane is not applicable in large scale productions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides an effective and efficient process for the preparation of substituted pyrimidines of formula I, wherein R 1 and R 2 each independently represent an optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, phenyl or heteroaryl group, R 3 and R 4 each independently represent a hydrogen atom or an optionally substituted alkyl or phenyl group, and X represents O or S, which comprises reacting an amidine of formula II, or a salt thereof, wherein R 1 has the meaning given for formula I, with a 3,3-disubstituted vinylcarbonyl compound of formula III wherein R 3 and R 4 have the meaning given, and L represent a halogen atom or a group of formula XR 2 , (a) in an inert solvent, in the presence of a base and a compound of formula IV HXR 2 (IV) wherein X and R 2 have the meaning given, in the event that L represent a halogen atom, or (b) in an inert solvent and in the presence of a base, in the event that L represents a group of formula XR 2 . It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an efficient new process for the preparation of substituted pyrimidines. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description and the appended claims.

Field of the Invention This invention relates to certain aminomethyl biphenyl, phenylpyridines and phenylpyrimidine derivatives which selectively bind to brain dopamine receptor subtypes. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds. It further relates to the use of such compounds in treating affective disorders such as schizophrenia and depression as well as certain movement disorders such as Parkinsonism. 2. Description of the Related Art Schizophrenia or psychosis is a term used to describe a group of illnesses of unknown origin which affect approximately 2.5 million people in the United States. These disorders of the brain are characterized by a variety of symptoms which are classified as positive symptoms (disordered thought, hallucinations and delusions) and negative symptoms (social withdrawal and unresponsiveness). These disorders have an age of onset in adolescence or early adulthood and persist for many years. The disorders tend to become more severe during the patients lifetime and can result in prolonged institutionalization. In the United States today, approximately 40% of all hospitalized psychiatric patients suffer from schizophrenia. During the 1950s physicians demonstrated that they could successfully treat psychotic patients with medications called neuroleptics; this classification of antipsychotic medication was based largely on the activating (neuroleptic) properties of the nervous system by these drugs. Subsequently, neuroleptic agents were shown to increase the concentrations of dopamine metabolites in the brain suggesting altered neuronal firing of the dopamine system. Additional evidence indicated that dopamine could increase the activity of adenylate cyclase in the corpus striatum, an effect reversed by neuroleptic agents. Thus, cumulative evidence from these and later experiments strongly suggested that the neurotransmitter dopamine was involved in schizophrenia. One of the major actions of antipsychotic medication is the blockade of dopamine receptors in brain. Several dopamine systems appear to exist in the brain and at least five classes of dopamine receptors appear to mediate the actions of this transmitter. These dopamine receptors differ in their pharmacological specificity and were originally classified upon these differences in the pharmacology of different chemical series. The butyrophenones, a class of compounds containing many potent antipsychotic drugs, were quite weak at the dopamine receptor that activated adenylate cyclase (now known as a D1 dopamine receptor). In contrast, they labelled other dopamine receptors (called D2 receptors) in the subnanomolar range and a third type, D3, in the nanomolar range. Two additional receptor subtypes have also been identified. D5, which is somewhat similar to the D1 receptor subtype, and D4 which is closely related to D3 and D2 receptor types. The phenothiazines, which include chlorpromazine, possess nanomolar affinity for all three types of dopamine receptors. Other drugs have been developed with great specificity for the D1 receptor subtype and for the D2 receptor subtype. A group of drugs (such as sulpiride and clozapine) have been developed which display a lesser incidence of extrapyramidal side effects than classical neuroleptics. In addition, there is some indication that these drugs may be more beneficial in treating negative symptoms in some patients. Since all D2 blockers do not possess a similar profile, certain hypotheses underlying the differences have been investigated. One of the major differences among these various classes of antipsychotics has been in the anticholinergic actions of these drugs. The possibility also exists that the various doparmine receptor subtypes may be differentially distributed between the limbic areas, thought to mediate antipsychotic responses, and the motor areas of the brain. The existence of the D3, D4 and D5 and other as yet undiscovered dopamine receptors may contribute to this profile. Atypical antipsychotics have loosely been defined as those compounds which impart antipsychotic action without the concurrent motor impairment. Some of the atypical compounds possess similar activity at both D2, D3 and D4 receptors. The examples of this patent fall into this general class of molecules. Using molecular biological techniques it has been possible to clone cDNAs coding for each of the pharmacologically defined dopamine receptors. There are at least two forms of D1-type receptors, which have been referred to as D1 and D5, and two forms of D2-type receptors, referred to now as D2 and D4 dopamine receptors. In addition, there is at least one form of D3 dopamine receptor. Examples from the aminomethyl biphenyl, aminomethyl phenylpyridines and aminomethyl phenylpyrimidines series of this patent possess differential affinities for each receptor subtype. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention provides novel compounds of Formula I which interact with dopamine receptor subtypes. The invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds of Formula I. The invention also provides compounds useful in treating affective disorders such as schizophrenia and depression as well as certain movement disorders such as Parkinsonism. Furthermore compounds of this invention may be useful in treating the extrapyramidyl side effects associated with the use of conventional neuroleptic agents. Since dopamine D3 and D4 receptor subtypes are concentrated in the limbic system (Taubes, Science (1994) 265, 1034) which controls cognition and emotion, compounds which interact with these receptors may have utility in the treatment of cognitive disorders. Such disorders may be the cognitive deficits which are a significant component of the negative symptoms (social withdrawal, and unresponsiveness) of schizophrenia. Other disorders involving memory impairment or attention deficit disorders may also be treated with the compounds of this invention that interact specifically with dopamine D3 and/or D4 receptor subtypes. Accordingly, a broad embodiment of the invention is directed to a compound of Formula I: where S and V are the same or different and represent hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, phenyl, straight or branched chain lower alkyl having 1-6 carbon atoms, or straight or branched chain lower alkoxy having 1-6 carbon atoms; G and K are the same or different and represent N or CR where R is hydrogen, halogen, straight or branched chain lower alkyl having 1-6 carbon atoms or straight or branched lower alkoxy having 1-6 carbon atoms; R is hydrogen or straight or branched chain lower alkyl having 1-6 carbon atoms; R 1 , X, Y, Z and T are the same or different and represent hydrogen, halogen, cyano, hydroxy, straight or branched chain lower alkyl having 1-6 carbon atoms, straight or branched chain lower alkoxy having 1-6 carbon atoms or SO 2 R 4 where R 4 is straight or branched chain lower alkyl having 1-6 carbon atoms or where R 4 is NH 2 or NHCH 3 ; R 2 and R 3 are the same or different and represent hydrogen, straight or branched chain lower alkyl having 1-6 carbon atoms, aryl arylalkyl; or NR 2 R 3 together represent 2-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolinyl), either unsubstituted or mono or disubstituted with halogen, hydroxy, straight or branched chain lower alkyl having 1-6 carbon atoms, or straight or branched chain lower alkoxy having 1-6 carbon atoms; or NR 2 R 3 represents: where R 5 is phenyl, either unsubstituted or mono or disubstituted by either halogen, hydroxy, straight or branched chain lower alkyl having 1-6 carbon atoms, or straight or branched chain lower alkoxy having 1-6 carbon atoms; or NR 2 R 3 represents where W is N or CH; and R 6 is phenyl, benzyl, pyridyl or pyrimidinyl, unsubstituted or mono or disubstituted with halogen, hydroxy, straight or branched chain lower alkyl having 1-6 carbon atoms, or straight or branched chain lower alkoxy having 1-6 carbon atoms; and n is 1, 2 or 3. The interaction of the aminomethyl biphenyl, aminomethyl phenylpyridines and aminomethyl phenylpyrimidine derivatives of the invention with dopamine receptor subtypes results in the pharmacological activities of these compounds. These compounds are highly selective partial agonists or antagonists at brain dopamine receptor subtypes or prodrugs thereof and are useful in the diagnosis and treatment of affective disorders such as schizophrenia and depression as well as certain movement disorders such as Parkinsonism. Furthermore, compounds of this invention are useful in treating the extrapyramidyl side effects associated with the use of conventional neuroleptic agents. Thus, the invention encompasses methods for the treatment of neuropsychological disorders comprising administering to a patient having a neuropsychological disorder an amount of a compound according to Formula I effective to treat the neuropsychological disorder.

ND Not Done Assay for D4 Receptor Binding Activity Clonal cell lines expressing the human dopamine D4 receptor subtype were harvested in PBS and the cells centrifuged and the pellets stored at 80 C. until used in the binding assay. The pellets were resuspended and the cells lysed at 4 C. in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 buffer containing 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 5 mM MgCl 2 . The homogenate is centrifuged at 48000g for 10 minutes at 4 C. The resulting pellet is resuspended in fresh buffer and centrifuged again. After resuspension of the pellet in fresh buffer a 100 ml aliquot is removed for protein determination. The remaining homogenate is centrifuged as above, the supernatant removed and the pellet stored at 4 C. until needed; at which time it is resuspended to a final concentration of 625 mg/ml (250 mg per sample) with 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) and 120 mM NaCl just prior to use. Incubations were carried out for 60 minutes at 25 C. in the presence of 0.1 nM 3 H YM-09151-2. The incubation was terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/C filters and rinsed with 24 ml washes of chilled 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 120 mM NaCl. Non-specific binding was determined with 1 mM spiperone and radioactivity determined by counting in an LKB beta counter. Binding parameter were determined by non-linear least squares regression analysis, from which the inhibition constant Ki could be calculated for each test compound. The binding characteristics of some examples of this patent are shown in Table 2 for the dopamine D4 binding assay. In general, compounds of the accompanying examples were tested in the above assay, and all were found to possess a Ki value for the displacement of 3 HYM-09151-2 from the human dopamine D4 receptor subtype of below 500 nM.

"Imidazopyridine derivatives and process for making them", "abstract": "Imidazopyridine compounds of the formula 1 are can be made in high purity, e.g. greater than 95% pure, by a process that use a novel intermediate of formula 5: wherein R 1 and R 2 each independently represent hydrogen or a lower alkyl group and Y and Z each independently represent a lower alkyl group. By this process, zolpidem, a commercial pharmaceutical of the formula 1 can be effectively made. This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) from prior provisional patent application serial number 60/126,494, filed Mar. 25, 1999, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a synthetic route for producing various imidazopyridine derivatives, to certain intermediates useful therein, and to highly pure compounds produced thereby. Imidazopyridines of the formula (1) are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,382,938 as useful pharmaceutical agents. Y is hydrogen, halogen, or C 1 -C 4 alkyl and X 1 and X 2 are independently a hydrogen, halogen, C 1 -C 4 alkoxy, C 1 -C 6 alkyl, CF 3 , CH 2 S, CH 3 SO 2 or NO 2 . R 1 and R 2 are independently hydrogen, C 1 -C 5 alkyl, which may be substituted with, inter alia, halogen, hydroxy, etc., or together they form a heterocyclic ring. The compounds of formula (I) include the commercial product zolpidem which is sold in the hemitartrate form under the brand names Stilnox, Stilnoct, and Ambien. Zolpidem has the following formula. The method disclosed in the above-cited patent for making the compounds of formula (I) can be outlined as follows: The nitrile compound is converted to the primary amide compound by conventional methods and then the amide is saponified to form the acid compound. The acid compound can be converted to the final tertiary amide by known techniques including a reaction with an amine of the formula HNR 1 R 2 in the presence of carbonyldiimidazole or by forming the chloride of the acid and then reacting with amine of the formula HNR 1 R 2 . This process suffers from several drawbacks, especially from the commercial point of view. For example, the starting nitrile must be formed from the corresponding imidazopyridine compound (unsubstituted in the 3 position) which adds additional synthetic steps. Moreover, the use of toxic reactants such as potassium cyanide are required. A shorter reaction scheme that avoids the use of highly toxic reagents would be advantageous. An improved synthesis scheme, as shown below, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,794,185. The above process is believed to correspond to the commercial process presently used for the production of zolpidem. The process is described in the patent as providing high yield with excellent purity, after work up. While the number of steps has been reduced over the earlier process and the use of potassium cyanide can be avoided, the process uses special reactants, specifically the compounds of formula (III). Moreover, the replacement of the hydroxyl group with a chloride to form the compound of formula (V) and its subsequent removal means that chloride is a potentially troubling impurity in the final product. In addition, chlorination agents such as thionylchloride are highly hazardous compounds; making this synthetic scheme potentially dangerous to the operators and the environment. It would be desirable to have a process that could use inexpensive and safe reactants and that could form the free base of the final compound with very high purity. Additional methods for making various imidazopyridines are disclosed by Schmitt et al., Aust. J. Chem., 1997, 50, 719-725. Among them is the reaction of certain 2-phenylimidazo1,2-apyridines with freshly distilled ethyl glyoxylate to form ethyl 2-hydroxy-2-(2-phenylimidazo1,2-apyridin-3-yl) acetate. This compound is reduced by adding phosphorous tetraiodide in dichloromethane to form ethyl 2-(2-phenylimidazo1,2-apyridin-3-yl) acetate. Regarding such a procedure, Schmitt et al. states The foregoing method of preparing the 2-hydroxyacetate and its conversion into the acetate may provide a convenient synthesis of the relevant intermediates for the preparation of alpidem and zolpidem. Exactly what the alpidem or zolpidem intermediates would be and how they would be used (the intended synthesis scheme) is not explained. Indeed, it is not possible to directly convert the ester compounds of Schmitt et al. to the desired amide using conventional amidation techniques. Moreover, the use of ethyl glyoxylate is not convenient for a commercial scale production. Such a product is commercially sold, apparently exclusively, as a 50% toluene solution. In such a solution, a portion of the ethyl glyoxylate exists in a partly polymerized, and thus unreactive, form. De-polymerization can be carried out by heating. This appears to explain the need to use freshly distilled ethyl glyoxylate as taught in Schmitt et al. Besides the impracticability of using ethyl glyoxylate, the only disclosed reducing agent, phosphorous tetraiodide, is expensive, not readily available, and produces iodine- and phosphorous-containing wastes. Furthermore, Schmitt et al. teaches the isolation of the intermediates by column chromatography. These reactants and procedures are not convenient for scale up to a commercial size production. Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a process that can use inexpensive and/or readily available reactants. It would also be desirable to have a process that can be readily scaled up, that does not require special purification techniques and that can produce a highly pure product. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process, which comprises reacting a compound of formula (2): wherein Y and Z each independently represent a lower alkyl group; with glyoxylic acid or a compound of formula (6): wherein R 3 and R 4 each independently represent hydrogen or a lower alkyl; to form a compound of formula (5). Further, the present invention relates to removing the alpha hydroxyl group of the compound of formula (5) with a hydrogenolysis agent in the presence of a hydrogenolysis catalyst to thereby form a compound of formula (3). The compounds of formula (3) can be converted into compounds of formula (1) by the use of an amidation agent; wherein R 1 and R 2 each independently represent hydrogen or a lower alkyl group. The process of the present invention can produce compounds of formula (1) in very high purity, even higher than 99.5%, through the use of common reactants and is susceptible of being scaled. The compounds of formula (5) as well as the highly pure compounds of formula (1) are additional aspects of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The starting compounds of formula (2) are commercially available and/or readily attained by methods known in the art. Y and Z each independently represent a lower alkyl group. As used throughout this specification, the term lower alkyl group means a straight chain, branched chain, or cycloalkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms for a straight chain and 3 to 6 carbon atoms for a branched chain or cycloalkyl group. Typically Y and Z represent methyl, ethyl, propyl (n-or iso-propyl), or butyl (n-, iso-, or t-butyl), and preferably are both methyl. Glyoxylic acid (CHOCOOH) and the compounds of formula (6) are also commercially available or readily attainable by known techniques. The compounds of formula (6) are derivatives of glyoxylic acid. Glyoxylic acid itself is an unstable compound so that it easily forms in a water solution a geminal diol compound (2,2-dihydroxyacetic acid also known as glyoxylic acid monohydrate-formula (6) where R 3 R 4 H). This monohydrate form is stable as both a solid crystal and as a water solution. Similarly, glyoxylic acid readily reacts with an alkanol to yield the corresponding acetal (formula (6) where at least one of R 3 and R 4 is not H). R 3 and R 4 each independently represent hydrogen or a lower alkyl group. Typically, R 3 and R 4 are both hydrogen, methyl or ethyl, although they are not limited thereto. In the reaction, the compounds of formula (6) are believed to convert to glyoxylic acid as an intermediate which then reacts with the compound of formula (2). In a certain sense, the reaction is thus always between glyoxylic acid and a compound of formula (2). The compounds of formula (6) serve as a convenient precursor compound for providing the active but unstable glyoxylic acid for reaction. It is, however, possible to add glyoxylic acid itself as the reactant to form the compounds of formula (5). The phrase reacting a compound of formula (2) with glyoxylic acid or a compound of formula (6) is meant to include all reactions involving glyoxylic acid and the imidazoles of formula (2), whether the glyoxylic acid is directly added or provided indirectly as a precursor, such as the compounds of formula (6). In one embodiment, the glyoxylic acid is provided by adding only a compound or compounds of formula (6). The condensation reaction of the compound of formula (2) and glyoxylic acid or the compound of formula (6) proceeds smoothly by simple heating of the mixture of both reactants in a suitable inert solvent, optionally with removal of the formed water such as by distillation. Suitable solvents include non-polar organic solvents such as hydrocarbons or chlorinated hydrocarbons having a boiling point of 80 to 150 C. Preferred solvents are those that form an azeotropic mixture with water. Dichloroethane is an example of such a solvent. The glyoxylic acid or compound of formula (6) can be used in either a solid monohydrate or in a water solution and is generally combined in a molar ratio of at least 1:1 but generally not more than 10:1 from the point of view of economy, relative to the amount of 2-phenylimidazo1,2apyridines of formula (2). The addition is carried out on the 3-position exclusively, thereby forming the compound of formula (5). The produced hydroxyacids of formula (5) are generally solids and can be isolated if desired by techniques well known in the art such as by filtration from a solvent in which it is insoluble or by extraction and evaporation of the extraction solvent. However, in one embodiment such isolation does not occur and the reaction mixture is instead directly used in the next synthetic step. To accomplish this, the solvent should be a suitable medium for both the addition reaction and the subsequent hydroxyl-removal reaction. A preferred example of such a solvent is formic acid. The substituents Y and Z have the same meaning and preferences as stated above for formula (2). In particular, the compound of formula (5) where Y and Z are both methyl (6-methyl-2-(p-methylphenyl)imidazo1,2apyridine-3-(2-hydroxy) acetic acid) is a preferred intermediate. The alpha-hydroxyl group of the compound of formula (5) is subsequently removed and replaced by hydrogen to form an acid compound of formula (3). While many removal techniques and conditions are generally known and principally suitable for use in the present invention, care should be taken to not attack the carbonyl or hydroxyl moieties of the acid group. Only the alpha hydroxyl group is intended to be removed, that is selective removal. To this end, a preferred technique involves hydrogenolysis whereby the hydroxyl group is replaced with hydrogen by the use of a hydrogen source in the presence of a hydrogenolysis catalyst. Hydrogen sources include formic acid, phosphonic acid, phosphinic acid, alkali metal salts of these acids and hydrogen gas, but are not limited thereto. Hydrogenolysis catalysts include palladium, platinum, and rhodium, optionally supported such as on carbon. A preferred combination is formic acid and a palladium or rhodium catalyst supported on carbon from the viewpoint of achieving high specificity for hydrogenolysis of the alpha-hydroxyl group. In this case, the amount of formic acid is preferably in excess or great excess (e.g. over 20 times the amount required). In one embodiment, formic acid is used as the solvent for the reaction either alone or in combination with another solvent. The reaction proceeds smoothly at elevated temperatures, preferably at the reflux temperature. After the reaction, the catalyst is removed, typically by filtering, the solvent is removed by evaporation and the solid product is then isolated by conventional means such as crystallization from water. If desired the compound of formula (3) can be isolated as a salt of a base or acid instead of as the free base. The hydrogenolysis techniques of our invention as described above are advantageous in that the introduction of halides and halogenated substances into the reaction mixture is avoided as are the corresponding potential impurities and/or side reactions associated therewith. For example, the use of phosphorous tetralodide with the alpha hydroxylester as taught in Schmitt et al. appears to provide the ester product in a purity of about 90%. About 6% is side product and about 3% is unreacted starting material. The hydrogenolysis techniques of the present invention have been found, unexpectedly, to provide excellent selective removal of the alpha-hydroxyl group and to provide the compounds of formula (3) in high purity. For example, the acid compound of formula (3), when isolated, typically has a purity of at least 95%, preferably at least 97%, and more preferably at least 98%, without the need to perform a special purification step. Such high purity is advantageous for commercial scale production. From the acid compound of formula (3), the compounds of formula (1) can be readily made by methods of amidation that are well known in the art. For example, the acid of formula (3) can be reacted with an amidation agent either directly or after activation of the intermediate into an acylchloride, an anhydride, an activated ester, or an activated amide. The amidation reagent includes an amine of the formula HNR 1 R 2 and ammonia. Typically, an amine is used as the amidation reagent in the presence of carbonyldiimidazole. The process parameters for this reaction are well known in the art (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,382,938 discussed above). Another technique uses an amine amidation agent in the presence of oxalylchloride/dimethylfonmamide. A preferred amidation agent is dimethylamine. The produced compounds of formula (1) are generally solids and they can be isolated by conventional methods including filtration and precipitation after adding a proper diluent. Advantageously, the excess amine, if any, is removed from the reaction mixture before isolation of the compound of formula (1) is attempted. The compounds of formula (1), when isolated or recovered by conventional means are generally at least 98% pure and usually more than 99% pure, without the need to carry out subsequent purification or the use of special purification/isolation techniques such as HPLC. For clarity, although filtering and crystallization are both technically purification techniques, the purification or special purification step that is generally unnecessary in the context of the present invention refers to performing a purification technique after the first recovery or isolation of the compound. Such a duplicative step is not needed in order to attain the above-mentioned purity levels of at least 98% for compounds of formula (1) and at least 95% for compounds of formula (3). The high purity level of the compounds of formula (1) is especially advantageous in that it is attained with the free base as opposed to the salt. Moreover, it is attainable reliably, even on an industrial scale. Another advantage of the preferred embodiments of the present invention is that the free base has a low content of a halogen or halogen-containing compound. Unlike several of the prior art processes, the present invention is not required to use a halogen in the reduction of the alpha-hydroxyl group. Accordingly, no chloride ions or iodide ions are likely to be present in the reaction medium and thus unlikely to become impurities in the solid form of the compound of formula (1). In this context, the composition preferably contains not more than 1% total impurities and not more than 0.1% of a halide ion or a compound thereof. The impurity percentages used herein are based on weight percent. The compounds of formula (1) can be converted into their corresponding salts of inorganic or organic acids, preferably pharmaceutically acceptable acids, by methods well known in the art. Examples of suitable acid addition salts include hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, maleate, fumarate, tartrate, mesylate, and tosylate. Additionally, it should be understood that the compounds of formula (1) and their salts include hydrate, solvate and anhydrous forms unless otherwise specified. The above-mentioned high purity of the free base not only provides for a highly pure salt form, but also facilitates crystal formation. Specifically, it has been discovered that the compounds of formula (1) have difficulty forming crystalline salts; sometimes with poor yields and in a non-crystalline state. Apparently, this difficulty lies in the impurity level of the free base. The highly pure free base of the present invention allows for good yields in the preparation of crystalline salt forms and usually without the need to purify. Although each step of the synthesis provides good purity, it is permitted to carry out a subsequent purification step on any of the intermediates such as with activated charcoal, silica gel, kieselguhr, etc. Crystallization from a proper solvent is another form of purification. However, such is normally not necessary and is typically only employed for characterization purposes. The compounds of formula (1), and in particular the substantially pure forms discussed above, are useful in pharmaceutical applications. The compounds of formula (1) and more preferably a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, can be administered to a patient as a hypnotic, anxiolytic or anticonvulsive agent. Such utility is already known in the art. The compounds of formula (1) or their salts can be combined in an effective amount with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents to form a pharmaceutical composition. An effective amount to cause a hypnotic, anxiolytic or anticonvulsive effect is well known in the art and/or may be determined from common knowledge and practice using only routine skill. The pharmaceutical composition may be an oral dosage form or a parenteral dosage form and may contain other ingredients in addition to a carrier and/or diluents. Preferably the composition is an oral dosage form such as a tablet or capsule. EXAMPLES The invention will now be further described by the following non-limiting examples.

The present invention relates to novel dibenzonaphthyrones, to processes for the preparation thereof, to a process for colouring/pigmenting organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material with dibenzonaphthyrones and to substance compositions comprising dibenzonaphthyrones. Dibenzonaphthyrones of the formula H. D. Becker et al., Aust. J. Chem., 38(1), 97-110, 1985 describe the compounds of formulae (II) to (V). Dibenzonaphthyrones of formulae (VI) to (XIII) are known from J. Indian. Chem. Soc., 45, 35 (1968), J. N. Chatterjea et al. The dibenzonaphthyrone of formula (XIV) is known from Chem. Ber., 117(2), 666-671, 1984, Saalfrank, R. W. et al. The dibenzonaphthyrone of formula (XV) is known from Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr., 5 e sr.,T.9, 826 (1942), Ch. Marschalk et al. The industrial use of dibenzonaphthyrones has been negligible hitherto since their difficult preparation from complicated starting materials is uneconomic and/or the use of oxidising agents containing heavy metals is ecologically unsound. Aust. J. Chem., 38(1), 97-110, 1985, H. D. Becker et al. disclose, for example, the preparation of dibenzonaphthyrone from isoxindigo, which is difficult to obtain synthetically, by base-catalysed isomerisation, or, Chem. Ber. 117(2), 666-671, Saalfrank, R. W. et al., the isomerisation of coumarin, which has to be prepared in several stages, and, Chem. Lett., 1301-1304, 1979, Shibata K. et al., photo-oxidative multiple-stage preparation from flava-nonol compounds, or J. Indian Chem. Soc. 45, 35-44, 1968, Chatterjea, J. N. et al., condensation from coumarin or trans-2,2dimethoxydicyanostilbene. Tet. Left., 39, 4671-4674, 1966, Kubota, T. et al. discloses the preparation of dibenzonaphthyrone by oxidation with potassium permanganate and, Bull.Soc.Chim. Fr., 5 e sr.,T.9, 826 (1942), Ch. Marschalk et al., oxidation with iron chloride or chromic acids. Fluorescing properties of dibenzonaphthyrones, both in solution and in the crystalline state, are mentioned in Aust. J. Chem., 38(1), 97-110, 1985, H. D. Becker et al. The use of dibenzonaphthyrones as colourants is not known. Their difficult preparation makes them too expensive for most purposes. The problem underlying the invention was therefore to find novel dibenzonaphthyrones that are suitable as colourants or fluorescent agents, especially for colouring/pigmenting organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material, but especially high-molecular-weight organic material. In addition, the problem consisted of finding a simpler and cheaper process for the preparation of dibenzonaphthyrones. The present invention relates to novel dibenzonaphthyrones of the general formula (I) wherein A 1 , and A 2 are each independently of the other unsubstituted or mono- to tetra-substituted o-C 6 -C 18 arylene, with the proviso that formula (I) does not represent a dibenzonaphthyrone of the formula o-C 6 -C 18 Arylene is, for example, 1,2-phenylene, 1,2-naphthylene, 2,3-naphthylene, 1,2-phenanthrylene, 2,3-phenanthrylene, 3,4-phenanthrylene or 9,10-phenanthrylene. If o-C 6 -C 18 arylene is substituted, the substituents may, independently of one another, be any desired atoms, groups of atoms or radicals, which, depending on their valency, may be bonded to A 1 or to A 2 by one or more bonds. For example, divalent radicals, such as 1,3-butadien-1,4-ylene or CHCHNH, may then produce an additional 5- or 6-membered ring fused to A 1 and A 2 , with the proviso that formula (I) does not represent a dibenzonaphtyrone of formulae (II) to (XV). The compounds of formula (I) are, for example, symmetric or asymmetric dibenzonaphthyrones. If o-C 6 -C 18 arylene is substituted, the substituent may, for example, be a bridge to a further dibenzonaphthyrone. In that bis-dibenzonaphthyrone structure, two dibenzonaphthyrones may be linked to each other, for example, by an alkylene or cycloalkylene bridge. Preference is given to the use of dibenzonaphthyrone of the formula wherein A 3 is a single bond, or C 1 -C 24 alkylene unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by halogen, hydroxy, oxo, cyano, OCOR 6 , COOR 6 , COO X 30 , SO 3 X or by SO 3 R 6 , a polycyclic radical or C 5 -C 12 cycloalkylene, each of which may be uninterrupted or interrupted one or more times by O, N, P, S or by NR 6 , and C 6 -C 24 arylen and A 1 -A 24 heteroarylen, and R 100 , R 101 , R 102 and R 100 , R 101 , R 102 and R 103 , R 104 , R 105 , R 106 have independently of one another the same meanings as R 1 , and R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 and R 28 , R 29 , R 30 or R 31 are each independently of the others cyano, NO 2 , R 5 , NR 5 R 6 , NR 7 COR 5 , NR 7 COOR 5 , NCR 5 R 6 , CONR 7 R 8 , OR 5 , COOR 5 , COO X , SR 5 , SOR 5 , SO 2 R 5 , SO 2 NR 7 R 8 , SO 3 R 5 or SO 3 X , it being possible, where applicable, for the pairs of radicals R 1 and R 2 , R 2 and R 3 , R 3 and R 4 or R 5 and R 6 , and also R 28 and R 29 , R 29 and R 30 or R 30 and R 31 to be, in addition, joined together by a direct bond (with the removal of a hydrogen atom at each of the two atoms joined by the bond), so that a 5- or 6-membered ring is produced; R 5 is hydrogen, or C 1 -C 25 alkyl, C 5 -C 12 cycloalkyl or C 2 -C 24 alkenyl each of which is unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by halogen, hydroxy, oxo, cyano, OCOR 6 , COOR 6 or by COO X and each of which may be uninterrupted or interrupted one or more times by O, S or by NR 6 , or is C 6 -C 18 aryl, C 7 -C 18 aralkyl or A 5 -A 18 heteroaryl each of which is unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by halogen, nitro, cyano, OR 6 , SR 6 , NR 7 R 8 , CONR 7 R 8 , OCOR 6 , COOR 6 , COO X , SO 2 R 6 , SO 2 NR 7 R 8 , SO 3 R 6 , SO 3 X , NR 7 COR 6 or by NR 7 COOR 6 , R 6 is hydrogen, or C 1 -C 25 alkyl unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by halogen, hydroxy, oxo or by cyano, or OCOR 10 , COOR 10 or COO X , or C 2 -C 24 alkenyl, each of which may be uninterrupted or interrupted one or more times by O, S or NR 7 , or is C 6 -C 18 aryl, C 7 -C 18 aralkyl or A 5 -A 18 heteroaryl each of which is unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by halogen, nitro, cyano, hydroxy, OR 7 , SR 7 , NR 7 R 8 , CONR 7 R 8 , COOR 7 , OCOR 7 , COOH or by COO X , R 7 and R 8 independently of each other are hydrogen, C 6 -C 18 aryl, C 7 -C 18 aralkyl, or are C 1 -C 25 alkyl or C 2 -C 24 alkenyl each unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by halogen, hydroxy, C 1 -C 12 alkoxy, OCOR 10 , COOR 10 or by COO X , or R 7 and R 8 together with the common N are pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine or morpholine each unsubstituted or mono- to tetra-substituted by C 1 -C 4 alkyl, or are carbazole, phenoxazine or phenothiazine, X is a cation Li , Na , K , Mg 1/2 , Ca 1/2 , Sr 1/2 , Ba 1/2 , Cu , Cu 1/2 , Zn 1/2 , Al 1/3 or NR 7 R 8 R 10 R 11 , and R 10 and R 11 independently of each other are hydrogen, C 1 -C 25 alkyl, C 6 -C 18 aryl or C 7 -C 18 -aralkyl, with the proviso that, in formula (XVIa), dibenzonaphthyrones of formulae (II) to (XV) are excluded. If a group is poly-substituted, different substituents may be combined. The present invention further relates to a process for the preparation of dibenzonaphthyrones, which is described in detail hereinafter. The invention also relates to substance compositions comprising at least one dibenzonaphthyrone selected from the group of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) and organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material, especially high-molecular-weight organic material.

Special preference is given to a compound of the formula wherein R 12 , R 13 , R 32 and R 33 are each independently of the others hydrogen, halogen, NO 2 , R 14 , OR 14 , SR 14 especially OC 9 -C 18 alkyl or SC 9 -C 18 alkyl, and R 34 is a single bond, C 1 -C 24 alkylene or C 5 -C 12 cycloalkylene, wherein R 14 is C 1 -C 25 alkyl which is unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by oxo, cyano, COOR 16 , OCOR 16 or by COO X1 and which may be uninterrupted or interrupted one or more times by O, especially (C 1 -C 12 alkyl)COOR 16 , or C 6 -C 10 aryl or C 7 -C 10 aralkyl each unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by halogen, nitro, cyano, OR 16 , NR 16 R 17 , CONR 16 R 17 , COOR 16 , OCOR 16 , NR 18 COR 16 or by NR 18 COOR 16 ; X1 is a cation Na , K , Mg 1/2 , Ca 1/2 , Zn 1/2 , Al 1/3 or NR 16 R 17 R 18 R 19 ; and R 16 and R 17 independently of each other are hydrogen, C 6 -C 10 aryl, C 7 -C 10 aralkyl, or C 1 -C 8 -alkyl which is unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by halogen, hydroxy or by C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy; or R 16 and R 17 together with the common N are pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine or morpholine each unsubstituted or mono- to tetra-substituted by C 1 -C 4 alkyl; and R 18 and R 19 independently of each other are hydrogen, C 1 -C 12 alkyl, C 6 -C 10 aryl or C 7 -C 10 -aralkyl. More special preference is given to the use of a compound of the formula wherein R 20 , R 21 , R 34 and R 35 are each independently of the others hydrogen, chlorine, R 22 , OR 22 , especially OC 2 H 5 COOCH 3 , SR 22 , especially OC 9 -C 18 alkyl or SC 9 -C 18 alkyl, and R 37 is a single bond, C 1 -C 8 alkylene or C 5 -C 6 cycloalkylene, R 22 is C 1 -C 25 alkyl which is unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by oxo, cyano, COOR 27 , OCOR 27 or by COO X2 and which may be uninterrupted or interrupted one or more times by O, such as especially OCH 2 COOCH 3 , C 2 H 5 COOH, C 2 H 5 COO(C 1 -C 12 alkyl), or is C 6 -C 10 aryl or C 7 -C 10 aralkyl, X2 is a cation Na , K , Mg 1/2 , Ca 1/2 , Zn 1/2 , Al 1/3 or NR 24 R 25 R 26 R 27 , R 24 , R 25 and R 26 independently of one another are hydrogen, C 1 -C 12 alkyl or phenyl, and R 27 is hydrogen, C 1 -C 8 alkyl, C 6 -C 10 aryl or C 7 -C 10 aralkyl.

Dibenzonaphthyrones may occur in various crystal modifications, as described by H. D. Becker et al., in Aust. J. Chem., 38(1), 97-110, 1985. In the case of polymorphism, in principle any crystal modification is suitable as a colourant. The invention further relates to a process for the preparation of dibenzonaphthyrone of the formula which comprises dehydrating a compound of the formula or a tautomer thereof, to form isoxindigo of formula (XXIIa) and subsequently isomerising, it also being possible for formula (XXIII) to represent compounds of formulae (II) to (XV). The invention further relates to a process for the preparation of a mixture consisting of dibenzonaphthyrones of the formulae wherein A 1 and A 2 are different, which comprises dehydrating a mixture of compounds of the formulae or tautomers thereof, to form a mixture consisting of isoxindigos of the formulae and subsequently isomerising, it also being possible for formulae (XXIII), (XXIV) and (XXV) to represent compounds of formulae (II) to (XV). The compounds of formulae (XXIa) and (XXIb) and tautomers thereof are known from U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,572. It is not necessary to isolate the compound of formula (XXIa) or (XXIb); rather, the reaction mixture obtained in U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,572 can advantageously be further reacted directly. A mixture of a compound of formula (XXIa) and a compound of formula (XXIb) usually consists of a molar ratio of the two compounds in the range of from 100:0.1 to 0.1:100, preferably from 90:10 to 10:90, especially from 95:5 to 5:95, and there is also especially preferred the molar mixing ratio of 1:1. The mixtures are generally prepared from the individual 3-hydroxy-benzofuranonyl compounds by prior mixing, in accordance with generally known methods, or are obtainable directly from a mixed synthesis of two differently substituted phenols with glyoxylic acid. The dehydration can be performed thermally, for example at from 363 to 623K, preferably from 373 to 573 K, in an inert solvent, where appropriate with the addition of a protonic mineral or organic acid, a Lewis acid or an acid earth (such as, for example, Fulcat, montmorillonite, ion-exchanger). Where used, an amount of from 0.01 to 250 mol %, preferably from 1 to 10 mol %, based on the compound of formula (XVIa) or on the molar sum of the compounds (XXIa) and (XXIb), normally suffices. The dehydration is preferably carried out by removing water azeotropically from the reaction mixture using a water separator, with vigorous stirring and refluxing, where appropriate under reduced or elevated pressure. The dehydration can also be performed chemically, the compound of formula (XXIa), or the compounds of formulae (XXIa) and (XXIb), first being reacted with an equimolar amount of an electrophilic reagent and then an acid being eliminated from the resulting product, for example at from 253 to 523 K, preferably at from 323 to 473 K, in an inert solvent, where appropriate with the addition of an organic base, such as, for example, triethylamine, a dialkylaniline, 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-diazabicyclo2.2.2octane (DABCO), pyridine, an alkylpyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or quinoline. An amount of from 0.01 to 250 mol %, preferably from 0.1 to 50 mol %, based on the compound of formula (XXIa), or on the compounds of formulae (XXIa) and (XXIb), normally suffices in that case. If, however, the acid to be eliminated is not volatile under the elimination conditions, it is advantageous to use at least 100 mol % of base, based on the compound of formula (XXIa) or on the compounds of formulae (XXIa) and (XXIb). The acid can thereby be eliminated even at a lower temperature. As inert solvent it is possible to use, for example, an organic solvent that is unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by halogen or nitro, such as C 7 -C 25 aralkyl, especially toluene, C 9 -C 13 aralkyl, or C 6 -C 24 aryl unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by halogen or nitro, such as 1,2-dichlorobenzene, or C 1 -C 24 alkyl unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by halogen or nitro, such as dichloroethane. Suitable electrophilic reagents are, for example, methyl and ethyl esters of mineral acids, such as dimethyl sulfate or dimethylphosphonate, or organic or inorganic acid chlorides, such as thionyl chloride, phosgene, methanesulfonyl chloride, mesyl chloride, tosyl chloride or acetyl chloride, or anhydrides, such as acetic anhydride. A preferred electrophilic reagent is thionyl chloride. The subsequent isomerisation can be carried out thermally and/or with base catalysis. In a preferred embodiment, the isomerisation of the compounds of formulae (XXIIa), or (XXIIc), or (XXIIa), (XXIIb) and (XXIIc) to form (I) is usually base-catalysed. Preference is given to the use of organic bases, such as, for example, tertiary amine bases, such as triethylamine, a dialkylaniline, 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-diazabicyclo2.2.2octane (DABCO), or an aromatic nitrogen base, such as pyridine, alkylpyridine, dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or quinoline, preferably triethylamine, pyridine or quinoline, more preferably triethylamine or pyridine and most preferably pyridine. The isomerisation according to the invention is advantageously carried out in the presence of solvents, especially protic, polar solvents, such as an alcohol, such as, for example, a C 1 -C 6 alcohol. The isomerisation is usually carried out at elevated temperature, normally in the boiling temperature range of the solvent used. The reaction can be observed by hypsochromic colour change. The end of the reaction normally lies in the range of from 1 to 40 hours, whereafter the colour no longer changes. The dibenzonaphthyrone can be further processed in the customary manner; for example the crude product is filtered off, where appropriate washed, dried and, where appropriate, sieved. The invention further relates to a process for the preparation of dibenzonaphthyrone of formulae (I) to (XV) by condensation of 3-oxo-furanonyl with 3-methylene-furanonyl compounds, which comprises condensing a 3-methylene-furanonyl compound of formula (XXXX) with a 3oxo-furanonyl compound of formula (XXXXI) wherein A 1 and A 2 are different, using organic or inorganic acids or bases, to form and subsequently isomerising. The reaction is usually started by bringing a 3-methylene-furanonyl compound into contact with a 3-oxo-furanonyl compound and the condensation catalyst in accordance with methods known per se, for example by mixing the starting materials together or adding one of the starting materials dropwise to the other as described, for example, by J. N. Chaterjea in J. Indian Chem. Soc., 36, 70 (1959). In that literature reference, however, the condensation catalyst used is phosphorus tribromide which is ecologically harmful. Acids or bases may be used as the condensation catalyst. For example, it is possible to use inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, organic acids, such as arylsulfonic acids, especially ptoluenesulfonic acid, or alkanoic acids, formic acid or acetic acid, especially trifluoroacetic acid, and Lewis acids. It is possible to use as bases, for example, organic nitrogen bases, such as triethylamine, piperidine, pyridine, morpholine, or aliphatic alcoholates, such as, for example, methanolate, ethanolate, propanolate or butanolate, or aromatic alcoholates, such as, for example, phenolate. As solvents it is possible to use organic acids, such as, for example, acetic acid, or alcohols, such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol or hexanol, or hydrocarbons, such as, for example, hexane, heptane, or also ethers, such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether or dioxane. The molar ratio of 3-methylene-furanonyl to 3-oxo-furanonyl is normally selected to be in the range of from 1:1 to 3:1 and, preferably, the molar ratio is 1:1. The molar ratio of the condensation catalyst to 3-oxo-furanonyl is normally selected to be in the range of from 0.001:1 to 5:1, preferably in the range of from 0.001:1 to 1:1 and especially in the range of from 0.001:1 to 0.05:1. The reaction temperature selected is preferably a temperature at which the reaction mixture boils; it is in the range of the boiling temperature of the solvent used. The reaction mixture can be worked up by the customary methods, such as, for example, by the addition of water and subsequent repeated extraction of the crude product with an organic solvent, such as toluene. The organic phase containing the crude product can be washed with water and then concentrated by evaporation. If desired, the crude product is combined with methanol and subsequently filtered, the product being obtained as the filter residue. The starting materials for that process are prepared analogously to known processes. 3-Methylene-furanonyl compounds can be prepared, for example, analogously to the procedure of H.-D. Becker, K. Gustafsson, J.Org.Chem. 42, 2966 (1977) from phenols by reaction with glyoxal. 3-Oxo-furanonyl compounds obtained by oxidation of 3-hydroxy-furanonyl compounds can be prepared, for example, according to generally known methods of oxidising hydroxy compounds to keto compounds. Those methods are described, for example, in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, 4th edition, Vol. 4/1a 4/1b. In J. Org. Chem., 56, 6110 (1991), Z-Ma, J. M. Bobbitt describe oxidation using nitroxides. 3-Hydroxy-furanonyl compounds can be prepared analogously to the procedure for 3-hydroxy-benzofuranones which is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,614,572. Preferably, the bis-isoxindigos (IIb) are prepared from bis-3-oxo-furanonyl compounds of the formula or from bis-3-methylene-furanonyl compounds of the formula Preference is given to preparation from bis-3-oxo-furanonyl compounds (XXXII) by reaction with a 3-methylene-furanonyl compound (XXXIII) or, if desired, with a mixture of two differently substituted 3-methylene-furanonyl compounds (XXXIII). Dibenzonaphthyrones are also obtainable from isoxindigos that isomerise, for example, during the process for colouring/pigmenting high-molecular-weight organic material, preferably at elevated temperatures. The present invention further relates to compositions consisting of from 2 to 10 dibenzonaphthyrones of formulae (I) to (XV), preferably 2 or 3 compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). If the composition consists of three compounds, these may be especially compounds of the formulae wherein A 1 and A 2 are different and the compounds of formulae (XXIII), (XXIV) and (XXV) also represent dibenzonaphthyrone of the formulae (II) to (XV). The molar ratio of the compositions consisting of dibenzonaphthyrones of formulae (XXIII), (XXIV) and (XXV) is usually in the range of from 98:1:1 to 1:98:1 or 1:1:98, preferably in the range of 25:50:25 based on (XXIII):(XXIV):(XXV) and, in the case of two dibenzonaphthyrones, usually in the range of from 99:1: to 1:99. The compositions consisting of from 2 to 10 dibenzonaphthyrones of formulae (I) to (XV) can be prepared from the individual compounds by mixing methods known per se or, in the case of three-component compositions, also by direct synthesis, which is described above. The present invention further relates to a process for the mass-colouring/pigmenting of organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material, especially high-molecular-weight organic material, which comprises admixing at least one dibenzonaphthyrone of formulae (I) to (XV), preferably from 2 to 10, and especially 2 or 3 compounds, with the organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material, especially high-molecular-weight organic material, before processing thereof. If three compounds are admixed, these are preferably (XXIII), (XXIV) and (XXV). The invention further relates, therefore, to a substance composition comprising an organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material, especially high-molecular-weight organic material, and at least one compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or a composition consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) in a colour-producing amount, normally in the range of from 0.01 to 70% by weight, especially from 0.01 to 30% by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 10% by weight, based on the organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material. The present invention further relates to the use of the compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) individually as colourants or fluorescent agents, especially for colouring or pigmenting organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material, especially high-molecular-weight organic material. It is also possible, however, for the compositions according to the invention comprising compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) to be used in the form of mixtures, solid solutions or mixed crystals. Compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) can also be combined with colourants of another chemical class, for example with dyes or pigments, for example those selected from the group of the diketopyrrolopyrroles, quinacridones, perylenes, dioxazines, anthraquinones, indanthrones, flavanthrones, indigos, thioindigos, quinophthalones, isoindolinones, isoindolines, phthalocyanines, metal complexes, azo pigments and azo dyes. Depending on the nature of their substituting and on the polymer to be coloured, the compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) can be used in the form of polymer-soluble dyes or in the form of pigments. In the latter case, it is advantageous to convert the products obtained in the synthesis into a finely dispersed form. That can be done in a manner known per se. Depending on the compound and the intended use, it proves advantageous to use the colourants as toners or in the form of preparations. The high-molecular-weight material may be organic or inorganic and may be synthetic and/or natural material. The high-molecular-weight organic material usually has an average molecular weight of 10 5 -10 7 g/mol. It may be, for example, a natural resin or a drying oil, rubber or casein or a modified natural material, such as chlorinated rubber, oil-modified alkyd resins, viscose, or a cellulose ether or ester, such as ethylcellulose, cellulose acetate, propionate or butyrate, cellulose acetobutyrate or nitrocellulose, but is especially a completely synthetic organic polymer (duroplasts and thermoplasts) as may be obtained by polymerisation, for example by polycondensation or polyaddition. The class of polymers includes, for example, polyolefins, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisobutylene, and substituted polyolefins, such as polymerisates of monomers such as vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, styrene, acrylonitrile, acrylates, methacrylates, fluoropolymers, such as polyfluoroethylene, polytrifluorochloroethylene or tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene mixed polymerisate, and copolymerisates of the mentioned monomers, especially ABS (acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene) or EVA (ethylene/vinyl acetate). From the group of polyaddition and polycondensation resins it is possible to use, for example, condensation products of formaldehyde with phenols, the so-called phenoplasts, and condensation products of formaldehyde and urea or thiourea, also melamine, the so-called aminoplasts, and the polyesters used as surface coating resins, either saturated, such as alkyd resins, or unsaturated, such as maleic resins, and also linear polyesters, polyamides, polyurethanes, polycarbonates, polyphenylene oxides or silicones, and silicone resins. The mentioned high-molecular-weight compounds may be present individually or in mixtures in the form of kneadable compounds, melts or in the form of spinning solutions. They may also be present in the form of their monomers or in the polymerised state in dissolved form as film-formers or binders for paints or printing inks, such as, for example, boiled linseed oil, nitrocellulose, alkyd resins, melamine resins and urea-formaldehyde resins or acrylic resins. Low-molecular-weight materials are, for example, mineral oils, waxes or lubricating greases. The present invention further relates, therefore, to the use of the compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) and of the compositions according to the invention consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) for the production of inks, for printing inks in printing processes, for flexographic printing, screen printing, the printing of packaging, security colour printing, intaglio printing or offset printing, for preliminary printing stages and for textile printing, for office and home use or for graphics, such as, for example, for paper goods, for ball-point pens, felt-tip pens, fibre-tip pens, paperboard, wood, (wood) stains, metal, stamp pads or inks for impact printing processes (with impact printing ink ribbons), for the production of colourants, for paints, for use in industry or advertising, for textile decoration and industrial labelling, for roll coating or powder coating compositions or for automobile paints, for high-solids (low-solvent), water-containing or metallic paints or for pigmented formulations for aqueous paints, for mineral oils, lubricating greases or waxes, for the production of coloured plastics for coatings, fibres, plates or moulded substrates, for the production of non-impact printing material for digital printing, for the thermal wax-transfer printing process, the ink-jet printing process or for the thermal transfer printing process, and also for the production of colour filters, especially for visible light in the range of from 400 to 700 nm, for liquid crystal displays (LCDs) or charge-coupled devices (CCDs) or for the production of cosmetics or for the production of polymeric colour particles, toners, dry copy toners, liquid copy toners or electrophotographic toners. The present invention further relates to the use of substance compositions comprising an organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material, especially high-molecular-weight organic material, and at least one compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or a composition consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) in a colour-producing amount for the production of inks or colourants for paints, printing inks, mineral oils, lubricating greases or waxes, or coloured or pigmented plastics, non-impact printing material, colour filters, cosmetics or toners. The present invention further relates to inks comprising high-molecular-weight organic material and a colour-producing amount of the compound (I) to (XV) or of the composition consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). For example, the inks can be produced by mixing the compounds according to the invention with polymeric dispersants. The mixing of the compounds according to the invention with the polymeric dispersant is preferably carried out by generally known mixing methods, such as stirring or mixing, and the use of an intensive mixer, such as an Ultraturax, is especially to be recommended. When mixing the compounds according to the invention with polymeric dispersants, a water-dilutable organic solvent is advantageously used. The weight ratio of the compounds according to the invention to ink is advantageously selected to be in the range of from 0.0001 to 75% by weight, preferably from 0.001 to 50% by weight, based on the total weight of the ink. The present invention therefore relates also to a process for the production of inks which comprises mixing high-molecular-weight organic material with a colour-producing amount of the compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or compositions thereof consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). The present invention further relates to colourants comprising high-molecular-weight organic material and a compound according to the invention of formulae (I) to (XV), or a composition according to the invention consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV), in a colour-producing amount. The present invention relates, in addition, to a process for the preparation of colourants which comprises mixing a high-molecular-weight organic material and a colour-producing amount of the compound according to the invention of formulae (I) to (XV) or composition according to the invention consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). The present invention further relates to coloured or pigmented plastics or polymeric coloured particles comprising high-molecular-weight organic material and compound (I) to (XV), or composition consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV), in a colour-producing amount. The present invention relates, in addition, to a process for the preparation of coloured or pigmented plastics or polymeric coloured particles which comprises mixing together a high-molecular-weight organic material and a colour-producing amount of the compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or composition consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). The colouring of high-molecular-weight organic substances with the colourants of formulae (I) to (XV) or the compositions consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) is carried out, for example, by mixing such a colourant, optionally in the form of a master batch, into those substrates using roll mills or mixing or grinding apparatus, whereby the colourant is dissolved or finely distributed in the high-molecular-weight material. The high-molecular-weight organic material with the admixed colourant is then processed according to procedures known per se, such as, for example, calendering, compression moulding, extrusion moulding, coating, spinning, casting or injection-moulding, whereby the coloured material acquires its final form. Admixing of the colourant can also be carried out immediately prior to the actual processing step, for example by continuously metering a powdered colourant according to the invention and a granulated high-molecular-weight organic material, and optionally also additional ingredients, such as additives, directly into the inlet zone of an extruder simultaneously, where mixing takes place just before the processing operation. In general, however, prior mixing of the colourant into the high-molecular-weight organic material is preferred, since more uniform results can be obtained. It is often desirable for the purpose of producing non-rigid mouldings or reducing the brittleness thereof to incorporate so-called plasticisers into the high-molecular-weight compounds before shaping. There may be used as plasticisers, for example, esters of phosphoric acid, phthalic acid or sebacic acid. In the process according to the invention, the plasticisers can be incorporated into the polymers before or after the incorporation of the colourant. In order to obtain different colour shades it is also possible to add to the high-molecular-weight organic substances, in addition to the compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) or compositions according to the invention consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV), any desired amounts of constituents such as white, coloured or black pigments. For the colouring of paints and printing inks, the high-molecular-weight organic materials and the compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) or the compositions according to the invention consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV), optionally together with additional ingredients, such as fillers, dyes, pigments, siccatives or plasticisers, are finely dispersed or dissolved in a common organic solvent or solvent mixture. That procedure may comprise dispersing or dissolving each individual component on its own or dispersing or dissolving several components together and only then combining all the components. Processing is carried out in accordance with customary methods, for example by spraying, film-spreading or one of the many printing methods, whereupon the paint or printing ink is advantageously cured thermally or by irradiation, optionally after previous drying. When the high-molecular-weight material to be coloured is a paint, it may be a conventional paint or a special paint, for example an automobile finish, preferably a metal-effect finish containing, for example, metal or mica particles. Preference is given to the colouring of thermoplastics, especially also in the form of fibres, and printing inks. Preferred high-molecular-weight organic materials that can be coloured according to the invention are, very generally, polymers having a dielectric constant2.5, especially polyesters, polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyamide, polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene/acrylonitrile (SAN) or acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene (ABS). More especially preferred are polyesters, polycarbonate, polystyrene and PMMA. Most especially preferred are polyesters, polycarbonate and PMMA, especially aromatic polyesters that can be obtained by polycondensation of terephthalic acid, such as, for example, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polybutylene terephthalate. They can be used in the form of their monomers or copolymers or in the polymerised state in dissolved form as film formers or binders for paints that can be used for the decoration of metal or for decorative colour finishes, and for printing inks used, for example, in the ink-jet printing process, or also for wood stains. Special preference is also given to the colouring of mineral oils, lubricating greases and waxes with the compounds according to the invention. The present invention also relates to mineral oils, lubricating greases and waxes comprising high-molecular-weight organic material and a compound of formulae (I) to (XV), or compositions consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV), in a colour-producing amount. The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of mineral oils, lubricating greases and waxes, which comprises mixing high-molecular-weight organic material with a colour-producing amount of the compound of formulae (I) to (XV), or compositions thereof consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). The present invention also relates to non-impact printing material comprising high-molecular-weight organic material and a compound of formulae (I) to (XV), or compositions consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV), in a colour-producing amount. The present invention relates, in addition, to a process for the preparation of non-impact printing material, which comprises mixing together a high-molecular-weight organic material and a colour-producing amount of the compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or compositions consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). The present invention further relates to a process for the production of colour filters comprising a transparent substrate and a red, a blue and a green coating applied thereto in any desired sequence, which comprises using for the production of the red, blue and green coatings a correspondingly coloured compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or compositions comprising compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). The different-coloured coatings are preferably arranged in such a pattern that they do not overlap over at least 5% of their respective surface area and, most preferably, do not overlap at all. The colour filters can be coated, for example, using inks, especially printing inks, comprising the compounds or compositions according to the invention, or, for example, by mixing a compound or composition according to the invention with a chemically, thermally or photolytically structurable high-molecular-weight material (resist). The further production can be carried out, for example, analogously to EP-A 654 711, by application to a substrate, such as an LCD, subsequent photo-structuring and developing. The invention further includes a transparent substrate coated with a red, a blue and a green coating each of a correspondingly coloured compound of formulae (I) to (XV), or composition consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV), comprising pigmented high-molecular-weight organic material. The sequence in which coating is carried out is not important as a rule. The different-coloured coatings are preferably arranged in such a pattern that they do not overlap over at least 5% of their respective surface area and, most preferably, do not overlap at all. The present invention also includes colour filters comprising a transparent substrate and, applied thereto, a red, a blue and a green coating, each obtainable from a correspondingly coloured compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or from compositions comprising compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). The present invention relates, in addition, to toners comprising high-molecular-weight organic material and a compound of formulae (I) to (XV), or compositions consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV), in a colour-producing amount. The present invention also relates to a process for the production of toners, which comprises mixing together a high-molecular-weight organic material and a colour-producing amount of the compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or compositions consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV). The present invention also relates to inks or colourants for paints, printing inks, mineral oils, lubricating greases or waxes, or coloured or pigmented plastics, non-impact printing material, colour filters, cosmetics or toners comprising high-molecular-weight organic material and compound (I) to (XV), or composition comprising an organic or inorganic, high-molecular-weight or low-molecular-weight material and at least one compound of formulae (I) to (XV), in a colour-producing amount. In a special embodiment of the process according to the invention, toners, paints, inks or coloured plastics are produced by processing master batches of toners, paints, inks or coloured plastics in roll mills or mixing or grinding apparatus. A colour-producing amount of the compound of formulae (I) to (XV) or of compositions consisting of compounds of formulae (I) to (XV) means in the present invention normally from 0.0001 to 99.99% by weight, preferably from 0.001 to 50% by weight and especially from 0.01 to 50% by weight, based on the total weight of the material coloured or pigmented therewith. The coloured/pigmented high-molecular-weight materials obtained, such as, for example, plastics, fibres, paints and prints, are distinguished by very high colour intensity, high saturation, good fastness to overspraying, good migration-stability, good fastness to heat, light and weathering and by a high gloss and good IR reflectance behaviour. The high economic efficiency of the process according to the invention compared with previous preparation processes for dibenzonaphthyrones makes those compounds commercially attractive. Dibenzonaphthyrones of formulae (I) to (XV) produce surprisingly brilliant colour finishes of high colour intensity, are additionally distinguished by a high degree of fluorescence and exhibit surprisingly good heat-stability and light-fastness properties in polar plastics. Despite very good solubilities, the dibenzonaphthyrones have surprisingly good migration properties in the coloured material. In mixtures comprising the compounds according to the invention, beautiful shades of colour are obtained. Especially advantageously, asymmetric dibenzonaphthyrones and bis-dibenzonaphthyrones enable further colour shades to be obtained and allow their solubility to be influenced by the choice of the substituting. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of hydroxybenzofuranone, 5,7-di-tert-butyl-3-hydroxy-3H-benzofuran-2-one 300 ml of toluene, 212 g of 97% by weight 2,4-di-tert-butyl-phenol (Fluka), 121.9 ml of 50% by weight aqueous glyoxylic acid (Fluka), and 40 g p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (Fluka, Aldrich) are added in succession, with stirring, to a 1.5 litre multi-necked vessel equipped with stirrer, dropping funnel, water separator, condenser and thermometer. The reaction mixture is then refluxed vigorously while stirring well, during which the water present in the glyoxylic acid and the water of reaction of the first step separates. After a reflux time of approximately 3 hours, the separation of water ceases, leaving a homogeneous, slightly yellow solution of the hydroxybenzofuranone, 5,7-di-tert-butyl-3-hydroxy-3H-benzofuran-2-one. EXAMPLE 2a Dehydration to isoxindigo; in toluene with thionyl chloride and triethylamine The reaction mixture from Example 1 is diluted with 40 ml of a linear C 9 -C 13 alkylbenzene that boils at 548-585 K (Marlican, Hls). Then, under normal pressure and at a heating-bath temperature of up to 415 K, approximately 200 ml of toluene are distilled off. At the end of the distillation, the internal temperature is approximately 393 K. The light-yellow, oily mixture is cooled to an internal temperature of approximately 60 C. and 13.9 ml of triethylamine are added thereto. 79.8 ml of thionyl chloride are then added dropwise from the dropping funnel sufficiently rapidly that the evolution of HCl and SO 2 remains vigorous yet controllable. The addition lasts approximately 75 min, and the internal temperature is 333-340 K. When the formation of gas has virtually subsided, the reaction mixture is stirred for a further hour at 373 K. The heating control of the heating bath is then increased to 473 K. The temperature of the reaction mixture rises to 459 K over a period of approximately 35 min, during which a further 105 ml of toluene distil off. At the same time, a vigorous stream of HCI gas escapes once more. If the evolution of gas is too violent, the heating rate is reduced accordingly. The mixture, which is already deep-red, is then stirred for a further 2 hours at 453-463 K. The thick, dark-red to black crystal suspension is cooled to approximately 423 K; 200 ml of n-butanol followed by 400 ml of ethanol are then added through the condenser. The crystal suspension is stirred under reflux for approximately a further hour, is then cooled to 273-278 K and filtered off. The crystal cake is washed with sufficient cold ethanol (approximately 600 ml) until the filtrate is clearly no longer brown-tinged but is faintly red in colour. The crystalline dye is then dried at 353 K/50 mbar, yielding 186.2 g (76.2% of the theoretical yield based on 2,3-di-tert-butyl-phenol) of fine, deep-red, shiny crystals of 5,7,5,7-tetra-tert-butyl-3,3bibenzofuranylidene-2,2-dione of formula (LIa). melting point: 427-429 K.; elemental analysis: % C % H calc. 78.65 8.25 found 78.40 8.39 EXAMPLE 2b Dehydration to isoxindigo; in 1,2-dichlorobenzene with thionyl chloride and 4-dimethylaminopyridine 10 g of 5,7-di-tert-butyl-3-hydroxy-3H-benzofuran-2-one (prepared as described in Ex. 1a of U.S. Pat.

The isoxindigo is crystallised out by adding 30 ml of acetonitrile to the residue, is filtered off, washed with acetonitrile and dried, yielding 6.8 g (73% of the theoretical yield) of 5,7,5,7-tetra-tert-butyl-3,3bibenzofuranylidene-2,2-dione of formula (LIa).

Chem. 42, 2966 (1977)), 4.9 g (0.01 mol) of bis(5-cyclohexylidene)-7-tert-butyl-3-oxo-benzofuranone (Example 12) and 0.3 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid are boiled under reflux in 25 ml of acetic acid for 10 hours. 125 ml of water are then added and the resulting precipitate is filtered off with suction and chromatographed on silica gel (hexane/toluene 2:1). Crystallisation of the pure fractions from methanol yields 1.25 g of bis-isoxindigo (LXIIa). melting point: 577-581 K. EXAMPLE 14 Isoxindigo (LIVa) 300 ml of toluene, 30 g (0.117 mol) of 2,4-dicyclohexylphenol (synthesis, for example, according to: Kozlikovskii, Ya. et al.: Zh. Org. Khim. (1984), 20(1), 121-4), 121.9 ml of 50% aqueous glyoxylic acid and 0.5 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate are added in succession, with stirring, to a 1.5 litre multi-necked vessel equipped with stirrer, dropping funnel, water separator, condenser and thermometer. The reaction mixture is then refluxed vigorously while stirring well, during which the water present in the glyoxylic acid and the water of reaction of the first step separates. After a reflux time of approximately 3 hours, the separation of water ceases, leaving a homogeneous, slightly yellow solution of the hydroxybenzofuranone. The reaction mixture is then diluted with 40 ml of a linear C 9 -C 13 alkylbenzene that boils at 548-585 K. (Marlican, Hls). Then, under normal pressure and at a heating-bath temperature of up to 315 K, approximately 200 ml of toluene are distilled off. At the end of the distillation, the internal temperature is approximately 394 K. The light-yellow, oily mixture is cooled to an internal temperature of approximately 333 K and 13.9 ml of triethylamine are added thereto. 79.8 ml of thionyl chloride are then added dropwise from the dropping funnel sufficiently rapidly that the evolution of HCl and SO 2 remains vigorous yet controllable. The addition lasts approximately 75 min, and the internal temperature is 333-337 K. When the formation of gas has virtually subsided, the reaction mixture is stirred for a further hour at 373 K. The heating control of the heating bath is then increased to 573 K. The temperature of the reaction mixture rises to 495 K over a period of approximately 35 min, during which a further 105 ml of toluene distil off. At the same time, a vigorous stream of HCl gas escapes once more. If the evolution of gas is too violent, the heating rate is reduced accordingly. The mixture, which is already deep-red, is then stirred for a further 2 hours at 453-463 K. The thick, dark-red to black crystal suspension is cooled to approximately 422 K; 200 ml of n-butanol followed by 400 ml of ethanol are then added through the condenser. The crystal suspension is stirred under reflux for approximately a further hour, is then cooled to 273-278 K and filtered off. The crystal cake is washed with sufficient cold ethanol (approximately 600 ml) until the filtrate is clearly no longer brown-tinged but is faintly red in colour. The crystalline dye is then dried at 80 C./50 mbar, yielding 13.5 g (39% of the theoretical yield based on 2,3-dicyclohexylphenol) of fine, deep-red, shiny crystals of 5,7,5,7-tetra-cyclohexyl-3,3bibenzofuranylidene-2,2-dione of formula (LIVa). melting point: 517-524 K. elemental analysis: % C % H calc. 81.04 8.16 found 80.92 8.23 EXAMPLE 15 Process for the Dreparation of dibenzonalhthyrones (L) to (LXII) 0.02 mol of isoxindigo is boiled under reflux in 100 ml of n-butanol 1 and 50 ml of pyridine for a sufficiently long period (normally 10-40 hours) until the red colour of the isoxindigo has completely changed to the yellow colour of the dibenzonaphthyrone. The mixture is then cooled in an ice-bath, and the resulting crystals are filtered off with suction, washed with methanol and dried. 1 In the case of compound LVI, Table 1, methanol is used in order to avoid transesterification.

The mixture is then pre-extruded at 543 K in a 25 mm 1-screw extruder (Collin). The compound is then processed on a microprocessor-controlled injection-moulding machine (Ferromatik FM 40, Klckner). The residence time of the polymer (dependent on the cycle time, screw volume and plastification volume) is 5 min, during which the back pressure and the screw speed are kept low. That promotes homogeneous processing of the plastics material and prevents the generation of heat due to friction. The first injection-mouldings (platelets measuring 65251.5 mm) are discarded. The injection-mouldings produced at temperatures of from 473 K to 573 K in a residence time of 5 minutes are distinguished by excellent colour fastness properties, such as very high heat-stability, high light-fastness, good migration-stability and high colour intensity. The colour fastness properties are compared visually with a standard or are determined colorimetrically. EXAMPLE 16a Production of injection-moulded plates using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (MELINAR PURA, ICI) 0.1 g of dibenzonaphthyrone of formulae (L) to (LXII) is mixed with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (MELINAR PURA, ICI) in accordance with the above Example 16 and processed to form injection-mouldings. The injection-mouldings are produced at 543 K, 553 K, 563 K and 573 K in 2 minutes in each case. They are distinguished by very high heat-stability, high light-fastness, good migration-stability and high colour intensity. EXAMPLE 16b Production of injection-moulded plates using polybutylene terephthalate (PBTB)(CRATIN S 600, CIBA) 0.1 g of dibenzonaphthyrone of formulae (L) to (LXII) is mixed with polybutylene terephthalate (PBTB) (CRATIN S 600, CIBA) in accordance with the above Example 16 and processed to form injection-mouldings. The injection-mouldings are produced at 533 K, 548 K and 563 K in 5 minutes in each case. They have very high heat-stability, high light-fastness, good migration-stability and high colour intensity.

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims priority from German Application No. 198 22 912.7, filed on May 22, 1998, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of compounds of the general formula I and their salts wherein R 1 may represent H, (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkynyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkoxyalkyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-acyl, which are optionally linear or branched and may be mono- or poly-substituted by halogens, by radicals containing N, O, P, S atoms, (C 3 -C 7 )-cycloalkyl, which may be saturated or unsaturated and mono- or poly-substituted by linear or branched (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, (C 2 -CB)-alkynyl, (C 1 C 8 )-acyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-alkoxy, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkoxyalkyl, by halogens, by radicals containing N, O, P, S atoms, or may contain hetero atoms such as N, O, P, S in the ring, aryl, such as phenyl or naphthyl, aralkyl, such as benzyl or phenethyl, heteroaryl, such as furyl, pyrrolyl, pyridyl, heteroaralkyl, such as furfuryl, pyrrolylmethyl, pyridylmethyl, furylethyl, pyrrolylethyl, pyridylethyl, wherein the rings just mentioned may optionally be mono- or poly-substituted by linear or branched (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkynyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-acyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-alkoxy, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkoxyalkyl, by halogens, by radicals containing N, O, P, S atoms, N-bonded amino acid or peptide residue, R 2 may represent H, (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkynyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkoxyalkyl, which are optionally linear or branched and may be mono- or poly-substituted by halogens, by radicals containing N, O, P, S atoms, (C 3 -C 7 )-cycloalkyl, which may be saturated or unsaturated and mono- or poly-substituted by linear or branched (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkynyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-acyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-alkoxy, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkoxyalkyl, by halogens, by radicals containing N, O, P, S atoms, and/or may contain hetero atoms such as N, O, P, S in the ring, aryl, such as phenyl or naphthyl, aralkyl, such as benzyl or phenethyl, heteroaryl, such as furyl, pyrrolyl, pyridyl, heteroaralkyl, such as furfuryl, pyrrolylmethyl, pyridylmethyl, furylethyl, pyrrolylethyl, pyridylethyl, wherein the rings just mentioned may optionally be mono- or poly-substituted by linear or branched (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkynyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-acyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-alkoxy, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkoxyalkyl, by halogens, by radicals containing N, O, P, S atoms, R 3 may represent H, ClCO, (C 1 -C 8 )-acyl, which may optionally be linear or branched, a C-bonded amino acid or peptide residue or a conventional peptide-protecting group such as, for example, formyl, carbamoyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, tert.-butyloxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl, trifluoroacetyl. The invention relates also to novel intermediates of the general formulae V, IV and II and their salts wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 are as defined above and R 4 represents (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkoxy, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyloxy, which are optionally linear or branched and are optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms, aryl, such as phenyl or naphthyl, aralkyl, such as benzyl or phenethyl, arylalkyloxy, such as benzyloxy, and R 5 represents H, or R 5 and R 3 are bonded together via a CO group to form a ring, wherein in formula V, when R 2 is H, R 3 may not be H, and to the uses of those intermediates. 2. Background Information The compounds that can be prepared by the process according to the invention and the novel intermediates are valuable intermediates for the production of biologically active substances. For example, 3-amino-2-oxo-pyrrolidines are preferably used as a structural unit for peptide mimetics, which are used as pharmaceuticals. In WO 94/22820, 3-amino-1-phenyl-2-oxo-pyrrolidines substituted at the phenyl ring, for example, are described as intermediates for thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors. Other biologically active compounds containing those -lactams have been studied by Kottirsch et al. (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1993, 3, 1675). In other examples, they are used in highly potent neurokinin NK-2 receptor antagonists according to Deal et al. (J. Med. Chem. 1992, 35, 4195). The majority of the processes used hitherto for the preparation of substituted 3-amino-2-oxo-pyrrolidines consist in first converting the corresponding open-chained methionine compounds into their sulfonium salts and cyclising the latter with strong bases in a suitable solvent. Friedinger et al. (J. Org. Chem. 1982, 47, 104-109) use for that purpose methyl iodide and sodium hydride, which is difficult to handle in a large-scale process. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,484,946, trimethylsulfonium or trimethylsulfoxonium salts are used for the alkylation instead of methyl iodide, which is readily volatile. The cyclisation is then carried out using potassium carbonate. However, the main problem of those procedures, namely the unavoidable release from the methionine precursor of dimethyl sulfide, which is extremely strong-smelling, cannot be avoided in the process just mentioned either. Moreover, the necessary use of expensive aprotic polar solvents such as, for example, DMSO in the cyclisation with potassium carbonate appears to be a further disadvantage. WO 94/22820 mentions a process in which racemic homoserine derivatives, which have been prepared starting from butyrolactone, are cyclised to pyrrolidones by means of triphenylphosphine and azodicarboxylic acid diesters. However, those reagents are not very suitable for use in an industrial process since they are relatively expensive. Moreover, the cyclisation in that variant yields a number of secondary products which are difficult and hence time-consuming and expensive to separate from the desired derivative (K. Nakajima et al. Peptide Chemistry 1983, 77-80). Although L-homoserine is a naturally occurring amino acid, as yet there are known only a relatively small number of syntheses of homoserineamides, for example peptides, that start from homoserine. The reasons therefor are that homoserine and the corresponding N-acyl compounds very readily form the corresponding lactones under acid conditions (J. P. Greenstein, M. Winitz, Chemistry of the Amino Acids, Wiley, New York 1961, Vol. 3, p. 2612). The same also occurs when the carboxy group is activated, as is necessary for the preparation of homoserineamides. Although it is possible to react also N-acylhomoserinelactones with alkylamines and amino acid esters or amino acid salts to form the corresponding amides (Sheradsky et al., J. Org. Chem. 1961, 26, 2710), the reaction requires either very long reaction times or relatively high temperatures. For that reason, this method has not been used for the preparation of complex, optionally optically active compounds. For the preparation of homoserineamides there are used homoserine derivatives in which the hydroxy function is protected by a suitable group. Hitherto, that was achieved either by a trityl group (Barlos et al., J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. 1986, 1259), by mono- or di-methoxytrityl groups (Beltran et al., Lett. Pept. Sci. 1997, 4, 147), tert.-butyldimethylsilyl group (WO 97/46248) or benzyl groups (Cornille et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 909). The disadvantage of those protecting groups is that they either require expensive chemicals or can be introduced only in a complicated manner. O-Acyl compounds could be simple and inexpensive O-protecting groups. However, the problem with those compounds is that they very rapidly undergo an O-N-acyl shift under basic conditions, with formation of the corresponding N-acylhomoserines. Furthermore, for the preparation of O-acetylhomoserine there has hitherto been described only the reaction of homoserine with acyl anhydrides in perchloric acid which, on account of the explosive tendency of perchlorates, appears to be very disadvantageous and unsuitable for larger batches. The yields are only 51% at the most (Nagani et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1967, 242, 3884). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide a further process for the preparation of -lactams of the general formula I which can advantageously be carried out on an industrial scale, that is to say which avoids the use of critical substances and expensive reagents as far as possible. Within the context of the invention, critical substances are to be understood as being compounds which, when used on a large scale, give rise to particular risks as regards environmental pollution or health and safety at work. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process which allows the -lactams of the general formula I to be prepared without formation of the foul-smelling dimethyl sulfide. A further object of the invention is to provide novel intermediates which can advantageously be used for the synthesis of the -lactams of the general formula I, and to indicate an advantageous use of those intermediates. These and other objects, which are not explained in greater detail but which readily follow from the prior art in an obvious manner, are the subject of a process having the features of the characterising clause of claim 1 . Advantageous developments of the process according to the invention are described in the sub-claims which are dependent on claim 1 . By synthesising a compound of the general formula I and its salts wherein R 1 may represent H, (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkynyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkoxyalkyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-acyl, which are optionally linear or branched and may be mono- or poly-substituted by halogens, by radicals containing N, O, P, S atoms, (C 3 -C 7 )-cycloalkyl, which may be saturated or unsaturated and mono- or poly-substituted by linear or branched (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkynyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-acyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-alkoxy, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkoxyalkyl, by halogens, by radicals containing N, O, P, S atoms, and/or may contain hetero atoms such as N, O, P, S in the ring, aryl, such as phenyl or naphthyl, aralkyl, such as benzyl or phenethyl, heteroaryl, such as furyl, pyrrolyl, pyridyl, heteroaralkyl, such as furfuryl, pyrrolylmethyl, pyridylmethyl, furylethyl, pyrrolylethyl, pyridylethyl, wherein the rings just mentioned may optionally be mono- or poly-substituted by linear or branched (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkynyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-acyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-alkoxy, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkoxyalkyl, by halogens, by radicals containing N, O, P, S atoms, N-bonded amino acid or peptide residue, R 2 may represent H, (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkynyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkoxyalkyl, which are optionally linear or branched and may be mono- or poly-substituted by halogens, by radicals containing N, O, P, S atoms, (C 3 -C 7 )-cycloalkyl, which may be saturated or unsaturated and mono- or poly-substituted by linear or branched (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkynyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-acyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-alkoxy, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkoxyalkyl, by halogens, by radicals containing N, O, P, S atoms, and/or may contain hetero atoms such as N, O, P, S in the ring, aryl, such as phenyl or naphthyl, aralkyl, such as benzyl or phenethyl, heteroaryl, such as furyl, pyrrolyl, pyridyl, heteroaralkyl, such as furfuryl, pyrrolylmethyl, pyridylmethyl, furylethyl, pyrrolylethyl, pyridylethyl, wherein the rings just mentioned may optionally be mono- or poly-substituted by linear or branched (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkynyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-acyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-alkoxy, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkoxyalkyl, by halogens, by radicals containing N, O, P, S atoms, R 3 may represent H, ClCO, (C 1 -C 8 )-acyl, which may optionally be linear or branched, a C-bonded amino acid or peptide residue or a conventional peptide-protecting group such as, for example, formyl, carbamoyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, tert.-butyloxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl, trifluoroacetyl, by cyclising derivatives of the general formula II wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 are as defined above and X represents an element from the group halogen, sulfonic acid ester, the desired compounds of the general formula I are obtained in good yields in a very simple and nevertheless advantageous manner, the process according to the invention being predestined for a large-scale industrial process owing to the fact that the starting materials necessary for the synthesis are relatively inexpensive, the reaction is simple to perform, the yields are good, and dangerous or foul-smelling reagents are not used. Within the context of the process according to the invention, a sulfonic acid radical X is to be understood as being any radical derived from a sulfonic acid of the structure HOSO 3 R, wherein R in this connection represents a linear or branched (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl radical or an aryl radical which may optionally be substituted by one or more (C 1 -CB)-alkyl radicals. The mentioned radicals may optionally be substituted by one or more elements from the group halogen, preferably Cl or F. The above-described cyclisation may advantageously be carried out under basic conditions, it being possible to use as the base preferably an alkali hydroxide. The use of aqueous alkali hydroxide solution is especially preferred, and very special preference is given to the use of sodium hydroxide solution for the cyclisation. Compounds of the general formula II that can advantageously be used for the cyclisation possess a sulfonic acid ester as the leaving group X, and the use of the so-called mesyl (OSO 3 Me) group is especially preferred. This process can be applied very especially to compounds of the general formula II wherein R 1 is a p-cyanophenyl or p-carbamoylphenyl radical, while R 2 is advantageously H and R 3 benzyloxycarbonyl. The cyclisation can be carried out at temperatures of from 20 C. to 100 C. Temperatures of from 0 C. to 50 C. are preferably employed in the cyclisation, very especially temperatures of from 10C to 30 C. The synthesis of the compounds of the general formula I can preferably and extremely simply be accomplished from compounds of the general formula II, if II is reacted to form I without being isolated beforehand. The compounds of the general formula II can advantageously be prepared from derivatives of the general formula III wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 are as defined above. The compounds of the general formula III are preferably not isolated before being processed further to form compounds of formula II. The compounds of formula III, in turn, are very especially preferably prepared from compounds of the general formula IV wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 are as defined above and R 4 represents (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, (C 1 -C 8 )-alkoxy, (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyloxy, which are optionally linear or branched and are optionally substituted by one or more halogen atoms, aryl, such as phenyl or naphthyl, aralkyl, such as benzyl or phenethyl, arylalkyloxy, such as benzyloxy. In principle, any processes for hydrolysis known to the person skilled in the art can be used for the above-mentioned conversion. Advantageously, however, compounds of the general formula IV can be converted into compounds of the general formula III by aminolysis. Special preference is given in this connection to the use of ammonia as the amine; very especially preferably, ammonia can be employed in the form of its aqueous solution. The compound of the general formula IV, in turn, can advantageously be prepared from compounds of the general formula V wherein R 2 , R 3 , R 4 are as defined above and R 5 represents H, or wherein R 3 and R 5 are bonded together via a CO group to form a ring. Before they are reacted to form compounds of the general formula IV, compounds of the general formula V wherein R b 5 is H can be activated preferably by means of acid chlorides (analogously to Houben-Weyl, Volume 15, Part 2, p. 169 ff). Compounds of the general formula V wherein R 3 and R 5 are bonded together via a CO group to form a ring can advantageously be converted into compounds of the general formula IV wherein R 3 represents H. According to the invention, the compounds of the general formula V can advantageously be prepared from the acid addition salts of the general formula VI wherein R 2 1 R 4 are as defined above and Y is the corresponding base of an inorganic acid, by reaction with an acylating reagent derived from R 3 . Within the scope of the invention, an inorganic acid is to be understood as being an acid whose pKa value is less than 2.5, such as, for example, HCl, HBr, H 2 SO 4 , H 3 PO 4 . Phosgene can preferably be used as the acylating reagent. In that case, compounds of the general formula V wherein R 3 and R 5 are bonded together via a CO group to form a ring are obtained. Alternatively, compounds of the general formula VI can be obtained by reaction with acylating reagents from the group of the organic anhydrides, such as, for example, di-tert.-butyl pyrocarbonate, of the activated esters, such as, for example, trifluoroacetic acid ester, acetic acid hydroxysuccinimide ester, or of the halocarbonic esters, such as, for example, benzyloxycarbonyl chloride, allyloxycarbonyl chloride or tert-butyloxycarbonyl fluoride. The above-described acylation can preferably take place in aqueous solution at a pH of from 4 to 9; it is especially preferred to maintain a pH range of from 6.5 to 7.5 in that reaction. The acylation to form compounds of the general formula V wherein R 5 is H can, however, also be carried out in organic solvents in the presence of a tertiary base. Triethylamine may advantageously be used as the tertiary base. The acid addition salt of the general formula VI, in turn, can preferably be prepared from compounds of the general formula VII wherein R 2 is as defined above. The reaction can take place in a mixture of a carboxylic acid R 4 COOH and the carboxylic acid chloride or bromide R 4 COCl or R 4 COBr, respectively, wherein R 4 is as defined above. For that reaction it is advantageous first to mix together the appropriate carboxylic acid R 4 COOH and the corresponding carboxylic acid halide R 4 COHal and then to add the compound of the general formula VII to that mixture. The above-mentioned process is advantageously carried out at a temperature of from 20 C. to 50 C., preferably from 10 C. to 20 C. and especially from 5 C. to 10 C. Another preferred variant for preparing the compound of the general formula V consists in reacting compounds of the general formula VIII wherein the radicals R 2 , R 3 may be as defined above and R 5 represents H, with the reagent R 4 COZ, wherein R 4 is as defined above and Z represents an activating radical. The activating radical Z may in principle be any radical known to the person skilled in the art for that purpose, such as, for example, hydroxysuccinimide, hydroxybenzotriazole, R 4 CO 2 , halogen (The Chemical Synthesis of Peptides, J. Jones, Oxford Press 1991, p. 42 ff). For the acylation of the OH function of formula VIII there are preferably used compounds in which the activating radical Z corresponds to a halogen. In that case, the reaction is very especially preferably carried out in the carboxylic acid corresponding to the carboxylic acid halide as solvent. Especially preferred halides are the chlorides or bromides of the carboxylic acid. Very special preference is given to the embodiment in which the inorganic acid formed in the acylation is buffered by addition of the sodium salt of the corresponding carboxylic acid used as solvent. In a further aspect of the present invention, advantageous novel intermediates of the general formulae V, IV and II and their salts are provided wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 are as defined above, wherein in formula V, when R 2 is H, R 3 may not be H. Preference is given to compounds in which R 2 is hydrogen, R 3 is a benzyloxycarbonyl, tert.-butyloxycarbonyl or trifluoroacetyl radical, R 4 is a methyl radical and R 5 is hydrogen, or in which R 3 and R 5 are bonded together via a CO group to form a ring. X is preferably a halogen or a sulfonic acid ester, very especially preferably an OSO 3 Me group. R 1 is very especially preferably p-cyanophenyl or p-carbamoylphenyl. The advantageous compounds of the general formulae V, IV and II are used according to the invention for the preparation of intermediates of biologically active substances. The present invention is explained again in the scheme below: The cyclisation of II to I is an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution. In principle, any variant known to the person skilled in the art may be employed for that reaction. However, a number of subsidiary products, such as, for example, the removal or substitution of the leaving group, are to be expected in that reaction. For that reason it was very surprising that it was possible to find for the cyclisation, with the choice of leaving groups X, conditions that permit the use of a relatively strong basein this case sodium hydroxidein the presence of a polar protic, cation-stabilising solventin this case waterand nevertheless allow the reaction to proceed as selectively as possible. Those very inexpensive, uncritical reagents, which can readily be used for a large-scale process, are clearly to be preferred over other conditions from the prior art for the intramolecular substitution (dimethyl sulfide is not formed, sodium hydride is not used, no expensive reagents and solvents are required). A further advantage of those preferred reaction conditions is that the optical activity of enantiomerically enriched starting compounds is maintained virtually completely under the conditions according to the invention. In the above-described reaction there are preferably used derivatives of II that contain the p-cyanophenyl or p-carbamoylphenyl group as the radical R 1 , H as R 2 , and a benzyloxycarbonyl radical as R 3 . They yield advantageous compounds for the preparation of pharmaceuticals, as described, for example, in WO 94/22820. The preparation of the compounds of formula II from III can be carried out analogously to processes known from the literature. It is, however, preferred to form a sulfonic acid ester from III and sulfonic acid chloride, which ester can advantageously be reacted further in the manner indicated above, without being isolated as an intermediate, to form I. Special preference is given to the use of the mesyl (OSO 3 Me) group, which can be introduced using mesyl chloride and triethylamine as base. It is astonishing that under the preferred reaction conditions according to the invention it is not the hydrolysis of the sulfonic acid ester II but the cyclisation that is the main reaction. That was not foreseeable. It is also especially advantageous that the compounds of the general formula II do not have to be isolated before they are reacted to form I. They are formed and then preferably reacted in situ. The preparation of the compounds of the general formula III from the compounds of the general formula IV can be carried out by acid or basic hydrolysis of the O-acyl group. Under those conditions, however, partial hydrolysis, for example of the N-acyl group which may be present and of the amide bond, may occur. Under the preferred hydrolysis variant, therefore, the removal of the O-acyl group is carried out by aminolysis. Ammonia is especially preferably used for that purpose, very especially preferably its aqueous solution. Under those conditions, the Q-acyl group is removed selectively. According to the invention it is also not necessary to isolate the compounds of the general formula III. They can also be reacted directly to form compounds of the general formula II. For the present process it is, therefore, extremely advantageous to select a process variant in which, starting from derivatives of the general formula IV to the end product of the general formula I, no intermediate stage is isolated intermediately. Nevertheless, the derivatives of the general formula I are obtained in good to very good yields and with a very high degree of purity. That was surprising and could in no way be foreseen; it is, however, all the more advantageous for a large-scale process since the very cost-intensive handling of isolated intermediate products can be reduced to a minimum. There may be used as solvents for the conversion of III-II any organic solvents that are inert under the given conditions. Special preference is given to ethers, such as, for example, methyl tert.-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, dioxane, hydrocarbons, such as, for example, hexane, cyclohexane, toluene, ketones, such as, for example, acetone, diethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and carboxylic acid alkyl esters, such as, for example, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, n-butyl acetate. Very special preference is given to organic solvents that form a low-boiling azeotrope with water, such as, for example, toluene, methyl isobutyl ketone or n-butyl acetate. Compounds of formula IV, in turn, can preferably be obtained from derivatives V. In the case where the radicals R 3 and R 5 are bonded together via a CO group to form a ring, that is to say an N-carboxylic acid anhydride of the derivative in question is present, the carboxy function of the homoserine derivative does not have to be activated for the coupling. The derivatives are then simply reacted with the chosen amine, yielding compounds of formula IV wherein R 3 is H. The latter can be converted into the corresponding N-acyl compounds in accordance with processes known from the literature by reaction with an acylating reagent derived from R 3 . In the case where R 5 H, the carboxy function is activated before coupling with the amine. That is effected by methods of peptide chemistry known to the person skilled in the art (Houben-Weyl, Volume 15, 2nd part), such as, for example, via mixed anhydrides, activated esters, etc. Reaction with an acid chloride, such as, for example, pivaloyl chloride, to form the mixed anhydride is, however, preferred. The compounds of the general formula V according to the invention can be obtained from homoserine derivatives such as VII by two different methods. Either VII is first acylated at the oxygen to form VI and then processed further at the nitrogen by N-acylation to form V, or compounds of the general formula VIII, which are obtainable from VII by N-acylation, are converted into V by O-acylation. The N-acylation to form the homoserine derivative VIII can be carried out analogously to that of other amino acids (Houben-Weyl, Volume 15, Part 1 and Part 2). In principle there may be used as the acylating reagents any acylating reagents derived from R 3 , such as amino-protecting reagents, C-terminal activated amino acids or peptides. In the isolation of the N-acylhomoserines of formula VIII there was, however, the problem that those compounds, as the free acid, are very unstable and readily cyclise to form the corresponding lactones. That cyclisation is catalysed by acids and, moreover, always occurs when the acid function is activated. It takes place also in the reaction with the activated acid derivative R 4 COZ under the basic conditions which are otherwise customary for acylations. However, if the O-acylation is carried out in, as solvent, the carboxylic acid R 4 COOH corresponding to the reagent R 4 COZ used for the O-acylation, then the desired derivatives V are obtained almost exclusively. Special preference is given to the use of Cl for Z. A base is optionally and advantageously used to buffer the acid that forms during the reaction. The sodium salt of the carboxylic acid used as solvent is advantageously added as the base. The subsidiary product, the lactone, which is also formed in that process but to a lesser extent can be separated from the product mixture in a simple manner by extraction and, after ring-opening, is available for the reaction again. In the second variant, the O-acylation to form derivatives VI is carried out according to the invention in a medium that helps to prevent the N-acylation, since that would be the more rapid reaction. The reaction is, therefore, preferably carried out in a carboxylic acid such as R 4 COOH, to which the appropriate corresponding carboxylic acid halide, preferably carboxylic acid chloride, has previously been added. When the homoserine derivative VII is subsequently added, protection of the amino function of VII takes place by protonation as a result of the strong inorganic acid that forms in the solvent, and acylation of the hydroxy function preferentially occurs. The acid addition salt of the hydroxy-protected homoserine VI is therefore obtained as the product. The use of the dangerous perchloric acid, as is known from the prior art, is thus avoided. Furthermore, the yields in the process according to the invention are markedly better. The further reaction of derivatives VI to form V can in principle be carried out by processes known to the person skilled in the art using an acylating reagent derived from R 3 , such as amino-protecting reagents, C-terminal activated amino acids, peptides, or using phosgene. There was the problem, however, that the O-acylhomoserines VI rapidly undergo an O-N-acyl shift under basic conditions. According to the process of the invention, that can be avoided by maintaining the pH range, if the acylation is carried out in an aqueous medium, at from 3 to 9, preferably from 6 to 7.5. A further possibility is to react the O-acyl compounds VI in anhydrous solvents and triethylamine as base. For the reaction with phosgene, the acid addition salt VI can be used without addition of a base. There come into consideration as linear or branched (C 1 -Ce)-alkyl radicals methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec.-butyl, tert.-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl or octyl, including all possible isomers of constitution. The linear or branched (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl radical includes all the substituents listed above in connection with the (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl radical with the exception of the methyl radical, at least one double bond being present in those radicals. The scope of (C 2 -C 8 )-alkynyl corresponds to that of (C 2 -C 8 )-alkenyl, but at least one triple bond must be present in that case. The radical (C 1 -C 8 )-alkoxy corresponds to the radical (C 1 -C 8 )-alkyl, with the proviso that it is bonded to the ring via an oxygen atom. (C 2 -C 8 )-Alkoxyalkyl radicals are radicals in which the alkyl chain is interrupted by at least one oxygen function, wherein two oxygens may not be bonded together. The number of carbon atoms indicates the total number of carbon atoms contained in the radical. (C 2 -C 8 )-Alkenyloxy is to be understood as meaning radicals such as (C 2 -C 8 )-alkoxy that have at least one C-C double bond. Radicals containing N, O, P, S atoms are especially alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl radicals of the above-mentioned type that have one or more of those hetero atoms in their chain or that are bonded to the molecule via one of those hetero atoms. (C 3 -C 7 )-Cycloalkyl is to be understood as being cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl or cycloheptyl radicals. There are suitable as halogens fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. An N-bonded amino acid or peptide residue is to be understood as being a compound in which the molecule in question is bonded via its N atom to the a-carbon atom of a carboxylic acid derived from an amino acid, which carboxylic acid may be part of a peptide residue. A C-bonded amino acid or peptide residue is to be understood as being a compound in which the molecule in question is bonded via its N atom to the carbon atom of the carboxyl group of an amino acid, which may be part of a peptide. (C 1 -C 8 )-Acyl is to be understood as being an alkyl radical having from one to eight carbon atoms, which may be linear or branched, that is to say which likewise includes all the possible isomers of constitution, and which is bonded to the molecule via a CO function. Within the scope of the invention, compounds having a stereogenic centre mean racemates as well as the enantiomeric antipodes of those structures. However, for the process according to the invention it is preferred to use enantiomerically enriched homoserine derivatives of the general formula VII. Thus, when the enantiomerically enriched starting materials (D or L) are used, the enantiomerically enriched products of the general formulae V and I (D or L) are obtained with virtually complete stereoconservation. Salts are to be understood as being ionic addition compounds from strong acids such as HCl, HBr, H 2 SO 4 , H 3 PO 4 , CF 3 COOH, p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid and the molecule in question.

to two or three acyl groups derived from fatty acids. The compound has the following formula. in which X is chlorambucil, Y is an optional spacer group, AA is an amino acid, B is H or CH 2 OR 3 , and n is a number from 0 to 3. X is linked to Y via the carboxyl group. R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are as defined by the present specification. This application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 08/875,098 filed Jul. 16, 1997, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,952,499, which is a 371 of PCT/AU96/0015 filed Jan. 15, 1996. The present invention relates to a range of therapeutic compounds conjugated to one to three acyl groups derived from fatty acids. The therapeutic compounds are selected from the following group: 1. the corticosterone family of drugs; 2. opioids and opioid antagonists; 3. antiviral nucleosides, such as AZT; 4. cyclosporins and related cyclopeptides; 5. folate antagonists including methotrexate, folic acid and folic acid analogues; 6. catecholamine precursors, such as DOPA and Dopamine, and catecholamines, such as adrenaline, noradrenaline and derivatives; and 7. alkylating agents containing a carboxylic acid group, such as chlorambucil and melphalan. In particular the present invention relates to altering the pharmacokinetic profile and mode of delivery of these therapeutic compounds by conjugating them to one to three acyl derivatives of fatty acids. 1. The Corticosterone Family of Drugs Among the most commonly used therapeutic agents are the corticosterone family of drugs based on the naturally occurring hormones produced by the adrenal cortex. There are two major groups of corticosterone hormones with overlapping activities: glucocorticoidsnormal biological action is the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism, possess anti-inflammatory activity at higher levels. mineralocorticoidsconcerned with water and mineral metabolism. The corticosterones, both natural and synthetic, are based on the cholesterol molecule and generally have the common structural features of: These groups are generally unmodified in active analogues of the hormones with the exception of the hydroxyl moiety (alternatively described as the hydroxyl at position 21) of the hydroxyacetyl at position 17 eg hydrocortisone acetate. Of particular interest in one aspect of the present invention is the anti-inflammatory action of the glucocorticoids (both natural hormones and synthetic drugs) non-limiting examples of which are: cortisone hydrocortisone fludrocortisone prednisone prednisolone methylprednisolone triamcinolone dexamethasone betamethasone paramethasone fluocinolone The present inventors have shown that members of this family can be linked to one to three acyl derivatives of fatty acids. It is believed that such new conjugated compounds are improved over the unconjugated therapeutic agent. Further it is believed that these novel compounds will aid in the oral, transdermal, intraarticular, intranasal, and/or intraocular delivery of these drugs. Accordingly in a first aspect the present invention consists in a compound of the following formula: in which X is a member of the corticosterone family of hormones or drugs and is linked to Y via an hydroxyl group Y is a spacer group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5 B is H or CH 2 OR 3 R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are the same or different and are either hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or an acyl group derived from a fatty acid, with the proviso that at least one of R 1 , R 2 and R 3 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. In a second aspect the present invention consists in a compound of the following formula: XYAA n NHCH 2 CH 2 OR 4 in which X is a member of the corticosterone family of hormones or drugs and is linked to Y via an hydroxyl group Y is a spacer group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5, and R 4 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. In a third aspect the present invention consists in a method of prolonging or altering the activity of a member of the corticosterone family of hormones or drugs comprising administering the compound in the form: in which X is a member of the corticosterone family of hormones or drugs and is linked to Y via an hydroxyl group Y is a linker group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5 B is H or CH 2 OR 3 R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are the same or different and are either hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or an acyl group derived from a fatty acid, with the proviso that at least one of R 1 , R 2 and R 3 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. In a fourth aspect the present invention consists in a method of prolonging or altering the activity of a member of the corticosterone family of hormones or drugs comprising administering the compounds in the form: XYAA n NHCH 2 CH 2 OR 4 in which X is a member of the corticosterone family of hormones or drugs and is linked to Y via an hydroxyl group Y is a spacer group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5, and R 4 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. The fatty acid may be saturated or unsaturated. As stated above X is linked via a hydroxyl group to the linker Y. Typically, this hydroxyl group will be at position 17 or 21, however it may be at other positions such as 16. Linkers Y to join compounds with an hydroxyl group to the amino group of Tris (when B is CH 2 OR 3 ) or the intervening amino acid (AA, if present) useful in the present invention include: a) a linker with a carboxyl group to the compound and a carboxyl group to the Tris (or amino acid if present) such as a dicarboxylic acid via the anhydride eg succinic anhydride, maleic anhydride. b) a linker with a carboxyl group to the compound and an aldehyde group to the Tris (or amino acid if present) such as glyoxylic acid (in the presence of a reducing agent eg NaBH 4 ). c) a linker with a carboxyl group to the compound and an halide group to the Tris (or amino acid if present) such as chloroacetic acid. d) a linker with a carboxyl group to the compound and a NCO group to the Tris (or amino acid if present) such as ethylisocyanatoacetate. X may be any one of the members of the corticosterone family of compounds, however, it is presently preferred that X is hydrocortisone or cortisone. In further preferred embodiments of this aspect of the present invention Y is a dicarboxylic acid, AA is not present or is glycine or alanine and the linkage is via the hydroxyl group at position 21. As will be appreciated R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are either hydrogen or an acyl group of a fatty acid. Also it is clear to those skilled in the art that substitutions other than methyl or ethyl are possible at R 1 , R 2 and R 3 . The prime requirement is that at least one of R 1 , R 2 and R 3 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. When R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are each acyl groups of fatty acids it is preferred that they are the same group. It is also preferred that the acyl groups of fatty acids have a carbon chain of 3 to 18, more preferably 10 to 18. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that similar modifications could be made to some members of the other classes of steroid (or analogues) hormones such as the male and female sex hormones at hydroxyl groups situated at various sites in the molecule. The present invention also provides therapeutic compositions comprising the compound of the first or second aspect of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The composition may further include an unconjugated member of the corticosterone family of hormones or drugs. The therapeutic composition may be administered by any appropriate route as will be recognised by those skilled in the art. Such routes include transdermal, intraarticular, oral, intranasal and intraocular. 2. Opioids and Opioid Antagonists Morphine is a classic example of an opiate analgesic that acts on the CNS receptors for the naturally occurring opioid peptides, the enkephalins and endorphins, mimicking their action. It is a powerful addictive drug used for the relief of moderate to severe pain associated with conditions such as heart attack, cancer, colic due to kidney or gall stones, following surgery and for severe burns etc. It has a short biological half-life and is normally delivered orally or by injection. Related opioid analgesic or antagonists include hydromorphone, oxymorphone, levorphanol, levallorphan, codeine, nalmefene, nalorphine, naloxone, naltrexone, buprenorphine, butorphanol and nalbufine. Morphine has the structure: Modification of the hydroxyl groups at position 3 or 6 with lipophilic groups change the rate of absorption and distribution of morphine particularly to the CNS. The present inventors have shown that morphine and related opioid analgesic or antagonists (morphine family) can be ester linked at the hydroxyl at the 3 position via spacers to one to three acyl derivatives of fatty acids. It is believed that such new conjugated compounds are improved over the unconjugated therapeutic agent. It is also believed that similar linkage could be achieved via the hydroxyl group at the 6 position. Accordingly in a fifth aspect the present invention consists in a compound of the following formula: in which X is a member of the morphine family and is linked to Y via an hydroxyl group eg the hydroxyl group at the 3 or 6 position Y is a spacer group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5 B is H or CH 2 OR 3 R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are the same or different and are either hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or an acyl group derived from a fatty acid, with the proviso that at least one of R 1 , R 2 and R 3 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. In a sixth aspect the present invention consists in a compound of the following formula: XYAA n NHCH 2 CH 2 OR 4 in which X is a member of the morphine family and is linked to Y via an hydroxyl group at the 3 or 6 position Y is a spacer group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5, and R 4 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. In a seventh aspect the present invention consists in a method of prolonging or altering the activity of a member of the morphine family comprising administering the compound in the form: in which X is a member of the morphine family and is linked to Y via an hydroxyl group at the 3 or the 6 position Y is a linker group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5 B is H or CH 2 OR 3 R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are the same or different and are either hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or an acyl group derived from a fatty acid, with the proviso that at least one of R 1 , R 2 and R 3 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. In an eighth aspect the present invention consists in a method of prolonging or altering the activity of a member of the morphine family comprising administering the compound in the form: XYAA n NHCH 2 CH 2 OR 4 in which X is a member of the morphine family and is linked to Y via an hydroxyl group at the 3 or the 6 position Y is a spacer group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5, and R 4 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. The fatty acid may be saturated or unsaturated. Linkers Y to join compounds with an hydroxyl group to the amino group of Tris (when B is CH 2 OR 3 ) or the intervening amino acid (AA, if present) useful in the present invention include: a) a linker with a carboxyl group to the compound and a carboxyl group to the Tris (or amino acid if present) such as a dicarboxylic acid via the anhydride eg succinic anhydride, maleic anhydride. b) a linker with a carboxyl group to the compound and an aldehyde group to the Tris (or amino acid if present) such as glyoxylic acid (in the presence of a reducing agent eg NaBH 4 ). c) a linker with a carboxyl group to the compound and an halide group to the Tris (or amino acid if present) such as chloroacetic acid. d) a linker with a carboxyl group to the compound and a NCO group to the Tris (or amino acid if present) such as ethylisocyanatoacetate. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention X is morphine modified at the 3 or 6 position, Y is a dicarboxylic acid and AA is not present or is glycine or alanine. As stated above R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are either hydrogen or an acyl group of a fatty acid. Also it will be clear to those skilled in the art that substitutions other than methyl or ethyl are possible at R 1 , R 2 and R 3 . The prime requirement is that at least one of R 1 , R 2 and R 3 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. When R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are acyl groups of fatty acids it is preferred that they are the same group. It is also preferred that the acyl groups of fatty acids have a carbon chain of 3 to 18, more preferably 10 to 18. The present invention also provides therapeutic compositions comprising the compound of the fifth or sixth aspect of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The composition may further include an unconjugated member of the morphine family. The therapeutic composition may be administered by any appropriate route as will be recognised by those skilled in the art. Such routes include topical, local injection, intraperitoneal and intravenous. 3. Antiviral Nucleosides As stated above in one aspect the present invention relates to therapeutic conjugates of AZT (azidothymidine or zidovudine) and other antiviral nucleosides (eg acyclovir, ganciclovir, vidarabine, idoxuridine, triphuridine, valaciclovir, famciclovir) and comprises the antiviral agents bound via linker group/s to one to three acyl groups and to methods involving the use of these compounds. In particular the present invention relates to alteration of the pharmacokinetics and/or mode of delivery and targeting of these drugs when bound to one to three acyl derivatives of fatty acids. AZT is an example of an antiretroviral drug. It is active against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other mammalian retroviruses. The drug is a thymidine analogue which is converted to the triphosphate derivative by normal cellular enzymes. In this form it inhibits viral reverse transcription (RNA dependent DNA synthesis). DNA chains are terminated by the incorporation of the modified thymidine. AZT is widely prescribed for AIDS and, as it has a short biological half-life, it must be administered every 4 hours. Its use is associated with many side effects from nausea to suppression of new blood cell formation and associated conditions. The present inventors have shown that AZT and similar drugs (hereafter termed the Antiviral Nucleosides) can be linked to one to three acyl derivatives of fatty acids. It is believed that such new compounds will improve the delivery, uptake, half-life and targeting within the cell of the drug after oral, intranasal, transdermal, intraocular and other modes of delivery. Further it may change the distribution of the drug in the body increasing the percentage of drug delivered to the CNS and to lymphocytes in the lymphatic system. Accordingly in a ninth aspect the present invention consists in a compound of the following formula: in which X is an antiviral nucleoside and is linked to Y via an hydroxyl group Y is a spacer group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5 B is H or CH 2 OR 3 R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are the same or different and are either hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or an acyl group derived from a fatty acid, with the proviso that at least one of R 1 , R 2 and R 3 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. In a tenth aspect the present invention consists in a compound of the following formula: XYAA n NHCH 2 CH 2 OR 4 in which X is an antiviral nucleoside and is linked to Y via an hydroxyl group Y is a spacer group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5, and R 4 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. In a eleventh aspect the present invention consists in a method of prolonging or altering the activity of an antiviral nucleoside comprising administering the antiviral nucleoside in the form: in which X is an antiviral nucleoside and is linked to Y via an hydroxyl group Y is a linker group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5 B is H or CH 2 OR 3 R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are the same or different and are either hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or an acyl group derived from a fatty acid, with the proviso that at least one of R 1 , R 2 and R 3 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. In a twelfth aspect the present invention consists in a method of prolonging or altering the activity of an antiviral nucleoside comprising administering the antiviral nucleoside in the form: XYAA n NHCH 2 CH 2 OR 4 in which X is an antiviral nucleoside and is linked to Y via an hydroxyl group Y is a spacer group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5, and R 4 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. The fatty acid may be saturated or unsaturated. Linkers Y to join compounds with an hydroxyl group to the amino group of Tris (when B is CH 2 OR 3 ) or the intervening amino acid (AA, if present) useful in the present invention include: a) a linker with a carboxyl group to the compound and a carboxyl group to the Tris (or amino acid if present) such as a dicarboxylic acid via the anhydride eg succinic anhydride, maleic anhydride. b) a linker with a carboxyl group to the compound and an aldehyde group to the Tris (or amino acid if present) such as glyoxylic acid (in the presence of a reducing agent eg NaBH 4 ). c) a linker with a carboxyl group to the compound and an halide group to the Tris (or amino acid if present) such as chloroacetic acid. d) a linker with a carboxyl group to the compound and a NCO group to the Tris (or amino acid if present) such as ethylisocyanatoacetate. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention X is AZT, acyclovir, ganciclovir, vidarabine, idoxuridine, trifluridine, ddI, ddC, ddA, or ribavirin, however, it is presently preferred that X is AZT. It is also preferred that Y is a dicarboxylic acid and AA is not present or is glycine or alanine. As stated above R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are either hydrogen or an acyl group of a fatty acid. Also it will be clear to those skilled in the art that substitutions other than methyl or ethyl are possible at R 1 , R 2 and R 3 . The prime requirement is that at least one of R 1 , R 2 and R 3 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. When R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are acyl groups of fatty acids it is preferred that they are the same group. It is also preferred that the acyl groups of fatty acids have a carbon chain of 3 to 18, more preferably 10 to 18. The present invention also provides therapeutic compositions comprising the compound of the ninth or tenth aspect of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The composition may further include an unconjugated antiviral nucleoside. The therapeutic composition may be administered by any appropriate route as will be recognised by those skilled in the art. Such routes include oral, intranasal, transdermal and intraocular. 4. Cyclosporins and Related Cyclopeptides Cyclosporins are a family of closely related cyclic peptides which exhibit powerful immunosuppressive activity. Cyclosporins are used extensively (often in combination with glucocorticoids such as prednisolone) in organ transplantation to prevent rejection. Cyclosporins appear to act in a reversible manner on helper T lymphocytes by inhibiting the production of interleukins and interferons and/or inhibiting interleukin binding with receptors on killer T lymphocytes, thereby curtailing the cell mediated response to the foreign cells of the transplanted tissue or organ. Animal studies have shown that cyclosporins inhibit a range of immune responses including delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity, Freunds adjuvant induced arthritis and T cell dependent antibody production opening the possibility of use in a broader range of applications than is currently practiced eg topically applied cyclosporin could be beneficial in the treatment of psoriasis and/or arthritis. The structure of the cyclosporin family is shown below with cyclosporins A, B, C, D, and G varying only at side-chain R. The present inventors propose that members of this family can be linked to one to three acyl derivatives of fatty acids. This could be possible by linkage to the invariant hydroxyl group or via linkage to variants of R eg cyclosporin C has a threonine side chain at R which could be used as a linkage point. It is believed that such new compounds will improve the delivery, uptake, half-life and/or mode of delivery of the members of the cyclosporin family of drugs. Further it is believed that these novel compounds will aid in the oral, transdermal, intranasal, parenteral and/or intraocular delivery of these drugs by facilitating their transport across lipophilic membranes. Accordingly in a thirteenth aspect the present invention consists in a compound of the following formula: in which X is a member of the cyclosporin family of drugs and is linked to Y via an hydroxyl group Y is a spacer group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5 B is H or CH 2 OR 3 R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are the same or different and are either hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or an acyl group derived from a fatty acid, with the proviso that at least one of R 1 , R 2 and R 3 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. In a fourteenth aspect the present invention consists in a compound of the following formula: XYAA n NHCH 2 CH 2 OR 4 in which X is a member of the cyclosporin family of drugs and is linked to Y via an hydroxyl group Y is a spacer group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5, and R 4 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. In a fifteenth aspect the present invention consists in a method of prolonging or altering the activity of a member of the cyclosporin family of drugs comprising administering the compound in the form: in which X is a member of the cyclosporin family of drugs and is linked to Y via an hydroxyl group Y is a linker group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5 B is H or CH 2 OR, R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are the same or different and are either hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or an acyl group derived from a fatty acid, with the proviso that at least one of R 1 , R 2 and R 3 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. In a sixteenth aspect the present invention consists in a method of prolonging or altering the activity of a member of the cyclosporin family of drugs comprising administering the compound in the form: XYAA n NHCH 2 CH 2 OR 4 in which X is a member of the cyclosporin family of drugs or related cyclopeptide and is linked to Y via an hydroxyl group Y is a spacer group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5, and R 4 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. Where X is a member of the cyclosporin family of drugs it may be linked to Y via the invariant hydroxyl moiety of the family or the hydroxyl group of the threonine side-chain of cyclosporin C. Alternatively, as opposed to linking solely via an hydroxyl, specific new analogues could be produced with a range of reactive side chains at this position. The fatty acid may be saturated or unsaturated. Linkers Y to join compounds with an hydroxyl group to the amino group of Tris (when B is CH 2 OR 3 ) or the intervening amino acid (AA, if present) useful in the present invention include: a) a linker with a carboxyl group to the compound and a carboxyl group to the Tris (or amino acid if present) such as a dicarboxylic acid via the anhydride eg succinic anhydride, maleic anhydride. b) a linker with a carboxyl group to the compound and an aldehyde group to the Tris (or amino acid if present) such as glyoxylic acid (in the presence of a reducing agent eg NaBH 4 ). c) a linker with a carboxyl group to the compound and an halide group to the Tris (or amino acid if present) such as chloroacetic acid. d) a linker with a carboxyl group to the compound and a NCO group to the Tris (or amino acid if present) such as ethylisocyanatoacetate. It is preferred that X is a member of the cyclosporin family, preferably cyclosporin C. It is also preferred that Y is a dicarboxylic acid and AA is not present or is glycine or alanine. As stated above R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are either hydrogen or an acyl group of a fatty acid. It is also be clear to those skilled in the art that substitutions other than methyl or ethyl are possible at R 1 , R 2 and R 3 . The prime requirement is that at least one of R 1 , R 2 and R 3 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. When R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are acyl groups of fatty acids it is preferred that they are the same group.

The present invention also provides therapeutic compositions comprising the compound of the thirteenth or fourteenth aspect of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The composition may further include an unconjugated member of the cyclosporin family of drugs or related cyclopeptides. The therapeutic composition may be administered by any appropriate route as will be recognised by those skilled in the art. Such routes include oral, transdermal, intranasal, parenteral and intraocular. 5. Folate Antagonists Including Methtrexate, Folic Acid Folic Acid and Folic Acid Analogues Methotrexate, an anti-metabolite drug, is an example of the folate antagonist family of drugs. It acts to reduce the proliferation of new cells by acting as a competitive inhibitor of folic acid reductase thereby preventing the conversion of the vitamin folic acid to its active form, folinic acid. methotrexate is prescribed for the treatment of cancers and is also used to reduce the proliferation of epithelial cells for treatment of psoriasis that is unresponsive to other forms of treatment. Low dose methotrexate is found to be effective in arresting the progress and relieving the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis presumably by inhibition of the inflammatory cell response. The present inventors have shown that members of the methotrexate family can be linked to one to three acyl derivatives of fatty acids. It is believed that such new compounds will improve the delivery, uptake, persistence in the intraarticular regions, half-life and/or mode of delivery and distribution into the CNS of these drugs. Further it is believed that these novel compounds will aid in their oral, intranasal, transdermal, intratumoural, parenteral, intraarticular and/or intraocular delivery.

Catecholamine Precursors and Catecholamines DOPA is a precursor of the catecholamines, an important pharmacologically active group of compounds including adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine; the neurotransmitter amines which act as adrenergic stimulants and vasopressor agents. DOPA and analogues (hereafter termed the DOPA family) diminishes akinesia in Parkinsons disease, probably acting to elevate dopamine levels in the brain. The present inventors have shown that DOPA can be linked to one to three acyl derivatives of fatty acids. It is believed that such new compounds will improve the delivery of DOPA across the gastrointestinal tract and the blood-brain barrier and improve its half-life.

HPLC analysis indicated the title products to be of high purity, free from parent drug and other derivatives. EXAMPLE 3 Synthesis of Morphine-Suc-Gly-Tris-Di and Tripalmitate The present inventors have demonstrated that the phenolic hydroxy group at the C-3 position of morphine (Mor) can be successfully coupled with Gly-Tris-Dipalmitate or Gly-Tris-Tripalmitate via a succinic acid (Suc) linker, without protection of the secondary hydroxy group at the C-6 position. The synthesis of Mor-Suc-Gly-Tris-Dipalmitate involved two steps with a 54% overall yield. I. Preparation of Morphine-Succinate Triethylamine (9.584 ml, 69.45 mmol) was added dropwise to a suspension of morphine sulphate (9.286 g, 27.78 mmol) in dry DMF (140 ml) at 0 C. under nitrogen. After stirring for ten minutes, succinic anhydride (2.781 g, 27.78 mmol) was added portionwise to the reaction. The reaction was monitored by TLC (50% EtOH/H 2 O) and by analytical HPLC (R t I of Mor-Suc was 5.06). The reaction was complete in 24 to 48 h and the product precipitated out. The precipitate was filtered and washed with a small volume of cold DMF and THF. Both 1 H NMR and HPLC indicated that the product was of sufficient purity for the next reaction (Mor-Suc 6.11 g; 57% yield). Preliminary 1 H NMR indicated that succinylation occurred at the phenolic hydroxyl at the C-3 position. II. Preparation of Morphine-Suc-Gly-Tris-Dipalmitate General procedure of preparation of Mor-Suc-Gly-Tris-(Palmitate) n To the suspension of Mor-Suc (0.860 g, 2.23 mmol) in dry THF (44 ml) at 0 C. under nitrogen, was added DCC (0.506 g, 2.45 mmol) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (0.308 g, 2.68 mmol). The resulting mixture was slowly warmed to room temperature, then refluxed overnight. The reaction was monitored by HPLC (System I); retention time of the active ester, Mor-Suc-OSu. was 5.45 min. After the reaction was completed, the mixture was cooled to 0 C. and the precipitate filtered off and washed with dry DCM. The filtrate was added directly to Gly-Tris-Dipalmitate (1.459 g, 2.23 mmol) at room temperature with vigorous stirring. The aminolysis of Mor-Suc-OSu was monitored by HPLC (System II) and TLC (10% MeOH/DCM). Both HPLC and TLC showed that the reaction was complete after stirring overnight. The solvent was removed under vacuum and the residue redissolved in DCMI and washed with water several times until the pH equalled 7 The organic phase was dried (MgSO 4 ) and evaporated to afford a light yellow solid. The crude product was purified by the flash chromatography (silica, 10% MeOH/DCM) which gave the title compound (2.16 g) in excellent yield, (94.7% ). III Preparation of Morphine-Suc-Gly-Tris Tripalmitate Following the general procedure set out above Mor-Suc (0.101 g, 0.26 mmol) was successfully coupled with GTP 3 to give Mor-Suc-GTP 3 (0.215 g) in 65.6% isolated yield. The product was purified by flash chromatography on alumina with 10% MeOH/EtOAc elution. By HPLC (System II) both Mor-Suc-GTP 2 and Mor-Suc-GTP 3 were of high purity and free from parent drug. EXAMPLE 4 Synthesis of AZT-Gly-Tris-(Palmitate) n ; where n1, 2 or 3 Synthesis Scheme Overview AZT was reacted with succinic anhydride to form AZT-succinic acid. This was reacted by the DCC/HOSu method with a mixture of Gly-Tris-Mono, Di and Tripalmitate (GTP n ) which was prepared by catalytic hydrogenation of Z-GTP n . Column chromatography on silica gel and preparative HPLC were used to isolate the final compounds: I. AZT-Succinic Acid AZT (1.068 g, 4 mmol), succinic anhydride (0.440 g, 4.4 mmol) and DMAP (0.015 g) were weighed into a 25 ml flask fitted with a condenser. DMF (10 ml) was added and the mixture stirred for 5 min and immersed into an oil bath preheated to 90 C. for 1.5 h until HPLC assay indicated completion of reaction. DMF was evaporated under vacuum (40 C.) and the residue used directly for the subsequent reaction. The residue can be purified by chromatography on silica gel and the product isolated in 87% yield and 97% purity if required. II. AZT-Suc-Gly-Tris-(Palmitates) n : where n1, 2 and 3 AZT-Succinic acid (1.468 g, 4 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (30 ml) and HOSu (0.552 g, 4.8 mmol) added. The mixture was stirred for 5 min, then DCC (0.988 g, 4.8 mmol) was added in one portion. Stirring was continued for 1 hr until HPLC analysis indicated completion of the reaction. The reaction mixture was filtered and the insoluble DCU washed with DCM (35 ml). The combined filtrate was collected in a reaction vessel, then GTP n (2.5 g) added and stirred overnight. The reaction was monitored by HPLC. Extra GTP n was added until all the active OSu ester was consumed. The reaction mixture was evaporated in vacuo. The product was purified by column chromatography on silica using hexane/ethyl acetate and ethyl acetate/methanol as eluent to separate the AZT-Suc-Gly-Tris Mono, Di and Tripalmitates. The products were further purified by preparative HPLC (C18 column). EXAMPLE 5 Method One for the Preparation of Cyclosporin-Suc-Gly-Tris-(Palmitate) n ; where n1, 2 or 3 I. Cyclosporin-Suc The title compound can be prepared from cyclosporins A, B, D, and G by their reaction with succinic anhydride in the presence of triethylamine in DMF. The threonine side chain in cyclosporin C would require prior protection before carrying out this reaction. II. Cyclosporin-Suc-Gly-TRIS The title compound can be prepared by the reaction of cyclosporin-Suc with Gly-Tris in the presence of DCC and HOSu. III. Cyclosporin-Suc-Gly-TRIS mono, di and tripalmitates The title compounds can be prepared by the reaction of cyclosporin-Suc-Gly-Tris with palmitic acid at a molar ratio of 1 to 2 in the presence of DCC. The three title compounds can then be separated by preparative HPLC or via silica gel chromatography with elution by organic solvents. With cyclosporin C the side chain protection would be removed prior to purification. Method Two for the Preparation of Cyclosporin-Suc-Gly-Tris-(Palmitate) n ; where n1, 2 or 3 I. Preparation of the Benzyl Ester of Suc-Gly-Tris-TriOTBDMS Suc-mono benzyl ester can be prepared by the reaction of succinic anhydride with benzyl alcohol in the presence of strong base. The remaining unmodified carboxyl group can then be reacted with Gly-Tris in the presence of DCC and HOSu to give Bzl-Suc-Gly-Tris. The three hydroxyl groups of Tris can then be protected by reaction with TBDMS chloride in the presence of imidazole to give the title compound. II. Cyclosporin-Suc-Gly-Tris-Mono, Di and Tripalmitates The benzyl ester of Bzl-Suc-Gly-Tris-TriOTBDMS can be removed using hydrogen in the presence of palladium on carbon to generate an unprotected carboxyl group which can be reacted with the hydroxyl group of cyclosporin (A, B, D, and G; as above side chain protection would be required for cyclosporin C) in the presence of DCC to generate an ester bond. The three TBDMS protected hydroxyls of Tris in this compound can be deprotected by the action of acetic acid and reacted with palmitic acid in the presence of DCC to give a mixture of the title compounds. The three title compounds can then be separated by preparative HFLC or via silica gel chromatography. EXAMPLE 6 Synthesis of Methotrexate-Gly-Tris-Di and Tripalmitate Synthesis Scheme Overview The method devised involved removal of the glutamyl moiety of methotrexate (MTX) by enzymatic cleavage with Carboxypeptidase G and replacing it with glutamic acid which had its two carboxyl groups selectively esterified (-tertbutyl; -methyl). Selective removal of the methyl ester then provided the site for the attachment of Gly-Tris which was subsequently palmitylated and the dipalmitate derivative (and a small amount of the tripalmitate) were isolated by silica chromatography and/or extraction. I. (2,4-Diamino-6-Pteridinyl) MethylMethyl AminoBenzoic Acid The title compound was prepared by carboxypeptidase G cleavage of glutamic acid from methotrexate as described in the literature (J. Med. Chem. 24, 1450-1455 (1981)). The yield of I obtained was virtually quantitative. II. -tertButyl -Methyl L-Glutamate The title compound was prepared from -methyl L-glutamate according to the literature (Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. 646, 134 (1961)). Yields were highly variable but typically in the 30-50% range. Compound II, obtained as an oil was used immediately in subsequent coupling reactions. III. -tertButyl -Methyl Methotrexate The title compound was prepared from I and II according to the literature J. Med. Chem. 24, 1450-1455, (1981). Yields were typically 50-60%. IV. -tertButyl Methotrexate The title compound was prepared by Ba(OH) 2 hydrolysis of III according to the literature J. Med. Chem. 24, 1450-1455 (1981). Compound IV was typically obtained sufficiently pure not to require purification by ion exchange chromatography as evidenced by 1 H NMR. Yields were typically in the 75-80% range. V. Methotrexate--tertButyl -Gly-Tris To IV (100 mg, 0.20 mmol) in DMF/acetonitrile (1:1, 6 ml) was added HOSu (21 mg, 0.22 mmol) followed by DCC (45 mg, 0.22 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature and monitored by HPLC (System I). Preparation of the OSu ester was 85% complete after 5 h with HPLC analysis indicating the remainder to be IV along with some decomposition products. A solution of Gly-Tris (prepared by hydrogenation of Z-Gly Tris in DMF over 10% Pd/C (1.5 eq. in 3 ml DMF)) was added and the reaction followed by HPLC. The reaction was complete within 30-60 min. The reaction mixture was then diluted with H 2 O (3-5 ml), allowed to stand for 10 min and the DCU filtered off. Solvent was removed from the filtrate, and the residue purified via preparative HPLC to afford the title compound as a bright yellow solid after removal of solvent by freeze drying. Yield30 mg, 23%. On a larger scale using 800 mg of IV a 69% yield of V was obtained. HPLC indicated the purity of the product to be 97%. VI. Methotrexate -tertButyl Ester -Gly-Tris (palmitate) n ; where n2 or 3 To a suspension of V (650 mg, 0.97 mmol) in DCM (50 ml) was added sufficient DMF to affect solubilisation (5-10 ml), followed by DMAP (30 mg), palmitic acid (500 mg, 2 eq.) and DCC (400 mg, 2 eq.). The mixture was stirred at RT for 36 hrs after which time it was diluted with DCM (80 ml) and chilled in ice for 10 min. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate extracted with 0.01M HCl (100 ml) followed by brine (2100 ml). After drying (MgSO 4 ) and removal of solvent, the residue was applied to a silica column and eluted consequently with DCM. DCM/5% MeOH, DCM/10% MeOH which afforded the Tri and Dipalmitates of VI as yellow bands which bled off the column. Fractions which were pure by TLC (DCM/isopropanol(30% )) were combined and solvent removed to afford the title compounds as bright yellow solids. VII. Methotrexate--Gly-Tris-Dipalmitate To VI (200 mg, 0.17 mmol) was added TFA (5 ml). The mixture was stirred at RT for 20-30 min upon which time solvent was removed by evaporation. The residue was partitioned between DCM (50 ml) and H 2 O (50 ml), TEA was added to the aqueous phase until the pH was 7. Upon this time acetic acid was added until the pH reached 3-4. The organic phase was collected and washed with H 2 O (50 ml), dried (Na 2 SO 4 ) and solvent removed. The product, which was pure by TLC (butanol/acetic acid/water, 4:2:1), was washed with ethanol and dried to afford the title product as a golden solid. EXAMPLE 7 Synthesis of L-DOPA-Gly-Tris-(palmitate) n : where n1, 2 or 3 Synthesis Scheme Overview The two phenolic hydroxyl groups of DOPA, as well as the amino group were protected and the active ester of Z 3 -DOPA prepared. The formation of active ester of the fully protected compound was best using TPTU probably due to the structurally hindered nature of this compound. This was reacted with Gly-Tris-Dipalmitate to give Z 3 -DOPA -Gly-Tris-Dipalmitate. An alternative synthesis was by palmitylation of Z 3 -DOPA-Gly-Tris (prepared from Z 3 -DOPA and Gly-Tris via the active ester method). Hydrogenation of these products yielded the desired DOPA-Gly-Tris-Dipalmitate and DOPA-Gly-Tris-Tripalmitate in good yields. I. N,OO-Tricarbobenzoxy-L-DOPA (Z 3 -Dopa) The method for the preparation of Z 3 -DOPA was that of Felix et al. 1974 J. Med. Chem. 17, 422-426. The title compound was synthesised by adding L-DOPA (7 g, 35.5 mmol) to a pre-cooled solution of 1M NaOH (35.5 ml) and water (74 ml) at 10 C. under a blanket of nitrogen in a 3-neck flask. The solution was stirred vigorously, whilst 1M NaOH (100 ml) and a solution of carbobenzoxy chloride (20.2 g, 116.5 mmol) in diethyl ether (100 ml) were added dropwise, simultaneously, over a period of 1 h at 10 C. Stirring was continued at 10 C. for 1 h, then 1 h at 0 C. and finally at 20 C. for 2 h. The precipitated sodium salts were collected by filtration, washed with diethyl ether and water and partitioned between diethyl ether and 1M citric acid (100 ml each). The ether layer was washed with water, dried (Na 2 SO 4 ) and the solvent removed in vacuo to give the crude title product as an oil (18 g, 84.6% yield). Further purification of the title product by preparative HPLC (Reverse phase C18 column) gave chromatographically pure title product, R t II 4.77. II. Z 3 -DOPA-Gly-Tris-Dipalmitate The active ester of Z 3 -DOPA was prepared by adding a solution of TPTU (1.68 g, 5.62 mmol) in acetonitrile (30 ml) to a stirred solution of Z 3 -DOPA (1.68 g, 2.8 mmol) in acetonitrile (20 ml) and DIEA (550 ul to pH 8.50). The reaction was followed by HPLC and monitored at 300 nm. After 10 min the reaction was complete and the solvent and base evaporated in vacuo. The residue was redissolved in DCM, re-evaporated, and the procedure repeated twice to ensure the complete removal of base. A solution of the residue in DCM (30 ml) was added to a stirred solution of GTP 2 (2.0 g, 3 mmol) in DCM (15 ml) in an atmosphere of nitrogen in the dark. HPLC, monitored at 260 nm. showed, that the reaction was complete in 30 min to give a single product. The reaction mixture was diluted with DCM (120 ml), washed with water (3120 ml) and dried (Na 2 SO 4 ). The DCM layer contained the desired title product which gave a single peak on HPLC (R t II 8.70). The solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue repeatedly washed with cold acetonitrile to give the title product as a white fluffy precipitate, 3.40 g, in 98% yield. HPLC, TLC and NMR spectroscopy showed that the title product was of high purity. Hydrogenation of an aliquot of the above product in ethanol in the presence of catalytic amounts of 10% palladium on carbon for 5 h gave L-DOPA-GTP 2 , R t II 8.05 with an absorption max at 285 nm. Yield was 785 mg, 83.5%. Analysis by HPLC indicated that the title product was 99% pure, free from the parent drug. III. Preparation of Z 3 -DOPA-Gly-Tris A solution of Z 3 -DOPA (800 mg, 1.33 mmol) in dry acetonitrile (10 ml) was reacted with a solution of TPTU (1 g, 3.4 mmol) in acetonitrile (5 ml) and DIEA (350 ul, to pH 8.3) and the formation of active ester monitored by HPLC in System II at 300 nm. The reaction was complete in 10 min to give the active ester in 89% yield by HPLC, R t II 5.19. Repeated evaporation of the solvent and DIEA from DCM gave an oily residue, which was redissolved in acetonitrile (15 ml) and added dropwise to a solution of Gly-Tris (1 g, 5.6 mmol) in freshly distilled, dry DMF (5 ml) with stirring. The reaction was monitored by HPLC at 300 nm and at 260 nm which showed the formation of the title product in both HPLC systems, I and II (Rt 7.11 and 3.05 respectively). The solvents were removed in vacuo and the title product purified by preparative HPLC to give 655 mg of Z 3 -DOPA-Gly-Tris (60.4% yield). The structure of the product was confirmed by NMR Spectroscopy. IV. Z 3 -DOPA-Gly-Tris-Di and Tripalmitate A solution of Z 3 -DOPA-Gly-Tris (600 mg, 1 mmol) in DCM (10 ml) was reacted with palmitic acid (312 mg, 1.22 mmol) and DCC (250 mg, 1.2 mmol) as described above. The reaction was followed by HPLC with additional palmitic acid added in 10 mg aliquots as required. After addition of a further 40 mg of palmitic acid, Z 3 -DOPA-Gly-Tris-Mono and Dipalmitate were formed in a 1:1 ratio as determined by HPLC. After removal of DCU by filtration, the solvent was removed in vacuo and the mixture separated by preparative HPLC using a C18 column. During the workup procedure, most of the product converted to the Di- and the Tripalmitate forms, which were separated to give 260 mg of dipalmitate and 520 mg of tripalmitate, calculated on the percentages shown by HPLC traces of the mixture (21% P 2 ; 35% P 3 ). L-DOPA-GTP 2 and GTP 3 were obtained by hydrogenation in ethanol in the presence of Pd/C catalyst to give the desired title products. EXAMPLE 8 Synthesis of Chlorambucil-Gly-Tris-(Palmitate) n ; where n1, 2 or 3 The title compounds were formed by preparing the active ester of chlorambucil and reacting this with a mixture of Gly-Tris Mono, Di and Tripalmitate (GTP n ) produced by hydrogenation of Z-GTP n . The resulting products were purified by column chromatography and preparative HPLC. I. Chlorambucil-Gly-Tris-(Palmitate) n ; where n1, 2 or 3 Chlorambucil (0.913 g, 3 mmol) and HOSu (414 mg, 3.6 mmol) were weighed into a 50 ml flask with a magnetic stirring bar. DCM (15 ml) was added and the solution stirred for 5 min. DCC (742 mg, 3.6 mmol) in DCM (15 ml) was added within 5 minutes. Analytical HPLC indicated completion of reaction after 1 h. The solution was filtered and the residue rinsed with DCM (10 ml). The combined filtrate was collected in a flask, stirred and solid GTP n (4 g) added. Stirring was continued overnight and fresh GTP n added (300 mg). HPLC after 2 h showed the absence of the chlorambucil-OSu ester indicating the completion of the reaction. The mixture was evaporated under vacuum (40 C.). The product was chromatographed over silica gel using hexane: ethyl acetate followed by preparative HPLC to generate high purity products. II. Chlorambucil-Gly-Tris-Monopalmitate To a solution of chlorambucil (0.972, 3.2 mmol) in DCM (32 ml) was added DCC (0.726 g, 3.5 mmol) and HOSu (0.387 g, 3.3 mmol) portionwise at 0 C. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. After the completion of the reaction according to HPLC (System I), the precipitate (DCU) was filtered and washed with dry DCM (10 ml). To the filtrate was added Gly-Tris-Monopalmitate (1.208 g, 2.9 mmol) portionwise with vigorously stirring at rt overnight. When the reaction was completed, the resulting mixture was diluted with DCM, then washed with H 2 O several times. The organic phase was dried (MgSO 4 ) and evaporated in vacuo to afford the crude product. The crude product was purified by the flash chromatography (80% ethyl acetate/hexane, 2.5% MeOH/ethyl acetate) to give the title compound (0.950 g) as light yellow semi solid in 46.6% yield. III. Chlorambucil-Gly-Tris-Tripalmitate To a solution of chlorambucil (0.240 g, 0.789 mmol) in DCM (16 ml) at 0 C. was added DCC (0.171 g, 0.828 mmol) and DMAP (0.005 g, 0.039 mmol), followed by the Gly-Tris-Tripalmitate (0.740 g, 0.828 mmol). The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The precipitate was filtered and the filtrate washed with 5% acetic acid aqueous solution, then H 2 O three times until the pH was 7. The organic phase was dried (MgSO 4 ), then concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by the flash chromatography (30% , 40% ethyl acetate/hexane), then recrystallized from ethyl acetate/hexane to give the title compound (0.45 g) as a white solid in 48.2% yield. EXAMPLE 9 Anti-inflammatory Effect of Hydrocortisone and Hydrocortisone Fatty Acid Conjugates in the UVB Model Drugs Used Hydrocortisone was purchased from Sigma Chemicals, Lot no. 13H0525, H-4001. Hydrocortisone-Suc-GTP 2 , and Hydrocortisone-Suc-GTP 3 and 17b Hydrocortisone Suc-GTP 3 were synthesised as described above. UVB Erythema Assay A strain of i/b Skh-1 hairless albino female mice not previously exposed to UVB were used in all experiments. The average age was 12 weeks and the mice were boxed in groups of three (Average weight 30 g). An FS40 light source with one UVB tube was used to induce the erythema (inflammation). The mice were exposed to 15 minutes of UVB equivalent to an exposure of 2 MED (minimum erythema dose). The irradiated mice were given either a post-irradiation treatment or were pretreated several days prior to UVB exposure by evenly dispersing 100 ls of a solution of the Hydrocortisone, Hydrocortisone-Suc-GTP 2 , or Hydrocortisone-Suc-GTP 3 , in ethanol (vehicle), onto the backs of mice using a Gilson pipettor. The mice were left for 24 hours and the skin fold measurements taken using a hand held micrometer. Experimental As an initial part of the study we examined the effect of Hydrocortisone on UVB induced inflammation. A group of Skh-1 mice were irradiated with 2 MED of UVB and then painted topically with Hydrocortisone in ethanol. The net skin fold thickness increase (NSFT) was determined after 24 h. The concentration curve carried out determined the optimal dose of Hydrocortisone required to give the best anti-inflammatory protection from an exposure of 2 MED of UVB. A dose of 0.5 mg/mouse gave almost 100% protection from erythema and oedema, this was used in subsequent experiments examining the effects of Hydrocortisone conjugates. Hydrocortisone-succinate Fatty Acid Conjugates and their Protection Against UVB Induced Oedema The longevity of topically applied Hydrocortisone-Succinate fatty acid conjugates was examined. Hydrocortisone concentrations of 0.5% and 1% w/v were used (equivalent to 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg/mouse respectively) and the results are presented below. The test conjugates were applied 5 and 3 days prior to UV exposure. At day 0 the conjugates were applied after UV exposure to avoid the possibility of UV absorption (sunscreen effect). Results of the 0.5 mg/mouse experiments are given in Table 1.

Results The three forms of the Hydrocortisone-succinate conjugates, Hydrocortisone-Suc-Gly-Tris-Dipalmitate (HC-Suc-GTP 2 ), Hydrocortisone-Suc-Gly-Tris-Tripalmitate (HC-Suc-GTP 3 ) and 17-b HC-Suc-GTP 3 had activity equivalent to approximately 50% of the hydrocortisone activity in protecting against UVB induced oedema when applied at Day 0, post UVB exposure. It was also observed that when the conjugates were applied to the mouse skin three days before UVB exposure there was still a protective effect present with both conjugates and this appeared to be slightly better than Hydrocortisone alone. There was a smoothing (delay) of the response with the conjugates indicating an altered delivery profile. At the higher concentration of 1 mg/mouse the protective effects of the Hydrocortisone conjugates was enhanced (Table 2) with greater protection with all test compounds at Day-3. Once again there was a delay in the action of the hydrocortisone conjugates suggesting a more sustained, even delivery profile.

Conclusions The efficacy of Hydrocortisone-succinate fatty acid conjugates was determined in a mouse UVB model of inflammation. The overall biological findings are that the fatty acid conjugated forms of Hydrocortisone synthesised are similar to Hydrocortisone in their biological action as measured by their protection against UVB induced erythema and oedema. Importantly, the fatty acid conjugates appear to have an altered profile of delivery to the epidermis, suggested by the delay in full activity at Day 0. The results indicate that there may be some advantage in using fatty acid conjugated molecules over Hydrocortisone in respect to improved compartmentalisation with transdermal delivery. This altered delivery may also reduce the side effects brought about by the down regulation of the H-P-A axis through prolonged use of Hydrocortisone. EXAMPLE 10 Contact Hypersensitivity Assay The assay used the method described in Current Protocols in Immunology (Vol 1, Section 4.2 Eds Coligan et al. (1991) NIH). The sensitiser was Oxazalone. Briefly this method was as follows: UVB Radiation. Mice were irradiated with a single FL40SE UVB fluorescent tube (Oliphant) in a reflective batten, providing 2.6104 W/cm 2 UVB radiation measured at target distance using an International Light IL1700 radiometer with a UVB detector sensitive between 250-315 nm. The mice received 0.1179 J/cm 2 UVB radiation, constituting 1 minimal erythemal dose (MED) as previously ascertained, on each of 3 consecutive days, being exposed unrestrained with the wire cage tops removed. The cumulative dose resulted in a moderate non-blistering erythema. The erythema was quantitated as the oedema component of this reaction by measuring the mid-dorsal skinfold thickness with a spring micrometer (Mercer, St. Albans. UK) at 24 h after the first UVB exposure, i.e. immediately prior to the third UVB exposure, at which time the reaction was found to be maximal. Induction of Systemic Contact Hypersensitivity. Test mice were exposed on the dorsum to 1 NIED UVB radiation (or no UVB radiation) at the same hour on days 1, 2 and 3. On days 8 and 9, the mice (irradiated and non-irradiated) were sensitized by topical application to the abdominal skin of 0.1 ml of 3% (w/v) oxazolone (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, Mo.) freshly prepared in ethanol. On day 15, the pre-challenge ear thickness was measured using the spring micrometer, and the mice were then challenged by the application of 5 ul freshly prepared 3% oxazolone/ethanol solution to both surfaces of each pinna. Ear thickness was again measured repeatedly between 16-24 hours, and the maximum ear thickness was recorded. The net ear swelling was calculated as the difference between the average pre-challenge and the average post-challenge ear thickness for each treatment group. Statistical significance of the differences in net ear swelling between treatment groups was assessed with Students t test. The mice were painted with vehicle, 0.5 mg/mouse HC, 0.5 mg/mouse HC-Suc-GTP 2 , 1 mg/mouse 17-b HC-Suc-GTP 3 or 17-b HC within 10 minutes post UVB exposure. A total of 3 MED of unshielded UVB was used. (Table 3) TABLE 3 Contact Hypersensitivity Results Test Material Net Ear Swelling (10 2 mm) Std. Dev.

There appeared to be no difference between the parent drugs or the conjugates in their ability to alter the immunosuppression due to UVB. Importantly however is that the conjugates appear to be just as active as the parent drugs in producing a systemic response. EXAMPLE 11 AZT The biological activities of AZT and AZT-fatty acid conjugates were tested for cytotoxicity and anti-HIV activity. I. Cytotoxicity The cytotoxicity of AZT and AZT-fatty acid conjugates (AZT-Suc-GTP 1 , P 2 and P 3 ) was tested in vitro with JURKAT (acute T cell human leukemia) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Cells were incubated with drug and viability was determined by a colorimetric proliferation test. Methods a) Cell culture Conditions JURKAT cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1.610 4 cells /200 ul complete RPMI 1640 mediumdrug and cultured for 64 h. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from three healthy donors by centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia). Cells were seeded into a 96-well plates at a density of 210 5 cells/200 ul complete RPMIdrug and cultured for 40 h. b) Drug delivery Drugs were dissolved in ethanol and added to culture media. The final concentration of ethanol in media was no greater than 1% (v/v). c) Viability assay Viability was determined using the MTS assay (CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay) from Promega. Reagent (40 ul) was added to each well and absorbance values at 490 nm were determined 1 to 4 h later. The effect of drug on cell viability was compared to cultures set up containing no drug (100% viability). Wells containing no cells were used to control for background absorbance (0% viability). Each concentration was tested in at least 3 wells. Concentrations necessary to cause a 50% inhibition of cellular growth of control cells (IC50) were calculated by linear regression. Results AZT-Suc-GTP 1 was 40 times more cytotoxic to JURKAT cells than the parent drug (Table 4). The conjugate was also more cytotoxic to PBMC than AZT. TABLE 4 Cytotoxicity of AZT and AZT-Suc-GTP 1 to PBMC and JURKAT cells. Cell Type Compound IC 50 (uM) JURKAT AZT 1720.8 AZT-Suc-GTP 1 43.0 PBMC AZT 105 AZT-Suc-GTP 1 26.7 II. Anti HIV Activity The anti-HIV activities of AZT-Suc-GTP 1 and AZT-Suc-GTP 2 were also tested. Infected cells were incubated for 5 days with compound. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and 5-fold dilutions were used. The following parameters were measured: syncytia formation, virus antigen gp120 production, cell survival. Cytotoxicity is also measured in uninfected cells. Two cell lines were used: C8166 (human T-lymphoblastoid cells) infected with HIV-I MN JM (semi mature human T-cell from lymphoblastoid leukemia) infected with HIV-I U4550 AZT is poorly active in JM cells possibly due to insufficient phosphorylation and was used to confirm the mode of action of compounds. Results TABLE 5 Effect of AZT-Suc-GTP 1 , AZT-Suc-GTP 2 , AZT and ddI on cellular growth and HIV infection (Ag gp120 production) in JM and C8166 cells.

IC 50 concentration of drug which reduces cell growth by 50%. The AZT-Suc-GTP 1 conjugate was 50-fold more cytotoxic to both cell lines than AZT (Table 5); this is consistent with the findings with PBMC and JURKAT cells (Table 4). Cytotoxicity of the P 2 conjugate was also observed with JM and C8156 cells (25-fold more cytotoxic than AZT). TABLE 6 Ratios of AZT: Conjugate EC 50 (Data from Table 5). Cell Line AZT:AZT-SUC-GTP 1 AZT:AZT-Suc-GTP 2 JM 12.5 approx. 0.5 C8166 1.3 0.5 The virus in the JM cell line was 12.5-fold more susceptible to AZT-Suc-GTP 1 than AZT (Table 6). This increase in toxicity towards the virus was not reflected in the pattern of HIV infection: svncytia formation or infected cell growth profiles; the effect is only observed with the detection of antigen. The JM cell line does not metabolise AZT to the same extent as C8166 cells but greater delivery of AZT via the P 1 conjugate may result in higher levels of the triphosphate being formed in the cells. Discussion AZT-Suc-GTP 1 was more cytotoxic than AZT to PBMC, JURKAT, C8166 and JM cells suggesting increased cellular uptake. Cellular kinases convert AZT to AZT-triphosphate, which inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) and at 100-fold higher concentrations inhibits cellular -DNA polymerase. It appears that conjugation increases cell uptake, thus increasing cytoxicity (Table 5). In infected JM cells, AZT-Suc-GTP 1 was more potent in reducing amounts of Ag gp 120 produced by HIV, however because of the cytotoxic nature of this compound cells did not recover and exhibit normal growth. These are very positive results in that they are consistent with the conjugates being taken up by the cells and being metabolised to release AZT to act in the usual manner. Their cytotoxicity (which may have beneficial effects if targeted), while above that of unmodified AZT, is at a low enough level to allow their use. These findings may allow some of the major limitations of current AZT therapy, namely its rapid clearance, poor bio-availability and its poor delivery to the lymphatic system which is the primary site of virus load, to be addressed. Quoting Charman and Porter (1996 Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews in press) the major opportunities associated with lipophilic prodrugs are the potential for (i) by-passing hepatic first pass metabolism after oral dosing, and (ii) targeting drugs to the lymphatic system. Additionally the lipophilic prodrug such as our AZT-Suc-GTP 1 should act to give a sustained release profile. These features should result in lower overall doses of AZT being required with the possibility of lessened side effects in spite of the overall general more cytotoxic nature of the conjugates compare with AZT. EXAMPLE 12 Chlorambucil The cytotoxicity of chlorambucil and chlorambucil fatty acid conjugates (CGTP 1 , P 2 and P 3 ) were tested in vitro with JURKAT cells (acute T cell human leukemia). Cells were incubated with drug and viability was determined by a colourmetric proliferation test. Cytotoxicity towards other cells lines was also tested (PC3 human prostate cancer cells, B16 mouse melanoma cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells). Methods a) Cell culture Conditions JURKAT cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1.610 4 cells /200 l complete RPMIdrug and cultured for 64 h. A 1:3 split of confluent PC3 cells in a 75 cm 2 flask were seeded into a 96-well plate and cultured for 48 h in complete RPMI. Media was removed and complete RPMIdrug was added to wells. Cells were further cultured for 72 h. A 1:8 split of confluent B16 cells in a 75 cm 2 flask were seeded into a 96-well plate and cultured for 48 h in complete EMEM. Media was removed and complete EMEMdrug was added to wells. Cells were further cultured for 48 h. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from one healthy donor by centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia). Cells were seeded into a 96-well plates at a density of 210 5 cells/200 l complete RPMIdrug and cultured for 40 h. b) Drug delivery Two types of delivery were tested: i) Ethanol. Drugs were dissolved in ethanol and added to culture media. The final concentration of ethanol in media was no greater than 1% (v/v). This delivery was used for experiments with JURKAT, PBMC, PC3 and B16 cell types. ii) Coating of plates. Drugs were dissolved in ethanol and aliquots (up to 40 ul) were added to 90% o (v/v) isopropanol. Solution (50 ul) was then added to wells of a 96-well plate and the solvent evaporated by heating at 37 C. Mediacells was then added. This delivery was used for some experiments with JURKAT cells. c) Viability assay Viability was determined using the MTS assay (CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay) from Promega. Reagent (40 ul) was added to each well and absorbance values at 490 nm were determined 1 to 4 h later. The effect of drug on cell viability was compared to cultures set up containing no drug (100% viability). Wells containing no cells were used to control for background absorbance (0% viability). Each concentration was tested in at least 3 wells. Concentrations necessary to cause a 50% inhibition of cellular growth of control cells (IC50) were calculated by linear regression. Results a) Drug cytotoxicity CGTP 1 was more cytotoxic to all cell types tested than chlorambucil (Table 7). TABLE 7 Concentrations of Chlorambucil and CGTP 1 necessary to cause a 50% inhibition of the cellular growth of control cells (IC 50 ) in different cell types. IC 50 Chlorambucil to Cell Type Chlorambucil (uM) CGTP 1 (uM) CGTP 1 Ratio JURKAT 100.6 6.5 15.5 PC3 160.2 10.7 15.0 B16 365 23.1 1.6 PBMC (1) 450 7.1 6.3 PBMC (3) 22 5.5 approx. 4 ( ) number of donors from which PBMC isolated. A 15-fold increase in activity was observed with JURKAT cells. The increase in toxicity of CGTP 1 to normal cells (PBMC) was not as great (approximately 5-fold). JURKAT cells appear to be more resistant to chlorambucil than PBMC. CGTP 1 is cytotoxic to both cell types at similar concentrations. The GTP 1 conjugate was also more toxic to PC3 and B16 cell types. CGTP 1 was more cytotoxic to JURKAT cells than an equimolar mixture of chlorambucil and GTP 1 . GTP 1 had no activity. This indicates that conjugation of chlorambucil to GTP 1 is necessary for the increased cytotoxicity observed (Tables 7, 8, 9). b) Effect of vehicle Both vehicles (ethanol isopropanol) were not cytotoxic to cells in the dose range studied. Delivery of compounds by coating the plates increased IC50 values of chlorambucil and CGTP 1 (Table 8), however this method of delivery detected activity with CGTP 2 and CGTP 3 (Table 9) which was not observed when these compounds were delivered to cultures in ethanol. This effect may be due to the reduced solubility of the P 2 and P 3 conjugates in the aqueous in vitro tests.

CGTP 2 and CGTP 3 also showed improved cytotoxicity towards JURKAT cells. EXAMPLE 13 Morphine The biological activities of Morphine (Mo) and fatty acid conjugates were tested in an antinociceptive assay using mice. Various doses and duration of pain-killing effect of the drugs were examined. Methods Quackenbush Strain mice (male, 5-week-old, approximately 30 g live weight) were used for the experiments. Animals were given free access to food and water prior to and during the experiment. Animals were divided into groups of 12 and individually weighed. The mean weight for each group was calculated. Mice were then placed on a metal block heated to 50 C. and the time taken for the animals to show signs of discomfort was measured (baseline response; control). Mice were then injected intraperitoneally (ip) with various doses of Morphine or Morphine-fatty acid conjugate. Morphine was made up in a H 2 O solution and Morphine-fatty acids were made up in an emulsion containing 10% glycerylmonooleate, 21% Miglyol, 6% ethanol, 24% Tween 80 (33% ) and 39% H 2 O. 0.2 ml of appropriate solution was injected ip into each mouse. At different times after injection, responses on the heated plate were measured. In each experiment 3 doses of Morphine and Morphine-fatty acid and 2 time points were tested. A single mouse was used for each treatment and the entire experiment repeated at least 3 times. All responses of the animals were filmed, and in some cases mice behaviour was assessed by an independent panel who did not know what treatment the mice had received. Members of the panel were asked to score mice behaviour according to the following key: 0agitated mouse, distressed 1showing mild discomfort 2not agitated or uncomfortable but still alert 3placid, docile; not at all worried. Results from the panel were averaged. Coordination of mice after treatment was also assessed by placing treated animals on a Rotor-Rod at 1.6 rpm. The ability of animals to stay on the rod was assessed. Results Experiment 1. Effect of Morphine and Morphine-Suc-GTP 2 (5, 10 20 mg Morphine/kg) on Mice at 1 and 4 hr After Injection. Four replicates of this experiment were analysed by an analysis of variance. There was not significant difference between the different doses examined within drugs. However, when the results of the different doses of each drug were pooled, differences were found (Table 10). TABLE 10 Time responses and behaviour scores of mice 1 and 4 hr after ip injection of Morphine or Morphine-Suc-GTP 2 . Results presented are the mean SEM, 12 mice in each group. Time Response SEM Behaviour Score (sec) SEM Compound 1 hr 4 hr 1 hr 4 hr Morphine 32.7 2.74 28.2 2.74 2.46 1.93 0.166 0.166 Morphine-Suc-GTP 2 26.7 2.74 31.2 2.74 2.34 2.35 0.166 0.166 Results were analysed by an analysis of variance. p0.13 for the time responses; p0.11 for the behaviour scores. Both the time response and behaviour score data shows that Morphine-Suc-GTP 2 is having a longer lasting pain-killing effect than unconjugated morphine. Mice treated with Morphine-Suc-GTP 2 were also tested for coordination. At 1 and 4 hr after injection they were able to stay on the rotor-rod, as were morphine treated animals. This indicates that Miorphine-Suc-GTP 2 does not affect the coordination of the test animals and is producing a true pain-killing effect. Experiment 2. Time Course of Morphine and Morphine-Suc-GTP 1 Activity at 5 mg Mo/kg. A slow release of Morphine from Morphine-Suc-GTP 2 is indicated as there is little activity 1 hr after injection but an increase at 4 and 6 hr (Table 11). Morphine shows maximal activity at 1 hr and decreased with time. TABLE 11 Mean time response of mice 1, 4 and 6 after ip injection of morphine or Morphine-Suc-GTP 2 (5 mg Mo/kg).

Morphine-GTP 2 has a slow-release delivery profile and a longer lasting pain-killing effect than the parent drug, morphine. Morphine-Suc-GTP 3 displayed a similar effect. EXAMPLE 14 L-DOPA The biological activities of L-DOPA and L-DOPA-GTP 2 were tested in an animal model of Parkinsons disease, a condition caused by low levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. Mice were pretreated with reserpine which depletes dopamine and causes animals to become catatonic. The ability of L-DOPA and L-DOPA-GTP 2 to reverse this condition was measured. Methods Quackenbush Strain mice (male, 5-week-old, approximately 30 g live weight) were used for the experiments. Animals were given free access to food and water prior to and during the experiment. Mice were injected intraperitoneally (ip) with reserpine (5 mg/kg) and 4 hours later tested for catatonia. A mouse was judged to be catatonic if it was able to stay on a stopper of 4.5 cm diameter for 5 minutes. Catatonic animals were then injected ip with L-DOPA or L-DOPA-GTP 2 suspended in Miglyol (200-400 ul/mouse) immediately before use and observed. Results Experiment 1. Anti-Reserpine Activity of L-DOPA. After the administration of L-DOPA to catatonic mice, all animals became active when given doses of 364 mg/kg or higher (Table 13). The level of activity was high compared to normal mice. Animals had a jerky gait and show toxic effects of L-DOPA such as rearing, salivating and jumping. TABLE 13 Anti-reserpine activity of L-DOPA. remained catatonic; very active L-DOPA moiety Response at 15 min. (mg/kg) mouse 1 mouse 2 9.1 91 364 637 910 Experiment 2. Anti-Reserpine Activity of L-DOPA and L-DOPA-GTP 2 . L-DOPA caused catatonic mice to become very active (Table 14) as previously observed in Experiment 1. Animals which received miglyol only and low doses of L-DOPA-GTP 2 (9.1 and 91 mg DOPA/kg) did not recover. Mice which received higher doses of L-DOPA-GTP 2 (364 and 637 mg DOPA/kg) showed signs of recovery at 7 and 5 hr after administration, respectively. These animals moved slowly and sporadically and did not exhibit the high activity level and toxic effects that treatment with L-DOPA caused. These results indicate that L-DOPA-GTP 2 has the ability to form dopamine in catatonic mice brains. A slow release is suggested by the time taken for a response to occur and the nature of the response (slow movements at 5 to 8 hr versus over-active mouse at 20 minutes).

EXAMPLE 15 Tumour Cytotoxicity Model: Test of Methotrexate and Chlorambucil and their fatty acid conjugates: Protocol Groups of C57 black mice were given an initiation dose of 210 5 B16 melanoma cells as an intradermal injection. The cells were suspended in MEM without serum. The abdomen was clipped and 100 l of cellsMENM was injected. At 8-10 days after injection, spots of growing B16 tumours were seen at the injection site. The tumours were measured with a micrometer and photographed just prior to the injection of drug (day 8-10). The cytotoxic drugs and their fatty acid conjugates were dissolved or suspended in 4:1 soy bean oil:ethyl oleate. A 10 mg/ml or a 20 mg/ml solution of each parent drug or the fatty acid conjugate made to the same molar concentration as the parent drug was then injected into the same region as the tumour at a dose of 0.5 mg or 1 mg. The tumours were then photographed, measured and re-injected every two to three days.

All results are significant at the 95% level except that MTX is not significantly different from control. All others are sign, diff, from control but not from each other. The Results Show: 1. There was no significant difference between the Vehicle and the Methotrexate (MTX) treated mice. 2. There was a significant difference between the vehicle/MTX and the MXGTP 2 conjugates at the two different concentrations but there was no difference between the two conjugate groups. 3. There was a significant difference between the Vehicle and the chlorambucil, CGTP 2 (0.5 mg) and CGTP 2 (1.0 mg) groups. 4. There was no difference between the chlorambucil group and the two conjugate groups or these with each other. 5. High toxicity was observed in chlorambucil test group (3 out of 7 mice died); no toxicity was observed with any other test group. 6. While there is no apparent advantage in cytotoxicity of chlorambucil conjugates compared to free chlorambucil the lower toxicity of the conjugates would offer a therapeutic advantage. Conclusion The present inventors have shown that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs when modified by the addition of one to three acyl derivatives of fatty acids exhibit prolonged activity compared to the unmodified parent when applied transdermally (see International Patent Application No. PCT/AU94/00440 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). The present inventors have now shown that other therapeutic agents when modified in a similar manner are biologically active and show altered activity compared to the unmodified drugs. It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive. What is claimed is: 1. A compound of the following formula: in which X is chlorambucil and is linked to Y via the carboxyl group Y is an optional spacer group AA is an amino acid; n is a number from 0 to 5 B is H or CH 2 OR 3 R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are the same or different and are either hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or an acyl group derived from a fatty acid, with the proviso that at least one of R 1 , R 2 and R 3 is an acyl group derived from a fatty acid. 2. A compound as claimed in claim 1 in which X is chlorambucil, Y is absent, an amino acid, glycolic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid or lactic acid, AA is not present or glycine or alanine and the linkage is either an amide bond or an ester bond to the carboxyl group.", "related_docs": [], "pct_data": [], "external_files": [{"file": "US06281376-20010828-C00001.CDX", "format": "cdx", "section":

The palladium acetate catalyst with modified phenanthroline has the following formula: wherein R 1 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl groups of from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, OH, and NO 2 groups and halogen and hydrogen atoms with at least six of the R 1 groups being hydrogen atoms in the ligand. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a new catalyst and is used in the oxidizing of side-chains of alkylbenzenes. 2. Background of the Invention The oxidation of some alkyl arenes is known to proceed by a radical mechanism. For example, the oxidation of ArCH 3 by Co(III), 0.1 M, proceeds at 90-100 C. in oxygen (0.2-1 bar) by the following mechanism. ArCH 3 Co(III) 3 .Co(II) ArCH 3 .ArCH 2 .H ArCH 2 .O 2 ArCH 2 O 2 . ArCH 2 O 2 .Co(II)ArCH 2 O 2 Co(III) ArCH 2 O 2 Co(III)ArCHOHOCo(III) Thus, this reaction mechanism predicts the formation of the aldehyde from the arene without the alcohol as the intermediate product. The aldehyde is converted to the acid by the auto-oxidation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Briefly described, in a preferred form, the object of this invention is to oxide the side-chain of alkylbenzenes rather than oxidizing the phenyl carbons. The object of this invention has been achieved by the use of palladium phenanthroline acetate, or a palladium acetatc catalyst with a modified phenanthroline ligand as a catalyst. It is used in the presence of oxygen to oxidize the side-chain of alkylbenzenes. These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading the following specification in conjunction with the accompanying drawing figures. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Preparation of the Catalyst The palladium phenanthroline acetate catalyst is prepared from a divalent palladium (Pd(II)) complexed by 1, 10-phenanthroline. This catalyst may be prepared ex site by traditional wet chemistry methods from the acetate salt or, it may be prepared ill sitsi by combining equimolar amounts of palladium acetate Pd(Oac) 2 and 1, 10-phenanthroline in the reaction mixture just prior to heating the reactants. The critical agent for the novel catalysis is the phen ligand. The effect of the ligand on conversion and selectivity is shown in Table 1: TABLE I Ligand system (OAc)/Hacac Oac/phen Duration, hours 4 4 Temperature, C. 150 150 Pd/substrate 0.001 0.0015 Oxidant pressure, psig 750 750 Conversion A 7400% 2290% Products Acetic acid, phenyl ester 0 B 7 C Benzaldehyde 0 9 Benzyl alcohol 0 6 Benzyl benzoate 0 38 Benzoic acid, phenyl ester 0 4 2,2-dmbp 2 2 2,3-dmbp 13 1 2,4-dmbp 10 1 3,3-dmbp 27 1 3,4-dmbp 35 1 4,4-dmbp 13 1 Methyl benzoate 0 11 2-methyl phenol 0 4 phenol 0 3 Others 0 11 A conversion based on equivalents of Pd, %; B yields based on calibrated GC: C yields based on area % A palladium acetate catalyst with modified phenanthroline ligand of the following formula can also be utilized: wherein R 1 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl groups of from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, OH, and NO 2 groups and halogen and hydrogen atoms with at least six of the R 1 groups being hydrogen atoms in the ligand. It is preferred that all of the R 1 groups be hydrogen or hydrogen and one or two methyl groups. Use of the Catalyst The palladium phenanthroline acetate catalyst is used in the oxidation of aromatic compounds. This catalyst shows a preference for oxidizing benzyl carbons rather than oxidizing phenyl carbons in substituted, aromatic compounds. One example of this new catalysis is the catalytic oxidation of toluene to benzyl benzoate by the following stoichiometry: Reaction Conditions The reaction conditions are mild. Temperature is 100-200 C., pressurized oxygen is the oxidant (500-750 psig) in a mixture with N 2 (preferably about 50 mol %). Catalyst to substrate ratio is 0.001-0.003 mol/mol and the reaction may be completed without a solvent. Reaction times in a batch reactor are less than 4 hours. Solvents may be used provided that reactive carbons are not present in these solvents. The effect of the phen ligand is to alter the point of the oxidation to the benzyl carbon and away from the phenyl carbon. Without the phen ligand, the oxidation point is the phenyl carbon when the ligand is (Oac), (acac), and others. The following compounds were oxidized: toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, and mesitylene. All reactions were completed in autoclaves of 25-75 cm 3 volume using pressurized, artificial air (50-mol % O 2 ) at 750 psig as the oxidant. In a typical reaction 1 mmol of Pd 2 (OAc) 2 was introduced with an equimolar amount of 1, 10-phenanthroline into 300 mmol of substrate at room temperature and then the temperature was increased quickly to 150 C. The Oxidation of the Methylbenzene The results of the oxidation of toluene, o-, m-, p-xylene, and mesitylene are shown in Table II. These data are shown as turnovers of reactant to give a particular product. The units of the table entries are moles of toluene converted to the indicated species/mole of Pd 2 ion. In the case of toluene the methyl group is oxidized to the alcohol, aldehyde, acid, and the ester in significant yields; whereas, the coupled products are always present in smaller amounts. When the substrate was o-xylene, the products where the corresponding alcohol (2-methylbenxyl alcohol), acid (2-methylbenzoic acid) and ester (2-methylbenzoic acid, 2-methyl benzoic ester). The aldehyde product (2-methylbenzylaldehyde) was not observed. Small amounts of the coupled product were observed (3, 4, 3, 4-tetramethylbiphenyl) and the dealkylated, coupled product (2, 2-dimethylbibenzyl). Phthalide was observed in modest yields (1 turnover) at each reaction time. Only two products were observed in significant yields for the oxidation of m-xylene: 3-methylbenzaldehyde and 3-methylbenzoic acid. The oxidation products in significant yields from p-xylene include 4-methyl benzyl alcohol, 4-methylbenzaldehyde, 4-methylbenzoic acid and the ester. Products appearing in small yields are the coupled products and terephthalic aldehyde. In the case of mesitylene as the substrate, the primary products are 3, 5-dimethylbenzyl alcohol, and 3, 5-dimethylbenzaldehyde; whereas the minor product is 2, 4, 6-trimethylphenol.

Acetophenone is the only product for the oxidation of ethylbenzene. When the radical cavenger BHT is added to the reactant mixture in amounts of 1 and 10 wt %, the turnovers to acetophenone decrease by the a factor of 2-3. The oxidation of 4-ethyltoluene shows p-methylacetophenone and p-tolylethanol as the major products with 4-methyl benzaldehyde and 4-ethylbenzyl alcohol as minor products.

The minor products for oxidation of cumene are 2, 3-dimethyl, 2, 3-diphenyl butane and ethoxy-methyl benzene. The minor products for oxidation of p-cymene are 4-isopropyl benzyl alcohol, 4-iso-propyl benzaldehyde, and 4-iso-propenyl-toluene. The oxidation of toluene appears to follow an obvious path as inferred from the kinetics of the product yields (Table IV). The intermediate products are benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, benzoic acid; whereas, benzyl benzoate is the final product by esterification of benzyl alcohol and benzoic acid. In a separate test at the same reaction conditions, but without the Pd catalyst, benzyl alcohol and benzoic acid were esterified in toluene to produce benzyl benzoate. The following reaction scheme explains these results: Oxidation of o-xylene produced 2-methylbenzyl alcohol and 2-methylbenzoic acid as intermediates to the ester: 2-methylbenzoic acid-2-methyl benzoic acid ester. No aldehyde was observed, but a product of the aldehyde was observed: phthalide. Oxidation of m-xylene led to only two products: 3-methylbenzaldehydc and 3-methyl benzoic acid. No alcohol was observed, nor was any ester product. Oxidation of p-xylene leads major products of p-methylbenzyl alcohol, p-methylbenzaldehyde, and p-methyl benzoic acid. The final product is 4-methyl benzoic acid-4-methyl benzoic acid ester. Minor products include the coupled products and terephthalaldehyde. Finally, the oxidation of mesitylene leads to 3, 5-dimethybenzyl alcohol and 3, 5-dimethyl benzaldehyde as the major products. 2, 4, 6-trimethylphenol is a minor product. The data for the oxidation of the four methylbenzenes substrates suggests that the major reaction products are the result of a sequential oxidation of the benzyl carbon in preference to oxidation of phenyl carbons. The oxidation of an alkyl substituent having a tertiary carbon leads to the formation of the acetophenone when the substrates were cumene and p-cymene. A carbon is lost from the iso-propyl group during the oxidation. The present results suggest that the Pd(phen)(OAc) 2 catalyst can oxidize the benzyl carbons in preference to the phenyl carbons on substrates that have alkyl groups that can be oxidized further. The date in Table V shows that results of oxidizing toluene over Pd(acac)(OAc) and oxidizing toluene and methyl benzoate over Pd(phen)(OAc) 2 . The oxidation of toluene over Pd 2 with the phen ligand shows products that suggest that the benzyl carbons are oxidized in preference of ring coupling whereas, the oxidation of the same substrate over Pd 2 with the acac ligands shows only the products of ring coupling reaction.

Moreover, it is possible to provide a method capable of preparing a highly-pure tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative efficiently and at low costs. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for purifying a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluroary)borate compound containing impurities. The present invention also relates to a method for preparing a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative which is useful as, for example, a co-catalyst of a metallocene catalyst (polymerization catalyst) for a cationic complex polymerization reaction and a catalyst for photopolymerization of silicone. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivatives are useful compounds as, for example, a co-catalyst for promoting the activity of a metallocene catalyst (polymerization catalyst) for a cationic complex polymerization reaction and a catalyst for photopolymerization of silicone. Moreover, tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compounds are compounds which are useful as intermediates for the preparation of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivatives. In resent years, the metallocene catalyst is particularly noted as a catalyst for polymerization of polyolefin. For instance, J. Organometal. Chem., 2 (1964), pp.245-250 discloses a method for synthesizing a tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate derivative by reacting bromopenetafluorobenzene with butyl lithium (an organic lithium compound) at 78 C. with the use of dry pentane as a solvent to form pentafluorophenyl lithium, reacting this compound with a boron trichloride (halogenated boron) to synthesize a tris(pentaflourophenyl)borane, and reacting this compound with pentafluorophenyl lithium to synthesize the tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate derivative. Moreover, Tokukaihei No. 6-247981 (Japanese laid-open patent application, published Sep. 6, 1994) discloses a method for synthesizing a tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate-lithium that is a kind of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound from pentafluorobenzene with the use of an organic lithium compound and halogenated boron. However, these methods suffer from the problems: 1) since the organic lithium compound is unstable with respect to heat, the temperature of the reaction system must be maintained at a temperature of not higher than 65 C., and therefore special facilities are required and it takes a cost for cooling; 2) since an expensive organic lithium compound must be used and ignition may occur by the reaction between the compound and water, etc, it is dangerous to handle the compound; and 3) since expensive halogenated boron must be used and the compound is in gaseous phase and corrosive, the compound is difficult to handle. It is thus difficult to industrially implement the method disclosed in the above-mentioned publications. In contrast, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,473,036 discloses a method for preparing triethylammonium*tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl)borate by reacting bromopentafluorobenzene with magnesium to give pentafluorophenyl magnesium bromide, reacting this compound as a Grignard reagent with a boron trifluoride diethyl ether complex to synthesize tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl) borate magnesium bromide, and reacting this compound with triethylammonium-chloride to prepare the triethylammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate. Further, Tokukaihei No. 6-247980 (Japanese laid-open patent application, published Sep. 6, 1994) discloses a method for synthesizing a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound by a Grignard reaction, and more specifically a) a method for preparing a tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate-magnesium halide by reacting a pentafluorophenyl magnesium halide with halogenated boron; and b) a method for preparing a tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate magnesium halide by reacting a pentafluorophenyl magnesium halide with tris(pentafluorophenyl) boron. In the preparation method of United States Patent No. 5,473,036, magnesium bromide fluoride and magnesium chloride fluoride are given as by-products together with triethylammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate. However, this publication does not disclose or mention separation and removal of the halogenated magnesium as the by-product from the reaction system. Since triethylammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate is a crude product, in order to obtain a final purified product, it is necessary to recrystallize the compound with the use of chloroform or methylene chloride/butyl ether. It is thus hard to say that the above preparation method is an industrially effective method. Besides, in the above-mentioned preparation method a) of Tokukaihei No. 6-247980, halogenated magnesium is given as a by-product together with the tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate. magnesium halide. However, this publication does not disclose or mention separation and removal of the halogenated magnesium as the by-products from the reaction system. When a tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate derivative which is prepared with the use of tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate-magnesium bromide containing halogenated magnesium as impurities is used as, for example, a co-catalyst of a metallocene catalyst, the activity of the catalyst is considerably owered. Therefore, the tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate magnesium bromide prepared by this method is not suitable as the intermediate for the preparation of the tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate derivative. The pentafluorophenyl magnesium halide as a Grignard reagent used in the above U.S. Pat. No. 5,473,036 and Tokukaihei No. 6-247980 and more specifically, for example, pentafluorophenyl magnesium bromide formed from bromopentafluorobenzene and magnesium, is colored black by colored components as impurities produced by a side reaction, etc. Therefore, a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound synthesized with the use of the pentafluorophenyl magnesium halide is colored black by the colored components unless the step of removing the colored components is executed. Thus, when a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative as an object is prepared using the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative has a bad color tone. Hence, it is difficult to provide tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivatives as products. In short, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound containing the colored components as impurities is not suitable as the intermediate for the preparation of a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative. However, the above-mentioned publications do not disclose or mention the removal of the colored components. Therefore, there is a great demand for a purifying method capable of efficiently and easily separating and removing colored components contained as impurities in tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compounds. There is also a great demand for a method capable of preparing a highly-pure tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative efficiently and at low costs. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a purifying method capable of efficiently and easily separating and removing colored components contained as impurities in tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compounds or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds. It is another object of the present invention to provide a method capable of preparing a highly-pure tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative, which is useful as, for example, a co-catalyst of a metallocene catalyst and a catalyst for photopolymerization of silicone, efficiently and at low costs. The inventors of the present invention eagerly studied on the method for purifying tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compounds, and the method for preparing tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivatives. It was found as a result of the study that, by mixing a solution containing an organic solvent and a tetrakis (fluoroaryl) borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds including colored components as impurities, with water, the colored components can be efficiently and easily separated and removed. Further, the inventors found that a highly-pure tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative can be prepared efficiently and at low costs by reacting the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds obtained by the above-mentioned purifying method with a compound generating a monovalent cation seed, and completed the present invention. In order to achieve the above object, a method for purifying a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds according to the present invention is a method characterized by mixing a solution containing an organic solvent and the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds including impurities, with water. Moreover, the method for purifying a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds according to the present invention is characterized in that the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds is a compound represented by general formula (1) (wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 , R 7 , R 8 , R 9 and R 10 independently represent a hydrogen atom, a fluorine atom, a hydrocarbon group or an alkoxy group, at least one of R 1 R 5 is a fluorine atom, at least one of R 6 to R 10 is a fluorine atom, M is a hydrogen atom, alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or alkaline earth metal halide, n is 3 or 4, and m is 1 when M is a hydrogen atom, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal halide, or m is 2 when M is an alkaline earth metal). Furthermore, the method for purifying a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds according to the present invention is characterized by removing the organic solvent from the mixture by distillation after mixing the solution with water, or by further mixing an aqueous solution obtained by removing the organic solvent from the mixture by distillation after mixing the solution with water, with an aromatic hydrocarbon. Additionally, the method for purifying a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds according to the present invention is characterized by isolating the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds as a solid from an aqueous solution of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds obtained by mixing the solution with water. By adopting the above purifying method, since colored components contained as impurities in the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds can be separated and removed efficiently and easily, it is possible to purify the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compoundor tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds. In addition, after the solution is mixed with water, by removing the organic solvent from the mixture by distillation, or by further mixing the aqueous solution obtained by removing the organic solvent from the mixture by distillation with an aromatic hydrocarbon, the colored components can be separated and removed more efficiently and easily. Besides, by adopting the above purifying method, it is possible to is ot islate the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound as a solid (crystal). In order to achieve the another object, a method for preparing a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative according to the present invention is characterized by reacting a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds obtained by the above purifying method with a compound which forms a monovalent cation seed. Moreover, the method for preparing a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative according to the present invention is characterized in that the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative is a compound represented by general formula (2) (wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 , R 7 , R 8 , R 9 and R 10 independently represent a hydrogen atom, a fluorine atom, a hydrocarbon group or an alkoxy group, at least one of R 1 to R 5 is a fluorine atom, at least one of R 6 to R 10 is a fluorine atom, Z is a monovalent cation seed, and n is 3 or 4). By adopting the above preparation method, it is possible to prepare efficiently a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative from a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound obtained by the above purifying method, at low costs. Since the derivative does not contain colored components as impurities, it has a satisfactory color tone and high purity. It is thus possible to use the derivative suitably as, for example, a co-catalyst of a metallocene catalyst for a cationic complex polymerization reaction and a catalyst for photopolymerization of silicone. Further objects, the nature and advantages of the present invention will be understood by the following description. Also, the effects of the present invention will be explained clearly in the following description. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT A method for purifying a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds of the present invention is a process of mixing a solution containing an organic solvent and the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds including impurities, with water. The water may be distilled water, ion-exchange water, or pure water. The tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds is suitable as an intermediate of a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative. Moreover, a method for preparing a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative of the present invention is a process of reacting the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds obtained by the above-mentioned purifying method with a compound which forms a monovalent cation seed. The tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds to be purified by the present invention is not particularly restricted if it is a borate compound having at least three fluoroaryl groups which are formed by substitution of at least one of hydrogen atoms of an aryl group with a fluorine atom. More specifically, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compounds to be purified by the present invention is a compound represented by general formula (3) (wherein R is an alkyl group having 1 to 20 carbon atoms or a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 10 carbon atoms, R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R and R 5 independently represent a hydrogen atom, a fluorine atom, a hydrocarbon group or an alkoxy group, at least one of R 1 to R 5 is a fluorine atom, M is a hydrogen atom, alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or alkaline earth metal halide, n is 3 or 4, and m is 1 when M is a hydrogen atom, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal halide, or m is 2 when M is an alkaline earth metal) . More specifically, the alkyl group of the substituent group represented by R in the formula is a straight-chain or branched-chain alkyl group. Among the compounds, a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound represented by general formula (1) above is more suitable. The following description will explain the present invention by illustrating the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound represented by general formula (1) above as an example. The tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound of general formula (1) to be purified by the present invention is a compound, wherein substituent groups represented by R 1 to R 10 in the formula are independently formed by a hydrogen atom, fluorine atom, hydrocarbon group or alkoxy group, at least one of the substituent groups represented by R 1 to R 5 is a fluorine atom, at least one of the substituent groups represented by R 6 to R 10 is a fluorine atom, a substituent group represented by M is formed by a hydrogen atom, alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or alkaline earth metal halide, n is 3 or 4, and m is 1 when M is a hydrogen atom, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal halide, or m is 2 when M is an alkaline earth metal. Therefore, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compounds are specifically alkali metal salts of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borates, alkaline earth metal salts of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borates, alkaline earth metal halide salts of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borates, and hydrogen compounds of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borates. Specifically, the hydrocarbon group is an aryl group, a straight-chain, branched-chain or cyclic alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a straight-chain, branched-chain or cyclic alkenyl group having 2 to 12 carbon atoms, etc. The hydrocarbon group may further include a functional group inert to the purification (process) and reaction of the present invention. Specific examples of the functional group include a methoxy group, methylthio group, N,N-dimethylamino group, o-anise group, p-anise group, trimethylsilyloxy group, dimethyl-t-butylsilyloxy group, and trifluoromethyl group. The alkoxy group is represented by general formula (A) OR a (A) (wherein R a is a hydrocarbon group), and the hydrocarbon group represented by R a in the formula is specifically, for example, an aryl group, a straight-chain, branched-chain or cyclic alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, or a straight-chain, branched-chain or cyclic alkenyl group having 2 to 12 carbon atoms. The hydrocarbon group may further include a functional group inert to the purification (process) and reaction of the present invention. Specific examples of the alkoxy group represented by the general formula (A) include a methoxy group, an ethoxy group, an n-propoxy group, an isopropoxy group, an n-butoxy group, an isobutoxy group, a sec-butoxy group, a t-butoxy group, a cyclohexyloxy group, an allyloxy group, and a phenoxy group. Prior to describe in great detail the purifying method of the present invention, an example of the method for preparing the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compounds will be explained below. The tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compounds can be prepared by {circle around (1)} a process of treating tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate-magnesium halide represented by general formula (4) (wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 5 , R 6 , R 7 , R 8 , R 9 and R 10 independently represent a hydrogen atom, a fluorine atom, a hydrocarbon group or an alkoxy group, at least one of R 1 to R 5 is a fluorine atom, at least one of R 6 to R 10 is a fluorine atom, X is a chlorine atom, bromine atom or iodine atom, and n is 3 or 4) with a carboxylic acid alkali metal salt and/or carboxylic acid alkaline earth metal salt; {circle around (2)} a process of treating the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide with an acid; {circle around (3)} a process of treating the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate magnesium halide with an alkali metal hydroxide and/or alkaline earth metal hydroxide after treating it with an acid; and {circle around (4)} a process of treating the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide with a carboxylic acid alkali metal salt and/or carboxylic acid alkaline earth metal salt after treating it with an acid. Therefore, when the tetrakis(fluoroaryl) borate magnesium halide is treated with a carboxylic acid alkali metal salt and/or carboxylic acid alkaline earth metal salt, or when it is treated with an alkali metal hydroxide and/or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, i.e., when the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide is treated by any of the above processes {circle around (1)}, {circle around (1)} and {circle around (1)}, an alkali metal salt of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate and/or an alkaline earth metal salt of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate and/or an alkaline earth metal halide salt of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate are obtained. Meanwhile, when the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide is treated with an acid, i.e., when it is treated by the above process {circle around (2)}, a hydrogen compound of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate is obtained. Besides, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide can be easily obtained by, for example, a process of reacting a halogenated aryl fluoride with magnesium to form fluoroaryl magnesium halide as a Grignard reagent and then reacting the fluoroaryl magnesium halide with halogenated boron in a mole ratio of 4:1. Hence, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl) boratemagnesium halide is obtained in the state of a reaction solution dissolved in a solvent used for a Grignard reaction. The solvent is not particularly limited, and specific examples of the solvent include solvents of the ether series, such as diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether, diisoamyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane, anisole, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, and 1,4-dioxane; solvents of the aliphatic hydrocarbon series, such as pentane, hexane, and heptane; solvents of the alicyclic hydrocarbon series, such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and methylcyclohexane; and solvents of the aromatic hydrocarbon series, such as benzene, toluene, and xylene. These solvents may be used as a combined solvent. Incidentally, the above-mentioned reaction solution contains colored components as impurities formed by a side reaction, etc. Besides, when the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide is produced by reacting a fluoroaryl magnesium halide with halogenated boron, the halogenated magnesium as the by-product, for example, magnesium bromide fluoride is dissolved as an impurity in the solution. Specific examples of carboxylic acid alkali metal salts used for the above treatment processes include: alkali metal salts of saturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids, such as sodium formate, potassium formate, sodium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium propionate, and potassium propionate; monoalkali or dialkali metal salts of saturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, such as monosodium oxalate, disodium oxalate, monopotassium oxalate, dipotassium oxalate, monosodium malonate, disodium malonate, monopotassium malonate, dipotassium malonate, monosodium succinate, disodium succinate, monopotassium succinate, and dipotassium succinate; alkali metal salts of unsaturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids, such as solidum acrylate, potassium acrylate, sodium methacrylate, and potassium methacrylate; monoalkali or dialkali metal salts of unsaturated aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, such as monosodium maleate, disodium maleate, monopotassium maleate, dipotassium maleate, monosodium fumarate, disodium fumarate, monopotassium fumarate, and dipotassium fumarate; alkali metal salts of aromatic monocaroboxilic acids, such as sodium benzoate, and potassium benzoate; and monoalkali or dialkali metal salts of aromatic dicarboxilic acids, such as monosodium phthalate, disodium phthalate, monopotassium phthalate, dipotassium phthalate, monosodium isophthalate, disodium isophthalate, monopotassium isophthalate, dipotassium isophthalate, monosodium terephthalate, disodium terephthalate, monopotassium terephthalate, and dipotassium terephthalate. However, the carboxylic acid alkali metal salts are not particularly limited to these examples.

However, the carboxylic acid alkaline earth metal salts are not particularly limited to these examples. Note that, in the present invention, the carboxylic acid alkaline earth metal salts include carbonates, such as calcium carbonate and barium carbonate. However, in the present invention, the carboxylic acid alkaline earth metal salts do not include carboxylic acid magnesium salts. Only one kind or more than one kind of these carboxylic acid alkali metal salts and carboxylic acid alkaline earth metal salts (the general term carboxylate is hereinafter used to refer to both of these salts). Among the exemplified carboxylates, lithium carbonate, solidum carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium acetate, disodium succinate, and barium acetate are particularly preferred. The amount of carboxylate used is not particularly restricted if it is not less than one equivalent of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide. Moreover, when the carboxylic acid alkali metal salt and carboxylic acid alkaline earth metal salt are used together, the ratio thereof is not particularly restricted. Specific examples of the acid used for the above-mentioned treatment processes include: inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and carbonic acid; and organic acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, and succinic acid. However, the acid is not particularly limited to these examples. It is possible to use only one kind or more than one kind of these acids. Among the exemplified acids, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid and malonic acid are particularly preferred. The amount of acid used is not particularly restricted if it is not less than one equivalent of magnesium used for the preparation of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide (introduced into the reaction system). Moreover, when an inorganic acid and an organic acid are used together, the ratio thereof is not particularly restricted. Specific examples of the alkali metal hydroxide used for the above-mentioned treatment processes include lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide. Besides, specific examples of the alkaline earth metal hydroxide used for the above-mentioned treatment processes include calcium hydroxide and barium hydroxide. In the present invention, however, the alkaline earth metal hydroxides do not include magnesium hydroxide. Only one or more than one kind of these alkali metal hydroxides and alkaline earth metal hydroxides (the general term hydroxides is hereinafter used to refer to both of these hydroxides). The amount of hydroxide used is not particularly restricted if it is not less than one equivalent of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide. Moreover, when the alkali metal hydroxide and alkaline earth metal hydroxide are used together, the ratio thereof is not particularly restricted. When treating the tetrakis(fluoroaryl) boratemagnesium halide with a carboxylate (the above-mentioned process {circle around (1)}, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide and carboxylate can be mixed and stirred. When treating the tetrakis(fluoroaryl) boratemagnesium halide with an acid (the above-mentioned process {circle around (2)}, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl) boratemagnesium halide and acid can be mixed and stirred. Further, when treating the tetrakis (fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide with a hydroxide after treating it with an acid (the above-mentioned process {circle around (1)}, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide and hydroxide can be mixed and stirred after separating and removing the acid. Meanwhile, when treating the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide with a carboxylate after treating it with an acid (the above-mentioned process {circle around (1)}, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide and carboxylate can be mixed and stirred after separating and removing the acid. The method of mixing a solution of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide with the carboxylate, acid or hydroxide is not particularly limited. The carboxylate, acid and hydroxide can be mixed in the present state (solid or liquid), or in the state of solution if necessary, with the solution of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide. Specifically, when the carboxylate, acid and hydroxide are in the state of solution, suitable examples of solvent include: water; the above-exemplified solvents of the ether series; the above-exemplified solvents of the aliphatic hydrocarbon series; the above-exemplified solvents of the alicyclic hydrocarbon series; solvents of the ester series, such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate; the above-exemplified solvents of the aromatic hydrocarbon series; solvents of the alcohol series, such as methyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol; and solvents of the ketone series, such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone. However, the solvent is not particularly limited to these examples. It is possible to use only one kind or more than one kind of these solvents. The method and order of mixing the carboxylate, acid or hydroxide are not particularly restricted. For instance, it is possible to mix the carboxylate, acid or hydroxide in the solution of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide. Alternatively, it is possible to mix the solution of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide in the carboxylate, acid or hydroxide. The temperature and time, i.e., conditions, of mixing and stirring the solution of tetrakis (fluoroaryl)borate. magnesium halide with the carboxylate, acid or hydroxide are not particularly restricted. According to the above-described treatment processes, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide can be easily treated by mixing the solution of tetrakis (fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide with the carboxylate, acid or hydroxide and then stirring them at room temperature for a predetermined time. Moreover, when treating the tetrakis (fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide with a hydroxide or carboxylate after treating it with an acid, the method of separating and removing the acid is not particularly restricted. For example, the acid can be separated from the solution of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound by performing simple separation (oil and water separation). After the treatment, the tetrakis (fluoroaryl)borate compound is obtained in the state of solution, i.e., in the state in which it is dissolved in a solvent (organic solvent). When the solution of tetrakis(fluoroaryl) borate.magnesium halide contains the carboxylate, acid or hydroxide, the carboxylate, acid or hydroxide can be removed by performing washing, etc., if necessary. On the other hand, when the carboxylate, acid, hydroxide or the solution thereof contains the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound, the tetrakis (fluoroaryl)borate compound can be recovered by performing extraction, etc., if necessary. Further, when water is contained in the solution of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound, water can be removed (dried) by adding a desiccant, such as anhydrous magnesium sulfate, if necessary. By treating the tetrakis(fluoroaryl) borate.magnesium halide according to the above processes {circle around (1)} to {circle around (4)}, a tetrakis (fluoroaryl) borate compound to be purified by the present invention is obtained. In other words, when the tetrakis(fluoroaryl) borate.magnesium halide is treated with the carboxylate or hydroxide, i.e., treated with the above-described processes {circle around (1)}, {circle around (3)} and {circle around (4)}, tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borates wherein M in general formula (1) above is an alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or alkaline earth metal halide are obtained. On the other hand, when the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide is treated with an acid, i.e., treated with the above-described process {circle around (2)}, a hydrogen compound of a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate wherein M in general formula (1) above is a hydrogen atom is obtained. Among the above-described treatment processes {circle around (1)} to {circle around (4)}, for example, a suitable process can be selected on the basis of the kind of tetrakis (fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide, the kind of solvent, etc. so that a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound in desired form (alkali metal salt, alkaline earth metal salt, alkaline earth metal halide salt or hydrogen compound) is obtained, or that the separation, for example, liquid separation, performed after the treatment is facilitated. According to the above-mentioned treatment processes, it is possible to convert, for example, halogenated magnesium, which is given as a by-product during the preparation of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide by a Grignard reaction, into the state of a water-soluble magnesium salt or water-insoluble magnesium salt (i.e., the state of a salt other than magnesium hydroxide). Therefore, for example, by separating or filtering the salt contained in the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide, it is possible to separate or remove the salt efficiently and easily from the solution of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound. In other words, impurities such as halogenated magnesium contained in the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide can be efficiently and easily separated and removed. The method of separating and removing impurities from the solution of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound is not particularly restricted. When a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative is produced using a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound containing halogenated magnesium as impurities, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative also contains halogenated magnesium as impurities. When the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative containing the halogenated magnesium is used as, for example, a co-catalyst of a metallocene catalyst, the activity of the catalyst is considerably lowered. Therefore, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound containing the halogenated magnesium is not suitable as the intermediate for the preparation of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative. Besides, for example, even when the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide does not contain impurities such as halogenated magnesium, it is preferred to obtain a hydrogen compound of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate, an alkali metal salt of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate, an alkaline earth metal salt of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate, or an alkaline earth metal halide salt of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate by performing the above-described treatment. It is possible to promptly and efficiently proceed the reaction between such a salt and a compound which forms a monovalent cation seed. Incidentally, the method for preparing a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound is not necessarily limited to those exemplified above. It is possible to prepare tetrakis(fluoroaryl)boratemagnesium halide as one kind of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound by, for example, a process of reacting fluoroaryl magnesium halide and tris(fluoroaryl) boron in a mole ratio of 1:1. With the above-mentioned preparation method, a solution containing a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound which does not contain halogenated magnesium such as magnesium bromide fluoride, i.e., a crude tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound, and an organic solvent (hereinafter simply referred to as the solution) is obtained. However, this solution contains colored components as impurities. The concentration (content) of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound in the solution is not particularly restricted. However, in order to implement the purifying method of the present invention, a higher concentration is preferred. Next, the following description will explain the purifying method of the present invention. According to the purifying method of the present invention, the above solution is mixed with water. The tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound is soluble in water. On the other hand, the colored components which are given as by-product impurities during the preparation of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound by the Grignard reaction are not soluble in water. Therefore, when the solution and water are brought into contact with each other by, for example, mixing and stirring, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound moves toward the aqueous layer side, while the colored components remain on the solution side (organic solvent side), i.e., remain on the oily layer side. Hence, for example, by separating the mixture obtained by mixing and stirring the solution and water into two layers and then separating the aqueous layer and oily layer (oil and water separation), the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound and the colored components can be separated and removed efficiently and easily. In other words, it is possible to purify the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound because the colored components can be separated and removed. The mixing ratio of the solution and water, i.e., the amount of water to the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound, can be set according to a mixing temperature (described later), the solubility of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound at the temperature, etc., and is not particularly restricted. For instance, the amount of water can be set so that the ratio of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound to the total amount of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound and water is within the range of preferably from 0.1% by weight to 90% by weight, more preferably from 1% by weight to 50% by weight, and most preferably from 10% by weight to 50% by weight. When the amount of water exceeds the above-mentioned range, the amount of the aqueous layer is increased, and there is a possibility that the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound is not purified efficiently. On the other hand, when the amount of water is less than the above-mentioned range, since the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound to be moved to the aqueous layer side remains on the oily layer side, there is a possibility that the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound is not purified efficiently. The method of mixing the solution and water and the mixing order are not particularly restricted. For instance, water may be mixed and stirred in the solution, or the solution may be mixed and stirred in water. At this time, water may be introduced into the solution by dropping, or the solution may be introduced into water by dropping. Alternatively, a method of continuously extracting the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound from the solution with the use of water as an extractive medium by an apparatus such as a Soxhlet extractor for heavy specific gravity can be employed as the above-mentioned mixing method. Accordingly, in the present invention, mixing the solution with water includes separating the solution from water while continuously contacting the solution with water. Moreover, the mixing temperature and time when mixing the solution with water, i.e., the purifying conditions, are not particularly restricted. According to the purifying method of the present invention, after mixing the solution with water, for example, they can be stirred for a predetermined time at a temperature which is higher than the freezing point of water but is not higher than the boiling point of water, i.e., within the range of from 0 C. to 100 C., and more preferably from 50 C. to 100 C. within which the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound has a higher solubility and is dissolved more efficiently. Besides, the solution and water may be adjusted to a predetermined temperature (i.e., the mixing temperature) prior to mixing. Alternatively, the mixture obtained by the mixing may be adjusted to the predetermined temperature. In short, according to the purifying method of the present invention, the aqueous layer and the oily layer need to reach the mixing temperature at the time of separation of the aqueous layer and oily layer (oil and water separation). Incidentally, the method of adjusting the solution and water, or the mixture, to the predetermined temperature is not particularly restricted. Moreover, in the purifying method of the present invention, after mixing the solution and water, by removing the organic solvent from the mixture by distillation or further mixing an aqueous solution obtained by the removal of the organic solvent from the mixture by distillation with an aromatic hydrocarbon with, if necessary, it is possible to more efficiently purify the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compoundor tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound. In other words, by removing the organic solvent by distillation, or more specifically by removing the organic solvent by distillation, so that the weight of the organic solvent to the weight of the water is equal to or less than 30% by weight, an increased amount of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound which is dissolved in the oily layer (organic solvent) can dissolve in water. It is thus possible to purify the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound more efficiently. The method or the conditions such as temperature, pressure and time, for removing the organic solvent by distillation are not particularly restricted. When the organic solvent forms an azeotropic composition with water, the temperature is preferably set to the azeotropic temperature. When the organic solvent does not form an azeotropic composition with water, the temperature is preferably set to a temperature equal to or higher than the boiling point of the organic solvent. Moreover, when the organic solvent forms the azeotropic composition with water, the water removed together with the organic solvent by distillation may be returned to the mixture after the separation, or discarded. Alternatively, new water equivalent to the amount of the water removed by distillation may be added to the mixture. The pressure can be either normal pressure (atmospheric pressure) or reduced pressure. Hence, when removing the organic solvent by distillation, the organic solvent is preferably a compound which forms an azeotropic composition with water or a compound whose boiling point at normal pressure is lower than 100 C. Further, after mixing the solution with water, the organic solvent may be removed from the mixture by distillation. Alternatively, the organic solvent may be removed by distillation while introducing the solution into water by dropping. Incidentally, the heating method in removing the organic solvent by distillation is not particularly restricted. When the aqueous layer and the oily layer are present after removing the organic solvent by distillation, usually, the oily layer is present as the upper layer and the aqueous layer is present as the lower layer. The method or the conditions such as the temperature and time, for separating the aqueous layer and the oily layer (oil and water separation) is not particularly restricted. However, in order to prevent separation of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound dissolved in the aqueous layer or to limit the lowering of the flowability of the aqueous layer, the temperature needs to be set to a temperature which is higher than the freezing point of the aqueous layer but is lower than the boiling point of the aqueous layer, and more preferably to a temperature around 50 C. Incidentally, when the organic solvent forms an azeotropic composition with water, the temperature needs to be set to a temperature which is higher than the freezing point of the aqueous layer but is lower than the azeotropic temperature. By the way, when the organic solvent is almost completely removed by distillation, the colored components become, for example, oily droplets, and sink because the specific gravity of the droplets is greater than that of the aqueous layer (aqueous solution) . In this case, by extracting the aqueous layer or the droplets, it is possible to separate the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound from the colored components. Alternatively, in order to facilitate the separation of the colored components, it is possible to dissolve the colored components in an aromatic hydrocarbon by mixing the aromatic hydrocarbon with the aqueous layer and then separate the aqueous layer and the aromatic hydrocarbon layer. As the aromatic hydrocarbon, it is possible to use a compound which dissolves the colored components but does not dissolve the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound. Specific examples of the aromatic hydrocarbon may include benzene, toluene, xylene, mesitylene, durene, ethylbenzene, and cumene. However, the aromatic hydrocarbon is not particularly limited to these examples. It is possible to use only one kind or a mixture of more than one kinds of these compounds. The amount of aromatic hydrocarbon used is not particularly restricted if it can dissolve the colored components sufficiently. For instance, the amount of aromatic hydrocarbon can be set so that the weight ratio of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound to the aromatic hydrocarbon is preferably within the range between 1:0.01 and 1:10, and more preferably between 1:0.1 and 1:5. When the amount of aromatic hydrocarbon used exceeds the above range, the amount of aromatic hydrocarbon layer is increased, and thus there is a possibility that the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound is not efficiently purified. The method of mixing the aqueous layer and the aromatic hydrocarbon and the mixing order are not particularly restricted. For instance, the aromatic hydrocarbon may be mixed and stirred in the aqueous layer, or the aqueous layer may be mixed and stirred in the aromatic hydrocarbon. Alternatively, a method of continuously extracting the colored components from the aqueous layer with the use of the aromatic hydrocarbon as an extraction medium by an apparatus such as a Soxhlet extractor for heavy specific gravity can be employed as the above-mentioned mixing method. Accordingly, in the present invention, mixing the aqueous layer with the aromatic hydrocarbon includes separating the aqueous layer and the aromatic hydrocarbon while continuously contacting the aqueous layer with the aromatic hydrocarbon. Moreover, the conditions such as the mixing temperature and time when mixing the aqueous layer with the aromatic hydrocarbon are not particularly restricted, and for example, can be set according to the above-mentioned conditions for mixing the solution with water. After separating a mixture obtained by mixing and stirring the aqueous layer and the aromatic hydrocarbon into two layers, by separating the aqueous layer from the aromatic hydrocarbon layer (oil and water separation), it is possible to efficiently and easily separate and remove the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound and the colored components. When the aqueous layer and the oily layer are separated without removing the organic solvent by distillation or when the aqueous layer and the oily layer are separated in a state in which the organic solvent is removed to certain extent by distillation, in order to further remove impurities contained in the aqueous layer, it is possible to mix the aqueous layer and aromatic hydrocarbon to dissolve (extract) the impurities in the aromatic hydrocarbon and then separate the aqueous layer and the aromatic hydrocarbon layer. With this process, it is possible to purify the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound to have higher purity. With the above-described purifying method, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound containing no colored components as impurities, i.e., an aqueous solution of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound is obtained. Besides, when isolating and purifying the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound as a solid (crystal) from the aqueous solution of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compoundor tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound, various processes can be further performed, for example, water is completely removed from the aqueous solution by distillation; the aqueous solution can be condensed and/or cooled to separate the compound, and then the separation process such as filtration is performed; or the compound is extracted from the aqueous solution by mixing the aqueous solution with an organic extraction medium, and then the organic extraction medium is removed by distillation. In particular, when water-soluble impurities are contained in the aqueous solution of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compoundor tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound, it is preferred to perform the process using the organic extraction medium. The method of removing water completely from the aqueous solution by distillation and the various conditions such as temperature, pressure and time of the method are not particularly restricted. A specific example of such a method is a method of condensing and drying the aqueous solution under normal pressure or reduced pressure. The method of separating the compound by condensing and/or cooling the aqueous solution and the method of separating the compound by filtration, and various conditions such as the temperature, pressure and time of these methods are not particularly restricted. As the above-mentioned organic extraction medium, it is possible to use a compound which dissolves the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound and is not evenly mixed with water. Examples of the organic extraction medium include: extraction media of the ether series, such as diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether, diisoamyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane, anisole, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, and 1,2-dioxane; extraction media of the ester series, such as methyl acetate, and ethyl acetate; extraction media of the ketone series, such as diethyl ketone and dipropyl ketone; and extraction media of the chlorine series, such as methylene chloride (dichloromethane), chloroform, and 1,2-dichloroethane. However, the organic extraction medium is not necessarily limited to these examples. It is possible to use only one kind or more than one kind of these organic extraction media. The amount of the organic extraction medium used is not particularly restricted if the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound is sufficiently extracted from the aqueous solution. When an extraction using the organic extraction medium is performed, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound moves to the oily layer side (organic extraction medium side), while various water-soluble impurities remain on the aqueous layer side (aqueous solution side). Therefore, for example, by separating the mixture obtained by mixing and stirring the aqueous solution with the organic extraction medium into two layers and then separating the aqueous layer from the oily layer (water and oil separation), the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound and the water-soluble impurities can be efficiently and easily separated and removed. The extraction method by mixing the aqueous solution with the organic extraction medium and the mixing order are not particularly restricted. For instance, the extraction may be performed by mixing and stirring the organic extraction medium in the aqueous solution, or by mixing and stirring the aqueous solution in the organic extraction medium. At this time, the organic extraction medium may be introduced into the aqueous solution by dropping, or the aqueous solution may be introduced into the organic extraction medium by dropping. Moreover, in the present invention extraction of the compound by mixing the aqueous solution with the organic extraction medium includes separation of the compound while extracting the compound by continuous contact of the aqueous solution with the organic extraction medium. The method in which the organic extraction medium is removed by distillation after extracting the compound from the aqueous solution and various conditions such as temperature, pressure and time of the method are not particularly restricted. Hence, the method of extracting the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound from the aqueous solution using the organic extraction medium and the extraction conditions are not particularly restricted. According to the above-mentioned purifying method, it is possible to islate the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound as a solid from the aqueous solution. Namely, the solid tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound containing no impurities can be obtained. Next, the following description will explain a method for preparing a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative by reacting a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound obtained by the above purifying method with a compound which forms a monovalent cation seed. More specifically, the present invention will be explained by illustrating, as an example, a method for preparing a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative represented by general formula (2) above by reacting a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound represented by general formula (1) above with a compound which forms a monovalent cation seed. The compound which forms a monovalent cation seed (hereinafter referred to as the cation seed generating compound) according to the present invention can be a compound which forms a monovalent cation seed in a later-described reaction solvent and is reactive with a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound. Specific examples of the monovalent cation seed formed by the cation seed generating compound include: ammonium cations, such as n-butyl ammonium, dimethyl ammonium, trimethyl ammonium, triethyl ammonium, triisopropyl ammonium, tri-n-butyl ammonium, tetramethyl ammonium, tetraethyl ammonium, and tetra-n-butyl ammonium; anilinium cations, such as anilinium, N-methyl anilinium, N,N-dimethyl anilinium, N,N-diethyl anilinium, N,N-diphenyl anilinium, and N,N,N-trimethyl anilinium; pyridinium cations, such as pyridinium, N-methyl pyridinium, and N-benzyl pyridinium; quinolinium cations, such as quinolinium, and isoquinolinium; adamantyl cations, such as adamantan-2-yl-ammonium; phosphonium cations, such as dimethylphenyl phosphonium, triphenyl phosphonium, tetraethyl phosphonium, and tetraphenyl phosphonium; sulfonium cations, such as trimethyl sulfonium, and triphenyl sulfonium; iodonium cations, such as diphenyl iodonium, and di-4-methoxyphenyl iodonium; carbenium cations, such as triphenyl carbenium, and tri-4-methoxyphenyl carbenium; and monovalent cations of metals other than alkali metals and alkaline earth metals. However, the monovalent cation seed is not particularly limited to these examples. Among these compounds, trialkyl ammonium cations, tetraalkyl ammonium cations, dialkyl anilinium cations, alkyl pyridinium cations, tetraalkyl phosphonium cations, tetraaryl phosphonium cations, and diaryl iodonium cations are more preferred. Note that the anionic seed which forms a pair with the monovalent cation seed is not particularly restricted. Specific examples of the cation seed generating compound include: quaternary ammonium compounds, such as tri-n-butyl amine.hydrochloride, N,N-dimethylaniline.hydrochloride, N,N-dimethylaniline sulfate, tri-n-butyl ammonium.hydrochloride, and tetramethylammonium chloride; nitrogen-containing aromatic heterocyclic compounds, such as pyridine hydrochloride, quinoline hydrochloride, N-methylpyridine iodide, and N-methylquinoline iodide; adamantane compounds, such as 2-aminoadamantane hydrochloride; quaternary phosphonium compounds, such as tetra-n-butyl phosphonium bromide, and tetraphenyl phosphonium bromide; sulfonium compounds, such as trimethyl sulfonium chloride, and trimethyl sulfonium iodide; iodonium compounds, such as diphenyl iodonium chloride; and carbenium compounds, such as tritylchloride (triphenylcarbenium chloride). For example, N,N-dimethylaniline hydrochloride forms N,N-dimethylanilinium cation as the monovalent cation seed. In this case, the anionic seed is a chlorine ion. The amount to be used of the compound generating cation seed is not particularly restricted if it is not less than 0.8 equivalent of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound. In the preparation method of the present invention, a reaction solvent is used. Specific examples of the reaction solvent include: water; solvents of the ether series, such as diethyl ether, dipropyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether, diisoamyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane, anisole, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, and 1,4-dioxane; solvents of the aliphatic hydrocarbon series, such as pentane, hexane, and heptane; solvents of the alicyclic hydrocarbons, such as cyclopentane, cyclohexane, and methylcyclohexane; solvents of the ester series, such as methyl acetate, and ethyl acetate; solvents of the aromatic hydrocarbon series, such as benzene, toluene, and xylene; solvents of the alcohol series, such as methyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol; and solvents of the ketone series, such as acetone, and methyl ethyl ketones. However, the reaction solvent is not particularly limited to these examples. It is possible to use only one kind or more than one kind of these compounds. Moreover, for the reaction using an aqueous solution of a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound obtained by the above-mentioned purifying method, water in which the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound is dissolved can be used as the reaction solvent (or part of the reaction solvent). Therefore, according to the preparation method of the present invention, it is possible to prepare a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative with the use of the solution, without isolating the purified tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound from the aqueous solution of the compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound. Specific examples of the method of mixing a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound and a cation seed generating compound include: a method of mixing a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound and a cation seed generating compound in the reaction solvent; a method of mixing a cation seed generating compound or a solution thereof in an aqueous solution of a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound; and a method of mixing a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound or an aqueous solution thereof in a solution of a cation seed generating compound. However, the method of mixing a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound and a cation seed generating compound is not particularly limited to these examples. When mixing the solution of a cation seed generating compound in the aqueous solution of a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound or when mixing the aqueous solution of a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound in the solution of a cation seed generating compound, it is preferred to introduce the solution to be added, by dropping. The temperature and time, i.e., the reaction conditions for the reaction of the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound with the cation seed generating compound, are not particularly restricted. According to the preparation method of the present invention, by stirring a reaction liquid, which is prepared by dissolving the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound and the cation seed generating compound in a reaction solvent, at room temperature for a predetermined time, the reaction can proceed easily. It is therefore possible to easily obtain a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative as an object. For instance, when the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound is an alkali metal salt of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate, an alkaline earth metal salt of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate or an alkaline earth metal halide salt of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate, and when the cation seed generating compound is N,N-dimethylaniline.hydrochloride, N,N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate as an object is obtained by the reaction therebetween, and alkali metal chlorides such as sodium chloride or alkaline earth metal chlorides such as calcium chloride are given as by-products. These alkali metal chlorides or alkaline earth metal chlorides can be easily separated and removed from the solution of N,N-dimethylaniliniumtetrakis (fluoroaryl)borate by, for example, performing separation, filtration, washing, etc. Moreover, for example, when the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound is a hydrogen compound of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate and when the cation seed generating compound is N,N-dimethylaniline.hydrochloride, N,N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis (fluoroaryl) borate as an object is obtained by the reaction therebetween, and a hydrochloric acid is given as a by-product. The hydrochloric acid can be easily separated and removed from N,N-dimethylaniliniumtetrakis (fluoroaryl)borate by, for example, performing separation, washing, etc. In other words, the tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative can be easily isolated and purified as a crystal by performing a simple process, for example, the removal of the reaction solvent (by distillation), if necessary, after performing a simple process such as separation and filtration. As described above, the method for preparing a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivative according to the present invention is a method of reacting a tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound or tris(fluoroaryl)borate compound obtained by the above-mentioned purifying method with a cation seed generating compound. According to this method, it is possible to prepare tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate derivatives from tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compounds, i.e., alkali metal salts of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate, alkaline earth metal salts of tetrakis (fluoroaryl)borate, alkaline earth metal halide salts of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate and hydrogen compounds of tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate, efficiently and at low costs. Since the derivatives do not contain colored components and impurities, for example, halogenated magnesium, they have a high purity and can be suitably used as, for example, a co-catalyst of a metallocene catalyst for a cationic complex polymerization reaction and a catalyst for photopolymerization of silicone. EXAMPLES The following description will explain in great detail the present invention by illustrating examples. However, the present invention is not limited by these examples. Example 1 400 ml of a xylene (organic solvent) solution containing 108.8 g (0.160 moles) of a tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)boratehydrogen as a crude tetrakis(fluoroaryl)borate compound, and 500 ml of ion-exchange water were placed in a 1-liter reaction vessel equipped with a thermometer, a stirrer and a reflux condenser. The purity of the tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)boratehydrogen in the solution was 95.4%. Moreover, the solution was colored black by colored components. Next, the mixture was heated and stirred at 100 C. for 4 hours. Subsequently, the stirring was stopped, and the mixture was cooled to 70 C. As a result, the mixture separated into two layers, i.e., a black xylene layer and a colorless transparent aqueous layer. Then, by performing separation (oil and water separation), only the aqueous layer was separated. The content of the tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)boratehydrogen in the aqueous layer was found by measuring 19 F-NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectrum. More specifically, by using p-fluorotoluene as an internal standard, 19 F-NMR was measured under predetermined conditions. In the measurement, a trifluoroacetic acid was used as a standard material, and the position of the signal was made 0 ppm. Then, the integrated value of fluorine atoms of p-fluorotoluene and the integrated value of fluorine atoms in the ortho position of the pentafluorophenyl group of the tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)boratehydrogen were obtained from the chart of the 19 F-NMR, and the amount of the tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) boratehydrogen was calculated from the integrated values. As a result, it was found that 79.4 g of colorless tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) boratehydrogen was contained in the aqueous layer, and the purity was 99.0%. Besides, the recovery of the tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate hydrogen was 73.0%.

The solution was colored black by colored components. Next, the mixture was heated to 100 C. with stirring in order to remove xylene by distillation. Water which distilled off by forming an azeotropic composition with xylene was separated, and then returned to the reaction vessel through the dropping funnel. The heating was stopped at the time 200 ml of xylene was removed by distillation, and the mixture was cooled to 70 C. As a result, the mixture separated into two layers, i.e., a black xylene layer and a white aqueous layer. Then, by performing separation, only the aqueous layer was separated.

The heating was stopped at the time the removal of di-n-butyl ether by distillation was completed, and the mixture was cooled to 70 C. As a result, a black oily layer remained at the bottom of the reaction vessel. Thereafter, 100 ml of toluene as an aromatic hydrocarbon was placed in the reaction vessel through the dropping funnel, and heated and stirred at 70 C. for one hour.

The solution was colored black by colored components. Next, after carrying out reflux intermittently for 60 hours while stirring the ion-exchange water in the reaction vessel to perform extraction, heating and stirring were stopped. The aqueous solution (extract) in the reaction vessel and the aqueous layer in the Soxhlet extractor were colorless and transparent. The aqueous layer in the Soxhlet extractor was separated and this aqueous solution and extract were combined.

The compounds may be bonded to inorganic or organic carriers. Their d-8 metal complexes are valuable catalysts for the enantioselective hydrogenation of prochiral organic compounds with carbon multiple bonds or carbon/hetero atom multiple bonds. The present invention relates to mono- and di-(halogenmethyl)-diphenyidiiodides, -dibromides and -diamines; mono- and di-(hydroxymethyl)-diphenyldiiodides, -dibromides and -diamines and mono- and di-(aminomethyl)-diphenyidiiodides, -dibromides and -diamines; mono- and di-(hydroxymethyl)-diphenyldiphosphines and mono- and di-(aminomethyl)-diphenyldiphosphines, as well as 2-hydroxypropane-1,3-dioxyl-diphenyidiphosphines; mono- and di-(hydroxymethyl)-diphenyldiphosphines and mono- and di-(aminomethyl)-di-phenyldiphosphines, as well as 2-hydroxypropane-1,3-dioxyl-diphenyidiphosphines, the hydroxyl groups or amino groups of which are provided with functional groups via a bridging group; inorganic and organic polymeric carriers which are immobilised with said diphosphines; metal complexes of the monomeric and immobilised diphosphines; and the use of the metal complexes as homogeneous and enantioselective catalysts in the synthesis of organic compounds, for example hydrogenation. In Pure and Appl. Chem., Vol. 68, No. 1, pp. 131-138 (1996), R. Schmid et al. describe atropisomeric 6,6-dimethyl- and 6,6-dimethoxy-2,2-diphenyldiphosphines as chiral ligands in metal complexes, which are used for the hydrogenation of prochiral ketones and olefins, whereby high optical yields may be attained. The catalysts can only be extracted from the reaction mixtures with difficulty and incompletely, so that it is impossible to reuse them for further reactions. In WO 98/01457, B. Pugin et al. describe the functionalisation of chiral ferrocenyldiphosphines as ligands for metal complexes and the immobilisation on inorganic and organic carriers, which may be used as enantioselective hydrogenation catalysts. These catalysts may be easily separated from the reaction mixture and reused. It has now been found that, in a simple manner, functionalised 2,2-diphenyidiphosphines can be prepared and may be immobilised both on inorganic and on organic polymeric carriers, and can also be used as water-soluble and/or extractable and/or adsorbable ligands/catalysts. The immobilised diphosphine ligands bond with d-8 metals such as rhodium, ruthenium and iridium complexes which may be used as highly effective catalysts in enantioselective hydrogenation of carbon-carbon, carbon-nitrogen or carbon-oxygen double bonds. The selectivity, activity and total yield for immobilised systems are surprisingly high. The catalysts may be easily separated from the reaction solution and reused. Almost no metal or ligand losses occur. In addition, immobilised diphenyidiphosphine ligands especially on inorganic carriers have surprisingly high stability, which is especially important for reusage. Therefore, using these immobilised catalysts, large-scale hydrogenation may be carried out especially economically. The reaction to be catalysed may be carried out even heterogeneously or homogeneously through the choice of polymer, for example in the case of polymer-bound diphosphine ligands. The polymer may be prepared in such a way, or also subsequently specifically modified in such a way that the polymer-bound catalyst dissolves in the reaction medium, and can be easily separated after the reaction by filtration, ultrafiltration, extraction or adsorption on carriers, and then reused. The catalysts can be reused several times. Through the choice of polymer, the catalyst may be optimally adapted to the reaction medium during the hydrogenation step, and then completely separated, which is important in particular for hydrogenation carried out on a large scale. The production of these immobilised or extractable and/or adsorbable diphenyldiphosphines is made possible only by providing correspondingly functionalised diphenyldiphosphines. Therefore, particular importance is placed on these intermediates and their preparation. In all cases, recovery of the noble metals contained therein is simplified if the catalyst has to be exchanged after frequent recycling. Frequently, further purification of the hydrogenated product can be dispensed with, since the catalyst can be removed practically quantitatively. A first object of the invention is compounds of formula I, wherein R 1 is methyl chloride, methyl bromide or methyl iodide, R 2 is C 1 -C 4 -alkyl or C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy or has the same significance as R 1 , and R 3 is Br, I or NH 2 . R 1 is preferably methyl bromide. R 2 is preferably alkyl, and as alkyl preferably signifies ethyl and most preferably methyl. R 2 as alkoxy preferably signifies methoxy or ethoxy. R 3 is preferably Br or I. The preparation thereof may be effected in known manner by the radical halogenation of the methyl groups of 2,2-di-R 3 -6,6-dimethyl-diphenyl with appropriate halogenation agents, for example Cl 2 , Br 2 , I 2 , interhalogen compounds such as ClBr, ClI, or SOCl 2 , SOBr 2 , SOI 2 , and organic halogen compounds such as CF 3 CL, CF 3 Br, CF 3 I, CCl 3 I, as well as N-halogenated acid amides, for example N-chloro-, -bromo- and -iodosuccinimide. Depending on the amount of halogenation agent, mono- or dihalogen-methyl-diphenyls are primarily obtained, whereby mixtures of the compounds may be separated by distillation, by chromatographic methods or by crystallisation. The oily or crystalline compounds of formula I are valuable initial products for the production of atropisomeric diphosphines. A further object of the invention is compounds of formula II, wherein R 3 is Br, I or NH 2 , R 4 is hydroxymethyl, aminomethyl, hydroxy-, amino- or cyano-C 2 -C 8 -alkoxy, hydroxy-, amino- or cyano-C 2 -C 8 -alkoxymethyl, or hydroxy-, amino- or cyano-C 2 -C 8 -alkylaminomethyl, and R 5 has the same significance as R 4 , or R 5 is C 1 -C 4 -alkyl or C 1 -C 4 -alkoxy, or R 4 and R 5 together are HOCH(CH 2 O) 2 , H 2 NCH(CH 2 O) 2 , or hydroxy-, amino- or cyano C 2 -C 8 -alkylOCH(CH 2 O) 2 . R 3 is preferably Br or I and especially I. C 2 -C 8 -alkyl in the hydroxy-, amino- or cyanoalkyl groups is preferably C 2 -C 6 -alkyl, more preferably C 2 -C 4 -alkyl, for example C 2 -, C 3 -alkyl or C 4 -alkyl.

If R 5 signifies alkyl, R 4 is preferably hydroxymethyl, aminomethyl, hydroxy-, amino- or cyano-C 2 -C 8 -alkoxymethyl, or hydroxy-, amino- or cyano-C 2 -C 8 -alkylaminomethyl. If R 5 signifies alkoxy, R 4 is preferably amino- or cyano-C 2 -C 8 -alkoxy. The hydroxy, amino or cyano groups are preferably primary groups. The compounds of formula II may be produced by known synthesis methods. Thus, the methyl halide group in the compounds of formula I can be hydroxylated or aminated in known manner. These hydroxy or amino compounds, or the known 2-alkoxy-2-hydroxy-6,6-substituted diphenyl, or the known 2,2-dihydroxy-6,6-substituted diphenyl, or a compound of formula which is obtainable by reacting 2,2-dihydroxy-6,6-substituted diphenyl with epichlorohydrin or 1,3-dichloro-2-hydroxypropane, is reacted with cyanoalkenyl and then the cyano group is hydrogenated, or reacted with hydroxyhalogen- or aminohalogen-alkanes, or with ethylene oxide or aziridine. The HO group may be substituted by a NH 2 group in known manner, for example first of all halogenated and then reacted with 1,1-carbonyl-diimidazole; hydrolysis then yields the free amine. The compounds of formula II are eminently suitable for producing corresponding diphenyldiphosphines, in which the functional groups may undergo prior or subsequent modification in conventional manner by conversion into other functional groups or by a reaction with difunctional chain extenders, for example epoxides, hydroxyalkyl cyanates, halo-alkanols, halo-alkane nitrites, halo-alkane phthalimides, dicarboxylic acids or diisocyanates. The phosphine groups are introduced in known manner see Pure and Appl. Chem., Vol. 68, No. 1, pp. 131-138 (1996) by reacting compounds of formula 11 with lithium alkyls, for example lithium butyl, and reacting these with secondary phosphine halides, for example chlorides. The functional groups may be provided with appropriate protecting groups, a large number of which are known. The introduction of the phosphine groups may also take place in stages, whereupon unsymmetrically substituted diphenyldiphosphines are obtainable. This functionalisation is described in detail in WO 98/01457.

Another preferred group of compounds is obtained if R 10 and R 11 signify unsubstituted phenyl or mono- or disubstituted phenyl.

In the context of this invention, functional group means that this group forms a chemical bond by addition or substitution with other functional groups. At the functional groups, chain lengthening may be undertaken for example and/or a polymerisable group may be bonded by known methods. Known methods are for example etherification, esterification, amidation, urea formation and urethane formation. Processes for the derivatisation of functional groups are known from organic chemistry textbooks (E. Breitmaier, Gnther Jung; Organische Chemie II (1983); Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York pp.342, 409ff). Examples of C-bonded functional groups are the carboxylic acid, carboxylate, carboxylic acid ester, carboxylic acid amide, carboxylic acid halide, cyano, imino, aldehyde, ketone, amine, alcohol, isocyanate, halogen or glycidyl group. The functional group may also be a polymerisable group, and in this case is preferably a vinyl group that is unsubstituted or substituted by C 1 -C 4 -alkyl. It may be bonded, for example, by an amide or ester group to the bridging group. The polymerisable group may be derived from ethylenically unsaturated alcohols, amines and isocyanates, for example allyl alcohol, allyl amine, allyl isocyanate, croton alcohol; monoesters or monoamides of dicarboxylic acids and unsaturated alcohols and amines; functional styrenes, for example chloromethylstyrene, hydroxystyrene, hydroxyethoxystyrene, styreneamine, styrene-hydroxyethylamine, styrenecarboxylic acid, styrenesulphonic acid, vinyl hydroxyethylether, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylic and methacrylic acid amide, acrylic- and methacrylic acid-C 2 -C 6 -hydroxyalkyl-amide, acrylic- and methacrylic acid-C 2 -C 6 -hydroxyalkyl-ester. The functional group which is bonded by a bridging group B to one of its carbon atoms preferably signifies an amine, alcohol, isocyanate, carboxylic acid, carboxylic acid ester, carboxylic acid amide, carboxylic acid halide group or a polymerisable group. Linkage by means of these functional groups may be carried out by generally known processes. It is fundamentally also possible to transform existing functional groups into other functional groups, for example CH 2 OH groups by oxidation into carboxylic acids, carboxylic acids into amides or halides, amine groups into isocyanate groups, alcohols or amines into carbonates or urethanes. Furthermore, it is possible to react alcohols or amines first of all with halocarboxylic acids (for example chloroacetic acid). Chain extenders, for example epoxides, aziridines, diols, diamines, dicarboxylic acids or dicarboxylic acid esters and diisocyanates, may also be used once or repeatedly in series, thus specifically determining the length of the extending group. These linking methods and processes are known and are described in specialist literature. If the functional group FU signifies (O)CH, (O)C(C 1 -C 12 )-alkyl, COOH, COCl or COO(C 1 -C 6 )-alkyl, these groups can also be converted into other functional groups by reduction, transesterification or other known standard reactions from organic chemistry. For example, the aldehyde group is easily converted into an amine group by means of a reaction with an amine and subsequent hydrogenation. Reduction to the alcohol with, for example, LiAIH 4 is likewise possible. If the functional group signifies OH, NH 2 or NH(C 1 -C 12 -alkyl), it can be functionalised to an oxyalkylsilyl group by means of a reaction with a compound of formula (R 18 ) n (R 19 O) 3n SiR 20 NCO, whereby R 20 is C 1 -C 12 -alkylene, R 19 is C 1 -C 12 alkyl, R 18 is C 1 -C 12 alkyl or OR 19 and n is 0, 1 or 2.

Some preferred examples of compounds of formula III are those of formula wherein R 6 and R 7 denote identical or different secondary phosphine groups, R 21 is H, NH 2 (CH 2 ) 3 , (C 1 - or C 2 -alkoxy) 3 Si(CH 2 ) 3 NHC(O), R 22 signifies HOCH 2 , H 2 NCH 2 , NC(CH 2 ) 2 OCH 2 H 2 N(CH 2 ) 3 OCH 2 or H 2 N(CH 2 ) 3 HNCH 2 , R 23 is HO(CH 2 ) 2 O or HO(CH 2 ) 3 O, H 2 N(CH 2 ) 2 O or H 2 N(CH 2 ) 3 O, and R 24 has the same significance as R 23 or is methoxy. A further aspect of the invention is metal complexes of formulae V, Va and Vb of d-8 metals with the compounds of formula III, whereby R 6 , R 7 , R 8 and R 9 have the above-mentioned significances and preferences; Y denotes two monoolefin ligands or one diene ligand; Me signifies a d-8 metal selected from the group Ir and Rh; D is Cl, Br or I; and E is the anion of an oxyacid or complex acid; X 2 and X 2 are identical or different and have the significance of D and E, or X 2 and X 2 are allyl or 2-methylallyl, or X 2 has the significance of D and E and X 2 is hydride. Metal complexes in which Y is 1,5-hexadiene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene or norbornadiene are preferred. In the metal complexes according to the invention, D is preferably Cl, Br or I. In the preferred metal complexes, E is ClO 4 , CF 3 SO 3 , CH 3 SO 3 , HSO 4 , BF 4 , B(Phenyl) 4 , PF 6 , SbCl 6 , AsF 6 or SbF 6 . Further ruthenium complexes that may be considered are known in literature and are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,691,037, 4,739,085, 4,739,084, EP 269395, EP 271310, EP 271311, EP 307168, EP 366390, EP 470756, JP 08081484, JP 08081485, JP 09294932, EP 831099, EP 826694, EP 841343, J. P. Gent, Arcos Organics Acta, 1 (1995) 4, N. C. Zanetti et al., Organometallics 15 (1996) 860. The metal complexes of formulae V, Va or Vb are produced by methods known in literature. The compounds of formulae V, Va and Vb represent catalysts that are already homogeneous and can be used, for example, for hydrogenation of unsaturated organic compounds. The metal complexes are preferably used for the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral compounds with carbon/carbon or carbon/hetero atom multiple bonds, in particular double bonds. Hydrogenations of this type with soluble homogeneous metal complexes are described, for example, in Pure and AppI. Chem., Vol. 68, No.1, pp. 131-138 (1996). The compounds of formula III may be covalently bonded to inorganic or organic carriers in a simple manner. A further aspect of the invention is inorganic or organic polymeric carriers, to which diphosphines of formula III are bonded. These are characterised in that they are bonded by the functional group FU of radicals R 8, R 9 or R 8 and R 9 to the inorganic or polymeric organic carrier, whereby the radicals R 6 , R 7 , R 8 and R 9 have the above-mentioned significances and preferences. The diphosphines of formula III are preferably bonded to the surface of these carriers. This has the advantage that catalytically active groups of corresponding d-8 metal complexes are also accessible and no inclusion occurs. In this way, during hydrogenation, less catalyst-containing carrier can also be used. If the compounds of formula III are bonded to inorganic carriers, the functional group FU thereof is advantageously first of all reacted with an alkoxysilylalkyl isocyanate, for example a compound of formula (VI) (R 25 ) n (R 26 O) 3n SiR 27 NCO(VI), wherein R 27 is C 1 -C 12 -alkylene, R 26 is C 1 -C 12 alkyl, R 25 is C 1 -C 4 -alkyl or OR 26 and n is 0, 1 or 2; FU in formula III in this case is defined as OH, NH 2 or NH(C 1 -C 12 )-alkyl. Compounds of formula (IIIa) are obtained, wherein the group BFU in radicals R 8 and R 9 is a radical of formula X 3 C(O)NHR 27 Si(R 25 ) n (R 26 O) 3n wherein X 3 signifies O, NH or N(C 1 -C 4 -alkyl), and n, R 25 , R 26 and R 27 have the above-mentioned significances. These compounds are intermediates in the preparation of diphenyidiphosphines bonded to inorganic carriers. A further aspect of the invention is a solid inorganic carrier, which is characterised in that it has diphosphine ligands of formula IIa bonded at the surface by one or two silyl groups of the radical of formula X 3 C(O)NHR 27 Si(R 25 ) n (R 26 O) 3n During this bonding, 1, 2 or 3 alkoxy groups in the silyl radical can be replaced by bonds. The solid carrier in question may be silicates and semi-metal or metal oxides, as well as glass, which preferably exists as powders with average particle sizes of 10 nm to 2000 m, preferably 10 nm to 1000 m, most preferably 10 nm to 500 m. The particles may be both compact and porous. Porous particles preferably have high internal areas, for example 1 to 1200 m 2 , preferably 30 to 600 m 2 . Examples of oxides and silicates are SiO 2 , TiO 2 , ZrO 2 , MgO, NiO, WO 3 , Al 2 O 3 , La 2 O 3 , silica gels, clays and zeolites. Preferred carriers are silica gels, aluminium oxide, titanium oxide or glass and mixtures thereof. One example of glass as a carrier is Controlled Pore Glass, which is available commercially. Preparation of the diphosphine ligands of formula IIa, which are bonded to inorganic carriers, is described in WO 98/01457. Owing to the presence of alkoxysilane groups, the compounds of formula IIIa may also be reacted directly to polysiloxanes in a sol-gel process. Reactions of this type have been described for example by U. Deschler et al. in Angew. Chem. 98, (1986), 237-253. A further aspect of the invention is organic polymeric carriers, to which diphenylphosphines of formula Ill are bonded by at least one OH, NH 2 group or functional group FU, whereby the radicals R 6 , R 7 , R 8 und R 9 have the above-mentioned significances and preferences. These carriers include both polymers which contain as structural elements the diphenyldiphosphines of formula III, which are bonded by at least one OH, NH 2 group or functional group FU, and polymer particles in which the diphenyldiphosphines of formula II, which are bonded by at least one OH, NH 2 group or functional group FU, are bonded to functional groups at the surface of the particles. The organic polymeric carriers may be uncrosslinked thermoplastic, crosslinked or structurally crosslinked polymers, which contain functional groups. The polymers containing functional groups may be either polymers of olefinically unsaturated monomers, for example polyolefins, polyacrylates, polyisoprene, polybutadiene, polystyrene, polyphenylene, polyvinychloride, polyvinylidene chloride or polyallyl compounds, polyaddition compounds, for example polyurethanes or polyethers, or polycondensated products, for example polyesters or polyamides. The monomers which form the polymer are preferably selected from the group styrene, p-methylstyrene or -methylstyrene, which contain functional groups. Another preferred group of polymers is formed by monomers that are derived from ,-unsaturated acids, their esters or amides. Particularly preferred are monomers from the group of acrylates and their C 1 -C 4 -alkylesters, methacrylates and their C 1 -C 4 -alkylesters, acrylamide and acrylonitrile. An equally preferred group is derived from monomers from the group of acrylates and their C 1 -C 4 -alkylesters, methacrylates and their C 1 -C 4 -alkylesters, which contain as structural elements, in bonded form, a hydroxyl group or a primary or secondary amine group as functional groups in the ester group. Bonding of the diphenyldiphosphines of formula III to the polymeric carriers may take place in various ways. One preferred group of polymerically bonded compounds of formula III is formed in such a way that FU illustrates an olefinically unsaturated radical which is bonded by an ester group OC(O)CR c CR d R e or an amide group OC(NR f )CR c CR d R e to the bridging group B, wherein R c , R d , R e und R f independently of one another, are hydrogen or C 1 -C 6 -alkyl, and these are used as comonomers in the radical polymerisation of olefinically unsaturated further monomers. Examples and preferences of further monomers are mentioned above. For the remaining radicals of the compounds of formula III, the above-mentioned significances and preferences apply. Radical polymerisation is effected in known manner, and a copolymer is obtained which contains diphenyldiphosphine ligands in bonded form. Another possibility is a polymer-analogous reaction, such as that described by R. Cullen et. al. in J. of Organometallic Chemistry, 333 (1987), 269-280. Polymer-analogous reactions are possible with polycondensates, such as polyesters, polyamines, which contain directly in a side chain or in the polymer chain a further functional group that is capable of condensation. Examples are hydroxyl-group-containing polyesters or polyethers, which can be reacted with compounds of formula III, whereby in this case the functional group FU preferably signifies COO(C 1 -C 12 )-alkyl or COCl. A further group of preferred polymers that are suitable for polymer-analogous reactions is formed by monomers which contain vinyl alcohol as a homopolymer or vinyl alcohol as a copolymer with vinyl acetate, stearate, benzoate, maleate, vinyl butyral, allyl phthalate, allyl melamine. Suitable polymers which are equally preferred for polymer-analogous reactions are formed from phenol and a C 1 -C 4 -aldehyde, most preferably from phenol and formaldehyde. The polymers are known as phenol-formaldehyde resins, especially as novolaks, and are available commercially. Another preferred group of polymers which are suitable for polymer-analogous reactions is derived from bisglycidyl ethers and diols. These are hydroxyl-functional polyethers, which are produced for example from bisglycidyl ethers and bisphenol A. These polyepoxides may be built up from diepoxide comonomers with preferably 6 to 40, most preferably 8 to 30 carbon atoms, and diols as comonomers with preferably 2 to 200, most preferably 2 to 50 carbon atoms. One preferred group derived therefrom is formed from monomers, which build up a polymer from cyclic C 3 -C 6 -ethers or C 2 -C 6 -alkylene glycols with bisglycidyl ethers. The bisglycidyl ethers may be aromatic, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic. Further preferred polymers with hydroxyl groups as functional groups are polysaccharides. Especially preferred are partial cellulose acetates, propionates or butyrates, partial cellulose ethers, starch, chitin and chitosan. Further polymers are derived from polymers having reducible groups, for example nitrile groups, ketone groups, carboxylic acid esters and carboxylic acid amides. Insoluble polymers may also be used in the reaction medium, and these are functionalised at the surface with hydroxyl or amine groups by means of a chemical or physical process. For example, partially unsaturated polymers are provided at their surface with hydroxyl groups by means of oxidation, e.g. with hydrogen peroxide. Another possibility is plasma treatment in, for example, an oxygen atmosphere, nitrogen atmosphere or ammonia atmosphere. The polymers are preferably present as powders. Of these carriers, polystyrene is preferred in particular, and this is subsequently functionalised by known methods with hydroxyl, amino or hydroxymethyl groups. An especially preferred group is formed by a polymeric organic material with structural elements, in which at least one isocyanate group FU in compounds of formula III is bonded to hydroxyl or amine groups, forming a urethane or urea bond, whereby the hydroxyl or amine groups are bonded directly or in a side chain of the polymer chain. Monomers of formula III with isocyanate groups are obtainable in a simple manner by reacting diisocyanates with amine- or hydroxyl-functional compounds of formula III. The diphenyidiphosphine radicals of formula III may be present as enantiomer mixtures. The radicals are preferably present in the form of the optically active isomers. One preferred group of immobilised polymers according to the invention is that in which hydroxy- or amino-functional polymers are first of all reacted with one isocyanate group of diisocyanates and then the second isocyanate group is reacted with a hydroxy- or amino-functional diphosphine of formula III. The choice of diisocyanate is in itself not critical. Suitable diisocyantes that are available on a large scale are described for example in Houben Weyl, Makromolekulare Stoffe, volume E 20, pages 1587 to 1583, 1987 edition. Preference is given to diisocyanates with a bridging group Q, which is selected from the group linear or branched, aliphatic C 2 -C 20 -alkyl which is unsubstituted or mono- to polysubstituted by C 1 -C 6 -alkyl, C 1 -C 6 -alkoxy; C 3 -C 8 -cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl which is unsubstituted or mono- to polysubstituted by C 1 -C 6 -alkyl, C 1 -C 6 -alkoxy; linear or branched aliphatic C 2 -C 20 -alkyl unsubstituted or substituted by C 1 -C 6 -alkyl, C 1 -C 6 -alkoxy and interrupted by C 3 -C 8 -cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by C 1 -C 6 -alkyl, C 1 -C 6 -alkoxy; phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl or C 3 -C 10 -heteroaryl either unsubstituted or mono- to polysubstituted by C 1 -C 6 -alkyl, C 1 -C 6 -alkoxy; linear or branched aliphatic C 2 -C 20 -alkyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by C 1 -C 6 -alkyl, C 1 -C 6 -alkoxy and is interrupted by phenyl, naphthyl or C 3 -C 10 -heteroaryl. Heterocycloalkyl is e.g. pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, oxazolidine, dioxolan or an isocyanuric acid triester group. Heteroaryl is for example pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrrole, furan, imidazole, pyrazole or triazine. Especially preferred diisocyanates are 1,6-bis-isocyanate-hexane, 5-isocyanate-3-(isocyanatemethyl)-1,1,3-trimethylcyclohexane, 1,3-bis-5-isocyanate-1,3,3-trimethyl-phenyl-2,4-dioxo-1,3-diazetidine, 3,6-bis-9-isocyanate-nonyl-4,5-di-(1-heptenyl)-cyclohexene, bis-4-iso-cyanate-cyclohexyl-methane, trans-1,4-bis-isocyanate-cyclohexane, 1,3-bis-isocyanate-methyl-benzene, 1,3-bis-1-isocyanate-1-methyl-ethyl-benzene, 1,4-bis-2-cyanate-ethyl-cyclohexane, 1,3-bis-isocyanate-methyl-cyclohexane, 1,4-bis-1-isocyanate-1-methylethyl-benzene, bis-isocyanate-isododecylbenzene, 1,4-bis-isocyanate-benzene, 2,4-bis-isocyanate-toluene, 2,6-bis-isocyanate-toluene, 2,4/2,6-bis-isocyanate-toluene, 2-ethyl-1,2,3-tris-3-isocyanate-4-methyl-anilinocarbonyloxy-propane, N,N-bis-3-isocyanate-4-methylphenyl-urea, 1,4-bis-3-isocyanate-4-methylphenyl-2,4-dioxo-1,3-diazetidine, 1,3,5-tris-3-isocyanate-4-methylphenyl-2,4,6-trioxohexahydro-1,3,5-triazine, 1,3-bis-3-isocyanate-4-methylphenyl-2,4,5-trioxoimidazolidine, bis-2-isocyanate-phenyl-methane, (2-isocyanate-phenyl)-(4-isocyanate-phenyl)-methane, bis-4-isocyanate-phenyl-methane, 2,4-bis-4-isocyanate-benzyl-1-isocyanatbenzene, 4-isocyanate-3-(4-isocyanate-benzyl)-phenyl-2-isocyanate-5-(4-isocyanate-benzyl)-phenylmethane, tris-4-isocyanate-phenyl-methane, 1,5-bis-isocyanate-naphthaline, or 4,4-bisisocyanate-3,3-dimethyl-biphenyl. Particularly preferred diisocyanates are 1,6-bis-isocyanate-hexan, 5-isocyanate-3-(isocyanate-methyl)-1,1,3-trimethylcyclohexane, 2,4-bis-isocyanate-toluene, 2,6-bis-isocyanate-toluene, 2,4-/2,6-bis-isocyanate-toluene or bis-4-isocyanate-phenyl-methane. The polymers to be used according to the invention, which contain hydroxyl groups and amine groups, may be uncrosslinked thermoplastic, crosslinked or structurally crosslinked polymers. Examples of hydroxyl-group-containing polymers are those mentioned above. The polymers to be used according to the invention are known per se, partly commercial or may be produced by known polymerisation processes or by subsequent modification of polymers. The polymeric organic materials preferably have a molecular weight of 5000 to 5,000,000 daltons, most preferably 50,000 to 1,000,000 daltons. A preferred sub-group of polymeric organic materials is highly crosslinked macroporous polystyrene or polyacrylate. Another preferred group of polymers is formed by weakly crosslinked polystyrene. An example thereof is polystyrene crosslinked with 1-5% divinylbenzene. The particle size of the polymeric organic materials is preferably 10 m to 2000 m. The highly crosslinked polymeric organic materials preferably have a specific area of 20 m 2 /g to 1000 m 2 /g, most preferably 50 m 2 /g to 500 m 2 g, determined by the BET method. Production of the diphenyldiphosphines that are bonded to inorganic or organic carriers may be effected analogously to the processes described in WO 98/01457. A further aspect of the invention is the d-8 metal complexes of inorganic or organic polymeric carriers, to which diphenyldiphosphines of formula VII, VIIa or VIIb are bonded by at least one HO, H 2 N group or functional group FU, whereby the radicals R 6 , R 7 , R 8 , R 9 , Me, E, Y, X 2 and X 2 and the carrier have the above-mentioned significances and preferences. Production of metal complexes with the polymeric carrier may take place by methods known in literature for the production of analogous homogeneous catalysts. A further aspect of the invention is diphenyldiphosphine ligands of formula III and their d-8 metal complexes of formulae VII, VIIa and VIIb with a molecular weight of preferably less than 5000 daltons, which contain solubility-enhancing or adsorption-facilitating groups bonded to at least one HO, H 2 N or functional group FU, which groups can be separated by extraction with immiscible liquids or by adsorption on a carrier. During extraction, it is preferable to use two immiscible liquids. When using such diphenyldiphosphines and the d-8 metal complexes thereof, there is almost no loss of metal or ligand. Therefore, using these extractable or adsorbable catalysts, large-scale hydrogenation may be carried out especially economically. A preferred group of soluble compounds is those that are soluble in aqueous media. Suitable immiscible liquids that may be mentioned are, for example, water and organic solvents that are immiscible with water, such as alkanes (for example hexane), chlorinated alkanes (for example methylene chloride, chloroform), aryls (for example toluene, benzene, xylene) or esters (for example ethyl acetate) or organic solvent systems such as fluorinated hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons. Carriers that are suitable for adsorption are metal oxides, for example silica gel, aluminium oxide, or reversed phase silica gel, polar and apolar polymers and ion exchangers (preferably for ligands with charged radicals). Suitable solubility-enhancing or adsorption-facilitating radicals may be taken from the publication I. T. Horvth et al. in Science, Vol. 266, pages 72-75 (1994). Preferred solubility-enhancing radicals for extractable diphenyidiphosphines are, for example, lipophilic radicals which are derived from alkanes having a molecular weight of between 100 and 2000 daltons, or also hydrophilic, optionally charged radicals, which are derived from sugars, or from polymers, for example polyvinyl alcohols, polyacrylic acids, polyethylene glycols, polyvinyl toluene or dendrimers. Preferred adsorption-facilitating radicals are, for example, lipophilic radicals which are derived from alkanes having a molecular weight of between 100 and 2000 daltons, and also fluoroalkanes. Further examples of extractable or adsorbable radicals are those that are derived from poly-ethylene glycols, polyhydroxy hydrocarbons, polyamino hydrocarbons and the ammonium salts thereof, polycarboxyl hydrocarbons and the alkali metal salts thereof, polyhydroxy hydrocarbons or polyamino hydrocarbons, which are reacted with halo-carboxylic acids, polyvinyl alcohols, polyaryl acids and the alkali metal salts thereof, higher alkanes and perfluoroalkanes. The metal complexes according to the invention are eminently suitable as catalysts for the hydrogenation of organic double and triple bonds. Examples are compounds which contain the groups CC, CN, CO, CCN or CCO (see for example K. E. Knig, The Applicability of Asymmetric Homogeneous Catalysis, in James D. Morrison (ed.), Asymmetric Synthesis, Vol. 5, Academic Press, 1985). The metal complexes according to the invention are especially suitable for the enantioselective hydrogenation of compounds having prochiral carbon double bonds and carbon/hetero atom double bonds. Examples of such compounds are prochiral alkenes, imines and ketones. After the reaction, the catalysts according to the invention may be practically completely separated from the reaction mixture in a simple manner, for example by decanting, centrifuging, filtration, ultrafiltration, extraction or adsorption, and reused. One particular advantage of this is that they can be reused several times without any notable losses of activity or selectivity . The catalysts which are functionalised and immobilised according to the invention often have improved optical yields when compared with the previously known diphenylphosphine catalysts. A further aspect of the invention is therefore the use of the metal complexes of d-8 metals according to the invention as heterogeneous or homogeneous catalysts for the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral compounds with carbon double bonds or carbon/hetero atom double bonds. The metal complexes are preferably used for the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral compounds with carbon double bonds or carbon/hetero atom double bonds, especially the Ir complexes for the hydrogenation of prochiral ketimines. A further aspect of the invention is a process for the asymmetric hydrogenation of compounds with carbon double bonds or carbon/hetero atom double bonds, which is characterised in that the compounds are reacted at a temperature of 20 to 80 C. and at a hydrogen pressure of 10 5 to 210 7 Pa in the presence of catalytic amounts of one or more metal complexes according to the invention. Catalysts are preferably employed in amounts of 0.0001 to 10 mol %, more preferably 0.001 to 10 mol %, most preferably 0.01 to 5 mol %, based on the compound to be hydrogenated. Hydrogenation may be carried out continuously or intermittently in various types of reactor. Preference is given to the reactors which allow comparatively favourable blending and good heat removal, e.g. loop reactors. This type of reactor has proved to be particularly effective when using small amounts of catalyst. The hydrogenated organic compounds that may be produced according to the invention are active substances or intermediates for producing such substances, especially in the field of pharmaceutical and agrochemical production. For example, o,o-dialkylarylketamine derivatives, especially those with alkyl and/or alkoxyalkyl groups, have fungicidal activity, especially herbicidal activity. The derivatives in question may be amine salts, acid amides, e.g. of chloroacetic acid, tertiary amines and ammonium salts (see e.g. EP-A-0 077 755 and EP-A-0 115 470). The following examples illustrate the invention.

E) Hydrogenation Examples E1-E14 Hydrogenation of Acetamidocinnamic Acid Methyl Ester Hydrogenation is carried out as follows: 0.0125 mmols of Rh(NBD)2BF4 and 0.015 mmols of polymer are placed under argon in a flask having a magnetic stirrer by repeatedly applying a vacuum and rinsing with argon. Then, 2 ml of degassed methanol are added, the mixture is stirred slowly for 10 minutes (if there are insoluble immobilised ligands, the solution loses its colour and the carrier becomes orange) and 8 ml of a degassed methanolic solution of 2.5 mmols of acetamidocinnamic acid methyl ester are added. Then, without stirring, the argon is replaced by hydrogen (normal pressure) by applying a vacuum and rinsing with hydrogen, and hydrogenation is started by switching on the stirrer. The progress of the reaction can be followed by the consumption of hydrogen (pressure drop in the hydrogen reservoir). The results are listed in table 1.

CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a non-provisional application related to U.S. application Ser. No. 60/105,830, filed on Oct. 27, 1998 priority of which is claimed hereunder. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This application is directed to an improved process for making methythiophenyl hydroxyketones such as (S)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1 -(4-methylthiophenyl)butan-1-one. These compounds are intermediates useful in the preparation of certain compounds that selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Compounds having COX-2 selectivity, for example, are found in WO 97/14691 filed on Oct. 9, 1996 and published on Apr. 24, 1997. Non-steroidal, antiinflammatory drugs exert most of their antiinflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity and inhibit hormone-induced uterine contractions and certain types of cancer growth through inhibition of prostaglandin G/H synthase, also known as cyclooxygenase. Initially, only one form of cyclooxygenase was known, this corresponding to cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) or the constitutive enzyme, as originally identified in bovine seminal vesicles. More recently the gene for a second inducible form of cyclooxygenase, COX-2 has been cloned, sequenced and characterized initially from chicken, murine and human sources. This enzyme is distinct from the COX-1 which has been cloned, sequenced and characterized from various sources including the sheep, the mouse and man. The second form of cyclooxygenase, COX-2, is rapidly and readily inducible by a number of agents including mitogens, endotoxin, hormones, cytokines and growth factors. As prostaglandins have both physiological and pathological roles, we have concluded that the constitutive enzyme, COX-1, is responsible, in large part, for endogenous basal release of prostaglandins and hence is important in their physiological functions such as the maintenance of gastrointestinal integrity and renal blood flow. In contrast, we have concluded that the inducible form, COX-2, is mainly responsible for the pathological effects of prostaglandins where rapid induction of the enzyme would occur in response to such agents as inflammatory agents, hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. Thus, a selective inhibitor of COX-2 will have similar antiinflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic properties to a non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug, and in addition would inhibit hormone-induced uterine contractions and have potential anti-cancer effects, but will have a diminished ability to induce some of the mechanism-based side effects. In particular, such a compound should have a reduced potential for gastrointestinal toxicity, a reduced potential for renal side effects, a reduced effect on bleeding times and possibly a lessened ability to induce asthma attacks in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic subjects. Furthermore, such a compound will also inhibit prostanoid-induced smooth muscle contraction by preventing the synthesis of contractile prostanoids and hence may be of use in the treatment of dysmenorrhea, premature labour, asthma and eosinophil related disorders. It will also be of use in the treatment of Alzheimers disease, for decreasing bone loss particularly in postmenopausal women (i.e. treatment of osteoporosis) and for the treatment of glaucoma. A brief description of the potential utility of selective COX-2 inhibitors is given in an article by John Vane, Nature , Vol. 367, pp. 215-216, 1994, and in an article in Drug News and Perspectives , Vol. 7, pp. 501-512, 1994.

Typically the compound of formula A consists of two stereoisomers, one stereoisomer in enantiomeric excess with respect to the other. Another embodiment of the invention is that wherein the product yield of the compound of formula A is greater than about 90%. In yet another embodiment, the following group of formula B: is selected from pyrrolidinyl, morpholinyl, piperidinyl and piperazinyl. More particularly, the group represents pyrrolidinyl. A preferred embodiment of the invention encompasses the process wherein the compound of formula B is produced by reacting a compound of formula D: wherein R and R 1 are C 1-6 alkyl, with an activating agent in a substantially non-reactive solvent at reduced temperature and then with pyrrolidine at room temperature to produce a compound of formula B. An example of an activating agent is carbonyldiimidazole. Another embodiment is that wherein the substantially non-reactive solvent is selected from the group consisting of: tetrahydrofuran, toulene, isopropyl acetate, ethyl acetate, t-butlymethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether and N,N-dimethylformamdide. Mixtures of two or more of the aforesaid solvents are also contemplated. As used herein, the reduced temperature is in the range of about 25 C. to about 10 C. More particularly the reduced temperature is about 0 C. A preferred embodiment is that wherein the product yield of the compound of formula B is greater than about 90%. Another preferred embodiment is that wherein R is methyl and R 1 is ethyl. A subclass of this class encompasses a process wherein the compound of formula D consists of one stereoisomer that is in enantiomeric excess with respect to the other. A group of this subclass is a process wherein the compound of formula D is resolved by reacting the racemic mixture of the compound of formula D with a chiral amine resolving agent in a substantially non-reactive solvent. Examples of substantially non-reactive solvent include those selected from the group consisting of: acetone, ethyl acetate, hexane and isopropyl acetate. Additionally mixtures of two or more of the aforesaid solvents are included. A preferred embodiment is a process wherein the compound of formula D is resolved to an enantiomeric excess of about 98%. In a more preferred embodiment the product yield for the resolution is greater than about 65%. More particularly, the compound of formula D is resolved to about 98% enatiomeric excess and the yield is about 60-70%. The invention is illustrated in connection with the following generic schemes A and B. The racemic starting material is first separated into its diastereomers with a chiral amine resolving agent to provide the desired stereospecific hydroxy acid. Alternatively, the appropriate families of chiral amines may be used as described in T. Vries, et al., Angew Chem. Int. Ed. (1998) 37: 2349-2354. Examples of chiral amine resolving agents can be selected from the group consisting of: (1) (R)-()-1-(1-napthyl)ethylamine and (2) (S)-()-1-(1-napthyl)ethylamine. Illustrating this is a process wherein (S)-()-2-hydroxy-2-methyl butyric acid is resolved using (R)-()-1-(1-napthyl)ethylamine. Another illustration is a process wherein (R)-()-2-hydroxy-2-methyl butyric acid is resolved using (S)-()-1-(1-napthyl)ethylamine. The resolved hydroxy acid is then activated using an appropriate activating agent, in a substantially non-reactive solvent, at reduced temperature, and then combined with a cyclic amine, providing compound B. The cyclic amine serves as a leaving group in the next step, when is displaced via a lithiation reaction, producing compound A. Compound A is oxidized to produce methyl sulfone D. A suitable oxidizing agent is Oxone. Methyl sulfone D is then subjected to esterification by reaction with a compound R a OCH 2 CO 2 H, wherein R a represents a C 3-6 alkyl group. One example of a suitable esterification procedure involves the addition of the esterifying agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) to methyl sulfone D in the presence of an amine base, e.g., DABCO, in a solvent or solvent mixture at about 30-35 C. The ester is thereafter cyclized, and optionally deprotected, to provide compounds having COX-2 selective inhibitory activity. For the purposes of this specification, the term alkyl means linear, branched or cyclic structures and combinations thereof, containing one to twenty carbon atoms. Examples of alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, s- and t-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, eicosyl, 3,7-diethyl-2,2-dimethyl-4-propylnonyl, and the like. The term substantially non-reactive solvent includes tetrahydrofuran, toluene, acetone, ethyl acetate, hexane, isopropyl acetate, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether and N,N-dimethylformamide. The phrase one stereoisomer that is in enantiomeric excess with respect to the other means that the mixture contains over 50% of one stereoisomer and under 50% of the other. This phrase also is meant to include an enantiomerically pure compound consisting essentially of 100% of a stereoisomer and essentially 0% of the corresponding enantiomer. The term room temperature means about 20 C. The term reduced temperature is meant to include any temperature less than room temperature. The term lithiating agent includes n-butyllithium, hexyllithium and phenyllithium. The term activating agent means any compound that activates a particular site on any other compound for displacement by another group. An example is carbonyldiimidazole. The term chiral amine resolving agent is meant to include any amine compound that when reacted with a mixture of enantiomers yields a mixture of one stereoisomer that is in enantiomeric excess with respect to the other and where such excess is greater than any excess of the original mixture. Examples include (R)-()-1-(1-napthyl)ethylamine and (S)-()-1-(1-napthyl)ethylamine.

bis-A-polysulfone membrane of polymers and copolymers having the polymer repeat unit of the formula: in the polymer or copolymer. This process is applicable to recovering and recycling hydrogen chloride, which is used as a catalytic promoter, in hydrocarbon conversion processes such as isomerization and alkylation. CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a division of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/343,496 filed Jun. 30, 1999, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a process for the recovery of halides from streams containing light hydrocarbons. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Numerous hydrocarbon conversion processes are widely used to alter the structure or properties of hydrocarbon streams. For example, isomerization processes rearrange the molecular structure from straight chain paraffinic hydrocarbons to more highly branched hydrocarbons that generally have a higher octane rating or increased utility as substrates for other conversion processes. Alkylation processes alkylate hydrocarbon alkylation substrates, such as aromatics or paraffins, with hydrocarbon alkylating agents, such as olefins, to produce motor fuels and useful industrial chemicals such as ethylbenzene, cumene, and linear alkyl benzenes that are used to make detergents. Additional processes include dehydrogenation, transalkylation, reforming, and others. Operating conditions and methods for carrying out these processes are well known by those skilled in the art. Many of these processes share the common feature of using a catalyst in the presence of one or more materials that enhance the effectiveness of the catalyst in the reaction zone. These performance enhancing materials can operate in many ways, such as increasing or attenuating catalyst activity, neutralizing catalyst poisons, or solubilizing catalyst or feed contaminants. Such performance enhancement materials may be chemically or physically sorbed on the catalyst or dispersed in the hydrocarbon stream. Where the hydrocarbon product stream leaving a hydrocarbon conversion zone contains the performance enhancing material or beneficent material, methods are sought for preventing contamination of the hydrocarbon product with the beneficent material and the loss of this beneficent material to the product stream. For example, many isomerization processes employ a highly effective platinum on chlorided alumina catalyst system in the reaction zone. The chlorided catalyst requires a continual addition of chloride to replace chloride lost from the surface of the catalyst in to the product stream. Hydrogen chloride and/or volatile organic chlorides escape from the process via a stabilizer overhead stream and, apart form the loss of chloride, pose environmental concern. In addition to the loss of chlorides and environmental concerns, chloride loss hinders the operation of chloride promoted isomerization zones in other ways. For example, the recycle of hydrogen or hydrocarbons through a zeolitic adsorption bed or a zeolitic conversion zone is not practical when a chloride type catalyst is used in the isomerization reaction zone, unless hydrogen chloride is removed from the recycle stream. Hydrogen chloride that is produced by the addition of chloride to the isomerization zone or that is released from the isomerization catalyst results in significant amounts of hydrogen chloride leaving in the effluent from the isomerization zone. Contact of this hydrogen chloride with a zeolite in, say, an adsorption bed or in a catalytic conversion zone, particularly in the presence of moisture and high temperature, will decompose the matrix structure of many zeolites, thereby destroying any adsorptive or catalytic function. Therefore, absent chloride neutralization methods, chlorided catalyst systems generally have insufficient compatibility with many zeolitic adsorbents or catalysts to permit simultaneous use. Alkylation of hydrocarbons presents another case where contamination by a performance enhancement material can pose concern. Alkylation processes can use a solid chlorided alumina catalyst in the alkylation reactor, with the chloride acting as a performance enhancement material for the catalyst. In the course of alkylation, some chloride is lost from the catalyst into the product stream. In addition, the current commercial versions of these solid alkylation catalysts tend to experience fairly rapidly deactivation, which necessitates frequent regeneration, which in turn usually leads to the loss of more chloride from the catalyst into one or more regeneration effluent streams. Unless some or most of the lost chloride in the product stream and the regeneration effluent stream(s) is recovered and returned to the catalyst, the costs of neutralizing chlorides and of supplying fresh or make-up chloride to the catalyst can render alkylation processes that use solid chlorided catalysts less economical. Thus, methods have been sought for recovering and recycling materials, such as hydrogen chloride, which act to enhance or benefit the performance of catalysts in conversion zones when such materials are carried from the conversion zone by a hydrocarbon-containing effluent stream. Since the 1960s, the chemical and petrochemical industries are increasingly using membranes in a broad variety of separation and recovery applications. A membrane is a thin barrier having two sides and separating two fluids. In a membrane process, a feed stream passes to one side of the membrane, which is commonly called the feed side or nonpermeate side of the membrane. The feed stream contains a permeable component and a nonpermeable component, which is used herein to refer to a component that has a permeance that is less than that of the permeable component. The permeable component selectively passes through the membrane and is recovered on the reverse side, or permeate side, of the membrane in a stream which is called the permeate. The portion of the feed stream that does not selectively pass through the membrane, including the nonpermeable component, is recovered from the nonpermeate side of the membrane in a stream which is called the nonpermeate and which is also commonly referred to as the concentrate, the retentate, or the residue. General information on membrane separation processes can be found in Perrys Chemical Engineers Handbook, Sixth Edition, edited by R. H. Perry and D. W. Green, published by McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, in 1984. In order for the permeable component to permeate from the nonpermeate side to the permeate side of the membrane at a particular location of a membrane, the local partial pressure of the permeable component at that particular location at or near the surface of the membrane must be greater on the nonpermeate side of the membrane than on the permeate side of the membrane. Local partial pressure of the permeable component means the product of the mole fraction of the permeable component and the total pressure, both determined locally at a given particular point at or near the surface of the membrane. In practice, the local mole fraction and local total pressure cannot be measured precisely at the surface of the membrane. Rather, the local mole fraction and total pressure are determined at least in part by the bulk flow rates, compositions, and pressures of the stream that are contacted with the membrane, and by controlling these streams, suitable local partial pressures of the permeable component can be controlled on both sides of the membrane. The separation of gas streams using dense membranes that are nonporous and yet permeable is well known. Dense membranes consist of a dense film through which a pressure and concentration gradient will force the diffusion of certain components. The relative rates of transport of various components through the dense film does not necessarily depend on the size of the components, as much as it depends on the diffusivity and solubility of the components. See the article entitled Membrane Technology, written by Richard W. Baker, appearing at pp. 135-193 in Vol. 16 of the Kirk - Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4 th Edition, published by John Wiley, in New York, in 1995. Two of the chief criteria for a dense membrane separation process are permeance and selectivity. At this point, it is useful for the sake of clarity to define these terms: i. Permeance In simple permeation, the permeation flux of a species i across a membrane may be expressed by the formula, R i P i *( y H *Hy L *L ) where R i equals the rate of permeation in units of standard volume of species i per unit of time per unit of membrane cross-sectional area, P i equals the permeance, y H equals the mole fraction of species i on the high-pressure or nonpermeate side of the membrane, H equals the pressure on the high-pressure side of the membrane, y L equals the mole fraction of species i on the low-pressure or permeate side of the membrane, and L equals the pressure on the low-pressure side of the membrane. Thus, permeance has units of standard volume of species i per unit of time per unit of membrane cross-sectional area per unit of pressure. ii. Selectivity Selectivity is defined as the ratio of the permeance of species i relative to the permeance of another species j and can be expressed by the equation, S ij P i /P j In this equation, the convention is to put the numerically larger permeance in the numerator and the numerically smaller permeance in the denominator, so that the higher the selectivity of a membrane, the more desirable is the use of that membrane in a process for separating species i and j. Examples of dense membranes include sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes that comprise polymers, including copolymers, which have the polymer repeat unit of the following general type of structure in the polymer or copolymer, which is hereinafter referred to as formula (I): In the above formula (I), S is the sulfonic acid group (SO 2 OH) or its satisfied form, and n represents the average number of polymer repeat units in the polymer or copolymer. Hackhs Chemical Dictionary, Third Edition, edited by Julius Grant, published by The Blakiston Company, Inc., New York, in 1953, defines the term salify as to form a salt. The term satisfied form of the sulfonic acid group as used herein means a form of the sulfonic acid group wherein the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group of the sulfonic acid group is replaced with a cation or cationic group. The salified form typically contains an ammonium group, an alkali metal atom, an alkaline earth metal atom, a transition metal atom, or an organic cation group. The polymer or copolymer has a molecular weight of generally above about 10,000 and preferably from about 25,000 to about 80,000. The polymer or copolymer has a degree of substitution (DS) of S groups of from about 0.2 to about 4. These sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,971,695 (Kawakami et al.), which teaches their use in separating gas mixtures such as air, as well as mixtures comprising hydrogen/nitrogen, hydrogen/methane, oxygen/nitrogen, ammonia/nitrogen, carbon dioxide/oxygen, carbon dioxide/methane, and hydrogen sulfide/methane. It is also known that these sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes are used to separate gas mixtures of water/air and water/methane, with water permeating through the membrane. Although sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes have been used for separating streams, these membranes have not been used for separating and recovering hydrogen chloride from streams. Therefore, a method is sought that uses membranes for recovering and recycling hydrogen chloride from hydrocarbon-containing streams. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has been discovered that sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes have surprising and unexpected selectivity for separating compounds containing a halide, i.e., a Group 7A (IUPAC 17) element, such as hydrogen chloride, from streams that contain C 1 -C 7 hydrocarbons. While it is already well known that sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes are highly selective in permeating hydrogen from a mixture of hydrogen and methane, it has now been discovered that sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes are nearly as selective in permeating hydrogen chloride from a mixture with methane as they are in permeating hydrogen from a mixture with methane. In addition, because the permeance of sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes toward hydrocarbons decreases as the number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon increases, the sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes are even more selective in permeating hydrogen chloride from a mixture with hydrocarbons that are heavier than methane. This invention takes advantage of these unexpected permeation characteristics of sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes and, accordingly, in one of its embodiments comprises a process for separating hydrogen chloride from streams that contain C 1 -C 7 hydrocarbons. The sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membrane are polymers, including copolymers, having the polymer repeat unit of the previously mentioned formula (I). The embodiment of this invention for separating hydrogen chloride from streams that contain C 1 -C 7 hydrocarbons has wide applicability in the field of hydrocarbon processing for removing hydrogen chloride from light off gas or fuel gas streams in oil refineries. Such gas streams are generated in hydrocarbon conversion processes which use chloride-promoted catalysts. Particular examples of this embodiment comprise improved processes for the conversion of hydrocarbons using chloride-promoted catalysts in which hydrogen chloride is recovered from effluent streams and recycled to a catalytic hydrocarbon conversion zone by the use of sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes. Specific hydrocarbon conversion processes to which this invention is applicable include processes for the isomerization, alkylation, reforming, and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Compared to the prior art process of caustic scrubbing and adsorption for removing hydrogen chloride from such streams, this invention effectively eliminates or substantially decreases the significant costs of purchasing fresh caustic or fresh adsorbent and of disposing of spent caustic or spent adsorbent. This invention also dramatically reduces the make-up rate of chloride precursors, such as hydrogen chloride, carbon tetrachloride, and perchloroethylene to hydrocarbon conversion processes. This invention is generally applicable to isomerization processes that use a performance enhancing material. Although this invention is useful in those isomerization processes which recycle hydrogen-rich gas from the reactor effluent separator to the reactor, this invention is particularly applicable to those isomerization processes which eliminate recycling from the reactor effluent separator to the reactor. Processes without such recycling use relatively low quantities hydrogen-rich gas on a once-through basis, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,929,794 (Schmidt et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,026,950 (Schmidt et al.). The advantage of this invention, when used in the context of a once-through process, arises from the fact that hydrogen permeates readily through the sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membrane, even more readily than hydrogen chloride. Thus, in the course of recovering hydrogen chloride from the stabilizer off gas stream of a once-through isomerization process, this invention also recovers and recycles nearly all of the hydrogen in the stabilizer off gas as well. Although the amount of hydrogen that is present in the stabilizer off gas of a once-through isomerization process is, of course, relatively small because these processes require comparatively little hydrogen-rich gas in any event, whatever hydrogen is recovered and recycled in the course of recovering and recycling hydrogen chloride further decreases the quantity of make-up hydrogen-rich gas that these once-through processes require. This invention has other novel and particularly advantageous aspects in its application to hydrocarbon conversion processes. For each hydrocarbon conversion process to which this invention is applied, the benefits of this invention can be further enhanced by the use of a sweep stream, or purge, stream for the permeate side of the membrane. Although it is well known that the driving force for permeation of a component through a membrane can be increased by sweeping or purging the permeate side of the membrane with a gas containing a low mole fraction of that component, each particular hydrocarbon conversion process offers a wide range of streams for possible use as the sweep stream. In other words, many streams in a hydrocarbon conversion process meet the minimum criterion of a sweep stream, namely a low mole fraction of the permeating component. However, some streams are better than others for use as a sweep stream, and certain embodiments of this invention comprise a particularly advantageous choice of sweep stream. For example, in the case of an isomerization process, the most advantageous sweep stream is a portion of the stabilizer bottoms that has been vaporized, while in a motor fuel alkylation process, wherein an olefin such as propylene alkylates a paraffin such as isobutane in the presence of a stoichiometric excess of isobutane, the most advantageous sweep stream is a portion of the recycle isobutane that has been vaporized. These particular sweep streams are preferred because they maximize the driving force for permeation while minimizing the cost of utilities and without compromising in any way the benefits of this invention, namely retaining hydrogen chloride while minimizing hydrogen chloride contamination of gaseous products and effluent streams. As has been suggested previously, it is believed that this invention has much wider applicability than the selective removal of merely hydrogen chloride or even of merely chloride-containing compounds. Because sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes exhibit such high permeance for hydrogen chloride, it is believed that these membranes will likewise exhibit surprisingly high permeance for some other chlorine-containing hydrocarbons that have a non-zero resultant molecular moment. Thus, it is expected that sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes can be used to separate a chlorine-containing hydrocarbon from a mixture of hydrocarbons having the same or more carbon atoms as the chlorine-containing hydrocarbon. Moreover, it is believed that this high permeance exhibited by sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes for substituted hydrocarbons is not limited to chlorine-containing hydrocarbons. Accordingly, it is expected that sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes can be used to separate a substituted hydrocarbon containing any Group 7A element, not only chlorine, from a mixture of hydrocarbons having the same or more carbon atoms as the substituted hydrocarbon. Thus, in its broadest scope, this invention comprises the use of sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes to recover a permeable component containing a Group 7A element from a stream containing the permeable component and a C 1 -C 7 hydrocarbon. In a broad embodiment, this invention is a process for recovering a permeable component containing a Group 7A element from a feed stream containing the permeable component and a nonpermeable component. A feed stream, which comprises a permeable component containing a Group 7A element and a nonpermeable component, passes to a membrane separation zone. The membrane separation zone comprises a resin membrane comprising a polymer or copolymer containing the polymer repeat unit represented by the previously mentioned formula (I), wherein S is the sulfonic acid group or its salified form and wherein n represents the average number of polymer repeat units in the polymer or copolymer and wherein the polymer or copolymer has a molecular weight above about 10,000 and a degree of substitution of S groups of from about 0.2 to about 4. A permeate stream comprising the permeable component is withdrawn from the membrane separation zone. In another embodiment, this invention is a process for the isomerization of a normal paraffin. Normal paraffins are introduced to an isomerization reaction zone, where normal paraffins are isomerized to branched paraffins having the same number of carbon atoms as the normal paraffins. The isomerization occurs in the presence of a chloride-containing catalyst. A reaction effluent stream is recovered from the isomerization reaction zone. The reaction effluent stream comprises branched paraffins, hydrocarbons having from 1 to 7 carbon atoms, and hydrogen chloride. At least a portion of the reaction effluent stream passes to a product separation zone, which operates at conditions to separate the entering paraffins. A recycle stream comprising hydrocarbons having from 1 to 7 carbon atoms and hydrogen chloride is withdrawn from the product separation zone. At least a portion of the recycle stream passes to a membrane separation zone comprising a resin membrane comprising a polymer or copolymer containing the polymer repeat unit represented by the previously mentioned formula (I). A permeate stream is withdrawn from the membrane separation zone. The permeate stream comprises hydrogen chloride. Branched paraffins are recovered from the process. In another embodiment, this invention is a process for the alkylation of an alkylation substrate with an alkylating agent. An alkylating agent and an alkylation substrate pass to an alkylation reaction zone. In the alkylation reaction zone, the alkylating agent alkylates the alkylation substrate in the presence of a chloride-containing catalyst to form alkylate. A reaction effluent stream is recovered from the alkylation reaction zone. The reaction effluent stream comprises alkylate, hydrocarbons having from 1 to 7 carbon atoms, and hydrogen chloride. At least a portion of the reaction effluent stream passes to a product separation zone, which operates at conditions to separate the entering hydrocarbons. A recycle stream comprising hydrocarbons having from 1 to 7 carbon atoms and hydrogen chloride is withdrawn from the product separation zone. At least a portion of the recycle stream passes to a membrane separation zone comprising a resin membrane comprising a polymer or copolymer containing the polymer repeat unit represented by the previously mentioned formula (I). A permeate comprising hydrogen chloride is withdrawn from the membrane separation zone. Alkylate is recovered from the process.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,732 (Zhang et al.) discloses a fluidized solid bed motor fuel alkylation process that uses a halide. The teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,732 are incorporated herein by reference. The use of nonporous, dense membranes in gas separation is described in the article entitled Membrane Technology, written by Richard W. Baker, appearing at pp. 135-193 in Vol. 16 of the Kirk - Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4 th Edition, published by John Wiley, in New York, in 1995. This article teaches that the relative rate at which a component permeates through a nonporous, dense membrane depends on the diffusivity and solubility of the component in the membrane material. It is well known that the driving force for the permeation of a component through a membrane can be increased by purging the low-pressure, or permeate, side of the membrane with a gas containing a low mole fraction of that component.

The article entitled Pollution Control: Field Tests Show Membrane Processing Attractive, by T. E. Cooley and W. L. Dethloff, CEP, October, 1985, pp. 45-50, describes a normal butane isomerization process that passes a hydrogen-containing feed gas stream to an undisclosed membrane in order to recover hydrogen as permeate and recycle hydrogen to the process. The article teaches that when the feed gas stream to the membrane contained hydrogen chloride, two undesirable effects occurred: 65% of the hydrogen chloride permeated through the membrane, and high levels of hydrogen chloride impaired the membrane performance. To avoid these effects, this article teaches caustic washing of the feed gas stream to the membrane so that the feed gas stream is free of hydrogen chloride. U.S. Pat. No. 4,971,695 (Kawakami et al.) discloses a sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membranes and their use in separating gas streams. The teachings of U.S. Pat. No. 4,971,695 are incorporated herein by reference. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a process flow diagram of an alkylation process of this invention. FIG. 2 is a process flow diagram of a butane isomerization process of this invention. FIG. 3 is a process flow diagram of a pentane and hexane isomerization process of this invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention recovers at least one permeable component from a stream that passes to a membrane separation zone and which is hereinafter referred to as the feed stream. In addition to the permeable component, the feed stream contains at least one nonpermeable component. The nonpermeable component is usually a light hydrocarbon, which means a hydrocarbon having between 1 and 7 carbon atoms and which is often referred to herein as a C 1 -C 7 hydrocarbon. Although the hydrocarbon may be an aromatic or an olefin, the preferred hydrocarbon is a paraffin, which may be either normal or branched. The feed stream may be a mixture containing more than one light hydrocarbon. The total concentration of the light hydrocarbon(s) in the feed stream can generally be from 5 to 95 mol-% (0.05 to 0.95 mole fraction), and more typically from 60 to 90 mol-% (0.6 to 0.9 mole fraction). The permeable component generally contains at least one atom of a Group 7A element, i.e., a halogen such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Although the permeable component may contain any number of carbon atoms, the permeable component contains generally 7 or less carbon atoms, preferably 4 or less carbon atoms, and more preferably no carbon atoms. For permeable components having the same number of halogen atoms, the fewer the number of carbon atoms the greater is the permeance of the permeable component. Thus, it is expected that the permeance of chloromethane is greater than the permeance of chloroethane, which is in turn greater than the permeance of the chloropropanes. Although this invention is not limited by any particular theory, part of the explanation for this may be that the permeance depends on diffusivity, and the smaller the permeable component the greater is the diffusivity and hence the greater is the permeance. Another explanation for this may be that permeance depends on the resultant molecular moment of the permeable component, the polarity of certain bonds of the sulfonated fluorinated polysulfone membrane, and the tendency of a molecule having polar bonds to be more soluble and hence usually more permeable in a membrane having polar bonds. The benefit of the polar effect of the halogen atom(s) may decrease as the size of the permeable component increases. For permeable components having the same number of carbon atoms, the greater the number of halogen atoms the greater is the permeance of the permeable component, provided that the steric orientation of the halogen atoms increases rather than decreases the dipole moment of the permeable component. Thus, it is expected that the permeance of 1,1-dichloroethane is greater than the permeance of chloroethane, because the presence of both chlorine atoms on the same carbon atoms is at least partially cumulative. In contrast, it is expected that the permeance of trans-1,2-dichloroethane is greater than that of cis-1,2-dichloroethane, because the steric orientation of the chlorine atoms decreases the dipole moment to nearly zero in the trans-isomer, but not in the cis-isomer. For permeable components having the same number of carbon atoms and the same number of halogen atoms, it is expected that the greater the number of multiple bonds the greater is the permeance of the permeable component. Thus, a monoolefinic permeable component is expected to have a greater permeance than the corresponding saturated permeable component. Also for permeable components having the same number of carbon atoms and the same number of halogen atoms, it is expected that a noncyclic permeable component will have a greater permeance than a cyclic permeable component. Preferably, the Group 7A element is chlorine. It is believed that preferred permeable components include those in which the position of the Group 7A element within the permeable component molecule results in a molecule having a non-zero molecular moment. Examples of such preferred permeable components containing a Group 7A element include hydrogen halides, such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, and hydrogen iodide. Preferred permeable components include acyclic saturated halogen-substituted hydrocarbons having from 1 to 2 carbon atoms, including chloromethane (methyl chloride), dichloromethane (methylene chloride), trichloromethane (chloroform), chloroethane (ethyl chloride), and chloroethanes having from 1 to 5 chlorine atoms. Other permeable components include acyclic saturated halogen-substituted hydrocarbons having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms and one or more chlorine atoms, including chloropropanes, chlorobutanes, chloromethylpropanes, chloropentanes, chloromethylbutanes, chlorodimethylpropanes, and saturated hydrocarbons having 6 or 7 carbon atoms and substituted with one or more chlorine atoms (e.g., chlorohexanes and chloroheptanes). Other suitable permeable components include cyclic saturated halogen-substituted hydrocarbons having from 1 to 7 carbon atoms and one or more chlorine atoms, such as chlorocylcopropanes, chlorocyclobutanes, chloromethylcyclopropanes, chlorocyclopentane, chlorodimethylcyclopropanes, chloromethylcyclobutanes, chloroethylcyclobutanes, chlorocyclohexanes and isomers thereof (e.g., chloromethylcyclopentanes, chlorodimethylcyclobutanes), and chlorocycloheptanes and isomers thereof (e.g., chlorodimethylcyclopentanes, chloromethylcyclohexanes). Permeable components also include unsaturated analogs of the previously mentioned saturated halogen-substituted hydrocarbons which have from 1 to 7 carbon atoms and one or more chlorine atoms. These compounds may have one or more double bonds and one or more triple bonds. Acyclic compounds of this type include chloroethene, chloroethyne (chloroacetylene), 1,1-dichloroethene, cis-1,2-dichloroethene, and trichloroethene. Other acyclic compounds that have 3 to 7 carbon atoms and one or more chlorine atoms include chloropropenes, chloropropadienes, chloropropynes, chlorobutenes, chlorobutadienes, chlorobutynes, chlorobutadiynes, chloromethylpropenes, chloromethylpropynes, chloropentenes, chloropentynes, chloromethylbutenes, chloromethylbutynes, chlorodimethylpropenes, chlorodimethylpropynes, chlorohexenes, chlorohexynes, chlorohexadiynes, chloromethylpentenes, chloromethylpentynes, chlorodimethylbutenes, chlorodimethybutynes, chloroheptenes, chloroheptynes, chloromethylhexenes, chloromethylhexynes, chlorodimethylpentenes, chlorodimethylpentynes, chloroethylbutenes, and chloroethylbutynes. Other chloride-containing compounds which have little or no resultant molecular moment on grounds of symmetry may also be present in the feed stream. These include molecular chlorine, tetrachloromethane (carbon tetrachloride); 1,2-dichloroethane (ethylene dichloride), trans-1,2-dichloroethene, tetrachloroethene (perchloroethylene), and hexachloroethane. It is expected that the permeance of compounds such as these will be greater than the permeance of the corresponding nonchloride-containing saturated hydrocarbons containing the same number of carbon atoms, due to the effect of the chloride atoms. However, it is also expected that the permeance of such components will be less than that of nonsymmetrical chloride-containing permeable components that have the same number of carbon atoms and a larger resultant molecular moment but fewer chloride atoms. For the permeable component, the resultant molecular moment is generally greater than zero, preferably greater than 0.5, and more preferably greater than 1.0. For the nonpermeable component, the resultant molecular moment is generally less than 0.75, preferably less than 0.35, and more preferably less than 0.1. Selected values of the resultant molecular moments in the gas phase for molecules containing a Group 7A (IUPAC 17) element are shown in Table 1A and of those for hydrocarbon molecules are shown in Table 1B. The values in Tables 1A and 1B are from the table starting on page E-63 in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 56 th Edition, edited by Robert C. Weast, CRC Press, Cleveland, Ohio, 1975.

The total concentration of the permeable component(s) in the feed stream can generally be from 0.1 mol-ppm to 70 mol-% (10 7 to 0.7 mole fraction), but is more typically from 0.5 mol-ppm to 1 mol-% (510 7 to 0.01 mole fraction). The feed stream may also, but need not, contain other additional components that permeate more readily or less readily than the permeable component. However, any other additional component should preferably not substantially interfere with the permeation of the permeable component or with the nonpermeation of the nonpermeable component. As used herein, a component substantially interferes with the permeation of the permeable component containing the Group 7A element when the presence of the component in the feed stream decreases the rate of permeation of the permeable component by more than 10% of the rate of permeation of the permeable component when the component is not present in the feed stream. Likewise, a component substantially interferes with the nonpermeation of the nonpermeable component when the presence of the component in the feed stream increases the rate of permeation of the light hydrocarbon by more than 10% of the rate of permeation of the nonpermeable component when the component is not present in the feed stream. In addition, any other component in the feed stream should preferably not have a deleterious effect on the physical or chemical properties of the membrane. Also, any other component in the feed stream should preferably not be a contaminant with respect to the process in which this invention is used, regardless whether the component exits the membrane separation zone in the permeate stream, the nonpermeate stream, and/or both streams. Molecular hydrogen is a common example of an additional component which is often present in petroleum refinery streams that can be feed streams for this invention. The feed stream of this invention may contain generally from about 0 to about 99 mol-% hydrogen, and typically from about 75 to about 95 mol-% hydrogen. When hydrogen is present in the feed stream, hydrogen tends to permeate through the membrane employed in this invention, and thus most of the hydrogen in the feed stream exits the membrane separation zone in the permeate stream. Generally, this tendency of hydrogen to permeate with the permeable component containing the Group 7A element can be an advantage in many petroleum refinery processes. Isomerization, alkylation, reforming, and dehydrogenation processes are examples of refinery operations that emit some hydrogen in off gas streams that contain a compound with a Group 7A element. For such streams, it can be advantageous to recover and recycle not only the compound with the Group 7A element but also the hydrogen. Consequently, in embodiments of this invention that comprise these processes, the fact that the permeate stream contains both the permeable component as well as the hydrogen that enters with the feed stream makes the permeate stream even more useful and valuable than if it contained the permeable component alone. The feed stream to the membrane separation zone preferably has a water concentration of less than 1 vol-ppm, and more preferably contains no water. Water can be removed from the feed stream by passing the feed stream through an adsorbent that selectively adsorbs water, such as 3A molecular sieve or silica gel. It is believed that water tends to increase the rate of corrosion in process equipment that is typically used in practicing this invention, such as vessels, piping, instrumentation, and membrane housings or modules. It is believed that water, in combination with components that contain a Group 7A element, especially molecular halogens (e.g., molecular fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) or hydrogen halides (e.g., hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, and hydrogen iodide), tends to rapidly corrode iron-containing and other metal-containing equipment, and that the corrosion products can have a deleterious effect on the membrane. Although corrosion-resistant alloys could be used to decrease the rate of corrosion, generally such alloys are expensive and therefore it is more economical to invest in feed stream drying equipment than in expensive corrosion-resistant equipment. The feed stream also preferably contains no inorganic iron-containing species because it is believed such species may tend to react with a Group 7A (such as chloride) and have a serious deleterious effect on the selectivity of the membrane. It is believed that other species in the feed stream, comprising other Group VIII (IUPAC 8-10) elements or Group I B through VIII B (IUPAC 3 through 7, 11, and 12) elements may also have a detrimental effect on the membrane and, therefore, should also preferably not be present in the feed stream. Methods to remove these species from the feed stream are well known and include filtration. The feed stream may be obtained from at least a portion of the effluent of a reactor in a reaction zone of a hydrocarbon conversion process, such as a process for isomerization, alkylation, reforming, or dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. As used herein in the context of a stream and unless indicated otherwise, the term portion means an aliquot portion of the stream having the same composition as the stream or a portion of the stream having a different composition as the stream. Depending on the particular hydrocarbon conversion process, the feed stream may be an aliquot portion of the reactor effluent, or the feed stream may be a stream which is recovered from a separation zone which separates the reactor effluent and which has a different composition from the reactor effluent. For example, the feed stream may be obtained from the effluent of an isomerization reactor for isomerizing a normal paraffin to a branched paraffin, in which case the isomerization reactor effluent and/or the feed stream may contain hydrogen chloride and, in addition to the desired branched paraffin product, other C 1 to C 7 hydrocarbons, depending on the composition of the charge stock to and also on the operating conditions of the isomerization reaction zone. The feed stream may also be obtained from the effluent of an alkylation reactor in an alkylation reaction zone for alkylating an alkylation substrate with an alkylating agent. In this case, the reactor effluent and/or the feed stream may contain the desired alkylate product, other C 1 to C 7 hydrocarbons, and hydrogen chloride. The feed stream passes to a membrane separation zone comprising a resin membrane comprising a polymer or copolymer containing the polymer repeat unit of the previously mentioned formula (I). Sulfonated polysulfone polymers can be prepared by sulfonation methods known in the art; see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,709,842, wherein Quentin describes a preparation of polymers in which part of the aromatic rings are substituted with hydroxysulfonyl radicals (SO 3 H, also called sulfonic groups). Additional methods can be found in E. E. Gilbert, Sulfonation and Related Reactions, R. E. Krieger Publishing Co., New York (1977) and A. Noshay and L. M. Robeson, J. of Applied Polymer Science, V20, p. 1885 (1976). In general, the sulfonation may be carried out by simple admixture of a solution or suspension of the polysulfone with a sulfonation agent in an inert solvent system. Sulfur trioxide, chlorosulfonic acid, and oleum are representative sulfonation agents. The temperature at which sulfonation takes place is less critical for polysulfone polymers of this invention due to good chemical resistance towards degradation. An advantageous temperature is within the range of from 13 to 176 F. (25 to 80 C.), preferably from 32 to 122 F. (0 to 50 C.). The sulfonated product polymer is usually separated from the reaction mixture by conventional techniques such as filtration, washing, and drying. The sulfonated polysulfone containing the polymer repeat unit of the previously mentioned formula (I) is shown to have sulfonate groups on the phenyl moiety distal to the sulfone linking group. Although substitution at these locations theoretically occurs first, the sulfonate groups may substitute at other positions and in other phenyl moieties of the polymer during sulfonation. The degree of substitution DS of the sulfonated hexafluoro polymers containing the polymer repeat unit of the previously mentioned formula (I) is a measure of the average number of polymer repeat units present in the polymer composition that have been sulfonated. Typically the degree of substitution is on average from about 0.2 to about 4, preferably from about 0.5 to about 2. Thus, if on average half of the polymer repeat units of the previously mentioned formula (I) are sulfonated, the degree of substitution is 0.5. The fluid separation membranes used in the processes of this invention can be of dense film or of any form known to those skilled in the art. Further, it can be a composite membrane, an asymmetric membrane, or a homogeneous or isotropic membrane. The membranes may be in spiral form, flat sheet, or other configurations, as well as in hollow fiber or tubular form. Those skilled in the art are aware of the many methods available for their production and know how to prepare the membranes in any of these forms. The isotropic and asymmetric type membranes used in the process of this invention are generally comprised essentially of a single permeable membrane material, the sulfonated hexafluoro bis-A polysulfone polymer containing the polymer repeat unit of the previously mentioned formula (I), which is capable of selectively separating at least one component from a fluid mixture containing said at least one component in admixture with other components. Asymmetric membranes used in the process of this invention are distinguished by the existence of two or more morphological regions within the membrane structure; one such region comprising a thin relatively dense semipermeable skin capable of selectively permeating at least one component from a fluid mixture containing said at least one component in admixture with other components, and the other region comprising a less dense, porous, essentially nonselective support region that serves to preclude the collapse of the thin skin region of the membrane during use. Composite membranes generally comprise a thin layer or coating of a suitable semipermeable membrane material, the sulfonated hexafluoro bis-A polysulfone polymer containing the polymer repeat unit of the previously mentioned formula (I), superimposed on a porous substrate. The sulfonated fluorinated polysulfones containing the polymer repeat unit of the previously mentioned formula (I) can be used as a pure membrane forming material, an admixture of several sulfonated polysulfones, or in a mixture with other organic or inorganic materials. The sulfonated fluorinated polysulfones will typically represent more than 50 percent by weight of the composition of the membrane material and preferably more than 70 percent by weight of the composition of the membrane material. Some typical examples of inorganic materials that can be used in a mixture with sulfonated fluorinated polysulfones are inorganic acids, such as sulfuric or phosphoric acid. Organic materials useful as admixtures with the sulfonated fluorinated polysulfones can be high molecular weight polymers that can be neutral or can contain ionic groups, e.g., polyvinyl pyridine, polyethylene imine, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, etc., or low molecular weight materials and plasticizers, for example, organic salts, polyhydric alcohols such as glycerine, low molecular weight amines such as ethylenediamine, diethylene triamine, acridine, piperazine, pyridine, etc. Flat sheet membranes are readily prepared from solutions of the sulfonated hexafluoro bis-A polysulfone polymer containing the polymer repeat unit of structure(I) in a suitable solvent, e.g., methoxyethanol, dimethylformamide, and the like, by casting the solution and evaporating the solvent, and thereafter drying and curing the case film, either under vacuum, at elevated temperature, or a combination of both. Such thin film membranes can vary in thickness from about 0.5 mil to about 10 mils or more, preferably from about 1 mil to about 3 mils. As used herein, the term mil means {fraction (1/1000)} th inch. Flat sheet membranes are not, however, the preferred form for use in commercial applications of this invention. In large scale commercial applications, hollow fiber permeable membranes are generally more desirable because they provide a significantly larger surface area per volume unit when fabricated as modules. The composite hollow fiber membranes that comprise a porous hollow fiber support having a permeable membrane layer on the surface thereof are advantageously used for fluid separations. The methods for their production are well known (See for example, Hollow Fibers Manufacture and Applications, ed. J. Scott, Noyes Data Corporation, New Jersey, 1981, p. 264 et seg.). Porous hollow fiber polysulfone substrates are particularly useful in the preparation of composite membranes. Porous polysulfone hollow fibers can be produced from solutions of the polysulfone in a solvent/nonsolvent mixture, as is known in the art, using the procedure described by I. Cabasso et al. in Composite Hollow Fiber Membranes, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 23, 1509-1523 and in Research and Development of NS-1 and Related Polysulfone Hollow Fibers For Reverse Osmosis Desalination of Seawater PB 248,666, prepared for the Office of Water Research and Technology, Contract No. 14303165, U.S. Department of the Interior, July 1975. The well known tube-in-tube jet technique can be used for the spinning procedure, with water at about room temperature being the outside quench medium for the fibers. The quench medium in the center bore of the fiber can be air. Quenching can be followed by extensive washing to remove pore forming material. Following the wash, the hollow fibers can be dried at elevated temperature by passage through a hot air drying oven. A suitable membrane material for use in this invention is called 6F-SPS (6-fluoro sulfonate polysulfone) membrane material, which is manufactured to custom order by Innovative Membrane Systems Inc., of Norwood, Mass. USA, and is available for use in practicing this invention from UOP LLC, of Des Plaines, Ill., USA. The operating conditions for the membrane separation zone include at least a partial gas phase operation both on the nonpermeate side and on the permeate side of the membrane. Preferably, all streams on both sides of the membrane are gas phase. The temperature of the membrane separation zone is generally from 50 to 250 F. (10 to 121 C.), and preferably from 100 to 180 F. (38 to 82 C.). The pressure on the nonpermeate side, which is generally the higher pressure side, of the membrane separation zone is generally from 50 to 1000 psi(g) (345 to 6895 kPa(g)) and typically from 250 to 450 psi(g) (1724 to 3103 kPa(g)). On the permeate side, which is generally the lower pressure side, of the membrane separation zone, the pressure is generally from 0 to 500 psi(g) (0 to 3448 kPa(g)) and typically from 5 to 50 psi(g) (34.5 to 345 kPa(g)). The permeate stream contains the permeable component, which as previously mentioned, comprises at least one atom of a Group 7A element. The mole fraction of the permeable component in the permeate stream is generally greater than the mole fraction of the permeable component in the feed stream. However, depending on the flow rate of a sweep stream, if any, the mole fraction of the permeable component in the permeate stream may be less than that in the permeate stream because a sweep stream can dilute the permeate stream. In order to increase the driving force for permeation through the membrane of the permeable component, a sweep, or purge, stream is preferably introduced to the membrane separation zone on the permeate side of the membrane. The sweep stream increases the driving force for permeation by decreasing the partial pressure of the permeable component containing the Group 7A element on the permeate side of the membrane. The ideal flow rate of the sweep stream depends on a number of factors, including the nonpermeate pressure, the permeate pressure, the selectivity of the membrane, and the nonpermeate stream flow rate. The ratio of the volumetric flow rate of the sweep stream to the volumetric flow rate of the feed stream is generally from about 0.001 to about 1000. All other factors being the same, as this volumetric ratio increases the concentration of the permeable component in the permeate stream decreases, because of the dilution effect of the sweep stream in the permeate stream. As mentioned previously, this invention is applicable to a number of hydrocarbon conversion processes, and the choice of the preferred or optimum sweep stream depends on the particular hydrocarbon conversion process. For a hydrocarbon conversion process that uses this invention to recover and recycle a permeable component, preferably the product of the mole fraction of the permeable component in the sweep stream and the pressure at the permeate side of the membrane is not greater than the product of the mole fraction of the permeable component in the nonpermeate stream and the pressure at the nonpermeate side of the membrane. It is believed that for most processes that are expected to use this invention in order to recover and recycle hydrogen chloride, the charge stock to the process meets the minimum requirement for a sweep stream. The term charge stock as used herein refers to a stream containing reactants that is charged to the reaction zone of a hydrocarbon conversion process. For example, in an alkylation process charge stocks include the stream containing the alkylation substrate and the stream containing the alkylating agent, each of which is charged to the reaction zone. In an isomerization process, the charge stocks include the stream containing the straight chain paraffinic hydrocarbon, as well as any streams containing makeup hydrogen that are charged to the reaction zone. This invention is applicable to those and other processes that require a minimum level of chloride in the environment of the reaction zone and in which in the absence of this invention the inflow of chloride to the reaction zone is less than the outflow of chloride from the reaction zone. In these processes, the fact that the inflow of chloride is relatively low is generally indicative of the fact that the charge stock either contains no chloride or has a relatively low mole fraction of chloride. Little or no chloride in the charge stock, in turn, tends to make the charge stock more suitable for use as a sweep stream. This generalization about the suitability of the charge stock for use as the sweep stream applies not only to the charge stock but to other streams that are inputted into the process as well. Other input streams to the process, such as a hydrogen or nitrogen purge stream, would likewise generally have a relatively low mole fraction of hydrogen chloride and would usually be suitable for use as a sweep stream also. However, the charge stock generally has the largest flow rate of the input streams that could be possibly used as the sweep stream. The relatively large flow rate of the charge stock makes the charge stock one of the better possible sweep streams from the viewpoint of process control, because the required flow rate of the sweep stream is generally such a small fraction of the total flow rate of the charge stock that a slip stream of the charge stock is sufficient to satisfy the sweep flow requirements. Thus, if a slip stream of the charge stock passes to the membrane separation zone as the sweep stream and if the effluent of the permeate side of the membrane separation zone combines with the remainder of the charge stock and passes to the reaction zone, then the flow rate of the slip stream can be adjusted as needed for sweeping without changing the total flow rate of charge stock to the process. As a practical matter, however, the charge stock may not be the most desirable stream of the process for use, in whole or in part, as the sweep stream to the membrane separation zone. The charge stock may be not be the preferred stream because it contains contaminants or foulants that would interfere with the performance of the membrane. Also, the charge stock may be undesirable because it is at a different temperature, pressure, or phase than that which exists on the permeate side of the membrane separation zone. Thus, it may be especially advantageous to choose some other particular stream of the process for use as the sweep stream. Of course, any other stream that is a candidate for the sweep stream must already meet the previously described minimum requirement for the sweep streamnamely that of providing a relatively low partial pressure of hydrogen chloride on the permeate side of the membrane separation zone. One or more other streams in the process, such as the overhead or bottoms stream of a distillation column in the product separation zone, may contain fewer contaminants or foulants than the charge stock and may already be at the desired operating temperature, pressure, and phase as the permeate side of the membrane separation zone. Thus, the sweep stream may comprise hydrogen or hydrocarbons having from 1 to 7 carbon atoms, may be formed from at least a portion of the nonpermeate stream, or may in an isomerization process comprise the branched paraffin. Accordingly, in several of its embodiments, this invention is a process for converting hydrocarbons by isomerization or by alkylation, in which hydrogen chloride is recovered and recycled to the isomerization or alkylation zone, respectively, and in which the process is especially benefited by a particularly advantageous selection of the sweep stream from any of a number of other streams in the process. In a hollow fiber permeable membrane configuration, the arrangement of the point of introduction of the feed stream and the point of withdrawal of the permeate stream relative to the membrane can result in cocurrent flow or cross flow of the feed stream and the permeate stream, but preferably the arrangement results in countercurrent flow of the feed stream and the permeate stream. In addition, while some back-mixing can occur on both the nonpermeable and permeate sides of the membrane, preferably the feed stream flows in a plug flow manner with little or no back-mixing on the nonpermeate side of the membrane, and likewise the permeate stream flows in a plug flow manner with little or no back-mixing on the permeate side of the membrane. The nonpermeate side of a hollow fiber permeable membrane may be either the inside or the outside of the hollow fiber, but preferably the nonpermeate side is the outside of the hollow fiber and thus the permeate side is the inside of the hollow fiber. Preferably, differences in pressure between locations along the length of the nonpermeate side of the membrane, or between locations along the length of the permeate side of the membrane, are relatively small in comparison to (i.e., less than 5% of) the difference at any location along the membrane between the pressure on the nonpermeate (high-pressure) side of the membrane and the pressure on the permeate (low pressure) side of the membrane. Accordingly, in a preferred arrangement of a hollow fiber permeable membrane, the feed stream is introduced at one end of the hollow fiber and flows in a plug-flow manner along the length of and on the outside of the hollow fiber, while the permeable component is collected along the length of the inside of the hollow fiber and the permeate stream flows in a plug flow manner along the length of the inside of the hollow fiber and is withdrawn from the same end of the hollow fiber at which the feed stream is introduced. When a sweep stream is used in the preferred arrangement, the sweep steam is introduced into the inside of the hollow fiber at the end of the hollow fiber that is opposite from the end at which the feed steam is introduced and the permeate steam is withdrawn. The sweep stream then flows inside and along the length of the hollow fiber in a plug flow manner and is withdrawn with the permeate stream. FIGS. 1 , 2 , and 3 illustrate, respectively, preferred embodiments of this invention for use in the alkylation of isoparaffins with olefins, in butane isomerization, and in pentane and hexane isomerization. For clarity and simplicity, some items associated with the operation of the embodiments have not been shown. These items include flow and pressure control valves, pumps, heat exchangers, temperature and pressure monitoring systems, vessel internals, etc., which may be of customary design. FIGS. 1 , 2 , and 3 are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention as set forth in the claims. Referring now to FIG. 1 , an olefinic charge stock comprising an alkylating agent (C 3 -C 5 olefin) enters the process through a line 10 . The olefinic charge stock combines with a recycle stream comprising an alkylation substrate (C 4 -C 5 branched paraffin) and hydrogen chloride flowing through a line 12 and a regenerated catalyst stream comprising at least partially regenerated catalyst particles that flows through a line 32 . The catalyst particles contain chloride. The flow rate of catalyst particles through the line 32 is controlled by one or more fluid-controlled valves (not shown), which are also called nonmechanical valves. Nonmechanical valves, which include L valves, J valves, or K valves, are described in an article entitled L Valves Characterized for Solid Flow, beginning at page 149 in the March, 1978 issue of Hydrocarbon Processing, in the text entitled Gas Fluidization Technology, edited by D. Geldart and published by John Wiley and Sons in 1986, and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,202,673. A slip stream (also not shown) of the recycle stream can be used as the control fluid for each nonmechanical valve. The combined mixture of C 4 -C 5 branched paraffins, C 3 -C 5 olefins, and catalyst particles flows through a line 14 and enters a transport reactor 16 , where C 3 -C 5 olefins alkylate C 4 -C 5 branched paraffins in at least a partial liquid phase to produce an alkylate comprising at least some C 7 hydrocarbons. Transport reactors are well known in continuous catalytic hydrocarbon conversion processes. In a transport reactor, the catalyst bed as a whole moves and is transported with a fluid phase. Thus, a transport reactor can be contrasted with a fixed bed catalytic reactor and with an ebulated bed catalytic reactor. In a fixed bed reactor the catalyst particles do not move, and in an ebulated bed reactor the catalyst particles are suspended in a fluid but the settling velocity of the catalyst particles balances the fluid upflow velocity so that the catalyst bed as a whole is not transported with the fluid phase. Although it is generally the case that the direction of catalyst flow through a transport reactor is upward, the direction may also be downward, horizontal, a direction that is intermediate between vertical and horizontal, or a combination of these directions. Transport reactor 16 is preferably a riser-reactor, and is referred to hereinafter as riser-reactor 16 . A riser-reactor is a transport reactor in which the direction of catalyst flow is upward. Riser-reactors are commonly used in hydrocarbon processing, such as fluidized catalytic cracking and more recently in motor fuel alkylation. In a common arrangement, a fluid hydrocarbon reactant engages a solid hydrocarbon conversion catalyst at the bottom of the riser-reactor and transports the catalyst in a fluidized state up the riser-reactor. During the ascent through the riser-reactor, the catalyst promotes certain desired conversion reactions among the reactants in order to produce desired products and, in addition, heavy hydrocarbons tend to deposit on the catalyst, at least partially deactivating the catalyst. A stream of catalyst containing heavy hydrocarbon deposits, alkylate, C 4 -C 5 branched paraffins, C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons, organic chloride-containing compounds, and hydrogen chloride discharges from the top of the riser-reactor 16 . The effluent of riser-reactor 16 flows through a line 18 and enters a reactor effluent separation zone 20 , which separates the riser-reactor effluent into a hydrocarbon-containing stream that flows through a line 22 and a spent catalyst stream containing catalyst having heavy hydrocarbon deposits that flows through a line 28 . The stream in the line 22 contains alkylate, C 4 -C 5 branched paraffins, C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons, hydrogen chloride, organic chloride-containing compounds, such as butyl chlorides, pentyl chlorides, and chloride-containing compounds having up to about 12 or more carbon atoms. In order to decompose these organic chlorides, some or all of the stream in the line 22 flows to a catalytic dechlorination zone 24 , where at least a portion of the organic chloride-containing compounds are decomposed into hydrogen chloride and one or more hydrocarbons. Any suitable catalytic dechlorination zone and dechlorination catalyst known to a person of ordinary skill in the art may be used, and the choice of a particular dechlorination zone or catalyst is not critical to the success of this invention. Some or all of the dechlorination zone effluent passes through a line 26 , combines with a hereinafter-described regeneration effluent stream that flows through a line 38 , and the combined stream flows through a line 42 to a product separation zone 50 . The spent catalyst stream that flows through the line 28 enters a regeneration zone 30 for the purpose of restoring the activity or selectivity of the catalyst particles. The catalyst particles in the spent catalyst stream are usually at least partially deactivated by the deposition of heavy hydrocarbons on the catalytically active sites of the catalyst. Heavy hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons having a carbon number greater than that of the desired alkylate product. In order to remove alkylate and heavy hydrocarbons from the catalyst particles, the regeneration zone 30 may comprise one or more subzones, which are not shown in FIG. 1 . For example, the regeneration zone may be subdivided into three subzones: an upper subzone zone, a middle subzone, and a lower subzone. The upper subzone may be a liquid-phase, or mild, regeneration zone, where the catalyst particles are contacted with hot, hydrogen-saturated isobutane liquid in order to remove alkylate and at least a portion of the heavy hydrocarbons from the catalyst particles. The middle zone may be a flushing zone, where the catalyst particles are contacted with isobutane in order to remove residual hydrogen from the void volume and the pore volume of the catalyst. The lower zone may be a catalyst withdrawal zone, from which catalyst particles are withdrawn and recirculated to the riser-reactor 16 . Where the regeneration zone 30 is subdivided into two or more zones, conventional fluid and particle flow distributors may be used to divide or separate the zones from each other. Such conventional distributors include pipe distributors, conical baffles, and annular baffles. Annular baffles are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,662,081 (Greenwood), U.S. Pat. No. 4,665,632 (Greenwood), and U.S. Pat. No. 5,397,458 (Micklich et al.). The at least partially regenerated catalyst that is withdrawn from the regeneration zone 30 forms the previously mentioned regenerated catalyst stream which flows through the line 32 . The regeneration of the catalyst particles in regeneration zone 30 produces a regeneration effluent stream that leaves the regeneration zone 30 in a line 38 . The composition of the regeneration effluent stream will depend on the particular regeneration steps, conditions, and streams that are employed to regenerate the catalyst particles. Typically, the regeneration effluent stream comprises branched C 4 -C 5 paraffins, a small quantity of the heavy hydrocarbons that were removed from the catalyst, hydrogen, and hydrogen chloride. The regeneration effluent stream passes to the product separation zone 50 through the lines 38 and 42 , as described previously. The product separation zone 50 is fed by two streams, namely the stream flowing through the line 42 and a paraffinic charge stock comprising a mixture of normal and branched C 4 -C 5 paraffins that enters through a line 44 . The product separation zone 50 , in turn, produces four outlet streams: a bottom stream, a heavy sidecut stream, a light sidecut stream, and an overhead stream. The bottom stream contains alkylate and a small amount of heavy hydrocarbons and exits the product separation zone 50 through a line 46 . The heavy sidecut stream contains normal C 4 -C 5 paraffins and possibly C 3 hydrocarbons, exits the product separation zone 50 through a line 48 , and is rejected from the process. The light sidecut stream contains branched C 4 -C 5 paraffins and possibly hydrogen chloride, and exits the product separation zone 50 through a line 54 . Most of the light sidecut stream passes through a line 56 , combines with a hereinafter-described permeate stream in a line 64 , and is recycled to the inlet of the riser-reactor 16 through the lines 12 and 14 , as described previously. Alternatively, the streams in lines 56 and 64 may be routed separately rather than in combination to the riser-reactor 16 . The remainder of the light sidecut stream passes through a line 62 and serves as the sweep stream to the membrane separation zone 60 , which is described hereinafter. The overhead stream of the product separation zone 50 is gaseous and contains hydrogen, hydrogen chloride, C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons, and possibly branched C 4 -C 5 paraffins. The overhead stream generally contains a higher concentration of hydrogen chloride than the light sidecut stream. The overhead stream exits through a line 52 and is the inlet stream to the membrane separation zone 60 . In practice, the product separation zone 50 typically comprises two fractionation columns: an isostripper and a depropanizer. In a process with such a two-column zone, the stream in the line 42 and the paraffinic charge stock in the line 44 pass to the isostripper. The isostripper produces a bottom stream comprising alkylate and a small amount of heavy hydrocarbons, a heavier-boiling sidecut stream comprising normal C 4 -C 5 paraffins, a lighter-boiling sidecut stream comprising branched C 4 -C 5 paraffins, and an overhead stream comprising hydrogen chloride, hydrogen, and C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons. The bottom stream and the heavier-boiling sidecut stream are recovered from the process. The lighter-boiling sidecut stream is recycled to the inlet of the riser-reactor 16 , and the isostripper overhead stream passes to the depropanizer. The depropanizer separates the overhead stream from the isostripper into a gaseous depropanizer overhead stream having the composition of the stream in the line 52 in FIG. 1 , which is the inlet stream to the membrane separation zone 60 . The depropanizer also produces a bottom stream comprising isobutane that is recycled to the inlet of the riser-reactor 16 . In addition, the depropanizer produces a sidecut stream comprising isobutane vapor, which functions as the sweep stream in the line 62 in FIG. 1 for the membrane separation zone 60 . The function of the membrane separation zone 60 is to selectively separate the hydrogen and hydrogen chloride from the light hydrocarbons in the inlet stream flowing in the line 52 . The membrane separation zone 60 contains a membrane 63 that comprises a resin membrane comprising a polymer or copolymer containing the polymer repeat unit of the previously mentioned formula (I). Light hydrocarbons such as C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons in the inlet stream in the line 52 do not selectively pass through the membrane 63 and are withdrawn in a nonpermeate stream in a line 58 . These light hydrocarbons may be used as fuel, either directly or after scrubbing with caustic to remove trace amounts of hydrogen chloride. Most of the hydrogen chloride that is present in the inlet stream in the line 52 selectively passes through the membrane 63 and is recovered in the permeate stream, which exits the membrane separation zone 60 in a line 64 . Hydrogen that is present in the inlet stream in the line 52 also tends to selectively pass through the membrane 63 and is also recovered in the permeate stream. In order to improve the driving force for the selective passage of hydrogen chloride through the membrane, the previously mentioned sweep stream passes through the line 62 to the permeate side of the membrane 63 . The sweep stream is preferably a vapor, such as gaseous C 4 -C 5 branched paraffins, and thus if the light sidecut stream in the line 54 is liquid phase, then means (not shown in FIG. 1 ) may be provided to vaporize the stream in the line 62 . Because the sweep stream has a low mole fraction of hydrogen chloride, the sweep stream tends to dilute the partial pressure of hydrogen chloride on the permeate side of the membrane 63 , thereby enhancing the passage of hydrogen chloride through the membrane 63 . The use of a sweep stream comprising C 4 -C 5 branched paraffins results in the permeate stream in line 64 also containing branched C 4 -C 5 branched paraffins. FIG. 2 , as previously mentioned, is a preferred embodiment of this invention for use in butane isomerization. Referring now to FIG. 2 , a recycle stream comprising normal butanes and isobutane flows through a line 103 from the bottom of a stabilizer column 140 , as described hereinafter, and enters a deisobutanizer zone 110 . A normal butane stream is withdrawn from the deisobutanizer zone 110 and passes to an isomerization reaction zone 130 via a line 111 . In addition to the normal butane stream in the line 111 , the deisobutanizer zone 110 also produces an isobutane stream comprising isobutane that is recovered from the process via a line 123 and a heavier stream comprising higher-boiling C 4 hydrocarbons that is recovered from the process via a line 121 . A dried butane charge stock enters the process through a line 101 , and is charged to the isomerization reaction zone 130 . In addition, makeup hydrogen, also dried, enters the isomerization reaction zone 130 via a line 126 , and a hereinafter-described permeate stream comprising hydrogen and hydrogen chloride enters the isomerization reaction zone 130 via a line 162 . In the isomerization reaction zone 130 , normal butane isomerizes to isobutane in the presence of a chloride-containing catalyst, but the specific composition of the particular chloride-containing catalyst is not critical to the success of this invention. An isomerization reaction zone effluent comprising hydrogen, hydrogen chloride, light C 1 to C 3 hydrocarbons, isobutane, normal butane, and higher-boiling C 4 hydrocarbons is withdrawn from the isomerization reaction zone 130 through a line 142 . The isomerization reaction zone 130 may comprise reactor(s), heat exchanger(s), compressor(s), and other equipment which are conventional, are known to persons of ordinary skill in the art of hydrocarbon processing, and need not be described in detail herein. The particular locations within the isomerization reaction zone 130 to which the streams in the lines 101 , 111 , 126 , and 162 pass and from which the effluent in the line 142 passes are not critical to the practice of this invention. The isomerization reaction zone effluent passes through the line 142 to a stabilizer column 140 . The stabilizer column 140 separates dissolved hydrogen, hydrogen chloride, and light C 1 to C 3 hydrocarbons from the effluent of the second isomerization reactor 130 . The overhead vapor stream of the stabilizer column 140 , which contains hydrogen, hydrogen chloride, and light C 1 to C 3 hydrocarbons, passes through a line 144 to a partial condenser 146 . The effluent of the condenser 146 flows through a line 148 to a stabilizer overhead receiver 150 . All of the condensed liquid that enters the stabilizer overhead receiver 150 is withdrawn through a line 152 and is returned to the stabilizer 140 as reflux. The vapor stream from the overhead receiver 150 contains hydrogen, hydrogen chloride, and light C 1 to C 3 hydrocarbons and passes through a line 154 to a membrane separation zone 160 . The function of the membrane separation zone 160 is to separate the hydrogen and hydrogen chloride from the light C 1 to C 3 hydrocarbons in the vapor stream flowing in the line 154 . The membrane separation zone 160 contains a resin membrane 163 comprising a polymer or copolymer containing the polymer repeat unit of the previously mentioned formula (I). Most of the light hydrocarbons in the vapor stream from the overhead receiver 150 do not selectively pass through the membrane 163 but instead are withdrawn in a line 156 in a nonpermeate stream that can be burned as fuel. Most of the hydrogen and hydrogen chloride that is present in the vapor stream in the line 154 selectively passes through the membrane 163 and is recovered in the permeate stream, which exits the membrane separation zone 160 in the line 162 . In order to improve the driving force for the selective passage of hydrogen and hydrogen chloride through the membrane 163 , a sweep stream passes through a line 158 to the permeate side of the membrane 163 . The sweep stream may be a vapor sidecut from a lower portion of the stabilizer column 140 , but the sweep stream is preferably a liquid stream from the bottom of the stabilizer column 140 that is subsequently vaporized. In either case, the sweep stream is a vapor stream and has low mole fractions of hydrogen and hydrogen chloride, and therefore the sweep stream tends to dilute the partial pressures of hydrogen and hydrogen chloride on the permeate side of the membrane 163 . The permeate stream in the line 162 thus contains not only hydrogen and hydrogen chloride that permeated through the membrane 163 but also components of the sweep stream. Isobutane, normal butane, and higher-boiling C 4 hydrocarbons are recovered from the bottom of the stabilizer column 140 in a bottoms stream that flows in a line 168 . The bottoms stream is divided into four portions. A small portion of the bottoms stream serves as the previously-mentioned sweep stream and is routed via the line 158 through a vaporizer (not shown) to the membrane separation zone 160 . The remaining part of the bottoms stream flows through a line 170 , and a second portion flows through a line 178 , is reboiled in reboiler 180 , and recirculates to the stabilizer column 140 via a line 182 . Another portion of the bottoms stream flows to storage through a line 172 and a line 173 . The final portion of the bottoms stream flows through the line 172 and is recycled to the deisobutanizer zone 110 via the line 103 , as described previously. FIG. 3 , as previously mentioned, is a preferred embodiment of this invention for use in pentane and hexane isomerization. Referring now to FIG. 3 , a dried fresh charge stock which comprises normal pentane and normal hexane enters the process through a line 201 and passes into an isomerization reaction zone 230 . Makeup hydrogen, also dried, enters the isomerization reaction zone 230 via a line 226 , and a hereinafter-described permeate stream comprising hydrogen and hydrogen chloride enters the isomerization reaction zone 230 via a line 262 . In the isomerization reaction zone 230 , in the presence of a chloride-containing catalyst, normal pentane isomerizes to isopentane (2-methylbutane), and normal hexane isomerizes mainly to 2,2-dimethylbutane but also to 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, and 2,3-dimethylbutane. The specific composition of the particular chloride-containing catalyst is not critical to the success of this invention. An isomerization reaction zone effluent comprising hydrogen, hydrogen chloride, light C 1 to C 4 hydrocarbons, normal pentane, isopentane, normal hexane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, 2,3-dimethylbutane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, and higher-boiling C 6 hydrocarbons is withdrawn from the isomerization reaction zone 230 through a line 242 . The isomerization reaction zone 230 may comprise reactor(s), heat exchanger(s), compressor(s), and other equipment which are conventional, are known to persons of ordinary skill in the art of hydrocarbon processing, and need not be described in detail herein. The particular locations within the isomerization reaction zone 230 to which the streams in the lines 201 , 226 , and 262 pass, and from which the effluent in the line 242 passes, are not critical to the practice of this invention. The isomerization reaction zone effluent passes through the line 242 to a stabilizer column 240 . Stabilizer column 240 produces an overhead vapor stream comprising light C 1 to C 4 hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and hydrogen chloride that flows through a line 244 . The overhead vapor stream passes through a line 244 to a partial condenser 246 . The partially condensed overhead stream flows through a line 248 and enters an overhead receiver 250 . All of the condensed liquid entering the overhead receiver 250 returns to the stabilizer column as reflux via a line 252 . The vapor stream from the overhead receiver 250 , which contains hydrogen chloride, hydrogen, and light C 1 to C 4 hydrocarbons, passes through a line 254 to a membrane separation zone 260 . Membrane separation zone 260 contains a resin membrane 263 comprising a polymer or copolymer containing the polymer repeat unit of the previously mentioned formula (I). Most of the light hydrocarbons flowing in line 254 are recovered in the nonpermeate stream flowing in a line 256 . Most of the hydrogen and hydrogen chloride flowing in the line 254 selectively passes through the membrane 263 and are recovered in the permeate stream in a line 262 . A sweep stream passes through a line 258 to the permeate side of the membrane 263 . Although the sweep stream may be a vapor sidecut from the stabilizer column 240 , the sweep stream is preferably a portion of the liquid bottoms stream of the stabilizer column 240 that is subsequently vaporized. The sweep stream contains less than 1 mol-% hydrogen and less than 0.01 mol-% (100 mol-ppm) hydrogen chloride in order to enhance the driving force for permeation through the membrane 263 of hydrogen and hydrogen chloride, as described previously. The bottoms stream of the stabilizer column 240 contains mostly branched pentanes and branched hexanes that are recovered in a line 268 . A small portion of the bottoms stream is the previously mentioned sweep stream that is routed via the line 258 to the membrane separation zone 260 . The remaining part of the bottoms stream passes through a line 270 . Another portion of the bottoms stream passes through a line 278 , is reboiled in a reboiler 280 , and returns to the stabilizer column 240 via a line 282 . The final portion of the stabilizer bottoms stream is the net product, which flows through a line 272 . EXAMPLES A membrane comprising a polymer or copolymer containing the polymer repeat unit of the previously mentioned formula (I) was tested for permeation of hydrogen chloride as follows. A feed comprising 5 mol-% hydrogen chloride, 10 mol-% hydrogen, 80 mol-% methane, and 5 mol-% propane was passed to a micromodule containing a 6F-SPS membrane obtained from Innovative Membrane Systems. The membrane was maintained at a constant temperature of 150 F. (66 C.) in a temperature controlled box. The feed passed to the permeate side of the micromodule, which was maintained at a pressure of 100 psi(a) (689.5 kPa(a)). Nonpermeate was withdrawn from the nonpermeate side of the membrane. Permeate was withdrawn from the permeate side of the membrane and a portion of the permeate was analyzed by a gas chromatograph. The permeate side of the micromodule was maintained at 15 psi(a) (103.4 kPa(a)). Rotometers measured the flow rates of the feed, nonpermeate, and permeate. The stage cut, which is defined as the volumetric flow rate of the permeate divided by the volumetric flow rate of the feed times 100, was from 1 to 3 percent. These conditions of the micromodule were maintained for 201 hours. The observed selectivities were as follows: Components Selectivity Methane relative to propane 3-3.5 Hydrogen relative to hydrogen chloride 1.2-2.5 Hydrogen chloride relative to methane 60-90 These selectivities show the surprising results that hydrogen chloride permeates through the membrane from 60 to 90 times faster than methane, and even faster yet relative to propane. It is believed that hydrocarbons heavier than propane permeate through the membrane even more slowly than propane, and so hydrogen chloride permeates much faster than all of the light hydrocarbons. These data also show the unexpected result that the permeability of hydrogen chloride is almost as great as (i.e., 40 to 83%) of hydrogen, which is the component of the feed that permeates most readily through the membrane.
