ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT This invention was made with government support under Grant No. DE-FC0387-ER60615, awarded by the Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Alzheimers disease affects approximately 20 to 40% of the population over 80 years of age, the fastest growing age group in the United States and other post-industrial countries. Common features in the brain of patients with Alzheimers disease include the presence of abundant intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and extracellular amyloid rich -amyloid plaques. NFTs are cytoskeletal pathologies largely composed of aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins assembled into periodically restricted amyloid fibers called paired helical filaments. The major component of amyloid plaques is a peptide, a small 39-43 aminoacid long -amyloid peptide that is generated from the cleavage of a larger amyloid precursor protein. However, except for diffuse plaques formed almost exclusively of B-amyloid peptides, amyloid plaques are complex lesions containing numerous associated cellular products. Mutations causing increased production of the 42 amino acid form of this peptide have been genetically linked to autosomal dominant familial forms of Alzheimers diseases. Deposits of -amyloid occur very early in the disease process, long before clinical symptoms develop. Because these mutations appear to be pathogenic and cause Alzheimers diseases in transgenic mice, -amyloids are widely believed to play a causal role in the disease. Whether or not amyloid deposits are causal, they are certainly a key part of the diagnosis. Further, because amyloid plaques occur early in the disease, the ability to image deposits would provide a convenient marker for early diagnosis and prevention of the disease as well as a method for monitoring the effectiveness of therapeutic regimens. Alzheimers disease is currently definitively diagnosed by taking sections from postmortem brain and quantifying the density of neocortical amyloid deposits. Unfortunately, current techniques for detecting amyloid deposits and/or NFTs require postmortem or biopsy analysis. For example, thioflavin fluorescent-labeling of amyloid in brain sections in vitro is currently a widely-used method for evaluation of the brain. Another potential amyloid probe, Chrysamine-G, a congo red derivative, has also been developed. Congo red is a charged molecule and thus lacks sufficient hydrophobicity for diffusion through the blood brain barrier and is therefore not useful as an in vivo label. See Klunk et al, Neurobiology of Aging, 16:541-548 (1995), and PCT Publication No. WO 96/34853. Chrysamine G enters the blood brain barrier better than Congo red, but its ability to label amyloid plaques in Alzheimers brain appears weak. See for example, H. Han, C-G Cho and P. T. Lansbury, Jr J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118, 4506 (1996); N. A. Dezutter et al, J. Label. Compd. Radiopharm. 42, 309 (1999). Similarly, earlier attempts to use monoclonal antibodies as probes for in-vivo imaging of -amyloid were hampered by their limited ability to cross the blood brain barrier. See R. E. Majocha et al, J. Nucl. Med. 33, 2184 (1992). More recently, the use of monobiotinylated conjugates of 1251 -A1-40 with permeability through the blood brain barrier has also been proposed (See Y. Saito et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 22, 2288 (1991)), but its ability to label -amyloid plaques and/or NFTs in vivo has not yet been demonstrated. Quantitation of the deposits in vivo is not yet possible with the currently available probes. Accordingly, a need exists for a convenient marker for early diagnosis of Alzheimers disease. In vivo, non invasive determination of regional cerebral glucose metabolic rates (rCMRGl) with positron emission tomography (PET) has been an important tool in the assessment of brain function in Alzheimers disease patients. Numerous studies using 2-F-18fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) have demonstrated a characteristic metabolic pattern of hypometabolism in temporoparietal and frontal association areas. A few of these studies have compared rCMRGl with postmortem regional neuronal pathology. These results and the uncertainties of the Alzheimers disease pathogenic cascade highlight the importance of assessing amyloid and neurofibril deposition in vivo, non-invasively in these patients. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides methods for labeling structures, including -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, in vivo and in vitro, and comprises contacting a compound of formula (I): with mammalian tissue. In formula (I), R 1 is selected from the group consisting of C(O)-alkyl, C(O)-alkylenyl-R 4 , C(O)O-alkyl, C(O)O-alkylenyl-R 4 , CC(CN) 2 -alkyl, CC(CN) 2 -alkylenyl-R 4 , R 4 is a radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl and substituted aryl; R 5 is a radical selected from the group consisting of NH 2 , OH, SH, NH-alkyl, NHR 4 , NH-alkylenyl-R 4 , O-alkyl, O-alkylenyl-R 4 , S-alkyl, and S-alkylenyl-R 4 ; R 6 is a radical selected from the group consisting of CN, COOH, C(O)O-alkyl, C(O)O-alkylenyl-R 4 , C(O)-alkyl, C(O)-alkylenyl-R 4 , C(O)-halogen, C(O)NH, C(O)NH 2 -alkyl, C(O)NH-alkylenyl-R 4 ; R 7 is a radical selected from the group consisting of O, NH, and S; and R 8 is N, O or S. In formula (I), R 2 and R 3 are each independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and alkylenyl-R 10 , wherein R 10 is selected from the group consisting of OH, OTs, halogen, spiperone, spiperone ketal and spiperone-3-yl. Alternatively, R 2 and R 3 together form a heterocyclic ring, optionally substituted with at least one radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkoxy, OH, OTs, halogen, alkylenyl-R 10 , carbonyl, spiperone, spiperone ketal and spiperone-3-yl. In the compounds of formula (I), one or more of the hydrogen, halogen or carbon atoms can, optionally, be replaced with a radiolabel. For in vitro detection of -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in brain tissue, the plaques are labeled, and the brain tissue is then observed with a fluorescence microscope. For in vivo detection, the -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in brain tissue are labeled, preferably by injection of a solution containing a radiolabeled compound of formula (I). The locations of the labeled -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are then observed by any method capable of detecting and depicting the distribution of the radiolabeled compound within the body. According to the methods of the invention, amyloid deposits in cryostat and paraffin sections of Alzheimer-diseased (AD) brain tissue are labeled with a level of sensitivity similar to thioflavin S. Use of the present invention, however, has several advantages over using thioflavin S. Namely, no pretreatments are required. Moreover, unlike with thioflavin S, the methods work with minimal washing and without formalin or paraformaldehyde fixation or differentiation of tissue. Additionally, stock solution can be kept in the freezer for six months and still produce acceptable results at 1/100 to 1/1,000 dilutions, eliminating the need to make the stock up fresh, as is required for thioflavin S labeling. Systemically injected compositions according to the invention readily penetrate the blood brain barrier and label amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles demonstrating the ability of the present compositions to act as an in vivo imaging probe. The methods of the invention achieve in vivo labeling and detection of -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain of a living patient. The methods of the invention not only permit detection of Alzheimers disease, but also provide a way for physicians to monitor the progress of patients undergoing treatment for the disease. Thus, physicians can better determine whether a particular treatment method is successful and worthwhile. In still another embodiment, the invention is directed to a composition comprising a compound of formula (I): R 1 is selected from the group consisting of C(O)-alkyl, C(O)-alkylenyl-R 4 , C(O)O-alkyl, C(O)O-alkylenyl-R 4 , CC(CN) 2 -alkyl, CC(CN) 2 -alkylenyl-R 4 , R 4 is a radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl and substituted aryl; R 5 is a radical selected from the group consisting of NH 2 , OH, SH, NH-alkyl, NHR 4 , NH-alkylenyl-R 4 , O-alkyl, O-alkylenyl-R 4 , S-alkyl, and S-alkylenyl-R 4 ; R 6 is a radical selected from the group consisting of CN, COOH, C(O)O-alkyl, C(O)O-alkylenyl-R 4 , C(O)-alkyl, C(O)-alkylenyl-R 4 , C(O)-halogen, C(O)NH 2 , C(O)NH-alkyl, C(O)NH-alkylenyl-R 4 ; R 7 is a radical selected from the group consisting of O, NH, and S; R 8 is N, O or S; R 2 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl and alkylenyl-R 5 and R 3 is alkylenyl-R 5 , and R 5 is selected from the group consisting of OH, OTs, halogen, spiperone, spiperone ketal, and spiperone-3-yl, or R 2 and R 3 together form a heterocyclic ring, optionally substituted with at least one radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkoxy, OH, OTs, halogen, alkylenyl-R 5 , carbonyl, spiperone, spiperone ketal and spiperone-3-yl. One or more of the hydrogen, halogen or carbon atoms can optionally be replaced with a radiolabel. The invention is more preferably related to a composition comprising a compound of formula (II): R 2 is selected from the group consisting of alkyl and alkylenyl-R 10 and R 3 is alkylenyl-R 10 , wherein R 10 is selected from the group consisting of OH, OTs, halogen, spiperone, spiperone ketal and spiperone-3-yl, or R 2 and R 3 together form a heterocyclic ring, optionally substituted with at least one radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkoxy, OH, OTs, halogen, alkylenyl-R 10 , carbonyl, spiperone, spiperone ketal and spiperone-3-yl, and R 9 is an alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl group, and to pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof. One or more of the hydrogen, halogen or carbon atoms can optionally be replaced with a radiolabel.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to methods for labeling structures such as -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in vivo and in vitro. The methods all involve contacting a compound of formula (I): with mammalian tissue.

R 7 is a radical selected from the group consisting of O, NH, and S. R 8 is N, O or S. In formula (I), R 2 and R 3 are each independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl and alkylenyl-R 10 , wherein R 10 is selected from the group consisting of OH, OTs, halogen, spiperone, spiperone ketal and spiperone-3-yl. Alternatively, R 2 and R 3 together form a heterocyclic ring, optionally substituted with at least one radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, alkoxy, OH, OTs, halogen, alkylenyl-R 10 , carbonyl, spiperone, spiperone ketal and spiperone-3-yl. In the compounds of formula (I), one or more of the hydrogen, halogen or carbon atoms may optionally be replaced with a radiolabel. In a preferred embodiment, the methods of the invention involve contacting a compound of formula (II): with mammalian tissue. In formula (II), R 2 and R 3 are as defined above, and R 9 is an alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl group. As used herein, the term alkyl refers to a straight or branched chain monovalent radical of saturated carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, pentyl, and hexyl. The term alkylenyl refers to a divalent analog of an alkyl group, i.e., methylenyl (CH 2 ), ethylenyl (CH 2 CH 2 ), etc. The term aryl refers to a mono- or polycyclic substituted or unsubstituted aromatic ring. As used herein, the term lower alkyl refers to a straight or branched chain monovalent radical having from one to four saturated carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, and t-butyl. As used herein, the term heterocyclic ring refers to a non-aromatic, monocyclic or bicyclic radical containing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 ring atoms, each of which is saturated or unsaturated, including 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. Nonlimiting examples include aziridine, azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperizine and derivatives thereof. Preferably, these heterocyclic rings are substituted with alkyl groups or substituted alkyl groups, for example, alkyl groups having substituents such as those defined for R 4 above. For the compounds of formula (I) and formula (II), preferably R 2 and R 3 are each independently alkyl, more preferably lower alkyl. For the compounds of formula (II), preferably R 9 is lower alkyl, more preferably methyl or ethyl, aryl and substituted aryl. Particularly preferred compounds for use in connection with the invention are 2-(1,1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-dimethylaminonaphthalene (DDNP) and 2-(1,1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-(ethyl)(methyl)(amino)-naphthalene, both of which can be optionally radiolabeled. Another preferred compound, particularly for use in vivo, is 2-(1.1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-(2- 18 F-fluoroethyl)-methylamino)-naphthalene (F-18FDDNP). The present invention is also directed to methods for detecting structures, such as -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in vitro and in vivo. The term structures refers to aggregates of biological materials containing peptides and other cellular materials that may occur as part of a disease pathology. The term peptides includes proteins. The compounds described above have fluorescent activity in the range of about 470 to 610 nm. In one application, the present invention labels -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in brain tissue. Accordingly, for in vitro detection Alzheimers disease, the compounds are contacted with brain tissue, and the brain tissue observed with a fluorescence microscope. For in vivo detection, preferably the compounds are radiolabeled. A preferred radiolabel is 18 F, which has a half-life of approximately two hours for position emission tomography (PET). Another radiolabel is radioiodine, for example, 123 I for use with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Alternatively, other radiolabels are used, such as 11 C, 13 N and 15 O, although these radiolabels are less desirable due to their relatively short half-lives. Any atom in the compound can be replaced with a suitable radiolabel. Radiolabeling can be achieved by any method known to those skilled in the art. For example, dry F-18fluoride ion 18 O(p,n) 18 F in K 2 CO 3 (0.75 mg) and Kryptofix 2.2.2 (19 mg) are added to a solution of the compound of formula (I) or formula (II) (4 mg in 1 mL CH 3 CN). The mixture is heated in an oil bath at 85 C. for about 10 to 40 minutes. After cooling and dilution with water, the radiolabeled product can be purified by preparative HPLC. Kryptofix 2.2.2 is a crown ether, available from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, Wis.). A solution containing the radiolabeled compound is then injected into the patient. As used herein, the term patient refers to any mammal, including humans, rats, mice, dogs and cats. Neuroanatomical regions can be determined manually using MRI scans, for example, using a Tela magnet, and then on amyloid-PET (positron emission tomography) and FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose-PET) by coregistration of the MRI scans. PET has current resolution of 2 to 3 min, a dynamic determination of radiolabeled compound deposition in the brain, and permits detection of abnormal areas. By the above-described methods, diseases characterized by the accumulation of -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles such as Alzheimers disease and other diseases associated with brain deterioration, can be detected.

The residue was dissolved in acetone and loaded onto a 4 mm dry silica plate for radial chromatography. The plate was eluted with a 1:1 mixture of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate. Appropriate fractions were collected and evaporated to give 125 mg (12%)of 1-6-ethyl-(2-hydroxylethyl)-amino-2-naphthylethanone. A solution of 1-6-ethyl-(2-hydroxylethyl)-amino-2-naphthylethanone (125 mg, 0.486 mmol) in pyridine (3.5 mL) was cooled to 15 C. and p-toluenesulfonic anhydride (252 mg, 0.81 mmol) was added with stirring under argon. The reaction mixture was allowed to slowly warm up to the room temperature, and stirring was continued for 24 hours. Because TLC (silica, 10% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether) revealed that the starting material was still present, more p-toluenesulphonic anhydride (252 mg, 0.81 mmol) was added, and stirring was continued for an additional 24 hours. The mixture was then cooled in an ice-water bath and distributed between brine and ether. The organic layer was dried and evaporated to leave an oily residue. The product, 6-acetyl-2-(ethyl-2-(4-methylphenyl)-sulfonyloxy-ethylamino)-naphthalene, was isolated by radial chromatography (1 mm silica, dichloromethane) in 30% yield.

The course of the reaction was followed by TLC (silica, 5% methanol in dichloromethane). Every 10 minutes an additional amount of the dicarbonate was added until all starting material had reacted. A total of approximately 1.5 equivalents were used. A mixture of water and dichloromethane (60 mL each) was added, and, after thorough shaking, the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with an additional 30 mL of dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts were dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. During this procedure, the color of the solution turned from pink to light yellow.

The TFA was removed in vacuo at room temperature. 1 H NMR: 2.72 (s, 3H, CH 3 ), 3.50 and 3.63 (broad, 8H, piperazine), 7.18 (broad s, 1H, 5-H), 7.29 (d, 1H, 7-H), 7.59 (d, 1H, 3-H), 7.79 (d, 1H, 4-H), 7.87 (d, 1H, 8-H), 8.04 (s, 1H, 1-H), 9.0 (broad, 1.5H, NH and acid); J 7,8 8.8 Hz, J 3,4 8.4 Hz. 19 F NMR: 76.2 (CF 3 COO). NMR of the residue revealed that the tert-butyloxycarbonyl group has been removed and that there was some TFA left ( 19 F NMR). Dichloromethane (10 mL) was added and the solution was washed with saturated NaHCO 3 solution, dried, and evaporated in vacuo. A light yellow oil was obtained, which, on standing at room temperature, turned dark red. TLC showed that the change in color is due to decomposition of 2-1-(6-piperazino-2-naphthyl)ethylidenemalononitrile into several products, the most intense spot being low-R f red-orange. Selected 1 H NMR signals after neutralization: 2.72 (s, 3H, CH 3 ), 3.09 and 3.35 (t, J5 Hz, 8H, piperazine), 7.08 (s, 1H, 5-H, 8.02 (s, 1H, 1-H). Example 1(f)Preparation of 2-(1.1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-(2- 18 -F-fluoroethyl)-methylamino)-naphthalene (F-18FDDNP) A mixture of 4.15 g (55.5 mmol) NaHSO 3 , 8 mL of water, 0.78 g (4.19 mmol) of 1-(6-hydroxy-2-naphthyl)-1-ethanone (prepared as described in Example 1(b)), and 8 mL of 2-methylaminoethanol was heated and stirred in a steel bomb at 140 C. for 28 hours. After cooling, the mixture was distributed between ethyl acetate and water (500 mL and 200 mL, respectively). The organic layer was dried and evaporated to leave raw 1-(6-(2-hydroxyethyl-methylamino)-2-naphthyl)-1-ethanone (0.749 g, 73%) of which was further purified by radial chromatography (4 mm SiO 3 , CH 2 Cl 2 ). To a solution of 201 mg (0.83 mmol) of 1-(6-2-hydroxyethyl-methylamino-2-naphthyl)-1-ethanone in pyridine (6 mL), malononitrile (236 mg, 3.6 mmol) was added and the mixture was heated at 95 C. for 24 hours. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the residue was chromatographed by radial chromatography (4 mm SiO 2 1% MeOH/CH 2 Cl 2 ) to give 150 mg (73%) of 2-(1,1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-2-hydroxyethyl)-methyl-amino)-naphthalene. To the solution of 2-(1,1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-(2-hydroxyethyl)-methylamino)-naphthalene (120 mg, 0.41 mmol) in pyridine (5 mL), p-toluensulfonic anhydride was added (441 mg, 1.35 mmol). After stirring at room temperature for 1 hour, pyridine was removed under vacuum, and the residue was chromatographed by radial chromatography (2 mm SiO 2 , CH 2 Cl 2 ) to give 183 mg (80%) of 2-(1,1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-(2-tosyloxyethyl)-methylamino-naphthalene. Radioactive 18 F-fluoride 528.5 mCi from the cyclotron was transferred into a solution of 19 mg of Kryptofix 2.2.2 and 0.75 mg potassium carbonate in 50 L of water and 300 L of acetonitrile. Water was removed in a stream of nitrogen at 115 C. followed by codistillation with acetonitrile (3200 L). The tosylate (2-(1,1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-(2-tosyloxyethyl)-methylamino)-naphthalene, 4 mg) in 1 mL of acetonitrile was added, and the mixture was heated at 85-86 C. for 20 minutes. After cooling, 1 mL of water was added, and the mixture was transferred onto a C-18 Sep-Pak Cartridge, washed with distilled water (34 mL) and eluted with CH 2 Cl 2 (22.5 mL). Eluate was dried by passing through a column packed with sodium sulfate and loaded onto a HPLC column (Whatman Partisil Silica 10, 50010 mm, mL/min CH 2 Cl 2 :hexane7:3, UV detector 254 nm, radioactivity detector). Eluate was collected, appropriate fractions were combined, evaporated under vacuo to yield 50.7 mCi (17%, corrected for decay) of the titled product which was formulated for injection. The synthesis was complete in 50 minutes. Example 2 Detection and labeling of -amyloid plaques in vitro and in vivo, using brain tissue sections and rat brains, were conducted using the following procedures. A 2.1 mg/mL DDNP stock solution was prepared, which was adjusted to 8 mM in 100% ethanol. A DDNP working solution was prepared by diluting the stock solution with distilled water in a ratio of 1:100-1000 (stock solution:distilled water). -amyloid 250 M (1.25 mg/mL in distilled water) was aggregated at 37 C. for 48 hours. 5 L were smeared on slides, air-dried and then rehydrated with distilled water. Alternatively, A-positive brain tissue sections were rehydrated with distilled water. DDNP working solution was applied to each slide for 30 minutes at room temperature. The slides were washed three times for five minutes with distilled water. The slides were coverslipped with fluorescent protectant mounding media (Vectashield, available Vector Labs., Burlingame, Calif.) and observed under a fluorescence microscope with a thioflavin S or FITC filter. -amyloid 250 M (1.25 mg/mL in distilled water) was aggregated at 37 C. for 48 hours to produce fibrils confirmed by smears. Three rats were anesthetized. 3 L of a solution of A fibrils (1.25 g/L) were injected unilaterally into the cortex of each rat (Bregma 0, AP-4.1 mm, ML2.0 mm, DV-3.1 mm). Then 3 L of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were injected into the contralateral side of each rat brain as a vehicle control. After injection, the needle remained for 5 minutes to prevent reflux, and then the cranial hole was sealed with bone wax. Eight days after -amyloid injection into the rat brains, the rats were injected with 10 microliters of DDNP working solution (320 micromolar) prepared by diluting DDNP stock solution into 1.5% BSA (bovine serum albumin) in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2). After one hour, the rats were cardiac perfused with PLP fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, 1% lysin in 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Additional immersion fixation of rat brain was at 4 C. overnight with PLP fixative. The rat brains were washed with PBS, saturated in 10 and 20% sucrose, and snap frozen in chilled isopentane (70 C.) with liquid nitrogen. The brains were cryostat sectioned at 10 M around the needle-track and directly coverslipped with glycerol and fluorescence protectant (Vectashield). The brain sections were observed with a fluorescence microscope. FIGS. 1A to 1 F depict amyloid plaques labeled in sections from brain of an AD patient and a transgenic mouse, demonstrating that DDNP is able to label amyloid plaques. FIGS. 2A to 2 E depict labeled -amyloid plaques, demonstrating that DDNP passes the blood brain barrier in rats. It was found that DDNP readily labeled amyloid deposits in cryostat and paraffin sections of AD brain tissue with a level of sensitivity similar to thioflavin S. Use of DDNP has several advantages over thioflavin S. Namely, the use of DDNP requires no pretreatments and, unlike thioflavin S, works with minimal washing and without formalin or parafornaldehyde fixation or differentiation of tissue. Stock solution can be kept in the freezer for six months and still produce acceptable results at 1/100 to 1/1,000 dilutions, eliminating the need to make the stock up fresh, as is required for thioflavin S labeling. Example 3 Labeling of human -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in vivo were conducted using the following procedures. A patient was placed in a tomograph to obtain brain dynamic PET images. 8.0 mCi of 2-(1.1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-(2- 18 F-fluoroethyl)-methylamino)-naphthalene (F18FDDNP (specific activity: 5-12 Ci/micromol; mass:1 nanomol), prepared as described in Example 1(f), were injected intravenously into the arm of the patient. Dynamic acquisition data of brain images were recorded simultaneously in forty-seven brain planes for two hours. It was found that F-18FDDNP readily crosses the brain blood barrier and labels brain structures in a manner consistent with the presence of beta amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The patient had previously had 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)/positron emission tomography (PET) scans, as well as MRI scans to monitor brain atrophy. In areas where the maximum atrophy was observed in the MRI scans (low temporal and parietal lobes), maximum accumulation of the F-18FDDNP label was observed. In those areas, low glucose metabolism (as measured with FDG/PET scans) was also observed. Example 4 Labeling and detection of human -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in vivo were conducted using the following procedures. Ten human subjects, seven Alzheimers diseased patients (ages 71 to 80) and three control patients (ages 62 to 82) were studied. The patients were positioned supine in an EXACT HR962 tomograph (Siemens-CTI, Knoxville, Tenn.) with the imaging plane parallel to the orbito-meatal line. Venous catheterization was performed, and then F-18FDDNP (5-10 mCi) in human serum albumin (25%) was administered as a bolus via the venous catheter. Sequential emission scans were obtained beginning immediately after F-18FDDNP administration using the following scan sequence: six 30 second scans, four 3 minute scans, five 10 minute scans, and three 20 minute scans. Rapid venous blood sampling was performed via the indwelling catheter in two subjects for input function determination and plasma metabolite analysis. FIG. 3A provides a PET-F-18FDDNP (2-(1.1-dicyanopropen-2-yl)-6-(2- 18 F-fluoroethyl)-methylamino)-naphthalene) image of a brain cross-section through the hippocampus-amygdala-entorhinal/temporal cortex region of an Alzheimers disease patient. The image was reconstructed from scanning data obtained 30 to 60 minutes post F-18FDDNP injection. Co-registered PET-FDG (FDG is 2-F-18fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose) and MRI (proton relaxation times) images of the patient are also shown, in FIGS. 3B and 3C , respectively, to provide information about glucose metabolism and anatomical structures on the cross-section, respectively. The medial temporal region appears darker in the F-18FDDNP scan (slower clearance) and lighter in the FDG scan (reduced glucose metabolism). FIG. 4 demonstrates that estimated residence times of F-18FDDNP in Alzheimers diseased patients are seen to be different from values in control patients. The residence time shown is in reference to that in the pons, an area known to have limited involvement in Alzheimers disease pathology. The residence time was calculated from the clearance rates of the tracer in affected regions of interest (ROI) and in the pons as: Residence time1/clearance rate for affected ROI1/clearance rate for pons Separate ROIs were defined in entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, lateral temporal cortex and pons. The region with the slowest clearance rate was used as the affected ROI in the calculation of the residence time shown in FIG. 4 . It was found that after intravenous injection, F-18FDDNP crosses the blood brain barrier readily in proportion to blood flow. Accumulation of radioactivity was followed by the differential regional clearance of F-18FDDNP. A slower clearance was observed in brain areas reliably known to accumulate -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, specifically the hippocampus-amygdala-entorhinal complex, as well as temporal and parietal cortex in more advanced states of the disease. rCMRGl measured with PET in these subjects were also consistent with the expected -amyloid plaque load and the possible presence of neurofibrillary tangles. In these patients, brain areas with low glucose metabolism were in general matched with high retention of F-18FDDNP. The hippocampus-amygdala-entorhinal cortex presented high retention of activity (F-18FDDNP) in most cases, even in patients with low severity of symptoms. A normal 82 year old volunteer presented deposition of activity in the hippocampus-amygdala-entorhinal complex in a PET study with F-18FDDNP, and low rCMRGl in the same areas, as measured with FDG, as shown in FIG. 4 . These results are consistent with observations that elderly individuals without apparent signs of dementia may present neurofibrillary pathology in the second layer of neurons of the entorhinai cortex and plaques in the hippocampal formation. Increased severity of symptoms was always accompanied with increased retention of activity, and slow clearance from temporal, parietal or frontal cortex, in agreement with expected A and neurofibrillary tangles deposition in these areas. In vitro autoradiography using F-18FDDNP with brain specimens of Alzheimer diseased patients also demonstrated a distribution of activity consistent with the presence of -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Binding was observed in hippocampus, temporal and parietal cortex matching results with immunostaining A and tau antibodies. Since DDNP and its derivatives are fluorescent, an evaluation of the ability of F-18FDDNP to label -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in vitro was also performed with the same brain specimens. In all Alzheimers disease brain specimens, excellent visualization of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid peptides, and diffuse amyloid was produced with both DDNP and F-18FDDNP, matching results with thioflavin S (24) obtained with the same samples. In FIG. 5 , the central image was obtained by immunostaining a forty five micrometer cryostate temporal cortex section of an Alzheimers disease patient incubated with AT8 (anti-phosphotau) and 10G4 (anti-AB1-15) at 1:800. Insets are adjacent sections of the same Alzheimers disease brain specimen stained with FDDNP. Images were generated using fluorescent scanning microscopy. Green arrows indicate approximate origin of inset with reference to central immunostaining section. Beginning in upper left corner and moving clockwise, the insets show (1) neuritic plaques, (2) diffuse plaque, (3) vascular amyloid, (4) dense plaques and tangles, and (5) dense tangles.

These compounds, for example those described in the international patent applications published under the numbers WO 92/20647, WO 92/21318, WO 94/26694, WO 94/27561 and WO 98/09611, are, in particular on account of their antimicrobial and antielastic activity, used as active agents in formulations for topical use. Such cosmetic, dermopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical formulations intended to care for the skin or mucous membranes must be easy to take up with the fingers before they are applied; when they are applied on the skin or on mucous membranes, they must spread easily, penetrate quickly and melt in well while at the same time affording sensations of freshness and softness, without being perceived as greasy or oily, and, after they have been applied to the skin or mucous membranes, they must not give rise to any sheen on the skin, or any unpleasant odour, or appear sticky; however, the sensations of softness and freshness resulting from their application must remain. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Now, in order to obtain a sensory profile which satisfies a formulation, it is often necessary to include texturing agents therein, which are compounds or mixtures of compounds capable of improving the rheological and sensory properties of the formulation. The applicant has found, unexpectedly, that N-acylamino acid derivatives can be used effectively as texturing agents for cosmetic, dermopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical formulations. Accordingly, a subject of the invention is the use of at least one compound of formula (I): in which R represents the characterizing chain of a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched fatty acid, the fragment RCO comprises from 12 to 22 carbon atoms and more particularly from 16 to 22 carbon atoms, represents the characterizing chain or cyclic radical of an amino acid, R 2 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical comprising from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or the topically acceptable salts thereof, as texturing agents, it being understood that the amino acid characterized by R 1 is not lysine, hydroxylysine or arginine. The expression topically acceptable salt means any salt of the acid of formula (I) which is biologically acceptable for the skin and/or mucous membranes, i,e, any salt which can in particular adjust the pH of the composition to a value of between 3 and 8 and preferably approximately equal to 5, which is a pH in the region of the skins pH. Examples of such salts are, in particular, alkali metal salts, such as sodium, potassium or lithium salts, alkaline-earth metal salts, such as calcium, magnesium or strontium salts; they can also be metal salts such as divalent zinc, copper or manganese salts or alternatively trivalent iron, lanthanum, cerium or aluminium salts. The compound of formula (I) present in the composition which is the subject of the present invention can be in free acid form or in partially or totally salified form. The expression characterizing chain used in the context of the present patent application denotes the main chain of the fatty acid or of the amino acid under consideration. Thus, for a fatty acid corresponding to the general formula RCOOH, the characterizing chain will be the chain represented by R. The linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated radical R represents a radical comprising from 11 to 21 carbon atoms, chosen, for example, from undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, heptadecyl, octadecyl, nonadecyl, eicosyl, uneicosyl, docosyl, heptadecenyl, eicosenyl, uneicosenyl and heptadecadienyl radicals. A subject of the invention is, more particularly, the use as defined above, for which, in formula (I), the fragment RCO represents in particular one of the following radicals: dodecanoyl (lauroyl), tetradecanoyl (myristyl), hexadecanoyl (palmitoyl), octadecanoyl (stearyl), eicosanoyl (arachidoyl), docosanoyl (behenoyl), octadecenoyl (oleyl), eicosenoyl (gadoloyl), docosenoyl (erucyl) or octadecadienoyl (linolenoyl). For an amino acid represented by the general formula: HN (R 2 )CHR 1 COOH, it will be characterized by the definition of R 1 ; for an amino acid represented by the general formula: it will be characterized by the definition of the cyclic radical: In the context of the present invention, the chain or the cyclic radical characterizing the amino acid are chosen from those of glycine, alanine, serine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, valine, threonine, proline, leucine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, histidine, tyrosine, tryptophan, asparagine, cysteine, cystine, methionine, hydroxyproline, ornithine and sarcosine. A subject of the invention is, more particularly, the use as described above for which, in formula (I), the chain or the cyclic radical characterizing the amino acid are chosen from those of glycine, proline, glutamic acid and sarcosine. The expression at least one compound of formula (I) means that the invention can be carried out with one or more of these compounds. The expression or more of these compounds means: either a mixture of compounds of formula (I), resulting from the condensation of a single amino acid with a mixture of fatty acids, and more particularly a mixture of fatty acids of natural origin, or a mixture of compounds of formula (I) resulting from the condensation of a mixture of amino acids with a single fatty acid, or a mixture of compounds of formula (I) resulting from the condensation of a mixture of amino acids with a mixture of fatty acids, and more particularly with a mixture of fatty acids of natural origin. The mixtures of fatty acids of natural origin which can be used advantageously for the preparation of the compounds of formula (I) are, in particular, those derived from coconut oil, palm kernel oil, palm oil, soybean oil, rapeseed oil, bovine tallow, spermaceti oil, herring oil or castor oil. According to a very specific aspect of the present invention, its subject is the use, as described above, of a mixture comprising at least one compound of formula (Ia) corresponding to formula (I), in which the cyclic radical characterizing the amino acid is that of proline, and at least one compound of formula (Ib) corresponding to formula (I) in which the characterizing chain of the amino acid is that of glutamic acid, and optionally at least one compound of formula (Ic) corresponding to formula (I) in which R 2 represents a methyl radical and R 1 represents the characterizing chain of sarcosine; as an example of such a use, mention may be made of the use of the mixture comprising N-palmitoylproline and N-palmitoylglutamic acid or the sodium or magnesium salts thereof or the use of the mixture comprising N-palmitoylproline, N-palmitoylglutamic acid and N-palmitoylsarcosine or the sodium or magnesium salts thereof. According to another very specific aspect of the present invention, its subject is the use, as described above, of a composition comprising N-cocoylglycine or one of the topically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of formula (I) are obtained by the methods known to those skilled in the art and described in particular in the international patent applications published under the numbers WO 92/20647, WO 92/21318, WO 94/26694, WO 94/27561 and WO 98/09611. A subject of the invention is also a composition (A) comprising; a) from 10% to 95% by weight, and more particularly from 60% to 80% by weight, of at least one compound of formula (I): in which R represents the characterizing chain of a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched fatty acid comprising from 12 to 22 carbon atoms, represents the chain or the cyclic radical characterizing the amino acid, chosen from those of glycine, alanine, serine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, valine, threonine, proline, leucine, phenylalanine, isolgucine, histidine, tyrosine, tryptophan, asparagine, cysteine, cystine, methionine, hydroxyproline, ornithine and sarcosine, R 2 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical comprising from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or one of the topically acceptable salts thereof, and R 2 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical comprising from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or one of the topically acceptable salts thereof, and b) from 90% to 5% by weight of at least one compound of formula (II) RCOOH, or one of the topically acceptable salts thereof. A subject of the invention is, more particularly, a composition (A) as defined above, for which the radical R comprises from 16 to 22 carbon atoms, and more particularly from 16 to 18 carbon atoms. According to one very specific aspect of the present invention, its subject is the composition (A) as defined above, comprising: from 30% to 50% by weight of palmitoylproline, from 5% to 25% by weight of N-palmitoylglutamic acid, from 0% to 25% by weight of N-palmitoylsarcosine and from about 5% to about 40% by weight of palmitic acid. According to another very specific aspect of the present invention, its subject is the composition (A) as defined above, comprising: from 30% to 70% by weight of cocoylglycine, from 0% to 25% by weight of N-cocoylsarcosine and from about 5% to about 45% by weight, and more particularly from 5% to about 20% by weight, of the mixture of fatty acids derived from coconut oil. A subject of the present invention is also a cosmetic, dermopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical formulation comprising, as texturing agent, an effective amount of at least one compound of formula I as defined above. In the context of the present invention, the expression effective amount means an amount representing from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight of the formulation. The cosmetic formulation is usually in the form of an aqueous solution, a dilute alcoholic solution or a simple or multiple emulsion, such as a water-in-oil (W/O), oil-in-water (O/W) or water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsion, or a dispersion of liposomes or of aminosomes. The term aminosome denotes a type of liposome formed by amphiphilic amino acid derivatives. Examples which may be mentioned are creams, milks, lotions, antisun emulsions, cosmetic wipes, gels such as shower gels or cream-gels, oils, soaps, liquid soaps, syndets, intimate-hygiene products, shampoos, make-up powders and mascaras, A subject of the invention is also the use of a composition (A) as defined above, to prepare a cosmetic, dermopharnaceutical or pharmaceutical formulation. This formulation is prepared according to the methods known to those skilled in the art which are suitable for the desired type of formulation, by combining composition (A) with the usual cosmetic active agents and excipients. The compounds of formula (I) are compatible with most known excipients, whether this is, for example, with reverse latices such as the compounds sold under the names Sepigel 305, Sepigel 501, Sepigel 502, Simulgel 600, Simulgel A or Simulgel EG, or with the compositions sold under the names Montanov 68, Montanov 14, Montanov 82, Montanov 202 or Sepiperl N and described, for example, in the patent applications published under the numbers WO 92/02778, WO 95/13863, WO 96/37285, WO 98/22207 or WO 98/47610. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The examples which follow illustrate the invention without, however, limiting it. EXAMPLE 1 Sensory Profile of a Composition According to the Invention a) A composition comprising about 45% of palmitoylproline, from 10% to 15% of N-palmitoylglutamic acid, from 10% to 15% of N-palmitoylsarcosine and about 30% of palmitic acid is prepared. b) A cream-gel (I) is prepared containing, as texturing agent, 3% of the composition prepared in paragraph a) and, as thickener, 3.5% of Sepigel 305, and a cream-gel (II) containing, as thickener, 3.5% of Sepigel 305 and containing no texturing agent. c) The sensory test was carried out on a panel of 15 individuals; these individuals assessed and compared the qualities of the two cream-gels in the following three situations: 1) Assessment of the uptake of the cream-gel with the fingers in order subsequently to spread it on the skin The panel assessed the ease of uptake. 2) Assessment of the application of the cream-gel onto the skin The panel assessed the ease of spreading, the melting nature, the sensation of freshness, the softness of the product, the absence of a greasy sensation of the product and the speed of penetration. 3) Assessment after application The panel assessed the odour on the skin, the sheen of the skin, the sticky aspect on the skin, the softness of the skin and the presence of residue. The results are given in the table below in the following manner; positive assessments or negative assessments when at least two thirds of the members are of the same opinion: undifferentiated assessment (indicated by idem) when less than two thirds of the members are of the same opinion: Cream-gel (I) Cream-gel (II) Invention Comparison Ease of uptake Easier Less easy Ease of spreading Easier Less easy Melting nature Melts more Melts less easily easily Sensation of Idem Idem freshness Softness Softer Less soft Greasy sensation Less greasy More greasy Penetration Faster Slower Odour on the skin Idem Idem Sheen of the skin Less shiny More shiny Stickiness on the Idem Idem skin Softness of the skin Softer Less soft Persistence More persistent Less persistent These results show that the presence of compounds of formula (I) in a cosmetic formulation markedly improve the sensory profile of the said formulation by improving its tactile properties.

Rees, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1995, or as described in the Patent Specifications EP-A-0 361 114, U.S. Pat. No. 5,032,165, WO 92/02509, WO 92/06962, WO 95/33728 and WO 96/01254. The end products of formula I can be isolated in conventional manner by concentration or evaporation of the solvent and purified by recrystallisation or trituration of the solid residue in solvents in which they are not readily soluble, such as ethers, aromatic hydrocarbons or chlorinated hydrocarbons, by distillation or by means of column chromatography and a suitable eluant. The sequence in which it is advantageous for certain reactions to be carried out so as to avoid possible secondary reactions will also be familiar to the person skilled in the art. Unless the synthesis is specifically aimed at the isolation of pure isomers, the product may be obtained in the form of a mixture of two or more isomers. The isomers can be separated according to methods known per se. For the use according to the invention of the compounds of formula I or of compositions comprising them, there come into consideration all methods of application customary in agriculture, for example pre-emergence application, post-emergence application and seed dressing, and also various methods and techniques such as, for example, the controlled release of active ingredient. For that purpose a solution of the active ingredient is applied to mineral granule carriers or polymerised granules (urea/formaidehyde) and dried. If required, it is also possible to apply a coating (coated granules), which allows the active ingredient to be released in metered amounts over a specific period of time. The compounds of formula I may be used in unmodified form, that is to say as obtained in the synthesising process, but they are preferably formulated in customary manner together with the adjuvants conventionally employed in formulation technology, for example into emulsifiable concentrates, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granules or microcapsules. Such formulations are described, for example, in WO 97/34485, pages 9 to 13. As with the nature of the compositions, the methods of application, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, wetting, scattering or pouring, are chosen in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances. The formulations, that is to say the compositions, preparations or mixtures comprising the compound (active ingredient) of formula I or at least one compound of formula I and, usually, one or more solid or liquid formulation adjuvants, are prepared in known manner, e.g. by homogeneously mixing and/or grinding the active ingredients with the formulation adjuvants, for example solvents or solid carriers. Surface-active compounds (surfactants) may also be used in addition in the preparation of the formulations. Examples of solvents and solid carriers are given, for example, in WO 97/34485, page 6. Depending on the nature of the compound of formula I to be formulated, suitable surface-active compounds are non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants and surfactant mixtures having good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. Examples of suitable anionic, non-ionic and cationic surfactants are listed, for example, in WO 97/34485, pages 7 and 8. In addition, the surfactants conventionally employed in formulation technology, which are described in, inter alia, uMcCutcheons Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood New Jersey, 1981, Stache, H., Tensid-Taschenbuch, Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich/Vienna 1981, and M. and J. Ash, Encyclopedia of Surfactants, Vol. I-III, Chemical Publishing Co., New York, 1980-81, are also suitable for the preparation of the herbicidal compositions according to the invention. The herbicidal formulations generally contain from 0.1 to 99% by weight, especially from 0.1 to 95% by weight, of herbicide, from 1 to 99.9% by weight, especially from 5 to 99.8% by weight, of a solid or liquid formulation adjuvant, and from 0 to 25% by weight, especially from 0.1 to 25% by weight, of a surfactant. Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ dilute formulations. The compositions may also comprise further ingredients, such as stabilisers, for example vegetable oils or epoxidised vegetable oils (epoxidised coconut oil, rape oil or soybean oil), anti-foams, for example silicone oil, preservatives, viscosity regulators, binders, tackifiers, and also fertilisers or other active ingredients. The compounds of formula I can be used successfully either in the form of a mixture comprising the isomers IW1a and IW1b or in the form of pure isomer IW1a or IW1b, generally on plants or the locus thereof, at rates of application of from 0.001 to 4 kg/ha, especially from 0.005 to 2 kg/ha. The concentration required to achieve the desired effect can be determined by experiment. It is dependent on the nature of the action, the stage of development of the cultivated plant and of the weed and on the application (place, time, method) and may vary within wide limits as a function of those parameters. The compounds of formula I and, generally, the isomers of formula 1 a especially, are distinguished by herbicidal and growth-inhibiting properties, allowing them to be used in crops of useful plants, especially cereals, cotton, soybeans, sugar beet, sugar cane, plantation crops, rape, maize and rice, and also for non-selective weed control. Crops is to be understood as meaning also crops that have been made tolerant to herbicides or classes of herbicides as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic techniques. The weeds to be controlled may be either monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous weeds, such as, for example, Stellaria, Nasturtium, Agrostis, Digitaria, Avena, Setaria, Sinapis, Lolium, Solanum, Phaseolus, Echinochloa, Scirpus, Monochoria, Sagittaria, Bromus, Alopecurus, Sorghum halepense, Rottboellia, Cyperus, Abutilon, Sida, Xanthium, Amaranthus, Chenopodium, Ipomoea, Chrysanthemum, Galium, Viola and Veronica. The following Examples further illustrate but do not limit the invention.

After 3 hours, the mixture is washed twice with dichloromethane and then rendered acidic with excess concentrated hydrochloric acid while cooling with an ice-bath. The resulting slurry is filtered, washed with water and dried in vacuo. 318 g of the desired product are obtained in the form of a white solid having a melting point of 135 C. (decomposition).

Stirring is then carried out for 5 hours at 100 C., after which the thionyl chloride is distilled off at normal pressure. After the addition of 50 ml of dry toluene, 20 ml thereof are distilled off. The resulting solution is poured into 200 ml of n-hexane and stirred overnight.

By cooling occasionally with an ice-bath, the internal temperature is maintained below 30 C. The exothermic reaction has subsided after 1 hours. The reaction mixture is then stirred overnight at 22 C. and subsequently cold water is added slowly, while stirring well. Extraction is carried out with diethyl ether, and the combined ethereal phases are washed with dilute sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. 58 g of a tacky solid are isolated.

After the addition of 13.0 g of potassium carbonate, the mixture is stirred and heated to 55 C. 2.36 ml of methyl iodide in 5.0 ml of N-methylpyrrolidone are then slowly added dropwise. After subsequently stirring for 2 hours, diethyl ether and water are added, the mixture is extracted by shaking and the organic phase is separated off. The separated ethereal phase is washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The crude product is purified by means of flash chromatography (silica gel; eluant: toluene/ethyl acetate 100/1).

The reaction can be monitored analytically by means of thin-layer chromatography (silica gel 60 F 254 , eluant: n-hexanelethyl acetate 4/1, UV). Once starting material can no longer be detected, glacial acetic acid is removed in vacuo and the residue is partitioned between dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and ethyl acetate. After extraction by shaking, the separated organic phase is washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The yellow oil is purified by means of flash chromatography (silica gel; eluant: n-hexane/ethyl acetate 5/1). 1.6 g of of the desired compound are obtained in the form of a yellow oil (70% of the theoretical yield). 1 H-NMR (DMSO-D 6 ): 8.80 ppm (d, 1H); 8.48 ppm (d, 1H); 4.11 ppm (s, 3H).

The organic phase is washed with water and brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to dryness in vacuo. 110 g of a brown oil are obtained, which is used directly for the next reaction step. For that reaction step, the brown oil obtained above is introduced at 25 C. into a solution of 20.5 ml of methyl hydrazine in 300 ml of glacial acetic acid and then stirred for 2 hours at 85 C. After the resulting brown suspension has been cooled to 25 C. it is introduced in portions into 2.5 liters of ice-water, stirred for 1 hour, filtered and washed with water and n-hexane.

The reaction mixture is partitioned between water and diethyl ether (foaming occurs on the addition of water). After extraction by shaking, and separation of the phases, the ethereal phase is washed twice with water and once with brine.

At 22 C. a pressure of 100 bar is applied with carbon monoxide and the reaction mixture is maintained at 100 C. for 48 hours. In the meantime a further 0.48 g of bis-triphenylphosphinepalladium dichloride is added, and the mixture is then cooled to 22 C. and the pressure is released. The reaction mixture is filtered over Hyflo and, after evaporating off the ethanol, taken up in ethyl acetate.

With stirring, 6.3 g of chlorine gas are passed over the solution at that temperature in the course of 1 hour. The reaction mixture is then poured into 2.5 liters of ice-water and subsequently stirred for 20 minutes. The resulting precipitate is filtered off, washed with ice-water and then dried in vacuo at 50 C. 24.4 g of the desired title compound are obtained in the form of a yellow solid having a melting point of 77-79 C. Example P21 5-(5-Chloro-3-fluoro-2-pyridyl)-4-chloro-2-methyl-2H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic Acid 11.0 g of 5-(5-chloro-3-fluoro-2-pyridyl)-4-chloro-2-methyl-2H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (Example P20) are introduced into 60 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide at 22 C. With stirring, 25.9 ml of a 2N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution are added dropwise, in the course of which an exothermic reaction can be detected. After subsequently stirring for one hour, TLC analysis of a sample shows that all the starting material has reacted. The reaction mixture is introduced into 2 liters of ice-cold dilute hydrochloric acid, then stirred for 15 minutes and filtered over a paper filter. The filtration residue is washed with cold water and, after drying overnight at 60 C. in vacuo, 8.7 g of the desired title compound having a melting point of 230 C. (decomposition) are obtained. The R f value of the starting material on silica gel 60 F 254 (eluant: n-hexane/ethyl acetate 1/1 (v/v)) is 0.75; and the R f value of the desired title compound is 0.36. Example P22 3-(3-Fluoro-5-chloro-2-pyridyl)-4-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole 8.63 g of 5-(5-chloro-3-fluoro-2-pyridyl)-4-chloro-2-methyl-2H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (Example P21) are introduced into a fluorination unit with 27 g of hydrogen fluoride (HF), 16.2 g of sulfur tetrafluoride (SF 4 ) and 270 ml of methylene chloride. The mixture is maintained at 80 C. for 5 hours. It is then cooled to 22 C. and the SF 4 is removed by way of a gas destroying unit (argon stream) and the HF is removed using a water-jet vacuum. After the addition of methylene chloride, the reaction mixture is extracted three times with ice-water, and the organic phase is dried over sodium sulfate and then concentrated to dryness in vacuo together with 40 g of silica gel. After applying the silica gel to a flash chromatography column, elution is carried out with an n-hexane/ethyl acetate 5/1 (v/v) mixture. 5.48 g of the desired title compound are obtained in the form of a beige solid having a melting point of 76-78 C. Example P23 3-(5,6-Dichloro-2-pyridyl)- and 3-(4,5-dichloro-2-pyridyl)-4-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole (isomers A and B) 20 ml of phosphorus oxychloride are heated to 90 C. With stirring, 10.37 g of 3-(5-chloro-2-pyridyl-N-oxide)-4-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole (Example P25) are introduced in several portions at that temperature and the mixture is then stirred for 1 hour at 90 C. The phosphorus oxychloride is then evaporated off in vacuo, the residue is taken up in diethyl ether and the ethereal phase is subsequently washed in succession with water, 0.5M sodium hydroxide solution and brine. After drying over sodium sulfate and filtering, concentration in vacuo is carried out and the residue obtained (8.93 g) is purified by column chromatography (silica gel; eluant: n-hexane/ethyl acetate 10/1). First 0.57 g of isomer B and then 5.11 g of isomer A are isolated in the form of a white solid. On silica gel 60 F 254 using the eluant n-hexane/ethyl acetate 4/1 (v/v), the R f value of isomer A is 0.31 and the R f value of isomer B is 0.41. The treatment of 6.3 g of 3-(5-chloro-2-pyridyl-N-oxide)-4-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole (Example P25) for 1 hour at 90 C. with 6.3 g of phosphorus pentachloride in 20 ml of phosphorus oxychloride yields, after working up as above, 4.36 g of isomer A and 1.01 g of isomer B. Example P24 3-(3-Fluoro-5,6-dichloro-2-pyridyl-N-oxide)-4-chloro-5-difluoromethoxy-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole 1.5 g of 3-(3-fluoro-5,6-dichloro-2-pyridyl)-4-chloro-5-difluoromethoxy-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole are dissolved in 10 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane and 0.5 g of hydrogen peroxide/urea adduct is added. With cooling in an ice-bath, 0.66 ml of trifluoroacetic anhydride is then metered in using a syringe and the mixture is stirred at 22 C. for 3 hours. According to TLC analysis there is only partial reaction of the starting material. Consequently, 0.5 g of hydrogen peroxide/urea adduct and 0.66 ml of trifluoroacetic anhydride are added to the reaction mixture one after the other, in the manner described above, four times, followed each time by stirring for 3 hours at 22 C., in the course of which a yellow suspension is formed which is taken up in ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed in succession with 1 N sodium hydroxide solution, water and brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product is purified by means of flash chromatography (silica gel; eluant: hexane/ethyl acetate 3/2). 0.25 g of the desired product is obtained in the form of yellow crystals having a melting point of 114-118 C. Example P25 3-(5-Chloro-2-pyridyl-N-oxide)-4-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole 6.82 g of 3-(5-chloro-2-pyridyl)-4-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole are introduced into 30 ml of methylene chloride at 25 C. With stirring, 7.23 g of m-chloroperbenzoic acid are added. After 48 hours a further 2.50 g of m-chloroperbenzoic acid are added. After a further 24 hours the reaction mixture is taken up in ethyl acetate and extracted twice with dilute sodium hydroxide solution, then washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated. Chromatography is then carried out (silica gel; eluant: n-hexane/ethyl acetate 1/1 (v/v)). 6.31 g of the desired compound are isolated in the form of a white solid.", "related_docs": [], "pct_data":

This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 08/293,790 filed Aug. 22, 1994 now U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,828. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy for treatment of malignancies are almost invariably faced with moderate or severe side effects due to their therapy. One of the common side effects faced by cancer patients is the induction of ulcerative mucositis of the mucosal membranes. This mucositis is especially prominent in the oral cavity. This side effect, although not as life threatening as other side effects such as anemia or immunosuppression, nonetheless often becomes the dose limiting factor in the continuation of therapy in many cancer patients. Ulcerative mucositis is marked by the formation of slowly healing open ulcers in the oral cavity causing a great deal of pain and discomfort to the patient. Eating, drinking, and swallowing become difficult and painful and additionally, the salivary glands are often effected compounding the discomfort. The presence of open ulcers in the mouth often lead to opportunistic infections of bacterial, viral, and fungal origin in these patients, who are often immunologically suppressed due to their therapy. These oral infections must be carefully monitored to avoid their spreading to life-threatening, systemic infections. As yet, there is no treatment for such mucositis except either cessation of the therapy or palliative and supportive interventions. Some of the palliative treatments in current use include the use of antibiotics to reduce the chance of infection, the use of anti-histamines and anti-inflammatory drugs, and the use of pain reducing medications. All of these treatments are either unacceptable, as with the case of cessation of cancer therapy or partially successful in relieving the suffering from the mucositis. For a more detailed description of radio- and chemotherapy induced mucositis, its treatment, management, and causes see Holland, J. F. et al.; Cancer Medicine, Third Ed., Lea Febiger, Philadelphia Pa., 1993; Vol.2, Section XL, pp. 2382-2385 and references therein. The current understanding of the mechanism which causes ulcerative mucositis in cancer patients undergoing radio- or chemotherapy is that both normal mucosal cells and malignant cancer cells share one common property, i.e., these are cells which are rapidly growing or cycling. Normally the mucosal lining turns over at a very rapid rate compared to most other tissue compartments in the body. This rapid mucosal turnover is also shared by several other normal tissues such as cellular blood elements, hair, skin, etc. It is not surprising to find that these tissues are also targets of various cancer therapies, because the governing strategy for the treatment of cancer has been aimed at targeting rapidly proliferated cancer cells by a variety of cellular mechanisms. Thus, cancer drugs which are most effective at interrupting the growth of cancer cells are often the most damaging agents to the normal, proliferating cells in the body, such as the mucosal lining. Other tissue compartments of the body whose cells are not as rapidly cycling, such as muscle and nerve cells, are not as prone to the rapid and deleterious effects of such cancer therapies. Recently there has been a report in the literature, suggesting that Transforming Growth Factor-B 3 (TGF-B 3) may be useful in treating patients suffering from ulcerative mucositis induced by cancer therapy. The authors hypothesis is that TGF-3 slows the rate of turnover of epithelial cells (epithelial cells are the predominant cell type in the mucosal lining) and thus these cells might be spared the effects of the cancer therapy. The authors give experimental data both in cell culture and in animal models which support their hypothesis. (Sonis, et al., Prevention Of Chemotherapy-Induced Ulcerative Mucositis by Transforming Growth Factor-3., Abst., NIH Symposia on TGF-s, Bethesda Md., May 3, 1994). TGF- is a peptide growth factor which refers to a generic family of peptides, often called isoforms meaning that members of the family either share amino acid homology and/or have similar physiological actions. Of particular interest to the subject of wound healing are: TGF-s 1, 2, and 3. For further discussion of the TGF- family of peptides, the subject is reviewed in: Roberts et al., The transforming growth factor-s. In: Sporn and Roberts, eds. Peptide growth factors and their receptors I. Berlin: Springer Verlag, 1990: 419-472. It would seem reasonable that an agent which might slow the rapid rate of turnover of the mucosal lining may be useful in protecting that tissue from the effects of the commonly used cancer therapies. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention provides methods of inhibiting ulcerative mucositis comprising administering to a human in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula I wherein R 1 and R 3 are independently hydrogen, wherein Ar is optionally substituted phenyl; R 2 is selected from the group consisting of pyrrolidino, hexamethyleneimino, and piperidino; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The current invention concerns the discovery that a select group of 2-phenyl-3-aroylbenzothiophenes (benzothiophenes), those of formula I, are useful for inhibiting ulcerative mucositis, particularly induced by chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The therapeutic and prophylactic treatments provided by this invention are practiced by administering to a human in need thereof a dose of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, that is effective to inhibit ulcerative mucositis. The term inhibit includes its generally accepted meaning which includes prohibiting, preventing, restraining, and slowing, stopping or reversing progression, severity or a resultant symptom. As such, the present method includes both medical therapeutic and/or prophylactic administration, as appropriate. Raloxifene is a preferred compound of this invention and it is the hydrochloride salt of a compound of formula 1 wherein R 1 and R 3 are hydrogen and R 2 is 1-piperidinyl. Raloxifene is a nuclear regulating compound, and has been shown to bind to the estrogen receptor, and was originally thought to be a molecule whose function and pharmacology was that of an anti-estrogen in that it blocked the ability of estrogen to activate uterine tissue and estrogen dependent breast cancers. Indeed, raloxifene does block the action of estrogen in some cells; however, in other cell types, raloxifene activates the same genes as estrogen does and displays the same pharmacology, e.g., osteoporosis, hyperlipidemia, etc. As a result, raloxifene has been referred to as an anti-estrogen with mixed agonist-antagonist properties. The unique profile which raloxifene displays and differs from that of estrogen is now thought to be due to the unique activation and/or suppression of various gene functions by the raloxifene-estrogen receptor complex as opposed to the activation and/or suppression of genes by the estrogen-estrogen receptor complex. Therefore, although raloxifene and estrogen utilize and compete for the same receptor, the pharmacological outcome from gene regulation of the two is not easily predicted and is unique to each. It has been reported in the literature that part of the pharmacologic action displayed by Raloxifene is due to its ability to induce TGF-3. Raloxifene shares this ability with estrogen; however, it appears that raloxifene induces this factor to a greater extent than estrogen. The compound of formula I would be a useful agent in the inhibition of ulcerative mucositis. This invention is not limited to only the mucositis seen in the oral cavity but also includes other mucosal lining such as found in the intestinal, uro-genital, and nasal tracts. Generally, at least one compound of formula I is formulated with common excipients, diluents or carriers, and compressed into tablets, or formulated as elixirs or solutions for convenient oral administration, or administered by the intramuscular or intravenous routes. The compounds can be administered transdermally, and may be formulated as sustained release dosage forms and the like. The compounds used in the methods of the current invention can be made according to established procedures, such as those detailed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,133,814, 4,418,068, and 4,380,635 all of which are incorporated by reference herein. In general, the process starts with a benzo b thiophene having a 6-hydroxyl group and a 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) group. The starting compound is protected, acylated, and deprotected to form the formula I compounds. Examples of the preparation of such compounds are provided in the U.S. patents discussed above. The term optionally substituted phenyl includes phenyl and phenyl substituted once or twice with C 1 -C 6 alkyl, C 1 -C 4 alkoxy, hydroxy, nitro, chloro, fluoro, or tri(chloro or fluoro)methyl. The compounds used in the methods of this invention form pharmaceutically acceptable acid and base addition salts with a wide variety of organic and inorganic acids and bases and include the physiologically acceptable salts which are often used in pharmaceutical chemistry. Such salts are also part of this invention. Typical inorganic acids used to form such salts include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric, sulfuric, phosphoric, hypophosphoric and the like. Salts derived from organic acids, such as aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxyalkanoic and hydroxyalkandioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, may also be used. Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus include acetate, phenylacetate, trifluoroacetate, acrylate, ascorbate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, methylbenzoate, o-acetoxybenzoate, naphthalene-2-benzoate, bromide, isobutyrate, phenylbutyrate, B-hydroxybutyrate, butyne-1,4-dioate, hexyne-1,4-dioate, caprate, caprylate, chloride, cinnamate, citrate, formate, fumarate, glycollate, heptanoate, hippurate, lactate, malate, maleate, hydroxymaleate, malonate, mandelate, mesylate, nicotinate, isonicotinate, nitrate, oxalate, phthalate, teraphthalate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, propiolate, propionate, phenylpropionate, salicylate, sebacate, succinate, suberate, sulfate, bisulfate, pyrosulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, sulfonate, benzene-sulfonate, p-bromophenylsulfonate, chlorobenzenesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, methanesulfonate, naphthalene-1-sulfonate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, xylenesulfonate, tartarate, and the like. A preferred salt is the hydrochloride salt. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are typically formed by reacting a compound of formula I with an equimolar or excess amount of acid. The reactants are generally combined in a mutual solvent such as diethyl ether or benzene. The salt normally precipitates out of solution within about one hour to 10 days and can be isolated by filtration or the solvent can be stripped off by conventional means. Bases commonly used for formation of salts include ammonium hydroxide and alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates, as well as aliphatic and primary, secondary and tertiary amines, aliphatic diamines. Bases especially useful in the preparation of addition salts include ammonium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, methylamine, diethylamine, ethylene diamine and cyclohexylamine. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts generally have enhanced solubility characteristics compared to the compound from which they are derived, and thus are often more amenable to formulation as liquids or emulsions. Pharmaceutical formulations can be prepared by procedures known in the art. For example, the compounds can be formulated with common excipients, diluents, or carriers, and formed into tablets, capsules, sprays, mouth washes, lozenges, suspensions, powders, and the like. Examples of excipients, diluents, and carriers that are suitable for such formulations include the following: fillers and extenders such as starch, sugars, mannitol, and silicic derivatives; binding agents such as carboxymethyl cellulose and other cellulose derivatives, alginates, gelatin, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone; moisturizing agents such as glycerol; disintegrating agents such as calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate; agents for retarding dissolution such as paraffin; resorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; surface active agents such as cetyl alcohol, glycerol monostearate; adsorptive carriers such as kaolin and bentonite; and lubricants such as talc, calcium and magnesium stearate, and solid polyethyl glycols. The compounds can also be formulated as elixirs or solutions for convenient oral administration or as solutions appropriate for parenteral administration, for instance by intramuscular, subcutaneous or intravenous routes. Additionally, the compounds are well suited to formulation as sustained release dosage forms and the like. The formulations can be so constituted that they release the active ingredient only or preferably in a particular part of the intestinal tract, possibly over a period of time. The coatings, envelopes, and protective matrices may be made, for example, from polymeric substances or waxes. Lozenges, troches or pastilles are discoid-shaped solids containing the medicinal agent in a suitably flavored base. The base may be a hard sugar candy, glycerinated gelatin, or the combination of sugar with sufficient mucilage to give it form. Troches are placed in the mouth where they slowly dissolve, liberating the active ingredient. The drug involved can be an antiseptic, local anesthetic, antibiotic, anthihistaminic, antitussive, analgesic, or a decongestant. Troches maybe prepared extemporaneously by the pharmacist. The mass is formed by adding water slowly to a mixture of the powdered drug, powdered sugar, and a gum until a pliable mass is formed. Powdered acacia in 7% concentration gives sufficient adhesiveness to the mass. The mass is rolled out and the troche pieces cut out using a cutter, or else the mass is rolled into a cylinder and divided. Each piece is shaped and allowed to dry before dispensing. If the active ingredient is heat stable, it may be prepared in a hard candy base. Syrup is concentrated to the point where it becomes a pliable mass, the active ingredient is added, and the mixture is kneaded while warm to form a homogeneous mass. The mass is gradually worked into a pipe form having the diameter desired for the candy piece and the lozenges cut from the pipe and allowed to cool. This is an entirely mechanical operation with equipment designed for this purpose. If the active ingredient is heat labile, it may be made into a lozenge preparation by compression. The granulation is prepared in a manner similar to that used for any compressed tablet. The lozenge is made using heavy compression equipment to give a tablet which is harder than usual as it is desirable for the troche to dissolve or disintegrate slowly in the mouth. In the formulation of the lozenge the ingredients are chosen which will promote its slow-dissolving characteristics. Compression is gaining in popularity as a means of making troches and candy pieces because of the increased speeds of compression equipment. In cases where holes are to be placed in troches or candy pieces, core-rod tooling is used. Core-rod tooling includes a rod centered on the lower punch around which the troche is compressed in the die cavity. The upper punch has an opening in its center for the core rod to enter during compression. It is evident that maximum accuracy is needed to provide alignment as the narrow punches are inserted into the die. The particular dosage of a compound of formula I required to inhibit ulcerative mucositis or its symptoms, according to this invention, will depend upon the severity of the condition, the route of administration, and related factors that will be decided by the attending physician. Generally, accepted and effective oral daily doses will be from about 0.1 to about 1000 mg/day, and more typically from about 50 to about 200 mg/day. Such dosages will be administered to a subject in need thereof from once to about three times each day, or more often as needed, and for a sufficient duration, to effectively inhibit ulcerative mucositis. It is usually preferred to administer a compound of formula I in the form of an acid addition salt, as is customary in the administration of pharmaceuticals bearing a basic group, such as the piperidino ring. For such purposes the following oral dosage forms are available. Formulations In the formulations which follow, Active ingredient means a compound of formula I.

The granules so produced are dried at 50-60 C. and passed through a No. 18 mesh U.S. sieve. The sodium carboxymethyl starch, magnesium stearate, and talc, previously passed through a No. 60 U.S. sieve, are then added to the granules which, after mixing, are compressed on a tablet machine to yield tablets. Suspensions each containing 0.1-1000 mg of Active ingredient per 5 mL dose are made as follows: Formulation 8: Suspensions Ingredient Quantity (mg/5 ml) Active ingredient 0.1-1000 mg Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose 50 mg Syrup 1.25 mg Benzoic acid solution 0.10 mL Flavor q.v. Color q.v. Purified water to 5 mL The Active ingredient is passed through a No. 45 mesh U.S. sieve and mixed with the sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and syrup to form a smooth paste. The benzoic acid solution, flavor, and color are diluted with some of the water and added, with stirring. Sufficient water is then added to produce the required volume. Formulation 9: Nasal Solution Ingredient Quantity (mg/5 ml) Active ingredient 0.1-1000 mg Chlorobutanol 0.5 g Sodium Chloride 0.5 g Water to 100 ml Formulation 10: Sublingual or Buccal Tablets Sublingula or buccal tablets, each containing 10 mg of active ingredient, may be prepared as follows: Ingredient Quantity Per Tablet Active ingredient 0.1-1000 mg Glycerol 210.5 mg Water 143.0 mg Sodium Citrate 4.5 mg Polyvinyl Alcohol 26.5 mg Polyvinylpyrrolidone 15.5 mg The glycerol, water, sodium citrate, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvinylpyrrolidone are admixed together by continuous stirring and maintaining the temperature at about 90 C. When the polymers have gone into solution, the solution is cooled to about 50-55 C. and the medicament is slowly admixed. The homogenous mixture is poured into forms made of an inert material to produce a drug-containing diffusion matrix having a thickness of about 2-4mm. This diffusion matrix is then cut to form individual tablets having the appropriate size. ASSAYS Assay 1 Five to fifty golden Syrian hamsters are begun on a daily oral dosage regimen of a compound of formula I one week before administering chemotherapy. The oral dosage regiman is continued during the 2 week chemotherapy and two weeks beyond. Positive results against mucositis include reduction of the course and/or severity of the mucositis, as measured by the epithelial BrdU labeling index, the PCNA-positive epithelial cell fraction weights, and/or survival rates. Assay 2 Five to fifty patients are selected for the clinical study. The patients are currently undergoing either chemo or radiotherapy which has induced ulcerative mucositis. Because of the idiosyncratic and subjective nature of these disorders, the study has a placebo control group, i.e., the patients are divided into two groups, one of which receives a compound of formula 1 as the active agent and the other receives a placebo. Patients in the test group receive between 50-200 mg of the drug per day by the oral route. They continue this therapy for the duration of the therapy and 2 months beyond. Accurate records are kept as to the number and severity of the symptoms in both groups and at the end of the study these results are compared. The results are compared both between members of each group and also the results for each patient are compared to the symptoms reported by each patient before the study began. Assay 3 Five to fifty patients are selected for the clinical study. The patients are set to undergo either chemo or radiotherapy which will induce ulcerative mucositis. Because of the idiosyncratic and subjective nature of these disorders, the study has a placebo control group, i.e., the patients are divided into two groups, one of which receives a compound of formula 1 as the active agent and the other receives a placebo. Patients in the test group receive between 50-200 mg of the drug per day by the oral route, being two weeks prior to chemo or radiotherapy. They continue this therapy for the duration of the therapy and 2 months beyond. Accurate records are kept as to the number and severity of the symptoms in both groups and at the end of the study these results are compared. The results are compared both between members of each group and also the results for each patient are compared to the symptoms reported by each patient before the study began.

TECHNICAL FILED The present invention relates to novel compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. More particularly, it relates to novel amidino derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which are useful as urokinase inhibitors, to processes for the preparation thereof, to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same, to a use of the same as a medicament and to a method of the therapeutic treatment of diseases in a human being or an animal. Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide novel amidino derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which are useful as urokinase inhibitors. Another object of the present invention is to provide processes for the preparation of novel amidino derivatives and salts thereof. A further object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an active ingredient, said amidino derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Urokinase (urokinase-type Plasminogen Activator, uPA) is a multi-domain serine protease which is able to convert the inactive precursor plasminogen to active plasmine. Among the family of plasminogen activators, tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) is present both in normal and in malignant tissue, whereas uPA has been shown to be produced abundantly by several common malignancies such as melanoma and colon, breast and prostate cancers. Cellular invasiveness initiated by urokinase causes many physiological processes such as angiogenesis, neovascularization, bone restructuring, embryo implantaion in the uterus (embryonic development), infiltration of immune cells into inflammatory sites, ovulation, trophoblast implantation, breast, uterine, and prostatic involution, spermatogenesis, tissue remodeling during wound repair (wound healing) and organ differentiation, fibrosis, local invasion of tumors into adjacent areas (tumor invasion), metastatic spread of tumor cells from primary to secondary sites (tumor metastasis), and tissue destruction in arthritis. Inhibitors of urokinase therefore have mechanism-based anti-angiogenic, anti-arthritic, anti-inflammatory, anti-invasive, anti-metastatic, anti-osteoporotic, anti-retinopathic (for angiogenesis-dependent retinopathies), contraceptive, and tumoristatic activities.

the formula wherein D is a donor mono- or disaccharide, A is an acceptor monosaccharide, and P-R is a lipophosphoglycerate mimetic group. Members of the library have a glycosidic linkage between the anomeric carbon of D and the C2 carbon of A, and the D-A moiety is in turn covalently linked through the anomeric carbon of A to the P-R group. Members of the library exhibit their greatest structural diversity in terms of substitutions occurring at the C3 position of the A residue, substitutions at the C2 position of the D residue, and different P-R groups used in assembling the compounds. Members of the library are preferably synthesized by solid phase techniques involving stepwise coupling of the respective units to a support, functionalizing the A and/or D saccharides either before or after immobilizing them on the support, and cleaving the assembled compounds from the support. Preferred functionalities attached to the sugar residues are amides, carbamates, ureas, sulfonamides, substituted amines, esters, carbonates, and sulfates. Exemplary P-R groups are derivatives of homoserine, glyceric acid, salicylates and mandelic acid. Members of the library can be screened for anti-microbial activity by contacting them with a culture of microbes and monitoring the growth rate of the microbes.", "related_docs": [], "pct_data": [],

having improved solubilizing groups", "abstract": "Compounds of formula A(B) x (I), wherein x is an integer from 1 to 8, A is the radical of a chromophore of the quinacridone, anthraquinone, perylene, indigo, quinophthalone, indanthrone, isoindolinone, isoindoline, dioxazine, azo, phthalocyanine or diketopyrrolopyrrole series that is bonded to x groups B via one or more hetero atoms, those hetero atoms being selected from the group consisting of N, O and S and forming part of the radical A, each group B independently of any other(s) is hydrogen or a group of the formula at least one group B being a group of the formula The compounds according to the invention are used in high-molecular-weight organic materials, thermo-, photo- or chemo-sensitive recording materials, light-sensitive negative or positive resist compositions, ink compositions for ink-jet printing and color tapes for thermal transfer printing. This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/013,659, filed on Jan. 26, 1998, now abandoned. The present Application relates to novel soluble chromophores having removable solubilising oxy-, thio- or amino-alkylene-oxycarbonyl groups. Those compounds have improved properties, especially a surprisingly higher solubility. In dissolved form those chromophores can be incorporated very readily into substrates in high concentrations and can then be converted back into the corresponding insoluble pigments with an especially high degree of conversion. Those groups can also be introduced into chromophores that cannot be reacted, or react only unsatisfactorily, with known groups. EP 648 770 and EP 648 817 disclose soluble, carbamate-group-containing chromophores that can be converted into the corresponding pigments by heating to relatively high temperatures, which results in the removal of the carbamate radicals. Among other numerous combinations, C 1 -C 4 alkylthio-C 1 -C 14 alkylenecarbamate radicals are also possible. Quinophthalone carbonates having limited solubility are known from U.S. Pat. No. 5 243 052 and can be used in heat-sensitive registration systems. It has now been found that soluble chromophores having markedly improved properties are obtained when oxy-, thio- or amino-alkylene-oxycarbonyl groups are used as solubilising groups. The present invention accordingly relates to compounds of formula A(B) x (I), wherein x is an integer from 1 to 8, A is the radical of a chromophore of the quinacridone, anthraquinone, perylene, indigo, quinophthalone, indanthrone, isoindolinone, isoindoline, dioxazine, azo, phthalocyanine or diketopyrrolopyrrole series that is bonded to x groups B via one or more hetero atoms, those hetero atoms being selected from the group consisting of N, O and S and forming part of the radical A, each group B independently of any other(s) is hydrogen or a group of the formula at least one group B being a group of the formula wherein Q is p,qC 2 -C 12 alkylene that is unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by C 1 -C 12 alkoxy, C 1 -C 12 alkylthio or by C 2 -C 24 dialkylamino, p and q being different position numbers, X is a hetero atom selected from the group consisting of N, O and S, m being the number 0 when X is O or S and m being the number 1 when X is N, and L 1 and L 2 are each independently of the other (p,qC 2 -C 12 alkylene)-Z n C 1 -C 12 alkyl or C 1 -C 12 alkyl that is unsubstituted or mono- or poly-substituted by C 1 -C 12 alkoxy, C 1 -C 12 alkylthio, C 2 -C 24 dialkylamino, C 6 -C 12 aryloxy, C 6 -C 12 arylthio, C 7 -C 24 arylalkylamino or by C 12 -C 24 diarylamino, wherein n is a number from 1 to 1000, p and q are different position numbers, each Z independently of any other(s) is a hetero atom O, S or C 1 -C 12 alkyl-substituted N, and C 2 -C 12 alkylene in the repeating units C 2 -C 12 alkylene-Z may be identical or different, and L 1 and L 2 may be saturated or one- to ten-fold unsaturated, uninterrupted or interrupted at any desired points by from 1 to 10 groups selected from the group consisting of (CO) and CH 4 , and may carry no substituents or may carry from 1 to 10 further substituents selected from the group consisting of halogen, cyano and nitro, with the proviso that when Q is (CH 2 ) r , wherein r is a number from 2 to 12, and X is S, L 2 may not be unsubstituted, saturated and uninterrupted C 1 -C 4 alkyl.

The compounds of formula I can be prepared analogously to methods known per se, as described, for example, in EP 648 770 and EP 648 817, for example by reacting a compound of the formula A(H) x , wherein A and x are as defined above, in the desired molar ratio with a dicarbonate of the formula in an aprotic organic solvent in the presence of a base as catalyst, advantageously at temperatures of from 0 to 120 C., preferably from 10 to 100 C., for from 2 to 80 hours. The molar ratio in each particular case is governed by x, that is to say the number of radicals B to be introduced. The dicarbonate is advantageously used in slight excess. Suitable aprotic organic solvents are, for example, ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, or glycol ethers, such as ethylene glycol methyl ether, ethylene glycol ethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether or diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, and also dipolar aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile, benzonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethyl-acetamide, nitrobenzene, N-methylpyrrolidone, halogenated aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, such as trichloroethane, benzene, or benzene substituted by alkyl, alkoxy or by halogen, such as toluene, xylene, anisole or chlorobenzene, or aromatic N-heterocycles, such as pyridine, picoline or quinoline. Preferred solvents are, for example, tetrahydrofuran, N,N-dimethylformamide and N-methylpyrrolidone. The mentioned solvents can also be used in the form of mixtures. It is advantageous to use from 5 to 20 parts by weight of solvent to 1 part by weight of reactant. Bases suitable as catalyst are, for example, the alkali metals themselves, such as lithium, sodium or potassium and the hydroxides and carbonates thereof, or alkali metal amides, such as lithium, sodium or potassium amide, or alkali metal hydrides, such as lithium, sodium or potassium hydride, or alkaline earth or alkali metal alcoholates that are derived especially from primary, secondary or tertiary aliphatic alcohols having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, such as, for example, lithium, sodium or potassium methanolate, ethanolate, n-propanolate, isopropanolate, n-butanolate, sec-butanolate, tert-butanolate, 2-methyl-2-butanolate, 2-methyl-2-pentanolate, 3-methyl-3-pentanolate, 3-ethyl-3-pentanolate, and also organic aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic N-bases including, for example, diazabicyclooctene, diazabicycloundecene and 4-dimethylaminopyridine, and trialkylamines, for example trimethylamine or triethylamine. It is also possible, however, to use a mixture of the mentioned bases. Preference is given to the organic N-bases, such as, for example, diazabicyclooctane, diazabicycloundecene and especially 4-dimethylaminopyridine. The reaction is carried out especially at temperatures of from 18 to 40 C., that is to say preferably at room temperature, and under atmospheric pressure. The dicarbonates of the formula suitable for the preparation of the compounds of formula I according to the invention can be prepared analogously to generally known methods. Most of the chemicals required for that purpose are known. Many of them are commercially available and all of them can be prepared in accordance with methods known per se. The compounds of formula I according to the invention are excellently suitable as fluorescent dyes for the mass-colouring of high-molecular-weight organic material. Examples of suitable high-molecular-weight organic materials that can be coloured using the compounds of formula I according to the invention are vinyl polymers, e.g. polystyrene, poly--methylstyrene, poly-p-methylstyrene, poly-p-hydroxystyrene, poly-p-hydroxyphenylstyrene, poly(methylacrylate) and poly(acrylamide) and also the corresponding methacrylic compounds, poly(methyl maleate), poly(acrylonitrile), poly(methacrylonitrile), poly(vinyl chloride), poly(vinyl fluoride), poly(vinylidene chloride), poly(vinylidene fluoride), poly(vinyl acetate), poly(methylvinyl ether) and poly(butylvinyl ether); novolaks derived from C 1 -C 6 -aldehydes, e.g. formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, and a dinuclear, preferably mononuclear, phenol that is unsubstituted or substituted by one or two C 1 -C 9 alkyl groups, by one or two halogen atoms or by a phenyl ring, such as, for example, o-, m- or p-cresol, xylene, p-tert-butylphenol, o-, m- or p-nonylphenol, p-chlorophenol or p-phenylphenol, or a compound having more than one phenolic group, e.g. resorcinol, bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane or 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane; polymers derived from maleimide and/or maleic anhydride, e.g. copolymers of maleic anhydride and styrene; poly(vinylpyrrolidone), biopolymers and derivatives thereof, e.g. cellulose, starch, chitin, chitosan, gelatin, zein, ethylcellulose, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate and cellulose butyrate; natural resins and synthetic resins, e.g. rubber, casein, silicone and silicone resins, ABS, urea- and melamine-formaldehyde resins, alkyd resins, phenol resins, polyamides, polyimides, polyamide/imides, polysulfones, polyether sulfones, polyphenylene oxides, polyurethanes, polyureas, polycarbonates, polyarylenes, polyarylene sulfides, polyepoxides, polyolefins and polyalkadienes. Preferred high-molecular-weight organic materials are, for example, cellulose ethers and esters, such as ethylcellulose, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate or cellulose butyrate, natural resins or synthetic resins, such as polymerisation or condensation resins, such as aminoplasts, especially urea- and melamine-formaldehyde resins, alkyd resins, phenoplasts, polycarbonates, polyolefins, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyamides, polyurethanes, polyesters, ABS, polyphenylene oxides, rubber, casein, silicone and silicone resins, individually or in admixture. The mentioned high-molecular-weight organic compounds may be present individually or in mixtures in the form of plastics, melts or in the form of spinning solutions, paints, coating compositions or printing inks. According to the intended use it has proved advantageous to use the compounds of formula I according to the invention as toners or in the form of a preparation. The compounds of formula I according to the invention are especially suitable for the mass-colouring of polyvinyl chloride and especially polyolefins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as of paints and also of powder coating compositions, printing inks and coating compositions. The compounds of formula I according to the invention can be used in an amount of from 0.01 to 30% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 10% by weight, based on the high-molecular-weight organic material to be coloured. The colouring of high-molecular-weight organic substances with the compounds of formula I according to the invention is carried out, for example, by mixing the compound of formula I, optionally in the form of a master batch, into those substrates using roll mills or mixing or grinding apparatus. The coloured material is then brought into the desired final form according to procedures known per se, such as calendering, compression moulding, extrusion moulding, coating, casting or injection-moulding. It is often desirable for the purpose of producing non-rigid mouldings or reducing the brittleness thereof to incorporate so-called plasticisers into the high-molecular-weight compounds before shaping. There may be used as plasticisers, for example, esters of phosphoric acid, phthalic acid or sebacic acid. The plasticisers can be incorporated into the polymers before or after the incorporation of the compounds of formula I according to the invention. In order to obtain different colour shades it is also possible to add to the high-molecular-weight organic substances, in addition to the compound according to the invention, any desired amounts of fillers or other colour-imparting constituents, such as white, coloured or black pigments. For the colouring of paints, coating compositions and printing inks, the high-molecular-weight organic materials and the compounds of formula I according to the invention, optionally together with additives, such as fillers, pigments, siccatives or plasticisers, are finely dispersed or dissolved in a common organic solvent or solvent mixture. It is also possible for the individual components to be dispersed or dissolved separately, or for several components to be dispersed or dissolved together, and only then for all the components to be combined. In colourings, for example of polyvinyl chloride or polyolefins or in printing inks, the compounds of formula I according to the invention are distinguished by good general properties, such as good migration-stability and light- and weather-fastness, but especially by their unexpectedly high fluorescence. Very great importance is attached, however, to the conversion of the soluble chromophores according to the invention that have been incorporated into a substrate into the corresponding pigments of the formula A(H) x . This can be achieved most simply by thermal treatment (heating to temperatures of from 50 to 250 C., preferably from 100 to 200 C., according to the pigment) of the solids, solutions or dispersions comprising the soluble compounds according to the invention in organic or aqueous media, polymer solutions or melts. This allows the colouring of paints, printing inks, plastics, especially also in fibre form, heat-sensitive registration systems, inks for ink-jet printing, colour tapes for thermal transfer printing onto smooth or woven receiver substrates, and very specifically also in light-sensitive compositions, for example negative or positive resist formulations, giving an overall improvement in properties, such as purity, colour strength, brilliance and transparency, and also allows interesting applications in analysis. The invention therefore relates also to high-molecular-weight organic material comprising in its mass a pigment of the formula A(H) x produced in situ by thermal degradation of a soluble compound of formula I, to a thermo-, photo- or chemo-sensitive recording material, and to an ink for ink-jet printing, a colour tape for thermal transfer printing or a light-sensitive negative or positive resist composition, each comprising a soluble compound of formula I. Inks for ink-jet printing, colour tapes for thermal transfer printing, thermo-, photo- and chemo-sensitive recording materials and also light-sensitive negative or positive resist compositions are well known to the person skilled in the art. It has also been found that in the case of certain compounds of formula I the thermal treatment comprising heating to temperatures of from 100 to 200 C., preferably from 105 to 120 C., may result in crystal modification conversions of the corresponding chromophores of the formula A(H) x . If different compounds of formula I are used, it is also possible to prepare mixed crystals. The invention therefore relates also to a process for the preparation of mixed crystals or for the crystal modification conversion of chromophores of formula A(H) x by conversion into compounds of formula I, for example in accordance with the above-mentioned process, and thermal treatment of the resulting compounds of formula I at temperatures of from 100 to 200 C. A very special, surprising advantage of the compounds according to the invention is their extraordinarily high solubility. As a result it is possible to incorporate relatively high concentrations into a substrate, so that a higher colour intensity can be achieved. A further surprising advantage is that the conversion into the pigment is more complete than in the case of known soluble pigments, thereby improving the migration tendency after conversion into the pigment. Another surprising advantage is that soluble chromophores can be prepared from pigments that could not be reacted, or could be reacted only unsatisfactorily, with the solubilising groups known hitherto. As a result of those improved properties, the soluble chromophores of formula I according to the invention can be used especially advantageously in compositions that are used in the preparation of structured colour formers or colour filters. The use of soluble pigment precursors in the preparation of structured colour formers or colour filters is known from EP 654 711. Those compositions comprise, for example, a soluble chromophore of formula I and a positive or negative resist resin. In particular, it is possible for resist formulations comprising soluble pigment precursors to be irradiated and developed in the desired pattern, it being possible for the soluble pigment precursor to be converted into the insoluble pigment during irradiation or development or alternatively only subsequently. The soluble pigment precursor can also be applied in the desired pattern directly to a receiving layer suitable for the purpose by means of ink-jet printing or by thermally induced diffusion. The methods disclosed in EP 654 711 are very suitable for the production of colour filters.

SPECIFICATION 1. Technical Field The present invention relates to a process for preparing halogenated -lactam compounds containing a halogenated penam derivative or halogenated cephem derivative, which are synthetic intermediates for medicine. As an example of halogenated -lactam compounds obtained by the invention, there is 6,6-dibromopenicillanic acid which is an intermediate for Sulbactam which is a kind of antibacterial agents (JP-A-72115/1980). 2. Background Art A conventional process for preparing halogenated -lactam derivatives of the formula (4) by using -lactam amino compounds of the formula (1), as a starting material, is disclosed in, for example, Volkmann J. Org. Chem. 47, 3344 (1982). A process for preparing halogenated -lactam compounds without employing organic solvent is disclosed in Clayton J. Chem. Soc. C 2123 (1969). In the former process, it is however essential to use a halogenated organic solvent such as methylene chloride or carbon tetrachloride. A large scale use of such a halogenated organic solvent is severely limited in view of safety and environmental pollution problems. The drawbacks of using carbon tetrachloride are its cost and its difficult handling properties. Therefore, a process for preparing halogenated -lactam compounds in the system using no organic solvent, is highly desired. The latter process employing organic solvent is however impractical because of its remarkably low yield, namely, 34%. An object of the present invention is to provide a process with which halogenated -lactam compounds are prepared at high yield and efficiency, in an industrially useful, inexpensive and safe manner, by using water as a reaction solvent, not employing any organic solvent causing many problems in view of safety and environmental pollution. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a process for preparing halogenated -lactam compounds, characterized in that a lactam amino compound of the formula (1) is reacted with nitrous acid or nitrite in a slurry dispersion state in water, under acid condition in the presence of halogen molecules, thereby obtaining a halogenated -lactam compound of the formula (4) wherein n is an integer of 0 to 2; A is the formula (2) or (3); R 1 and R 2 are the same or different and are hydrogen atom, halogen atom, C 1 -C 3 alkyl group, C 2 -C 4 alkenyl group, C 2 -C 4 alkynyl group, nucleophilic group, or CH 2 R 3 ; and R 3 is halogen atom or nucleophilic group wherein A is as defined above; X 1 is hydrogen atom or halogen atom; and X 2 is halogen atom. The present invention was accomplished when it was discovered that halogenated -lactam compounds of the formula (4) could be prepared efficiently on a large scale, by reacting -lactam amino compounds of the formula (1) in a slurry dispersion state in water, after various reaction conditions were considered in order to avoid the use of organic solvents causing many problems in view of safety and environmental pollution, and establish a simple and inexpensive process by using water as a main solvent. Halogen atoms present in substituent R 1 , R 2 or R 3 in the invention are chlorine, bromine and iodine. Examples of C 1 -C 3 alkyl group are methyl, ethyl and propyl. Examples of C 2 -C 4 alkenyl group are vinyl, propenyl, allyl and butenyl. Examples of C 2 C 4 alkynyl group are ethynyl, propargyl and butynyl. As nucleophilic groups represented by substituent R 1 , R 2 or R 3 in the invention, there are, for example, aliphatic acyloxy groups having 2 to 4 carbon atoms, such as acetyloxy group, propionyloxy group, 3-oxobutyryloxy group, 3-carboxypropionyloxy group and 4-carboxybutyryloxy group; aromatic acyloxy groups such as mandelyloxy group and 2-carboxybenzoyloxy group; carbamoyloxy group; hydroxy group; and mercapto group. Alternatively, these nucleophilic groups may be substituted with an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or aliphatic acyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms. Suitable number of substituents is usually 1 or 2. Further to the above examples of nucleophilic groups represented by substituent R 1 , R 2 or R 3 in the invention, there is a heterocycle bonded through S, that is, heterocyclic thio group. Herein, the heterocycle is a five- or six-member ring containing 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from O, S or N. Examples of these heterocycles are pyridyl group, pyridazinyl group, pyrazolyl group, thiazolyl group, thiadiazolyl group, triazolyl group and tetrazolyl group. These heterocycles may have a substituent, such as a lower alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms. Halogen atoms represented by X 1 and X 2 of halogenated -lactam compounds of the formula (4) in the invention are chlorine, bromine and iodine. In the present invention, acid condition is obtained by adding acid. Examples of acid used are sulfuric acid, hydrohalogenic acid and nitric acid. The amount of acid used to the compounds of the formula (1) is usually 1 to 20 equivalents, preferably 1.5 to 6 equivalents. Examples of halogen molecules used in the invention are bromine, iodine and chlorine. The amount of halogen molecules used to the compounds of the formula (1) is usually 1 to 16 equivalents, preferably 2 to 6 equivalents. Suitable nitrites are sodium nitrite and potassium nitrite. The amount of nitrous acid or nitrite used to the compounds of the formula (1) is usually 1 to 12 equivalents, preferably 2 to 6 equivalents. The reaction of the invention is usually conducted at atmospheric pressure, but it may be conducted under increased pressure, if required. The reaction temperature is preferably about 10 to 15 C., most preferably 5 to 6 C. In the present invention, a slurry formed by a compound of the formula (1) and water, or powder of a compound of the formula (1), is preferably added in portions over an adequate time. The reaction time depends on the reaction temperature, substrate concentration and reagent equivalent number, but suitable reaction time is usually about 6 to 36 hours, most desirably 12 to 24 hours. In the present invention, desired high purity -lactam compounds can be obtained efficiently by conducting the reaction within a sealed- or unsealed-type container, and filtering a deposited crystal after the reaction is completed. The crystal can also be purified by a usual purification method, such as recrystallization. BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The present invention will be described in further detail by giving examples, however, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the following examples.

No. 08/951,700 filed on Oct. 16, 1997, which is now U.S. Pat. No. 5,883,254. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a new process for the preparation of pyrimidine derivatives. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The subject process for manufacturing a compound of the formula: R 1 , R 2 , R 3 each independently is hydrogen, C 1-7 -alkyl, or C 1-7 -alkoxy, and A is CN, which comprises reacting a compound of the formula: wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are as above and X is chlorine, with an alkali cyanide in the presence of 1-azabicyclo2,2,2octane or 1,4-diazabicyclo2,2,2octane. Of particular concern is a process for manufacturing 2-cyanopyrimidine, which comprises reacting 2-chloropyrimidine with an alkali cyanide in the presence of 1-azabicyclo-2,2,2octane or 1,4-diazabicyclo2,2,2octane. Another particularly useful process is for manufacturing 4-tertbutyl-N-6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(pyrimidin-2-yl)-pyrimidin-4-yl-benzenesulphonamide, This process comprises manufacturing 2-cyanopyrimidine by reacting 2-chloropyrimidine with an alkali cyanide in the presence of 1-azabicyclo2,2,2octane or 1,4-diazabicyclo2,2,2octane. The 2-cyano pyrimidine is then converted by means of NH 3 /NH 4 Cl in a sodium methanolate/methanol solution into pyrimidin-2-carboxamidine hydrochloride. The pyrimidine-2-caroboxamidine hydrochloride is then converted in the presence of sodium methanolate with diethyl (o-methoxy-phenoxy-malonate) into rac-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-pyrimidin-2-yl-tetrahydro-pyrimidin-4,6-dione. This product is then reacted with N,N-diisopropyl-N-ethylamine and phosphorus pentachloride to give 4,6-dichloro-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2-bipyrimidine. This in turn is reacted with p-tert.butylbenzenesulphonamide to give 4-tert.butyl-N-6-chloro-5-2-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(pyrimidin-2-yl)-pyrimidin-4-yl-benzenesulphonamide which is reacted with sodium ethylene glycolate to give 4-tert.butyl-N-6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(pyrimidin-2-yl)-pyrimidin-4-yl-benzenesulphonamide. Intermediates in the above process include a compound of the formula: wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 each independently is hydrogen, C 1-7 -alkyl, or C 1-7 -alkoxy, and salts thereof; and a compound of the formula: wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 each independently is hydrogen, C 1-7 -alkyl, or C 1-7 -alkoxy, and salts thereof. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The subject invention will now be described in terms of its preferred embodiments. These embodiments are set forth to aid in understanding the invention, but are not to be construed as limiting. In detail, the subject invention relates to a novel process for the manufacture of pyrimidines of formula I: wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 each independently represent hydrogen, C 1-7 -alkyl, or C 1-7 -alkoxy, A signifies CN, a carbanionic R 4 -alkynyl residue, in which R 4 is hydrogen or C 1-7 -alkyl, or a carbanionic residue of the malonic acid derivative of formula III in which B and B independently represent CN, COOR 5 , or C(O)R 5 , wherein R 5 is alkyl or aryl. The process is useful for the preparation of pharmaceutical products, for example, those described in European Patent Application Publ. No. 726,708. A first aspect of the present invention relates to a process which comprises reacting a pyrimidine of the formula: wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 have the above significances and X is chlorine, with a compound yielding the residue A in the presence of 1-azabicyclo2,2,2octane (ABCO) or 1,4-diazabicyclo2,2,2octane (DABCO). A second aspect of this invention relates to intermediates of formulas IV and V or salts thereof: wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 each independently represent hydrogen, C 1-7 -alkyl, or C 1-7 -alkoxy. In more detail, the present invention refers to a process for the manufacture of pyrimidines of the formula I: wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 each independently represent hydrogen, C 1-7 -alkyl, or C 1-7 -alkoxy, A signifies CN, a carbanionic R 4 -alkynyl residue, in which R 4 is hydrogen or C 1-7 -alkyl, or a carbanionic residue of the malonic acid derivative of formula III: in which B and B independently represent CN, COOR 5 , or C(O)R 5 , wherein R 5 is alkyl or aryl. which process comprises reacting a pyrimidine of the formula: wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 have the above significances and X is chlorine, with a compound yielding the residue A in the presence of 1-azabicyclo2,2,2octane or 1,4-diazabicyclo2,2,2octane. The starting compounds, pyrimidine derivatives of formula II, can be prepared from the corresponding 2-pyrimidone (2-hydroxypyrimidine) derivatives (The chemistry of heterocyclic compounds, Ed. E. C. Taylor, Vol. 52, The Pyrimidines, John Wiley Sons, N.Y., 1994). For example, the corresponding 2-pyrimidone (2-hydroxypyrimidine) can be reacted with PCl 5 , POCl 3 or a combination of PCl 5 and POCl 3 . The resulting 2-chloropyrimidine derivative can be used for the process of the present invention. In the present invention the term alkyl signifies a straight-chain or branched alkyl group containing 1 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 3 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, tertbutyl, n-pentyl, iso-pentyl, neopentyl, n-hexyl, isohexyl and isohexyl. The term alkoxy means the group OR wherein R is alkyl as defined above. The term aryl means a monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic ring, preferably phenyl or naphthyl, and most preferably phenyl , which optionally can be substituted in the ortho-, meta- and/or para-position. Substituents which come into consideration are alkyl, alkoxy, hydroxy, nitro, trifluoromethyl as well as halo such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine or also trialkylsilyl. Preferred aryl residues are phenyl, p-tolyl, m-tolyl, m,m-dialkylphenyl, p-chlorophenyl and p-methoxyphenyl. The term carbanionic residue refers to residues resulting from base treatment of alkynyls or malonic acid derivatives, for example, carbanionic R 4 -alkynyl residues wherein R 4 is alkyl or hydrogen. Examples of R 4 -alkynyl residues are acetylene, propyne and 1-butyne, which can be converted by alcoholates and other bases into the carbanionic residue. Further examples of carbanionic residues are carbanionic residues of malonic acid derivatives of formula III in which B and B independently represent CN, COOR 5 , or C(O)R 5 , wherein R 5 is alkyl or aryl. Examples for these carbanionic residues are acetoacetic ester and its higher homologues, which have been converted by for example by a metal hydride into the reactive carbanionic component A. One preferred process includes pyrimidines of general formula II in which R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are each independently hydrogen, C 1-3 -alkyl, or C 1-3 -alkoxy as starting material. In the most preferred embodiment R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are all hydrogen (2-chloropyrimidine). Another preferred category refers to the compounds yielding the residue A. In a preferred embodiment the above pyrimidine compounds of formula II are reacted with a compound yielding the residue A wherein A signifies CN or a carbanionic residue of a malonic acid derivative of formula III in which B and B independently represent CN, COOR 5 , or C(O)R 5 , wherein R 5 is alkyl or aryl. In a more preferred embodiment R 5 is alkyl. In general, the carbanionic residues of formula III can be prepared e.g. from malonic acid esters and malonic acid derivatives using a metal hydride such as sodium hydride, lithium aluminium hydride and the like. In the most preferred embodiment the above pyrimidines of general formula II are reacted with a compound yielding the residue A wherein A is CN. The reagents yielding this cyano group can be, for example, alkali cyanides such as sodium cyanide. As solvents there can be used organic aprotic, non-polar or polar solvents from the group of halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride or chloroform, DMF, DMSO, N-methylpyrrolidine, acetonitrile, sulpholane, esters from the group of methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and propyl acetate or ethers such as tetrahydrofuran either alone in admixture with one another or with water. DMF, DMSO, N-methylpyrrolidine, acetonitrile, sulpholane, methylene chloride, chloroform as well as trifluoromethylbenzene are preferred. Preferably, an alkali cyanide, especially sodium cyanide, is reacted with compounds of formula II, preferably 2-chloropyrimidine. When an alkali cyanide, especially sodium cyanide, is used, the compound of formula II is preferably reacted in an equivalent ratio of 0.1 to 1.4. The aforementioned 1-azabicyclo2,2,2octane or 1,4-diazabicyclo2,2,2octane can be used as catalysts. These compounds are commercially available (Fluka, etc.). 1,4-Diazabicyclo2,2,2octane (DABCO) is especially preferred. The catalyst is used in the process in accordance with the invention in amounts of 0.001 to 1.5, preferably 0.05 to 0.8, mol equivalents based on the compound of formula II. When 1,4-diazabicyclo2,2,2octane is used, the most preferred amount of catalyst is 0.05 to 0.2 molar equivalents based on compound II. The course of the reaction is conveniently monitored by an in-process control in which the ratio of educt (for example chloropyrimidine) to product (for example cyanopyrimidine) is the determining criterion for stopping the reaction. The reaction is stopped when the critical limit has been reached. The working up of the reaction product can be effected using means which are known per se, for example, extraction with solvents. For example, the reaction mixture can be firstly diluted with water and thereupon subsequently extracted several times with TBME and n-hexane. The reaction temperature conveniently amounts to about 20 to 60 C. Using calorimetric investigations it has been established that higher yields can be achieved at temperatures below 40 C. than at higher reaction temperatures. The reaction temperature is therefore preferably 15-35 C. The most preferred process refers to the preparation of 2-cyano-pyrimidine which process comprises reacting 2-chloropyrimidine with an alkali cyanide in the presence of 1-azabicyclo2,2,2octane or 1,4-diazabicyclo2,2,2octane, preferably diazabicyclo2,2,2octane. The process of the present invention is useful for the preparation of valuable intermediates for the synthesis of pyrimidine derivatives. Compounds of formula I in which A is CN can be converted into pharmaceutically active substances useful as inhibitors of endothelin receptors. They can be used for the treatment of disorders which are associated with endothelin activities, especially circulatory disorders such as hypertension, ischaemia, and angina pectoris. Compounds of formula I in which A is CN may be converted in the corresponding carboxamidine, e.g. by NH 3 /NH 4 Cl. This derivative may then be used in the manner described in European Patent Application Publ. No. 726,708 to produce inhibitors of endothelin receptors. For the preparation of the inhibitors according to EP 726,708, a compound of formula I in which A is CN is converted for example by means of NH 3 /NH 4 Cl into the corresponding carboxamidine. This substance may then be converted with a phenoxy-malonate into a pyrimidinyl-tetrahydro-pyrimidine-dione, which is then reacted with phosphorus pentachloride followed by a reaction with a benzenesulphonamide to give the corresponding benzenesulphonamide derivative which may then be converted into a pharmaceutically active substance by reaction with a for example an alkali glycolate corresponding to the desired end product. The process of the present invention is especially useful for the preparation of 4-tert.butyl-N-6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(pyrimidine-2-yl)-pyrimidine-4-yl-benzenesulphonamide (bosentan). For the preparation of this compound 2-cyanopyrimidine is prepared as described above and converted into pyrimidin-2-carboxamidine hydrochloride by means of NH 3 /NH 4 Cl in a sodium methanolate/methanol solution. This compound is converted in the presence of sodium methanolate with diethyl (o-methoxy-phenoxy-malonate) into rac-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-pyrimidin-2-yl-tetrahydro-pyrimidin-4,6-dione. The obtained product is reacted with N,N-diisopropyl-N-ethylamine and phosphorus pentachloride to give 4,6-dichloro-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2,2-bipyrimidine. This substance is then reacted with p-tert.butylbenzenesulphonamide to give 4-tert.butyl-N-6-chloro-5-2-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(pyrimidin-2-yl)-pyrimidin-4-yl-benzenesulphonamide and further reacted with sodium ethylene glycolate to give 4-tert.butyl-N-6-(2-hydroxy-ethoxy)-5-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)-2-(pyrimidin-2-yl)-pyrimidin-4-yl-benzenesulphonamide (bosentan). The present invention accordingly includes the use of the process in accordance with the invention for the production of bosentan. It has been found that in the reaction in accordance with the invention the intermediate compounds of the formulas IV and V or salts thereof, preferably chlorides: wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 each independently represent hydrogen, C 1-7 -alkyl, or C 1-7 -alkoxy are obtained by reaction of the catalysts with compounds of formula II. Especially preferred compounds are those wherein R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are each independently hydrogen, C 1-3 -alkyl, or C 1-3 -alkoxy. The most preferred compounds are 1-pyrimidin-2-yl-4-aza-1-azonium-bicyclo2,2,2octane chloride and 1-pyrimidin-2-yl-1-azonium-bicyclo2,2,2octane chloride. These compounds are also an object of the present invention and can be obtained in isolated form conveniently by reacting a compound of formula II with ABCO or DABCO in toluene at room temperature. The following Examples illustrate the invention. In these Examples the abbreviations used have the following significance: RT Room temperature GC Gas chromatography ABCO 1-Azabicyclo2,2,2-octane DABCO 1,4-Diazabicyclo2,2,2-octane DMF Dimethylformamide DMSO Dimethyl sulphoxide TBME tert-Butyl methyl ether EXAMPLE 1 26.25 g (1.05 equivalents) of sodium cyanide, 5.63 g (0.1 equivalent) of DABCO and a solvent mixture of DMSO and water were placed in a sulphonation flask at a temperature of 20 to 25 C. A solvent mixture of 150 ml of DMSO and 57.55 g of 2-chloropyrimidine was added to the pre-prepared solution using a dropping funnel at a temperature of 20 to 30 C. over a period of 15 minutes. The mixture was held at 20-22 C. for a further 2 hours while stirring. During the reaction a weak stream of nitrogen was conducted through the reactor and subsequently through a 2N NaOH solution in order to trap excess hydrogen cyanide which results. After less than 3% of the educt used in the reaction mixture was present the reaction was interrupted and the reaction mixture was worked up. The working up of the reaction mixture was effected by extraction with TBME and n-hexane. Yield of 2-cyanopyrimidine 96.5%.

Preferred solvents for this reaction are, for example, alcohols, water or acetic acid either alone or in combination. Particularly preferred is the mixture of methanol and water. The resulting compound can then be transformed by reaction with di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate, preferably in the presence of a base such as triethylamine. A preferred solvent for this reaction is, for example, methanol. The resulting compound can then be used in the preparation of renin inhibitors as is disclosed in WO 97/09311. In general, the above-resulting compounds may be used in the preparation of renin inhibitors as follows. The selective functionalization of the phenolic function can be performed with alkylation reactions using aliphatic or benzylic chlorides, bromides, iodides, tosylates or mesylates in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate in solvents such as an ether like tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, acetone, methyl-ethyl-ketone, or pyridine at temperatures between 0 C. and 140 C. The alkylating agents used can either contain the whole chain desired to be included or optionally can be suitably protected by functional groups which allow further structural modifications at a later stage of the synthesis. Functionalization at the secondary hydroxy function of the piperidine ring can then be performed in solvents as ethers like tetrahydrofuran or 1,2-dimethoxyethane, or in dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide in the presence of a base like sodium hydride or potassium tert-butoxide and a suitable alkylating agent, preferentially an aryl methyl chloride, bromide, mesylate or tosylate at temperatures between 0 C. and 40 C. Again, the alkylating agents used can either contain the whole substituent desired or optionally can be suitably protected by functional groups which allow further structural modifications at a later stage of the synthesis. Further structural variations can comprise removal of protective functions followed by functionalization of the liberated functional groups, e.g. etherification of a phenolic moiety. Reduction may also be used, such as of a quinoline unit to a tetrahydroquinoline unit by, for example, sodium borohydride or nickel chloride in solvents such as methanol or ethanol. Final removal of the Boc-protective group can be performed in the presence of acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, trifluoroacetic acid in a variety of solvents such as alcohols and alcohol/water mixtures, ethers and chlorinated hydrocarbons. The Boc-protective group can also be removed with anhydrous zinc bromide in inert solvents such as dichloromethane. Compounds of formula 2 can be prepared as follows: Compound 5 is reacted with an acid, e.g. oxalic acid in an inert solvent to form a compound of formula 2. Compound 5 is formed by reacting a compound of the formula 7 in an inert solvent with butyllithium or a Grignard reagent to form an organometallic intermediate which is reacted with a compound of the formula 8. Compound 7 can be obtained by reacting a compound of formula 6 with a compound of the formula R 6 -Hal in the presence of a base and preferably a catalyst such as NaI in an inert solvent. R 6 is alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, aralkoxyalkyl, alkylsulfonyl or arylsulfonyl. Compound 8 can be obtained by the reaction of R 1 -NH 2 with 1-ethyl-1-methyl-4-oxo-piperidinium iodide in the present of a base. 1-Ethyl-1-methyl-4-oxo-piperidinium iodide can be obtained by the reaction of 1-ethyl-4-piperidone with methyl iodide in an inert solvent. Alternatively, as was discussed earlier, a compound of formula 2 can be obtained by the reaction of an ammonium salt having the formula R 1 NH 3 X with formaldehyde and a compound of formula 3. Compounds of formula 3 can be obtained, for example, by a Wittig reaction of the appropriate phosphorane with a compound of formula 9 in the presence of an inert solvent. Alternatively, compounds of formula 2 can be prepared by the reaction of an ammonium salt of the formula R 1 NH 3 X with formaldehyde and with a compound of the formula 4. Compounds of formula 4 can be prepared by the reaction of an organometallic compound containing a methyl group attached to the metal as in methylmagnesium bromide or methyllithium, with compound 9. Compounds of formula 4 wherein R 2 is chlorine, bromine or iodine can be prepared via oxidation of a halocumene (for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,954,876 or DE 2302751). Alternatively, compounds of formula 2 can be prepared by reacting a salt of the formula R 1 NH 3 X with formaldehyde and a compound of formula 4. Preferably, R 1 NH 3 X is generated in the reaction mixture from a compound R 1 NH 2 using the appropriate amount of a suitable acid HX. Furthermore, a compound of formula 4 can be obtained by the reaction of a compound of formula 11 with an appropriate organometallic compound. Compound 11 can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula 10 with R 6 -X in the presence of a base in an inert solvent. R 6 has the meaning given as above.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to optically active binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivatives, optically active binaphthol monophosphate derivatives and their use. The optically active binaphthol monophosphate acid derivatives of the present invention are important as in intermediates for synthesis of various catalysts for asymmetric synthesis, and the binaphthol monophosphate derivatives derived therefrom have high reactivity in various asymmetric synthetic reactions and provide reaction products having a high optical purity. Pyran compounds obtained by the method of the present invention are useful compounds as intermediates for synthesis of pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals. 2. Discussion of Background The binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivatives of the present invention and the binaphthol monophosphate derivatives derived therefrom, have not been conventionally known, and they are novel compounds. As one example of reactions to which the catalyst for asymmetric synthesis of the present invention is applicable, Diels-Alder cyclization reaction will be explained below. As the Diels-Alder cyclization reaction, many reactions of a diene with an olefin in the presence or absence of a Lewis acid catalyst such as aluminum chloride, have been known for a long time. As an asymmetric Diels-Alder cyclization reaction, e.g. a reaction of acryl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one with cyclopentadiene has been known (Shu Kobayashi et al, J. Org. Chem., 1994, 59, 3758). As an asymmetric hetero Diels-Alder cyclization reaction, e.g. a reaction of a benzaldehyde with a diene has been known (Hisashi Yamamoto et al, J. Am. Chem. 1988, 110, 310). However, with respect to the conventional asymmetric Diels-Alder cyclization reactions and asymmetric hetero Diels-Alder cyclization reactions, the reaction temperature is as low as at most 20 C. in all known reactions, whereby these reactions are not satisfactory as an industrial production method, although a reaction product having a high optical purity may be obtained in some of these reactions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been made to overcome the above object, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel binaphthol monophosphate derivative useful as a catalyst for asymmetric synthesis which can be used under more practical reaction conditions and which provides a high optical purity, and its intermediate binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative. The present inventors have conducted extensive studies to develop a catalyst for asymmetric synthesis which can be used under more practical reaction conditions and which provides a high optical purity, and as a result, they have found a binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative of the following formula (1) or (2): wherein each of R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 which are independent of one another, is hydrogen, a C 1-20 linear or branched alkyl group, a C 2-20 linear or branched alkenyl group, a C 2-20 linear or branched alkynyl group, a phenyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 1-10 linear or branched alkyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 2-10 linear or branched alkenyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 2-10 linear or branched alkynyl group, a naphthyl group or a C 3-8 cycloalkyl group, provided that R 1 to R 4 are not simultaneously hydrogen; and a novel binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative of the following formula (3) or (4) derived from a known compound: wherein each of R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 which are independent of one another, is hydrogen, a C 1-20 linear or branched alkyl group, a C 1-20 linear or branched alkenyl group, a C 2-20 linear or branched alkynyl group, a phenyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 1-10 linear or branched alkyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 2-10 linear or branched alkenyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 2-10 linear or branched alkynyl group, a naphthyl group or a C 3-8 cycloalkyl group. Further, they have found a binaphthol monophosphate derivative of the following formula (5), (6), (7) or (8): wherein each of R 1 , R 2 , R 3 and R 4 which are independent of one another, is hydrogen, a C 1-20 linear or branched alkyl group, a C 2-20 linear or branched alkenyl group, a C 2-20 linear or branched alkynyl group, a phenyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 1-10 linear or branched alkyl group, a a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to to 4-carbon atom by a C 2-10 linear or branched alkenyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 2-10 linear or branched alkynyl group, a naphthyl group or a C 3-8 cycloalkyl group, provided that R 1 to R 4 are not simultaneously hydrogen, and M is a metal element capable of forming a trivalent metal ion, wherein each of R 5 , R 6 , R 7 and R 8 which are independent of one another, is hydrogen, a C 1-20 linear or branched alkyl group, a C 2-20 linear or branched alkenyl group, a C 2-20 linear or branched alkynyl group, a phenyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 1-10 linear or branched alkyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 2-10 linear or branched alkenyl group, a phenyl group having its nucleus substituted at the 1- to 4-carbon atom by a C 2-10 linear or branched alkynyl group, a naphthyl group or a C 3-8 cycloalkyl group, and M is a metal element capable of forming a trivalent metal ion; which is useful as a catalyst for asymmetric synthesis, and which is derived from the compound of the above formula (1), (2), (3) or (4). They have found that when the binaphthol monophosphate derivative is applied to an asymmetric hetero Diels-Alder cyclization reaction, the reaction can be carried out at room temperature, and the desired compound having a high optical purity can be obtained. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of these discoveries. Namely, the present invention provides binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivatives of the above formulae (1) to (4), binaphthol monophosphate derivatives of the above formulae (5) to (8), and their use. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivatives of the above formulae (1) to (4) of the present invention, can be derived from optically active (R) or (S) binaphthol as the starting material, in several steps. For example, the binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative of the above formula (1) or (2) of the present invention may be obtained in accordance with e.g. methods as described in Reference Examples and Examples of the present invention, in such a manner that a commercially available optically active (R) or (S) 1,1-binaphthyl-2,2-diol is used as the starting material, the diol is protected, then, the starting material is converted to a halide at the 3,3-positions and/or a halide at the 6,6-positions, a substituent is introduced by e.g. a cross-coupling reaction, followed by a reaction with e.g. phosphorus oxychloride to obtain the binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative of the formula (1) or (2). Likewise, the binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative of the above formula (3) or (4) may be obtained by using, as the starting material, commercially available optically active (R) or (S) 1,1-binaphthyl-2,2-diol or binaphthol derivatives obtained as an intermediate for synthesis of the binaphthol monophosphoric acid of the above formula (1) or (2), carrying out partial hydrogenation reaction in accordance with a known method (D.

The catalyst of the present invention is a Lewis acid catalyst, and thus it can be applied to any conventional reaction using a Lewis acid, and it can induce asymmetry. Specific examples of such a reaction include asymmetric Diels-Alder cyclization reaction, asymmetric hetero Diels-Alder cyclization reaction, asymmetric reduction, asymmetric nitroaldol reaction, asymmetric protonation reaction, asymmetric Michael addition, asymmetric aldol condensation, asymmetric hydrophosphonyl reaction and asymmetric Michael-aldol reaction. However, the reaction is not particularly limited thereto. The optical absolute configuration developed by the reaction using the catalyst for asymmetric synthesis of the present invention, usually depends on the optical absolute configuration of the binaphthol constituting the catalyst for asymmetric synthesis. Namely, in the case where the optical absolute configuration of the asymmetric carbon of the product is (R) configuration when a (R)-binaphthol is used, for example, the optical absolute configuration of the asymmetric carbon of the product is (S) configuration when a (S)-binaphthol as the enantiomer is used. Further, with respect to the optical absolute configuration of the asymmetric carbon of the product, the product does not always have (R) configuration in the case of using a (R)-binaphthol, but the optical absolute configuration of the product may change depending upon the type of the substrate, the type of the binaphthol and the type of the phosphate-forming element. The catalyst of the present invention is prepared by converting the binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative of the present invention to an alkali metal salt of e.g. lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium or cesium, followed by reaction with a halide, sulfate, perchlorate, perbromate, tetrafluoroborate, trifluoromethanesulfonate or pentafluoroethanesulfonate of the salt-forming element. The molar ratio of the binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative to the salt-forming element is theoretically 1 to 3. However, for preparation, the binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative is used in an amount of from 1.01 to 1.2 equivalent amount based on the salt-forming element, the binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative is converted to its phosphate by an alkali metal hydroxide in an amount of from 0.9 to 1.05 times molar amount based on the binaphthol monophosphoric acid derivative, followed by reaction with the salt-forming element. When the catalyst of the present invention is used for a reaction, a ligand may be added to the reaction system as the case requires, and specific examples of the ligand include amines such as diethylamine, triethylamine, n-propylamine, di-n-propylamine, tri-n-propylamine, tert-butylamine, di-tert-butylamine, cyclohexylamine, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine, piperidine, 1-methylpiperidine, 2,6-dimethylpiperidine, 1,2,6-trimethylpiperidine, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinepyridine, piperazine, N,N-dimethylpiperazine, aniline, N,N-dimethylaniline, 2-picoline, 2-ethylpiridine, 2,4-lutidine, 2,6-lutidine, 3,5-lutidine, 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine, 2,6-bis(phenylethyl)pyridine, 2,4,6-collidine and chinaldine, phosphine oxides such as triphenylphosphine oxide, tri(2-methylphenyl)phosphine oxide, tri(3-methylphenyl)phosphine oxide, tri(4-methylphenyl)phosphine oxide, methyldiphenylphosphine oxide, methoxymethyl(diphenyl)phosphine oxide, tri-n-butylphosphine oxide, tri-n-octylphosphine oxide and tri(cyclohexyl)phosphine oxide, triamidephosphates such as hexamethyltriamidephosphate and tripiperidinophosphine oxide, and 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone and 2,6-lutidine-N-oxide. The ligand may be added in an amount of from 0 to 5 molar amount based on the salt-forming element, as the case requires. When the reaction is carried out by using the catalyst of the present invention, for removal of water in the system, a zeolite such as A type zeolite represented by molecular sieve 3A, 4A or 5A, molecular sieve 13X, Y type zeolite or L type zeolite may be used during the reaction as the case requires.

In the asymmetric hetero Diels-Alder cyclization reaction using the catalyst of the present invention, the catalyst may be used in any amount based on an aldehyde and a ketone or a diene to be subjected to the reaction. However, too excessive amount of its use is uneconomical, and if its amount is too small, the reaction may not proceed smoothly, or the catalyst may be deactivated due to a slight amount of impurities present in the system, whereby the reaction may not proceed at all in some cases. Accordingly, the amount of the catalyst is preferably within a range of from 0.01 mol % to 100 mol %, more preferably from 0.1 mol % to 50 mol %, based on the aldehyde and the ketone or the diene.
